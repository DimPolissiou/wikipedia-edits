{"title_page": "History of nursing in the United Kingdom", "text_new": "The '''history of nursing in the United Kingdom''' relates to the development of the profession since the 1850s. The [[history of nursing]] itself dates back to [[ancient history]], when the sick were cared for in [[temple]]s and [[place of worship|places of worship]]. In the [[History of Christianity in Britain|early Christian era]], [[nursing in the United Kingdom]] was undertaken by certain women in the [[Christian Church]], their services being extended to patients in their homes. These women had no real training by today's standards, but experience taught them valuable skills, especially in the use of [[herb]]s and folk drugs, and some gained fame as the [[physician]]s of their era.  Remnants of the religious nature of nurses remains in Britain today, especially with the retention of the [[job title]] \"[[Nursing sister|Sister]]\" for a senior female nurse.<ref>{{cite web|title=NMH-UK |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/~nmhuk/index.html |accessdate=24 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716142728/http://www.shef.ac.uk/~nmhuk/index.html |archivedate=16 July 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Nineteenth century==\nBefore the advent of training, nursing was often casual and low paid.  Pay in London [[voluntary hospital]]s was between 6 shillings and 9s 6d a week, with some board and lodging.  Outside London pay was much lower.  Few nurses were described as educated.  Facilities in hospitals were poor, though some began to provide meals for nurses.  Sisters were recruited separately from nurses and were more respectable, and matrons, whose work was largely administrative, even more so.\n\nNursing in the [[Workhouse infirmary|Poor Law infirmaries]], such as it was, was largely carried out by able-bodied paupers, who were not paid.  In 1866 there were a total of 53 nurses employed in the 11 metropolitan [[workhouse]]s, at an average salary of \u00a320 18s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=6}}</ref>\n\n==Florence Nightingale==\n\n{{Main|Florence Nightingale}}\n\n[[Image:Florence Nightingale.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Florence Nightingale]]\nFlorence Nightingale is regarded as the founder of modern nursing profession.<ref>Elizabeth Goodrick, and Trish Reay. \"Florence Nightingale endures: Legitimizing a new professional role identity.\" ''Journal of Management Studies'' (2010) 47#1 pp: 55-84.</ref>  There was no hospital training school for nurses until [[Deaconess's Institute of Kaiserswerth|one was established]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf-Kaiserswerth|Kaiserwerth]], Germany, in 1846. There, Nightingale received the training that enabled her in 1860 to establish, at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London, the [[Nightingale School of Nursing|first school]] designed primarily to train nurses rather than to provide nursing service for the hospital.\n\nIn the [[Crimean War]] against Russia, Nightingale was appointed by [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sir Sidney Herbert]] to oversee the introduction of female nurses into the military hospitals in Turkey. In November 1854, Nightingale arrived at the Barrack Hospital at Scutari, with a party of ten nurses and ten nuns. Initially the doctors did not want the nurses there and did not ask for their help, but within ten days fresh casualties arrived from the [[Battle of Inkermann]] and the nurses were fully stretched. Nightingale was horrified at what she found in the makeshift hospital: doctors reusing infected rags, the used rags just remaining in a pile, soldiers left unwashed and bleeding. She introduced sanitary protocols and reduced the casualty rate by fifty percent.\n\nWhen Nightingale returned from the Crimean War in August 1856, she hid herself away from the public's attention.  For her contribution to Army statistics and comparative hospital statistics in 1860, Nightingale became the first woman to be elected a fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society|Statistical Society]].\n\n==1858\u20131902==\n\n===Professionalisation===\nWhen state registration of the medical profession had begun in 1858, many observers pointed to the need for a similar system for nursing. That year, the ''Nursing Record'' (renamed the ''[[British Journal of Nursing]]'' in 1902), a nursing journal, called for \n''\"... the whole question of the Registration of trained nurses to be set forth in a succinct form before the profession and the public\".''  Support for the regulation of nursing began to become more widespread following the establishment of organised nurse training in 1860.\n\nBy the 1880s, the Hospitals Association (an early version of the [[NHS Confederation]]) was committed to the principle of registration for nurses. The Matrons' Committee, comprising the [[matron]]s of the leading hospitals, agreed with registration, but differed in their views of the required length of training, arguing for three years as opposed to the one supported by the Hospitals Association. In 1887, the Hospitals Association over-ruled the matrons and established a non-statutory voluntary register. At this the Matrons' Committee split between one group which supported the Hospitals Association and another faction, led by [[Ethel Gordon Fenwick]], which opposed the new register and sought to align themselves more closely with the medical profession. Florence Nightingale, incidentally, supported neither group and was opposed to any form of regulation for nursing, believing that the essential qualities of the nurse could neither be taught, examined nor regulated.\n\nIn 1887, the group of nurses associated with [[Ethel Gordon Fenwick]] formed the [[British Nurses' Association]], which sought ''\"... to unite all British nurses in membership of a recognised profession and to provide for their registration on terms, satisfactory to physicians and surgeons, as evidence of their having received systematic training\".''\n\nTherefore, two separate voluntary registers now existed. Whereas that maintained by the Hospitals Association was purely an administrative list, the register established by the BNA had a more explicit public protection remit.\n\nBy 1892 it was accepted in the [[voluntary hospital]]s that the matron was the head of an independent operation, controlling her own staff and reporting directly to the hospital committee.\n\nIn 1901 there were 3,170 paid nurses employed in workhouses, with about 2,000 probationers - about one nurse for 20 patients.  In total there were about 63,500 female nurses and 5,700 male nurses in England and Wales, working both in institutions and, the majority, in patients homes.  The men were almost entirely mental nurses and were not admitted to nurse training schools.  Nurses in workhouses were paid about \u00a317 a year.  Hospital nurses in 1902 were paid around \u00a319 a year, but the cost of maintenance, laundry, uniforms and accommodation which were provided was around \u00a330 a year.  In domiciliary work two guineas a week with meals provided was normal pay, and the work was easier.  In hospitals 12 hour days were normal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=55}}</ref>\n\n===Princess Helena and The Royal British Nurses' Association===\n\n[[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Princess Helena]], the daughter of Queen Victoria, played a central role in sponsoring and legitimizing the profession. Helena had a firm interest in nursing, and became President of the [[Royal British Nurses' Association|British Nurses' Association]] upon its foundation in 1887. In 1891, it received the prefix \"Royal\", and received the [[Royal Charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]] the following year. She was a strong supporter of [[nurse registration]], an issue that was opposed by both [[Florence Nightingale]] and leading public figures.<ref name=Chomet119>Seweryn Chomet, ''Helena: A Princess Reclaimed'' (Begell House, New York, 1999)  p. 119</ref> In a speech Helena made in 1893, she made clear that the RBNA was working towards \"improving the education and ''status'' of those devoted and self-sacrificing women whose whole lives have been devoted to tending the sick, the suffering, and the dying\". In the same speech, she warned about opposition and misrepresentation they had encountered. Although the RBNA was in favour of registration as a means of enhancing and guaranteeing the professional status of trained nurses, its incorporation with the Privy Council allowed it to maintain a list rather than a formal register of nurses.<ref name=Chomet120>Chomet, p. 120</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, the new Queen, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]], insisted on replacing Helena as President of the Army Nursing Service. In accordance with rank, Helena agreed to resign in Alexandra's favour, and she retained presidency of the Army Nursing Reserve.<ref name=Chomet122>Chomet, p. 122</ref> Though thought to be merely an artefact created by society ladies, Helena exercised an efficient and autocratic regime\u2014\"if anyone ventures to disagree with Her Royal Highness she has simply said, 'It is my wish, that is sufficient.'\"<ref>Georgina Battiscombe, ''Queen Alexandra'' (Constable & Company Ltd, London, 1969) p. 233</ref>\n\nThe RBNA gradually went into decline following the [[Nurses Registration Act 1919]]; after six failed attempts between 1904 and 1918, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] passed the bill allowing formal nurse registration.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Registration of Nurses\n |publisher   = Royal British Nurses' Association\n |year        = 2008\n |url         = http://www.r-bna.com/registration.asp\n |accessdate  = 2008-02-21\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209161803/http://www.r-bna.com/registration.asp\n |archivedate = 2008-02-09\n}}</ref> What resulted was the [[Royal College of Nursing]] (RCN), and the RBNA lost membership and dominance. Helena supported the proposed amalgamation of the RBNA with the new RCN, but that proved unsuccessful when the RBNA pulled out of the negotiations. However, Princess Helena remained active in other nursing organisations.<ref>Chomet, p. 123</ref>\n\n==Military nursing==\nNightingale laid the foundations of professional nursing with the principles summarised in the book ''[[Notes on Nursing]]''.<ref>A. Summers, ''Angels and Citizens: British Women as Military Nurses 1854\u20131914'' (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1988)</ref> Her highly publicized exposure of the abysmal care afforded sick and wounded soldiers energized reformers. Queen Victoria in 1860 ordered a hospital to be built to train Army nurses and surgeons, the [[Netley Hospital|Royal Victoria Hospital]]. The hospital opened in 1863 in [[Netley]] and admitted and cared for military patients. Beginning in 1866, nurses were formally appointed to Military General Hospitals.\n\nThe [[Army Nursing Service]] (ANS) oversaw the work of the nurses starting in 1881. These military nurses were sent overseas beginning with the [[First Boer War]] (often called Zulu War) from 1879 to 1881.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/army-medical-services/qaranc/9910.aspx|publisher=British Army Website|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028190846/http://www.army.mod.uk/army-medical-services/qaranc/9910.aspx|archivedate=28 October 2011}}</ref> They were also dispatched to serve during the Egyptian Campaign in 1882 and the Sudan War of 1883 to 1884. During the Sudan War members of the Army Nursing Service nursed in hospital ships on the Nile as well as the Citadel in Cairo. Almost 2000 nurses served during the second [[Boer War]], the Anglo-Boer War of 1899 to 1902, alongside nurses who were part of the colonial armies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

In 1902, the Midwives Registration [[Act of Parliament|Act]] established the state regulation of [[midwife|midwives]] and, two years later, a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]] was established to consider the registration of nurses.\n\nThe committee reported in 1904 and set out a detailed and persuasive case for registration. However, the government sat on the report and took no action. Over the next decade, a number of [[Private Member's Bill]]s to establish regulation were introduced but all failed to achieve significant support in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].\n\n====First World War====\nBy the beginning of the First World War in 1914, military nursing still had only a small role for women in Britain; 10,500 nurses enrolled in [[Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS) and the [[Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service]]. These services dated to 1902 and 1918, and enjoyed royal sponsorship. There also were  74,000 [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] (VAD) nurses who had been enrolled by the Red Cross.<ref>Brenda McBride, ''Quiet Heroines: Story of the Nurses of the Second World War'' (1985)</ref> The ranks that were created for the new nursing services were Matron-in-Chief, Principal Matron, Sister and Staff Nurses. Women joined steadily throughout the War. At the end of 1914, there were 2,223 regular and reserve members of the QAIMNS and when the war ended there were 10,404 trained nurses in the QAIMNS.<ref name=\"qaranc.co.uk\"/>\n\nGrace McDougall (1887\u20131963) was the energetic commandant of the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), which had formed in 1907 as an auxiliary to the home guard in Britain.  McDougall at one point was captured by the Germans but escaped. The British army wanted nothing to do with them so they drove ambulances and ran hospitals and casualty clearing stations for the Belgian and French armies.<ref>Roy Terry, \"McDougall ,  Grace Alexandra  (1887\u20131963)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2004); online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59610, accessed 6 March 2013]</ref><ref>Janet Lee, \"A Nurse and a Soldier: Gender, Class and National Identity in the First World War Adventures of Grace McDougall and Flora Sandes,\" ''[[Women's History Review]]'' (2006) 15#1 pp 83-103; Janet Lee,  ''War girls: the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry in the First World War'' (Manchester University Press, 2012)</ref>\n\nThe First World War provided the final impetus to the establishment of nursing regulation, partly because of the specific contribution made by nurses to the war effort and also as a reflection of the increased contribution of women more generally in society. The College of Nursing (later the [[Royal College of Nursing]]) was established in 1916 and three years later persuaded a backbench Member of Parliament (MP), Major [[Richard Barnett (sport shooter)|Richard Barnett]], to introduce a private members bill to establish a regulatory system. The bill was finally passed in December 1919 and separate Nurses Registration Acts were passed for England/Wales, Scotland and Ireland, which was still part of the United Kingdom at the time. These acts established the [[General Nursing Council]] for England and Wales and the other bodies which survived intact until the legislative changes in 1979 which were to create the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council|UKCC]] and the National Boards of Nursing. [[Ethel Gordon Fenwick]] was the first nurse on the English register.\n\nThe [[National Asylum Workers' Union]] organised strikes at [[Prestwich Hospital]], [[Whittingham Hospital]] and [[Bodmin Hospital]] in 1918. It threatened to organise strikes in all the London asylums in support of a 48-hour week in 1919.  The [[Professional Union of Trained Nurses]] was founded in 1919.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=132}}</ref>\n\n===1920s===\nIn the 1921 [[Census in the United Kingdom|Census]] 111,501 women and 11,000 men declared that they were nurses.  The registration regime stopped the very small hospitals from offering training.  The first national examination was in 1925. About 40% of the candidates failed.\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] produced its first draft policy statement on the profession in 1926, advocating a 48-hour week, the separation of training schools from hospitals and advocating that the profession should be organised on Trade Union lines.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=117}}</ref>\n\n===1930s===\n* Foundation of the [[National Society of Male Nurses]].\n* The Royal College of Nursing gains its [[royal charter]].\nIn the 1931 [[Census in the United Kingdom|Census]] 138,670 women and 15,000 men declared that they were nurses. 88% of the women were single, 5% married and 7% widowed or divorced.\n\nIn 1930 nurses in the [[voluntary hospital]]s worked 117 hours a fortnight in London and 119 in the provinces. In 1936 the [[London County Council]] introduced a standard 54 hour week for nurses and in 1938 moved to a 96-hour fortnight.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=123}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935 county councils began training courses for assistant nurses to care for the chronic sick.\n\nIn 1937 the [[Trades Union Congress]] adopted a \"Nurses\u2019 Charter\", demanding a  96-hour fortnight, improvement of the amenities of nurses\u2019 homes and arguing that nurses should be able to live out.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brook|first1=Iris|title=Happiness in the Hospital -Recruitment of Nurses|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/the-socialist-health-association/socialism-and-health/medicine-today-and-tomorrow/happiness-in-the-hospital/|accessdate=7 June 2017|publisher=Medicine Today and Tomorrow|date=October 1937}}</ref> At that time the average nurse was working 104 hours per fortnight.

It found that about 12,000 new recruits were needed each year.

Up to 67,000 were thought to be needed to care for the expected air-raid casualties.  This was more than the number of trained nurses in employment.  A Civil Nursing Reserve was set up - 7000 trained nurses, 3000 assistant nurses and also nursing auxiliaries.  The auxiliaries were given fifty hours training in hospital before they started work.\nAfter protests it was agreed that they should not do domestic work. 6,200 from the Civil Nursing Reserve were working in hospitals in June 1940.\n\nThe Ministry of Health guaranteed a salary of \u00a340 to nursing students in training, about double what voluntary hospitals were paying before the war.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=165}}</ref>\n\nDuring the war nurses belonged to [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps|Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS), as they had during World War I, and as they remain today.

Members of the Army Nursing Service served in every overseas British military campaign during World War II, as well as at military hospitals in Britain. At the beginning of World War II, nurses held officer status with equivalent rank, but were not commissioned officers. In 1941, emergency commissions and a rank structure were created, conforming with the structure used in the rest of the British Army.

Almost as an afterthought, Briggs also recommended the replacement of the existing regulatory structure (involving nine separate bodies across the United Kingdom) with a unified central council and separate boards in each of the four countries with specific responsibility for education. Six years of debate and delay followed before the modified Briggs proposals formed the basis of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/16 Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979]. This was due to the need to take account of [[devolution]], [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]] misgivings, lack of consensus within the professions (especially from midwives), and a lack of government will to find the parliamentary time to enact the legislation.\n\n===1980s===\n* Mass meetings are held over pay, the state of the NHS, clinical grading and the abolition of the enrolled nurse.\n* United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) becomes the profession's new regulatory body in 1983.\nIn 1983, the UKCC was set up.

In the [[History of Christianity in Britain|early Christian era]], [[nursing in the United Kingdom]] was undertaken by certain women in the [[Christian Church]], their services being extended to patients in their homes. These women had no real training by today's standards, but experience taught them valuable skills, especially in the use of [[herb]]s and folk drugs, and some gained fame as the [[physician]]s of their era.

Pay in London [[voluntary hospital]]s was between 6 shillings and 9s 6d a week, with some board and lodging.  Outside London pay was much lower.  Few nurses were described as educated.  Facilities in hospitals were poor, though some began to provide meals for nurses.  Sisters were recruited separately from nurses and were more respectable, and matrons, whose work was largely administrative, even more so.\n\nNursing in the [[Workhouse infirmary|Poor Law infirmaries]], such as it was, was largely carried out by able-bodied paupers, who were not paid.  In 1866 there were a total of 53 nurses employed in the 11 metropolitan [[workhouse]]s, at an average salary of \u00a320 18s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=6}}</ref>\n\n==Florence Nightingale==\n\n{{Main|Florence Nightingale}}\n\n[[Image:Florence Nightingale.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Florence Nightingale]]\nFlorence Nightingale is regarded as the founder of modern nursing profession.<ref>Elizabeth Goodrick, and Trish Reay. \"Florence Nightingale endures: Legitimizing a new professional role identity.\" ''Journal of Management Studies'' (2010) 47#1 pp: 55-84.</ref>  There was no hospital training school for nurses until [[Deaconess's Institute of Kaiserswerth|one was established]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf-Kaiserswerth|Kaiserwerth]], Germany, in 1846. There, Nightingale received the training that enabled her in 1860 to establish, at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London, the [[Nightingale School of Nursing|first school]] designed primarily to train nurses rather than to provide nursing service for the hospital.\n\nIn the [[Crimean War]] against Russia, Nightingale was appointed by [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sir Sidney Herbert]] to oversee the introduction of female nurses into the military hospitals in Turkey. In November 1854, Nightingale arrived at the Barrack Hospital at Scutari, with a party of ten nurses and ten nuns. Initially the doctors did not want the nurses there and did not ask for their help, but within ten days fresh casualties arrived from the [[Battle of Inkermann]] and the nurses were fully stretched. Nightingale was horrified at what she found in the makeshift hospital: doctors reusing infected rags, the used rags just remaining in a pile, soldiers left unwashed and bleeding. She introduced sanitary protocols and reduced the casualty rate by fifty percent.\n\nWhen Nightingale returned from the Crimean War in August 1856, she hid herself away from the public's attention.  For her contribution to Army statistics and comparative hospital statistics in 1860, Nightingale became the first woman to be elected a fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society|Statistical Society]].\n\n==1858\u20131902==\n\n===Professionalisation===\nWhen state registration of the medical profession had begun in 1858, many observers pointed to the need for a similar system for nursing. That year, the ''Nursing Record'' (renamed the ''[[British Journal of Nursing]]'' in 1902), a nursing journal, called for \n''\"... the whole question of the Registration of trained nurses to be set forth in a succinct form before the profession and the public\".''  Support for the regulation of nursing began to become more widespread following the establishment of organised nurse training in 1860.\n\nBy the 1880s, the Hospitals Association (an early version of the [[NHS Confederation]]) was committed to the principle of registration for nurses. The Matrons' Committee, comprising the [[matron]]s of the leading hospitals, agreed with registration, but differed in their views of the required length of training, arguing for three years as opposed to the one supported by the Hospitals Association. In 1887, the Hospitals Association over-ruled the matrons and established a non-statutory voluntary register. At this the Matrons' Committee split between one group which supported the Hospitals Association and another faction, led by [[Ethel Gordon Fenwick]], which opposed the new register and sought to align themselves more closely with the medical profession. Florence Nightingale, incidentally, supported neither group and was opposed to any form of regulation for nursing, believing that the essential qualities of the nurse could neither be taught, examined nor regulated.\n\nIn 1887, the group of nurses associated with [[Ethel Gordon Fenwick]] formed the [[British Nurses' Association]], which sought ''\"... to unite all British nurses in membership of a recognised profession and to provide for their registration on terms, satisfactory to physicians and surgeons, as evidence of their having received systematic training\".''\n\nTherefore, two separate voluntary registers now existed. Whereas that maintained by the Hospitals Association was purely an administrative list, the register established by the BNA had a more explicit public protection remit.\n\nBy 1892 it was accepted in the [[voluntary hospital]]s that the matron was the head of an independent operation, controlling her own staff and reporting directly to the hospital committee.\n\nIn 1901 there were 3,170 paid nurses employed in workhouses, with about 2,000 probationers - about one nurse for 20 patients.  In total there were about 63,500 female nurses and 5,700 male nurses in England and Wales, working both in institutions and, the majority, in patients homes.  The men were almost entirely mental nurses and were not admitted to nurse training schools.  Nurses in workhouses were paid about \u00a317 a year.  Hospital nurses in 1902 were paid around \u00a319 a year, but the cost of maintenance, laundry, uniforms and accommodation which were provided was around \u00a330 a year.  In domiciliary work two guineas a week with meals provided was normal pay, and the work was easier.  In hospitals 12 hour days were normal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=55}}</ref>\n\n===Princess Helena and The Royal British Nurses' Association===\n\n[[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Princess Helena]], the daughter of Queen Victoria, played a central role in sponsoring and legitimizing the profession. Helena had a firm interest in nursing, and became President of the [[Royal British Nurses' Association|British Nurses' Association]] upon its foundation in 1887. In 1891, it received the prefix \"Royal\", and received the [[Royal Charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]] the following year. She was a strong supporter of [[nurse registration]], an issue that was opposed by both [[Florence Nightingale]] and leading public figures.<ref name=Chomet119>Seweryn Chomet, ''Helena: A Princess Reclaimed'' (Begell House, New York, 1999)  p. 119</ref> In a speech Helena made in 1893, she made clear that the RBNA was working towards \"improving the education and ''status'' of those devoted and self-sacrificing women whose whole lives have been devoted to tending the sick, the suffering, and the dying\". In the same speech, she warned about opposition and misrepresentation they had encountered. Although the RBNA was in favour of registration as a means of enhancing and guaranteeing the professional status of trained nurses, its incorporation with the Privy Council allowed it to maintain a list rather than a formal register of nurses.<ref name=Chomet120>Chomet, p. 120</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, the new Queen, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]], insisted on replacing Helena as President of the Army Nursing Service. In accordance with rank, Helena agreed to resign in Alexandra's favour, and she retained presidency of the Army Nursing Reserve.<ref name=Chomet122>Chomet, p. 122</ref> Though thought to be merely an artefact created by society ladies, Helena exercised an efficient and autocratic regime\u2014\"if anyone ventures to disagree with Her Royal Highness she has simply said, 'It is my wish, that is sufficient.'\"<ref>Georgina Battiscombe, ''Queen Alexandra'' (Constable & Company Ltd, London, 1969) p. 233</ref>\n\nThe RBNA gradually went into decline following the [[Nurses Registration Act 1919]]; after six failed attempts between 1904 and 1918, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] passed the bill allowing formal nurse registration.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Registration of Nurses\n |publisher   = Royal British Nurses' Association\n |year        = 2008\n |url         = http://www.r-bna.com/registration.asp\n |accessdate  = 2008-02-21\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209161803/http://www.r-bna.com/registration.asp\n |archivedate = 2008-02-09\n}}</ref> What resulted was the [[Royal College of Nursing]] (RCN), and the RBNA lost membership and dominance. Helena supported the proposed amalgamation of the RBNA with the new RCN, but that proved unsuccessful when the RBNA pulled out of the negotiations. However, Princess Helena remained active in other nursing organisations.<ref>Chomet, p. 123</ref>\n\n==Military nursing==\nNightingale laid the foundations of professional nursing with the principles summarised in the book ''[[Notes on Nursing]]''.<ref>A. Summers, ''Angels and Citizens: British Women as Military Nurses 1854\u20131914'' (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1988)</ref> Her highly publicized exposure of the abysmal care afforded sick and wounded soldiers energized reformers. Queen Victoria in 1860 ordered a hospital to be built to train Army nurses and surgeons, the [[Netley Hospital|Royal Victoria Hospital]]. The hospital opened in 1863 in [[Netley]] and admitted and cared for military patients. Beginning in 1866, nurses were formally appointed to Military General Hospitals.\n\nThe [[Army Nursing Service]] (ANS) oversaw the work of the nurses starting in 1881. These military nurses were sent overseas beginning with the [[First Boer War]] (often called Zulu War) from 1879 to 1881.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/army-medical-services/qaranc/9910.aspx|publisher=British Army Website|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028190846/http://www.army.mod.uk/army-medical-services/qaranc/9910.aspx|archivedate=28 October 2011}}</ref> They were also dispatched to serve during the Egyptian Campaign in 1882 and the Sudan War of 1883 to 1884.

In 1902, the Midwives Registration [[Act of Parliament|Act]] established the state regulation of [[midwife|midwives]] and, two years later, a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]] was established to consider the registration of nurses.\n\nThe committee reported in 1904 and set out a detailed and persuasive case for registration. However, the government sat on the report and took no action. Over the next decade, a number of [[Private Member's Bill]]s to establish regulation were introduced but all failed to achieve significant support in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].\n\n====First World War====\nBy the beginning of the First World War in 1914, military nursing still had only a small role for women in Britain; 10,500 nurses enrolled in [[Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS) and the [[Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service]]. These services dated to 1902 and 1918, and enjoyed royal sponsorship. There also were  74,000 [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] (VAD) nurses who had been enrolled by the Red Cross.<ref>Brenda McBride, ''Quiet Heroines: Story of the Nurses of the Second World War'' (1985)</ref> The ranks that were created for the new nursing services were Matron-in-Chief, Principal Matron, Sister and Staff Nurses. Women joined steadily throughout the War. At the end of 1914, there were 2,223 regular and reserve members of the QAIMNS and when the war ended there were 10,404 trained nurses in the QAIMNS.<ref name=\"qaranc.co.uk\"/>\n\nGrace McDougall (1887\u20131963) was the energetic commandant of the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), which had formed in 1907 as an auxiliary to the home guard in Britain.  McDougall at one point was captured by the Germans but escaped. The British army wanted nothing to do with them so they drove ambulances and ran hospitals and casualty clearing stations for the Belgian and French armies.<ref>Roy Terry, \"McDougall ,  Grace Alexandra  (1887\u20131963)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2004); online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59610, accessed 6 March 2013]</ref><ref>Janet Lee, \"A Nurse and a Soldier: Gender, Class and National Identity in the First World War Adventures of Grace McDougall and Flora Sandes,\" ''[[Women's History Review]]'' (2006) 15#1 pp 83-103; Janet Lee,  ''War girls: the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry in the First World War'' (Manchester University Press, 2012)</ref>\n\nThe First World War provided the final impetus to the establishment of nursing regulation, partly because of the specific contribution made by nurses to the war effort and also as a reflection of the increased contribution of women more generally in society. The College of Nursing (later the [[Royal College of Nursing]]) was established in 1916 and three years later persuaded a backbench Member of Parliament (MP), Major [[Richard Barnett (sport shooter)|Richard Barnett]], to introduce a private members bill to establish a regulatory system. The bill was finally passed in December 1919 and separate Nurses Registration Acts were passed for England/Wales, Scotland and Ireland, which was still part of the United Kingdom at the time. These acts established the [[General Nursing Council]] for England and Wales and the other bodies which survived intact until the legislative changes in 1979 which were to create the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council|UKCC]] and the National Boards of Nursing. [[Ethel Gordon Fenwick]] was the first nurse on the English register.\n\nThe [[National Asylum Workers' Union]] organised strikes at [[Prestwich Hospital]], [[Whittingham Hospital]] and [[Bodmin Hospital]] in 1918. It threatened to organise strikes in all the London asylums in support of a 48-hour week in 1919.  The [[Professional Union of Trained Nurses]] was founded in 1919.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=132}}</ref>\n\n===1920s===\nIn the 1921 [[Census in the United Kingdom|Census]] 111,501 women and 11,000 men declared that they were nurses.  The registration regime stopped the very small hospitals from offering training.  The first national examination was in 1925.

It reported in 1972 and recommended a number of changes to professional education.  Almost as an afterthought, Briggs also recommended the replacement of the existing regulatory structure (involving nine separate bodies across the United Kingdom) with a unified central council and separate boards in each of the four countries with specific responsibility for education. Six years of debate and delay followed before the modified Briggs proposals formed the basis of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/16 Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979]. This was due to the need to take account of [[devolution]], [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]] misgivings, lack of consensus within the professions (especially from midwives), and a lack of government will to find the parliamentary time to enact the legislation.\n\n===1980s===\n* Mass meetings are held over pay, the state of the NHS, clinical grading and the abolition of the enrolled nurse.\n* United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) becomes the profession's new regulatory body in 1983.\nIn 1983, the UKCC was set up.

At the same time, National Boards were created for each of the UK countries.  Their main functions were to monitor the quality of nursing and midwifery education courses, and to maintain the training records of students on these courses.\n\nThis structure survived with minor modifications until April 2002, when the UKCC ceased to exist and its functions were taken over by a new [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] (NMC).

Mass education and increasing affluence led to new papers such as the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' emerging at the end of the 19th century, aimed at lower middle-class readers.\n\nIn the early 20th century the British press was dominated by a few wealthy [[press baron]]s. In a bid to increase circulation many papers included more popular and human-interest stories, as well as sports and other features. In 1969 [[Rupert Murdoch]] bought and relaunched ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' as a tabloid and soon added pictures of topless models on [[Page 3]]. Within a few years the Sun was the UK's most popular newspaper.\n\nIn the 1980s national newspapers began to move out of [[Fleet Street]], the traditional home of the British national press since the 18th century. By the early 21st century newspaper circulation began to decline.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Tobitt |first1=Charlotte |title=National newspaper ABCs |url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/national-newspaper-abcs-industry-wide-circulation-decline-continues-as-metro-and-sun-top-the-table/ |accessdate=10 November 2018 |magazine=Press Gazette |date=14 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 2010s many British newspapers were implicated in a major [[News International phone hacking scandal|phone hacking scandal]] which led to the closure of the ''[[News of the World]]'' after 168 years of publication and the [[Leveson Inquiry]] into press standards.<ref name=NMtimeline />\n\n==17th century==\nDuring the 17th century there were many kinds of news publications that told both the news and rumours, such as [[pamphlet]]s, [[poster]]s and [[Broadside ballads|ballads]]. Even when news periodicals emerged, many of these co-existed with them. A news periodical differs from these mainly because of its periodicity. The definition for 17th century [[newsbook]]s and [[newspapers]] is that they are published at least once a week. [[Johann Carolus]]' ''Relation aller F\u00fcrnemmen und gedenckw\u00fcrdigen Historien'', published in [[Strassburg]] in 1605, is usually regarded as the first news periodical.<ref>World Association of Newspapers: [http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html \"Newspapers: 400 Years Young!\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310235015/http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html |date=10 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, the right to print was strictly controlled in England. This was probably the reason why the first newspaper in the English language was printed in Rome by [[Joris Veseler]] around 1620. This followed the style established by Veseler's earlier Dutch paper ''[[Courante uyt Italien, Duytslandt, &c.]]'' However, when the English started printing their own papers in [[London]], they reverted to the pamphlet format used by contemporary books. The publication of these newsbooks was suspended between 1632 and 1638 by order of the [[Star Chamber]].  After they resumed publication, the era of these newsbooks lasted until the publication of the ''[[Oxford Gazette]]'' in 1665.\n\nThe control over printing relaxed greatly after the abolition of the [[Star Chamber]] in 1641. The [[English civil war|Civil War]] escalated the demand for news. News pamphlets or books reported the war, often supporting one side or the other. A number of publications arose after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], including the ''[[London Gazette]]'' (first published on 16 November 1665 as the ''Oxford Gazette''),<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/1/pages/1 London-gazette.co.uk]</ref> the first official [[journal of record]] and the newspaper of the Crown. Publication was controlled under the Licensing Act of 1662, but the Act's lapses from 1679\u20131685 and from 1695 onwards encouraged a number of new titles.\n\n''[[Mercurius Caledonius]]'' founded in [[Edinburgh]] in 1660, was [[Scotland]]'s first but short-lived newspaper.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://caledonianmercury.com/2010/01/24/the-previous-incarnations-of-the-caledonian-mercury/001099 | title = The previous incarnations of the Caledonian Mercury | accessdate = 2013-04-15 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140227052423/http://caledonianmercury.com/2010/01/24/the-previous-incarnations-of-the-caledonian-mercury/001099 | archivedate = 27 February 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  Only 12 editions were published during 1660 and 1661.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/collections/rarebooks/collections/newspapers.html|title=Rare Books Collections - Newspapers|publisher=[[National Library of Scotland]]|accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==18th century==\n[[File:Daily Courant plaque London.jpg|thumb|This plaque in London marks the publication in 1702 of ''The Daily Courant'' as London's first daily newspaper]]\nThere were twelve London newspapers and 24 provincial papers by the 1720s (the ''[[Daily Courant]]'' was the first daily newspaper in London). The ''[[Public Advertiser]]'' was started by Henry Woodfall in the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe first English journalist to achieve national importance was [[Daniel Defoe]]. In February 1704, he began his weekly, ''The Review'', which was eventually  printed three times a week and was a forerunner of ''The Tatler'' (started by [[Richard Steele]] in 1709) and ''The Spectator'' (started by Steele and [[Joseph Addison]] in 1711). Defoe's ''Review'' came to an end in 1713. Between 1716 and 1720 he published a monthly newspaper with old style title, ''Mercurius Politicus.'' ''The Examiner'' started in 1710 as the chief Conservative political mouthpiece, which enjoyed as its  most influential contributor, [[Jonathan Swift]]. Swift had control of the journal for 33 issues between November 1710 and June 1711, but once he became dean of  [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in Dublin, he gave up regular journalistic work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Kevin|title=Read All About It: a History of the British Newspaper|year=2010|pages=302}}</ref>\n\nIn 1702 [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], the virtual founder of the famous \"[[Lloyd's]]\" of commerce, started a thrice a week newspaper, ''Lloyd's News'', which had  but a brief existence in its initial form, but was the precursor  of the modern ''[[Lloyd's List]]''. The 76th issue of  the original paper contained a paragraph mentioning the House of Lords, for which the publisher was told he would have to pay a fine. He preferred to discontinue his publication instead. In 1726 he in part revived it, under the title of ''Lloyd's List'', published at first weekly, it would later become a daily.<ref>{{cite book|last=George|first=Curan|title=Newspaper History. Seventeenth Century to the Present|year=1978|location=423}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Edinburgh Courant]]'' was published out of [[Edinburgh]], [[Midlothian]], [[Scotland]]. Its first issue was dated 14-19 Feb 1705 and was sold for a [[penny]]. It was one of the country's first regional papers, second only to the [[Norwich Post]] (1701). The paper was produced twice weekly for five years, then continued as the ''Scots Courant'' until April 1720. Later that same year, the ''Edinburgh Evening Courant'' began publication, and it survived until the ''[[Edinburgh Evening News|Evening News]]'' came into existence in 1873.\n\nThe increasing popularity and influence of newspapers was problematic to the government of the day. The first bill in parliament  advocating a [[tax on newspapers]] was proposed in 1711. The duty eventually imposed in 1712 was a halfpenny on papers of half a sheet or less and a penny on newspapers that ranged from half a sheet to a single sheet in size. Jonathan Swift expressed in his  ''Journal to Stella'' on 7 August 1712, doubt in the ability of ''The Spectator'' to hold out against the tax. This doubt was proved justified in December 1712 by its discontinuance. However, some of the existing journals continued production and their numbers soon increased. Part of this increase was attributed to corruption and political connections of its owners. Later, toward the middle of the same century, the provisions and the penalties of the [[Stamp Act]] were made more stringent, yet the number of newspapers continued to rise. In 1753 the total number of copies of newspapers sold yearly in Britain amounted to 7,411,757. In 1760 it had risen to 9,464,790 and in 1767 to 11,300,980.

It was left to Steele and Addison to develop the social side of journalism in their respective papers. In 1761 the ''North Briton'' came out and it was largely a result of its publisher, [[John Wilkes]], and his campaign for increased freedom of the press that, in 1772 the right to publish parliamentary reports was established.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Alexander|title=A History of British Journalism|year=2011|pages=354}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Observer]]'', first published on 4 December 1791, was the world's first [[Sunday newspaper]].\n\n==19th century==\nBy the early 19th century, there were 52 London papers and over 100 other titles. As stamp, paper and other duties were progressively reduced from the 1830s onwards (all duties on newspapers were gone by 1855) there was a massive growth in overall circulation as major events and improved communications developed the public's need for information. ''The Daily Universal Register'' began life in 1785 and was later to become known as ''[[The Times]]'' from 1788. This was the most significant newspaper of the first half of the 19th century, but from around 1860 there were a number of more strongly competitive titles, each differentiated by its political biases and interests.\n\nIn 1802 and 1815 the tax on newspapers was increased to three pence and then four pence. Unable or unwilling to pay this fee, between 1831 and 1835 hundreds of untaxed newspapers made their appearance. The political tone of most of them was fiercely revolutionary. Their publishers were prosecuted but this failed to discourage untaxed newspapers. It was chiefly Milner Gibson and Richard Cobden who advocated the case in parliament to first reduce in 1836 and, in 1855, totally repeal the tax on newspapers. The development of the press  was greatly assisted by the gradual abolition of the taxes on periodicals as well as by the introduction of a cheap postal system. Both of these developments made the newspaper more affordable to a greater percentage of the population. The burden of the newspaper tax on publishers was heavy, resulting in 29,400,000 tax stamps being issued in 1820. In 1828 the proprietor of ''[[The Times]]'' had to pay the state more than \u00a368,000 in taxes. After the reduction of the stamp tax in 1836 from four pence to one penny, the circulation of English newspapers rose from 39,000,000 to 122,000,000 by 1854.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lake|first=Brian|title=British Newspapers: A History and Guide|year=1984|pages=213}}</ref>\n\n===Major papers===\n''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'' is a newspaper published by [[D.

Like most papers the entire front page was devoted to classified advertisements; ''The Courier'' was unusual in maintaining this format until 1992, before adopting the headline-news format.\n\n''[[Seren Gomer]]'' was a [[Welsh language]] periodical founded in 1814 by the clergyman and writer [[Joseph Harris (Gomer)]], the first Welsh-language newspaper.\n\nThe ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' was founded in Manchester in 1821 by a group of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] businessmen. Its most famous editor, [[Charles Prestwich Scott]], made the ''Manchester Guardian'' into a world-famous newspaper in the 1890s. It is now called ''The Guardian'' and published in London.\n\n''[[The Scotsman]]'' was launched<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.scotsman.com/help/about |title=The Scotsman Archive \u2013 25 January 1817 (page 1 of 8) \u2013 The Scotsman launched |work=The Scotsman |location=UK  |accessdate=20 December 2009}}</ref> in 1817 as a liberal weekly newspaper by lawyer [[William Ritchie (Newspaper Editor)|William Ritchie]] and [[customs]] official [[Charles Maclaren]] in response to the \"unblushing subservience\" of competing newspapers to the Edinburgh establishment.  The paper was pledged to \"impartiality, firmness and independence\". Its modern editorial line is firmly anti-independence. After the abolition of newspaper [[stamp tax]] in Scotland in 1855, ''The Scotsman'' was relaunched as a daily newspaper priced at [[\u00a3sd|1d]] and a circulation of 6,000 copies.\n\nThe [[Chartism|Chartist]] ''[[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]]'', first published on 26 May 1838, was a pioneer of popular journalism but was very closely linked to the fortunes of the movement and was out of business by 1852. At the same time there was the establishment of more specialised periodicals and the first cheap newspaper in the ''Daily Telegraph and Courier'' (1855), later to be known simply as the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''. \n[[File:Telegraph29061855.jpg|thumb|1855 first edition of the ''Daily Telegraph & Courier'']]\n''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was first published on 29 June 1855 and was owned by [[Arthur B.

His son, Edward Lawson soon became editor, a post he held until 1885. ''The Daily Telegraph'' became the organ of the middle class  and could  claim the largest circulation  in the world in 1890.

Critics noted how London was echoing the emerging New York style of journalism.<ref>Joel H.

In the 1850s and 1860s the ads appealed to the increasingly affluent middle-class that sought out a variety of new products. The advertisements announced new health remedies as well as fresh foods and beverages. The latest London fashions were featured in the regional press. The availability of repeated advertising permitted manufacturers to develop nationally known brand names that had a much stronger appeal than generic products.<ref>Beverley Ann Tudor, \"Retail Trade Advertising in the 'Leicester Journal' and the 'Leicester Chronicle' 1855-71.\" ''European Journal of Marketing'' 20#9 (1986) pp: 41-56.</ref>\n\n==20th century==\nAfter the war, the major newspapers engaged in a large-scale circulation race.

Koss]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain: The Twentieth Century'' (1984) 2:471-73.</ref>  Sales in the millions depended on popular stories, with a strong human interesting theme, as well as detailed sports reports with the latest scores. Serious news was a niche market and added very little to the circulation base.  The niche was dominated by ''[[The Times]]'' and, to a lesser extent, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]].''  Consolidation was rampant, as local dailies were bought up and added to chains based in London.   James Curran and [[Jean Seaton]] report: \t\t\n: after the death of Lord Northcliffe in 1922, four men, Lords [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]] (1879-1964), [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Rothermere]] (1868-1940), [[William Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose|Camrose]] (1879-1954) and [[Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley|Kemsley]] (1883-1968)\u2013became the dominant figures in the inter-war press.

Its editor [[Geoffrey Dawson]] was closely allied with Prime Minister  [[Neville Chamberlain]], and pushed hard for the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938.  Candid news reports by [[Norman Ebbutt]] from Berlin that warned of warmongering were rewritten in London to support the appeasement policy.

In response to a threat of statutory regulation, the voluntary General Council of the Press was formed in 1953, funded by newspaper proprietors. Membership was initially restricted to newspaper editors but was reformed as the [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]] in 1962, with 20 per cent lay members. The Council had a non-binding regulatory framework with the stated aim of maintaining high standards of ethics in journalism. In 1980 the [[National Union of Journalists]] withdrew from membership.

It started on 24 January 1986 when some 6,000 newspaper workers went on strike after protracted negotiation with their employers, [[News International]] (parent of Times Newspapers and News Group Newspapers, and chaired by [[Rupert Murdoch]]). News International had built and clandestinely equipped a new printing plant for all its titles in the London district of [[Wapping]], and when the print unions announced a strike it activated this new plant with the assistance of the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union]] (EETPU). Despite the widespread use of the [[Offset lithography|offset litho]] printing process elsewhere, the Murdoch papers in common with the rest of [[Fleet Street]] continued to be produced by the hot-metal and labour-intensive [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] method, rather than being composed [[Desktop publishing|electronically]]. [[Eddy Shah]]'s Messenger group, in a long-running and bitter dispute at [[Warrington]] had benefited from the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government's trade union legislation to allow employers to de-recognise unions, enabling the company to use an alternative workforce and new technology in newspaper production. He launched ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' on Tuesday 4 March 1986, as a middle-market tabloid, a rival to the long-established ''Daily Mail'' and ''Daily Express''. It pioneered computer photosetting and full-colour offset printing at a time when national newspapers were still using Linotype machines and letterpress. Established national newspapers converted to electronic production and colour printing. ''Today'' ceased publication on 17 November 1995, the first long-running national newspaper title to close since the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'' in 1971.\n\nBy 1988, nearly all the national newspapers had abandoned Fleet Street to relocate in the Docklands, and had begun to change their printing practices to those being employed by News International. Even though the last major British news office, [[Reuters]], left in 2005, the term ''Fleet Street'' continues to be used as a [[metonym]] for the British national press.\n\n''[[The Independent]]'' was first published on 7 October 1986. The paper was created at a time of fundamental change and attracted staff from the two Murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to the new headquarters in Wapping. Launched with the advertising slogan \"It is. Are you?\", and challenging ''The Guardian'' for centre-left readers, and ''The Times'' as a newspaper of record, it reached a circulation of over 400,000 in 1989. Competing in a moribund market, ''The Independent'' sparked a general freshening of newspaper design as well as a price war.\n\n''[[The European (newspaper)|The European]]'', billed as \"''Europe's first national newspaper''\", was a weekly newspaper founded by [[Robert Maxwell]]. It lasted from 11 May 1990 until December 1998. The circulation peaked at 180,000, over half of which was British. The [[David and Frederick Barclay|Barclay brothers]] bought the newspaper in 1992, investing an estimated $110 million and in 1996 transforming it into a high-end [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format oriented at the business community edited by [[Andrew Neil]].\n\nBy the 1980s Robert Maxwell's various companies owned the ''Daily Mirror'', the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'', the Scottish ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' and ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' and several other newspapers. Maxwell was  litigious against those who would speak or write against him. The satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' lampooned him as \"Cap'n Bob\" and the \"bouncing Czech\", the latter nickname having originally been devised by Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] (under whom Maxwell was an MP). Maxwell took out several libel actions against ''Private Eye''. Maxwell's untimely death triggered a flood of instability with banks frantically calling in their massive loans, and his publishing empire collapsed. It emerged that, without adequate prior authorisation, Maxwell had used hundreds of millions of pounds from his companies' pension funds to shore up the shares of the Mirror Group, to save his companies from bankruptcy.\n\n==21st century==\n\n===The phone hacking scandal===\n{{main|News International phone hacking scandal}}\nThe [[News International phone hacking scandal]] is an ongoing controversy involving the ''[[News of the World]]'' and other British newspapers published by [[News International]], a subsidiary of Murdoch's [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]].

The relaxation of government censorship in the late 17th century led to a rise in publications, which in turn led to an increase in regulation throughout the 18th century.<ref name=NMtimeline>{{cite web |title=History of British newspapers |url=http://www.newsmediauk.org/History-of-British-Newspapers |website=News Media Association |accessdate=10 November 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' began publication in 1785 and became the leading newspaper of the early 19th century, before the lifting of taxes on newspapers and technological innovations led to a boom in newspaper publishing in the late 19th century. Mass education and increasing affluence led to new papers such as the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' emerging at the end of the 19th century, aimed at lower middle-class readers.\n\nIn the early 20th century the British press was dominated by a few wealthy [[press baron]]s. In a bid to increase circulation many papers included more popular and human-interest stories, as well as sports and other features. In 1969 [[Rupert Murdoch]] bought and relaunched ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' as a tabloid and soon added pictures of topless models on [[Page 3]]. Within a few years the Sun was the UK's most popular newspaper.\n\nIn the 1980s national newspapers began to move out of [[Fleet Street]], the traditional home of the British national press since the 18th century. By the early 21st century newspaper circulation began to decline.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Tobitt |first1=Charlotte |title=National newspaper ABCs |url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/national-newspaper-abcs-industry-wide-circulation-decline-continues-as-metro-and-sun-top-the-table/ |accessdate=10 November 2018 |magazine=Press Gazette |date=14 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 2010s many British newspapers were implicated in a major [[News International phone hacking scandal|phone hacking scandal]] which led to the closure of the ''[[News of the World]]'' after 168 years of publication and the [[Leveson Inquiry]] into press standards.<ref name=NMtimeline />\n\n==17th century==\nDuring the 17th century there were many kinds of news publications that told both the news and rumours, such as [[pamphlet]]s, [[poster]]s and [[Broadside ballads|ballads]]. Even when news periodicals emerged, many of these co-existed with them. A news periodical differs from these mainly because of its periodicity. The definition for 17th century [[newsbook]]s and [[newspapers]] is that they are published at least once a week. [[Johann Carolus]]' ''Relation aller F\u00fcrnemmen und gedenckw\u00fcrdigen Historien'', published in [[Strassburg]] in 1605, is usually regarded as the first news periodical.<ref>World Association of Newspapers: [http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html \"Newspapers: 400 Years Young!\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310235015/http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html |date=10 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, the right to print was strictly controlled in England. This was probably the reason why the first newspaper in the English language was printed in Rome by [[Joris Veseler]] around 1620. This followed the style established by Veseler's earlier Dutch paper ''[[Courante uyt Italien, Duytslandt, &c.]]'' However, when the English started printing their own papers in [[London]], they reverted to the pamphlet format used by contemporary books. The publication of these newsbooks was suspended between 1632 and 1638 by order of the [[Star Chamber]].  After they resumed publication, the era of these newsbooks lasted until the publication of the ''[[Oxford Gazette]]'' in 1665.\n\nThe control over printing relaxed greatly after the abolition of the [[Star Chamber]] in 1641. The [[English civil war|Civil War]] escalated the demand for news. News pamphlets or books reported the war, often supporting one side or the other. A number of publications arose after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], including the ''[[London Gazette]]'' (first published on 16 November 1665 as the ''Oxford Gazette''),<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/1/pages/1 London-gazette.co.uk]</ref> the first official [[journal of record]] and the newspaper of the Crown. Publication was controlled under the Licensing Act of 1662, but the Act's lapses from 1679\u20131685 and from 1695 onwards encouraged a number of new titles.\n\n''[[Mercurius Caledonius]]'' founded in [[Edinburgh]] in 1660, was [[Scotland]]'s first but short-lived newspaper.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://caledonianmercury.com/2010/01/24/the-previous-incarnations-of-the-caledonian-mercury/001099 | title = The previous incarnations of the Caledonian Mercury | accessdate = 2013-04-15 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140227052423/http://caledonianmercury.com/2010/01/24/the-previous-incarnations-of-the-caledonian-mercury/001099 | archivedate = 27 February 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  Only 12 editions were published during 1660 and 1661.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/collections/rarebooks/collections/newspapers.html|title=Rare Books Collections - Newspapers|publisher=[[National Library of Scotland]]|accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==18th century==\n[[File:Daily Courant plaque London.jpg|thumb|This plaque in London marks the publication in 1702 of ''The Daily Courant'' as London's first daily newspaper]]\nThere were twelve London newspapers and 24 provincial papers by the 1720s (the ''[[Daily Courant]]'' was the first daily newspaper in London). The ''[[Public Advertiser]]'' was started by Henry Woodfall in the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe first English journalist to achieve national importance was [[Daniel Defoe]]. In February 1704, he began his weekly, ''The Review'', which was eventually  printed three times a week and was a forerunner of ''The Tatler'' (started by [[Richard Steele]] in 1709) and ''The Spectator'' (started by Steele and [[Joseph Addison]] in 1711). Defoe's ''Review'' came to an end in 1713. Between 1716 and 1720 he published a monthly newspaper with old style title, ''Mercurius Politicus.'' ''The Examiner'' started in 1710 as the chief Conservative political mouthpiece, which enjoyed as its  most influential contributor, [[Jonathan Swift]]. Swift had control of the journal for 33 issues between November 1710 and June 1711, but once he became dean of  [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in Dublin, he gave up regular journalistic work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Kevin|title=Read All About It: a History of the British Newspaper|year=2010|pages=302}}</ref>\n\nIn 1702 [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], the virtual founder of the famous \"[[Lloyd's]]\" of commerce, started a thrice a week newspaper, ''Lloyd's News'', which had  but a brief existence in its initial form, but was the precursor  of the modern ''[[Lloyd's List]]''. The 76th issue of  the original paper contained a paragraph mentioning the House of Lords, for which the publisher was told he would have to pay a fine. He preferred to discontinue his publication instead. In 1726 he in part revived it, under the title of ''Lloyd's List'', published at first weekly, it would later become a daily.<ref>{{cite book|last=George|first=Curan|title=Newspaper History. Seventeenth Century to the Present|year=1978|location=423}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Edinburgh Courant]]'' was published out of [[Edinburgh]], [[Midlothian]], [[Scotland]]. Its first issue was dated 14-19 Feb 1705 and was sold for a [[penny]]. It was one of the country's first regional papers, second only to the [[Norwich Post]] (1701). The paper was produced twice weekly for five years, then continued as the ''Scots Courant'' until April 1720. Later that same year, the ''Edinburgh Evening Courant'' began publication, and it survived until the ''[[Edinburgh Evening News|Evening News]]'' came into existence in 1873.\n\nThe increasing popularity and influence of newspapers was problematic to the government of the day. The first bill in parliament  advocating a [[tax on newspapers]] was proposed in 1711. The duty eventually imposed in 1712 was a halfpenny on papers of half a sheet or less and a penny on newspapers that ranged from half a sheet to a single sheet in size. Jonathan Swift expressed in his  ''Journal to Stella'' on 7 August 1712, doubt in the ability of ''The Spectator'' to hold out against the tax. This doubt was proved justified in December 1712 by its discontinuance. However, some of the existing journals continued production and their numbers soon increased. Part of this increase was attributed to corruption and political connections of its owners. Later, toward the middle of the same century, the provisions and the penalties of the [[Stamp Act]] were made more stringent, yet the number of newspapers continued to rise. In 1753 the total number of copies of newspapers sold yearly in Britain amounted to 7,411,757. In 1760 it had risen to 9,464,790 and in 1767 to 11,300,980. In 1776 the number of newspapers published in London alone had increased to 53.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Hannah|title=Newspapers, Politics and English Society|year=1999|pages=256}}</ref>\n\n''[[The News Letter]]'' is one of [[Northern Ireland]]'s main daily newspapers, published Monday to Saturday.

It was left to Steele and Addison to develop the social side of journalism in their respective papers. In 1761 the ''North Briton'' came out and it was largely a result of its publisher, [[John Wilkes]], and his campaign for increased freedom of the press that, in 1772 the right to publish parliamentary reports was established.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Alexander|title=A History of British Journalism|year=2011|pages=354}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Observer]]'', first published on 4 December 1791, was the world's first [[Sunday newspaper]].\n\n==19th century==\nBy the early 19th century, there were 52 London papers and over 100 other titles. As stamp, paper and other duties were progressively reduced from the 1830s onwards (all duties on newspapers were gone by 1855) there was a massive growth in overall circulation as major events and improved communications developed the public's need for information. ''The Daily Universal Register'' began life in 1785 and was later to become known as ''[[The Times]]'' from 1788. This was the most significant newspaper of the first half of the 19th century, but from around 1860 there were a number of more strongly competitive titles, each differentiated by its political biases and interests.\n\nIn 1802 and 1815 the tax on newspapers was increased to three pence and then four pence. Unable or unwilling to pay this fee, between 1831 and 1835 hundreds of untaxed newspapers made their appearance. The political tone of most of them was fiercely revolutionary. Their publishers were prosecuted but this failed to discourage untaxed newspapers. It was chiefly Milner Gibson and Richard Cobden who advocated the case in parliament to first reduce in 1836 and, in 1855, totally repeal the tax on newspapers. The development of the press  was greatly assisted by the gradual abolition of the taxes on periodicals as well as by the introduction of a cheap postal system. Both of these developments made the newspaper more affordable to a greater percentage of the population. The burden of the newspaper tax on publishers was heavy, resulting in 29,400,000 tax stamps being issued in 1820. In 1828 the proprietor of ''[[The Times]]'' had to pay the state more than \u00a368,000 in taxes. After the reduction of the stamp tax in 1836 from four pence to one penny, the circulation of English newspapers rose from 39,000,000 to 122,000,000 by 1854.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lake|first=Brian|title=British Newspapers: A History and Guide|year=1984|pages=213}}</ref>\n\n===Major papers===\n''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'' is a newspaper published by [[D. C. Thomson & Co.]] in [[Dundee]], Scotland. It had five daily editions for Dundee, Fife, Perth and Angus. It was established in 1801 as the ''Dundee Courier & Argus''. Like most papers the entire front page was devoted to classified advertisements; ''The Courier'' was unusual in maintaining this format until 1992, before adopting the headline-news format.\n\n''[[Seren Gomer]]'' was a [[Welsh language]] periodical founded in 1814 by the clergyman and writer [[Joseph Harris (Gomer)]], the first Welsh-language newspaper.\n\nThe ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' was founded in Manchester in 1821 by a group of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] businessmen. Its most famous editor, [[Charles Prestwich Scott]], made the ''Manchester Guardian'' into a world-famous newspaper in the 1890s. It is now called ''The Guardian'' and published in London.\n\n''[[The Scotsman]]'' was launched<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.scotsman.com/help/about |title=The Scotsman Archive \u2013 25 January 1817 (page 1 of 8) \u2013 The Scotsman launched |work=The Scotsman |location=UK  |accessdate=20 December 2009}}</ref> in 1817 as a liberal weekly newspaper by lawyer [[William Ritchie (Newspaper Editor)|William Ritchie]] and [[customs]] official [[Charles Maclaren]] in response to the \"unblushing subservience\" of competing newspapers to the Edinburgh establishment.  The paper was pledged to \"impartiality, firmness and independence\". Its modern editorial line is firmly anti-independence. After the abolition of newspaper [[stamp tax]] in Scotland in 1855, ''The Scotsman'' was relaunched as a daily newspaper priced at [[\u00a3sd|1d]] and a circulation of 6,000 copies.\n\nThe [[Chartism|Chartist]] ''[[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]]'', first published on 26 May 1838, was a pioneer of popular journalism but was very closely linked to the fortunes of the movement and was out of business by 1852. At the same time there was the establishment of more specialised periodicals and the first cheap newspaper in the ''Daily Telegraph and Courier'' (1855), later to be known simply as the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''. \n[[File:Telegraph29061855.jpg|thumb|1855 first edition of the ''Daily Telegraph & Courier'']]\n''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was first published on 29 June 1855 and was owned by [[Arthur B.

His son, Edward Lawson soon became editor, a post he held until 1885. ''The Daily Telegraph'' became the organ of the middle class  and could  claim the largest circulation  in the world in 1890. It held a consistent Liberal Party allegiance until opposing Gladstone's foreign policy in 1878 when it turned Unionist.<ref>{{cite book|last=Franklin|first=Bob|title=Pulling Newspapers Apart|year=2008|pages=292}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', founded in 1842, was the world's first illustrated weekly newspaper.

Critics noted how London was echoing the emerging New York style of journalism.<ref>Joel H.

In the 1850s and 1860s the ads appealed to the increasingly affluent middle-class that sought out a variety of new products. The advertisements announced new health remedies as well as fresh foods and beverages. The latest London fashions were featured in the regional press. The availability of repeated advertising permitted manufacturers to develop nationally known brand names that had a much stronger appeal than generic products.<ref>Beverley Ann Tudor, \"Retail Trade Advertising in the 'Leicester Journal' and the 'Leicester Chronicle' 1855-71.\" ''European Journal of Marketing'' 20#9 (1986) pp: 41-56.</ref>\n\n==20th century==\nAfter the war, the major newspapers engaged in a large-scale circulation race. The political parties, which long had sponsored their own papers, could not keep up, and one after another their outlets were sold or closed down.<ref>[[Stephen E. Koss]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain: The Twentieth Century'' (1984) 2:471-73.</ref>  Sales in the millions depended on popular stories, with a strong human interesting theme, as well as detailed sports reports with the latest scores. Serious news was a niche market and added very little to the circulation base.  The niche was dominated by ''[[The Times]]'' and, to a lesser extent, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]].''  Consolidation was rampant, as local dailies were bought up and added to chains based in London.   James Curran and [[Jean Seaton]] report: \t\t\n: after the death of Lord Northcliffe in 1922, four men, Lords [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]] (1879-1964), [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Rothermere]] (1868-1940), [[William Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose|Camrose]] (1879-1954) and [[Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley|Kemsley]] (1883-1968)\u2013became the dominant figures in the inter-war press. In 1937, for instance, they owned nearly one in every two national and local daily papers sold in Britain, as well as one in every three Sunday papers that were sold. The combined circulation of all their newspapers amounted to over thirteen million.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Curran|author2=Jean Seaton|title=Power Without Responsibility: Press, Broadcasting and the Internet in Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GM6OAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT72|date= 2009|publisher=Routledge|page=72}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Times]]'' was long the most influential prestige newspaper, although far from having the largest circulation.

The paper advocated [[appeasement]] of Hitler's demands.  Its editor [[Geoffrey Dawson]] was closely allied with Prime Minister  [[Neville Chamberlain]], and pushed hard for the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938.  Candid news reports by [[Norman Ebbutt]] from Berlin that warned of warmongering were rewritten in London to support the appeasement policy.

In response to a threat of statutory regulation, the voluntary General Council of the Press was formed in 1953, funded by newspaper proprietors. Membership was initially restricted to newspaper editors but was reformed as the [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]] in 1962, with 20 per cent lay members. The Council had a non-binding regulatory framework with the stated aim of maintaining high standards of ethics in journalism. In 1980 the [[National Union of Journalists]] withdrew from membership. In 1991, the Press Council was replaced by the [[Press Complaints Commission]].\n\nWhen he relaunched the flagging ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' newspaper in [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] format on 17 November 1969, [[Rupert Murdoch]] began publishing photographs of clothed glamour models on its third page.

It was hailed as Britain's first worker-controlled, mass-circulation daily, formed as a [[Worker cooperative|workers' cooperative]] by 500 of the 1,846 <ref name=\"pressgazette2\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/?t=article&l=back_issues_270505 |title=Journalism news and jobs for journalists |magazine=Press Gazette |accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref> journalists, photographers, engineers, and print workers who were made [[Redundancy (law)|redundant]] in April 1974 by Beaverbrook Newspapers when the ''[[Daily Express|Scottish Daily Express]]'' closed its printing operations in Scotland and moved to Manchester.\n\nThe [[Wapping dispute]] was a significant turning point in the history of the [[trade union]] movement and of UK industrial relations. It started on 24 January 1986 when some 6,000 newspaper workers went on strike after protracted negotiation with their employers, [[News International]] (parent of Times Newspapers and News Group Newspapers, and chaired by [[Rupert Murdoch]]). News International had built and clandestinely equipped a new printing plant for all its titles in the London district of [[Wapping]], and when the print unions announced a strike it activated this new plant with the assistance of the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union]] (EETPU). Despite the widespread use of the [[Offset lithography|offset litho]] printing process elsewhere, the Murdoch papers in common with the rest of [[Fleet Street]] continued to be produced by the hot-metal and labour-intensive [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] method, rather than being composed [[Desktop publishing|electronically]]. [[Eddy Shah]]'s Messenger group, in a long-running and bitter dispute at [[Warrington]] had benefited from the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government's trade union legislation to allow employers to de-recognise unions, enabling the company to use an alternative workforce and new technology in newspaper production. He launched ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' on Tuesday 4 March 1986, as a middle-market tabloid, a rival to the long-established ''Daily Mail'' and ''Daily Express''. It pioneered computer photosetting and full-colour offset printing at a time when national newspapers were still using Linotype machines and letterpress. Established national newspapers converted to electronic production and colour printing. ''Today'' ceased publication on 17 November 1995, the first long-running national newspaper title to close since the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'' in 1971.\n\nBy 1988, nearly all the national newspapers had abandoned Fleet Street to relocate in the Docklands, and had begun to change their printing practices to those being employed by News International. Even though the last major British news office, [[Reuters]], left in 2005, the term ''Fleet Street'' continues to be used as a [[metonym]] for the British national press.\n\n''[[The Independent]]'' was first published on 7 October 1986. The paper was created at a time of fundamental change and attracted staff from the two Murdoch broadsheets who had chosen not to move to the new headquarters in Wapping. Launched with the advertising slogan \"It is. Are you?\", and challenging ''The Guardian'' for centre-left readers, and ''The Times'' as a newspaper of record, it reached a circulation of over 400,000 in 1989. Competing in a moribund market, ''The Independent'' sparked a general freshening of newspaper design as well as a price war.\n\n''[[The European (newspaper)|The European]]'', billed as \"''Europe's first national newspaper''\", was a weekly newspaper founded by [[Robert Maxwell]]. It lasted from 11 May 1990 until December 1998. The circulation peaked at 180,000, over half of which was British. The [[David and Frederick Barclay|Barclay brothers]] bought the newspaper in 1992, investing an estimated $110 million and in 1996 transforming it into a high-end [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format oriented at the business community edited by [[Andrew Neil]].\n\nBy the 1980s Robert Maxwell's various companies owned the ''Daily Mirror'', the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'', the Scottish ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' and ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' and several other newspapers. Maxwell was  litigious against those who would speak or write against him. The satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' lampooned him as \"Cap'n Bob\" and the \"bouncing Czech\", the latter nickname having originally been devised by Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] (under whom Maxwell was an MP). Maxwell took out several libel actions against ''Private Eye''. Maxwell's untimely death triggered a flood of instability with banks frantically calling in their massive loans, and his publishing empire collapsed. It emerged that, without adequate prior authorisation, Maxwell had used hundreds of millions of pounds from his companies' pension funds to shore up the shares of the Mirror Group, to save his companies from bankruptcy.\n\n==21st century==\n\n===The phone hacking scandal===\n{{main|News International phone hacking scandal}}\nThe [[News International phone hacking scandal]] is an ongoing controversy involving the ''[[News of the World]]'' and other British newspapers published by [[News International]], a subsidiary of Murdoch's [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]. Employees of the newspaper were convicted of engaging in [[phone hacking]], [[Police corruption#bribery|police bribery]], and exercising improper influence in the pursuit of publishing stories.

For the current situation since 2000 see [[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom]].\n\nBritain from 1750 to the 1910s took pride in an unmatched economic base; comprising industry, finance, shipping and trade that largely dominated the globe. Foreign policy based on [[free trade]] (after 1840) kept the economy flourishing. The overseas [[British Empire]] recovered after the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in 1776, and reached its zenith about 1920. Foreign policy made sure it was never seriously threatened.\n\nAfter expending enormous energy on the defeat of the [[First French Empire]] and [[Napoleon]] (1793\u20131815), British policy focused on achieving a conservative [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] within Europe, with no one country achieving dominance over the affairs of the continent. This had been the basic reason behind the British wars against Napoleon, and the British commitment in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The chief enemy down to 1815 was [[History of France|France]], with its much larger population base and its powerful army. The British were generally [[British military history|successful in their many wars]], with the notable exception of the [[American War of Independence]] (1775\u20131783). In that war Britain, without any major allies, was defeated by the colonials who had the support of the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], while France had support from [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]].<ref>See Jeremy Black,  \"Could the British Have Won the American War of Independence?.\"  ''Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research.''

Britain relied heavily on its [[History of the Royal Navy|Royal Navy]] for security, seeking to keep it the most powerful fleet afloat with a full complement of bases across the globe. British dominance of the seas was vital to the formation of the British Empire, which was achieved through the maintenance of a Navy larger than the next two largest Navies combined for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, prior to the entry of the United States into World War II. The British controlled the oceans. So powerful was the Royal Navy, it needed to do little actual fighting from 1812 to 1914.  Although all of the other [[great power]]s fought with their neighbours, the [[British Army]] had only one relatively limited war (the [[Crimean War]] against the [[Russian Empire]] in 1854\u201356). The Army mostly handled garrison duty, and did have to deal with localized insurrections and colonial conflicts in Asia and Africa.\n\nFor a capsule guide to the wars, see [[List of conflicts involving the United Kingdom]].\n\n==English foreign policy before 1700==\nIn 1500 England had only a modest population (3.8 million) compared to its much larger rivals of France (15 million), Spain (6.5 million), and the Holy Roman Empire (17 million). It was three times larger than its naval rival, the Netherlands, and eight times larger than Scotland.<ref>Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones, ''Atlas of world population history'' (Penguin, 1978) pp. 43, 47, 57, 65,71, 101</ref>  The limited budget, limited ambitions on the continent, avoidance of alliances, and the protection afforded by the English Channel from foreign invasion combined to make foreign affairs less pressing for the British government before 1688. Elite elements paid little attention to Continental affairs before the 1660s, and there was little clamour to enter the [[Thirty Years War]] of 1618\u201348.

Foreign affairs apart from Scotland were not a high priority.  Scotland was an independent country, and peace was agreed to in 1497.  Much of his diplomacy involved treaties for marriages with ruling houses in Europe. He married his eldest daughter [[Margaret Tudor]] to King [[James IV of Scotland]] in 1503. The match did not guarantee peace in the short run but did so in the long run: in 1603 [[James VI and I]], the grandson of the marriage, united the two kingdoms under his rule.  Henry tried to marry [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|his daughter Mary]]  to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|the man who later became Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], but that fell through.  Henry VIII finally married her to King [[Louis XII of France]] as part of a peace treaty in 1514; Louis died after three months and Henry demanded and got most of her dowry back.  The other main diplomatic success of Henry VII was an alliance with Spain, sealed by the marriage in 1501 of his heir Arthur, Prince of Wales, to [[Catherine of Aragon]], Spain's infanta (eldest daughter of the Spanish king). When his Queen died in 1503, Henry VII searched the European marriage market for a diplomatic marriage with a large dowry for himself, but was unable to find a match.<ref>P.S.

In military terms, he paid special attention to expanding the English Navy, to protect the rapidly expanding merchant fleet.  He also commissioned privateers from the merchant fleets to act as auxiliary [[warship]]s that captured and resold enemy merchant ships.  Some of his foreign and religious policy revolved around annulling his marriage to Catherine in 1533 despite the opposition of the pope\u2014his solution was to remove the Church of England from the pope's authority, thereby launching the [[English Reformation]].<ref>R.B.

Henry renewed his father's friendship with [[Louis XII of France]], and signed a pact with King Ferdinand of Spain. After [[Pope Julius II]] created the anti-French [[League of Cambrai#Holy League|Holy League]] in October 1511, Henry followed Spain's lead and brought England into the new League.  An initial joint Anglo-Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover [[Aquitaine]] for England, the start of making Henry's dreams of ruling France a reality. The attack failed and it strained the Anglo-Spanish alliance. Nevertheless, the French were pushed out of Italy soon after, and the alliance survived, with both parties keen to win further victories over the French.<ref>J.J.

Chased by privateers in the English channel, five small Spanish ships carrying gold and silver worth 400,000 florins (\u00a385,000) sought shelter in English harbors at Plymouth and Southampton. The English government headed by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] gave permission. The money was bound for the Netherlands as payment for Spanish soldiers who were fighting rebels there. Queen Elizabeth discovered that the gold was not owned by Spain, but was still owned by Italian bankers.  She decided to seize it, and treated as a loan from the Italian bankers to England.  The bankers agree to her terms, so Elizabeth had the money and she eventually repaid the bankers.  Spain reacted furiously, and seized English property in the Netherlands and Spain.  England reacted by seizing Spanish ships and properties in England.  Spain reacted by imposing an embargo preventing all English imports into the Netherlands. The bitter diplomatic standoff lasted for four years.<ref>Wallace T. MacCaffrey, ''The Shaping of the Elizabethan Regime'' (1968) pp 271\u201390.</ref> However neither side wanted war.

War was never formally declared. Spain was militarily and financially much more powerful, and promoted a Catholic interest in opposition to England's Protestantism. The conflict saw widely separated battles, and began with England's military expedition in 1585 to the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (modern-day Belgium) in support of the resistance of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] to [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] rule.<ref>Charles Beem, ''The Foreign Relations of Elizabeth I'' (2011)</ref>  The English enjoyed a modest victory by \"[[Singeing the King of Spain's Beard]]\" in 1587 at C\u00e1diz, the main port in Spain.

The great English triumph was the decisive defeat of the Spanish invasion attempt by the ill-fated [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.<ref>Garrett Mattingly, ''[[The Armada (book)|The Armada'' (1959)]] is a famous narrative; recent scholarship is reviewed in Colin Martin and Geoffrey Parker, eds., ''The Spanish Armada'' (2nd ed. 1999).</ref> After Elizabeth died in 1603, the new king made peace a high priority and ended the long-simmering conflict in 1604.<ref>Susan Doran, ''Elizabeth I and Foreign policy, 1558\u20131603'' (Routledge, 2002).</ref>\n\n===Stuart foreign policy===\nBy 1600 the conflict with Spain became deadlocked during campaigns in [[Brittany]] and [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Ireland]].  James I, the new king of England made peace with the new King of Spain, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] with the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London in 1604]]. They agreed to cease their military interventions in the Spanish Netherlands and Ireland, respectively, and the English ended high seas [[privateering]] against Spanish merchant ships. [[James VI and I|King James I]] (reigned 1603\u201325)  was sincerely devoted to peace, not just for his three kingdoms, but for Europe as a whole.<ref>Roger Lockyer, ''James VI and I'' (1998) pp 138\u201358.</ref>   He disliked Puritans and Jesuits alike, because of their eagerness for warfare. He called himself \"Rex Pacificus\" (\"King of peace.\")<ref>Malcolm Smuts, \"The making of ''Rex Pacificus'': James VI and I and the Problem of Peace in an Age of Religious War,\" in Daniel Fischlin and Mark Fortier, eds., ''Royal Subjects: Essays on the Writings of James VI and I'' (2002) pp 371\u201387</ref>   Europe was deeply polarized, and on the verge of the massive [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), with the smaller established Protestant states facing the aggression of the larger Catholic empires.  On assuming the throne, James made peace with Catholic Spain, and made it his policy to marry his son to the Spanish Infanta (princess) in the \"[[Spanish Match]]\". The marriage of James' daughter Princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] to [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] on 14 February 1613 was more than the social event of the era; the couple's union had important political and military implications.  Across Europe, the German princes were banding together in the Union of German Protestant Princes, headquartered in Heidelberg, the capital of the Palatine.  King James calculated that his daughter's marriage would give him diplomatic leverage among the Protestants. He thus planned to have a foot in both camps and be able to broker peaceful settlements.  In his na\u00efvet\u00e9, he did not realize that both sides were playing him as a tool for their own goal of achieving destroying the other side. Spain's ambassador [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|Count Gondomar]] knew how to manipulate the king. The Catholics in Spain, as well as the Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], the Vienna-based leader of the Habsburgs and head of the Holy Roman Empire, were both heavily influenced by the Catholic counter-Reformation.  They had the goal of expelling Protestantism from their domains.<ref>W. B. Patterson, \"King James I and the Protestant cause in the crisis of 1618\u201322.\" ''Studies in Church History'' 18 (1982): 319\u2013334.</ref>\n\n[[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Lord Buckingham]] (1592\u20131628), who increasingly was the actual ruler of Britain, wanted an alliance with Spain.  Buckingham took Charles with him to Spain to woo the Infanta in 1623.  However, Spain's terms were that James must drop Britain's anti-Catholic intolerance or no marriage.  Buckingham and Charles were humiliated and Buckingham became the leader of the widespread British demand for a war against Spain.  Meanwhile, the Protestant princes looked to Britain, since it was the strongest of all the Protestant countries, to give military support for their cause.  His son-in-law and daughter became king and queen of Bohemia, which outraged Vienna.  The Thirty Years\u2019 War began, as the Habsburg Emperor ousted the new king and queen of Bohemia, and massacred their followers.  Catholic Bavaria then invaded the Palatine, and James's son-in-law begged for James's military intervention.  James finally realized his policies had backfired and refused these pleas.  He successfully kept Britain out of the European-wide war that proved so heavily devastating for three decades.  James's backup plan was to marry his son Charles to a French Catholic princess, who would bring a handsome dowry.  Parliament and the British people were strongly opposed to any Catholic marriage, were demanding immediate war with Spain, and strongly favored with the Protestant cause in Europe.  James had alienated both elite and popular opinion in Britain, and Parliament was cutting back its financing.  Historians credit James for pulling back from a major war at the last minute, and keeping Britain in peace.<ref>Jonathan Scott, ''England's Troubles: 17th-century English Political Instability in European Context'' (Cambridge UP, 2000), pp 98\u2013101</ref><ref>Godfrey Davies, ''The Early Stuarts: 1603\u20131660'' (1959), pp 47\u201367</ref>\n\nThe crisis in  Bohemia in 1619, and the conflagration that resulted, marked the beginning of the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]].

His experience and knowledge of European affairs made him the indispensable director of Allied diplomatic and military strategy, and he derived additional authority from his enhanced status as king of England \u2013 even the Emperor Leopold...recognized his leadership.  William's English subjects played subordinate or even minor roles in diplomatic and military affairs, having a major share only in the direction of the war at sea.  Parliament and the nation had to provide money, men and ships, and William had found it expedient to explain his intentions...but this did not mean that Parliament or even ministers assisted in the formulation of policy.<ref>J.R. Jones, ''Britain and the World, 1649\u20131815'' (1980) p. 157.</ref>\n\nEngland and France were at war almost continuously until 1713, with a short interlude 1697\u20131701 made possible by the [[Treaty of Ryswick]].<ref>Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714'' (1956)  pp 160\u201379.</ref>  The combined English and Dutch fleets could overpower France in a far-flung naval war, but France still had superiority on land. William wanted to neutralize that advantage by allying with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], the Habsburg Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (1658\u20131705), who was based in Vienna, Austria.  Leopold, however, Was tied down in [[Great Turkish War|war with the Ottoman Empire]] on his eastern frontiers; William worked to achieve a negotiated settlement between the Ottomans and the Empire.

But eventually the expenses, and war weariness, caused second thoughts.  At first, Parliament voted him the funds for his expensive wars, and for his subsidies to smaller allies. Private investors created the [[Bank of England]] in 1694; it provided a sound system that made financing wars much easier by encouraging bankers to loan money.<ref>John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: War, money, and the English state, 1688\u20131783'' (1989) p 133.</ref><ref>Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714'' (1956)  pp 174\u201379.</ref>\n\nIn the long-running [[Nine Years' War]] (1688\u201397) his main strategy was to form a military alliance of England, the Netherlands, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and some smaller states, to attack France at sea, and from land in different directions, while defending the Netherlands.  Louis XIV tried to undermine this strategy by refusing to recognize William as king of England, and by giving diplomatic, military and financial support to a series of pretenders to the English throne, all based in France. William focused most of his attention on foreign policy and foreign wars, spending a great deal of time in the Netherlands (where he continued to hold the dominant political office).  His closest foreign-policy advisers were Dutch, most notably [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland]]; they shared little information with their English counterparts.<ref>David Onnekink, \"\u2018Mynheer Benting now rules over us\u2019: the 1st Earl of Portland and the Re-emergence of the English Favourite, 1689\u201399.\" ''English Historical Review'' 121.492 (2006): 693\u2013713.

Diplomats were poorly selected, poorly funded, and non-professional. The main posts were Paris and The Hague, but the diplomats sent there were more clever in dealing with London politics than they were with diplomatic affairs.  King William III handle foreign policy himself, using Dutch diplomats whenever possible. After 1700, Britain built up the quantity of its diplomatic service in the major capitals, without much attention to quality. Vienna and Berlin were upgraded, but even they were ignored for years at a time. By the 1790s, British diplomats had learned a great deal by closely watching their French rivals; aristocratic exiles from Paris began helping out as well.  For the first time in the French wars, Britain set up an underground intelligence service that was in contact with local dissidents, and helped shape their protests.<ref>Elizabeth Sparrow, \"Secret Service under Pitt's Administrations, 1792\u20131806.\" ''History'' 83.270 (1998): 280\u2013294.</ref> [[William Pitt the Younger]], the Prime Minister during much of the [[French Revolution| French Revolutionary period]], was saddled with the largely incompetent Foreign Secretary, [[Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds]], from 1783 to 1791.

Great Britain and Prussia were the winners. They fought France, Austria, Spain and Russia\u2014nearly all of the other important powers except the Ottoman Empire). The Royal Navy played a major role, and the army and the Treasury played important roles. The war appeared to be a disaster for Prussia, until its fortunes reversed at the last second.  Britain swept up much of the overseas French Empire in North America and India. The financing of war was a critical issue, which Britain handled well, and France handled poorly, leaving itself so deep in debt. That it never fully recovered. [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]]  (1708\u201378) energized the British leadership, and used effective diplomacy and military strategy to achieve his victory.  Britain used the manpower from its American colonies effectively in cooperation with its regulars and its Navy to overwhelm the much less populous French colonial empire in what is now Canada. From a small spark in 1754 in the distant wilderness (near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), the fighting spread to Europe. 1759, was the \"[[annus mirabilis]]\" (\"miraculous year\"), with victory after victory. British and Prussian troops defeated the French army at the [[Battle of Minden]], the British captured [[History of Guadeloupe|Guadeloupe Island]] and [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Quebec]], smashed the French fleet at [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]], and (in January 1760) defeated the French in southern India.<ref>Frank McLynn, ''1759: The Year Britain Became Master of the World'' (2006)</ref>  Peace terms were hard to reach and the war dragged on until everyone was exhausted.

The League would not recognize supposed blockades of whole coasts, but only of individual ports, and then only if a British warship was actually present.  Denmark and Sweden agreed with Russia and the three countries signed the agreement forming the League. They remained otherwise out of the war, but threatened joint retaliation for every ship of theirs searched by a belligerent.  By the end of the war in 1783 [[Prussia]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Netherlands, Portugal, the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] had all become members.\n\nThe League never fought a battle.

Britons felt insulted when Napoleon said it deserved no voice in European affairs (even though King George was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire), and ought to restrict the London newspapers that were vilifying him.<ref>Frederick Kagan, ''The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801\u20131805'' (2007) pp 42\u201343</ref>\n\nBritain had a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon's possible threat to its overseas colonies. [[Frank McLynn]] argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a \"mixture of economic motives and national neuroses \u2013 an irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.\"  McLynn concludes that in the long run it proved to be the right choice for Britain, because in the long run Napoleon's intentions were hostile to the British national interest.  Napoleon was not ready for war and so this was the best time for Britain to stop them. Britain seized upon the Malta issue, refusing to follow the terms of the Treaty of Amiens and evacuate the island.<ref>Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014) p 309</ref>\n\nThe deeper British grievance was their perception that Napoleon was taking personal control of Europe, making the international system unstable, and forcing Britain to the sidelines.<ref>John D.

M. Trevelyan]] argues that British diplomacy under Lord Castlereagh played a decisive role:\n:In 1813 and 1814 Castlereagh played the part that William III and Marlborough had played more than a hundred years before, in holding together an alliance of jealous, selfish, weak-kneed states and princes, by a vigour or character and singleness of purpose that held Metternich, the Czar and the King of Prussia on the common track until the goal was reached. It is quite possible that, but for the lead taken by Castlereagh in the allied counsels, France would never have been reduced to her ancient limits, nor Napoleon dethroned.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Macaulay Trevelyan|title=British History in the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCLPc07CzgwC&pg=PA133|year=1923|page=133}}</ref>\n\n* 1803: [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815) against France<ref>See Arthur Bryant, ''Years of Victory, 1802\u20131812'' (1944) for British perspective</ref>\n*1803\u201306: [[War of the Third Coalition]]: Napoleon terminates the Holy Roman Empire.\n* 1803: By the Anglo-Russian agreement, Britain pays a subsidy of \u20a41.5 million pounds for every 100,000 Russian soldiers in the field.

Five men stand out for their leadership in foreign policy: Lord Palmerston, Lord Aberdeen, Benjamin Disraeli, William Gladstone and Lord Salisbury. Military action was much less important than diplomacy.

As foreign secretary (1830-4, 1835\u201341 and 1846\u201351) and subsequently as prime minister, Palmerston sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe, sometimes opposing France and at other times aligning with France to do so.<ref>Roman Golicz,  \"Napoleon III, Lord Palmerston and the Entente Cordiale.\" ''History Today'' 50#12 (2000): 10\u201317 online.</ref><ref>David Brown, \"Palmerston and Anglo\u2013French Relations, 1846\u20131865.\" ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 17.4 (2006): 675\u2013692</ref> Thus he was aligned with France in the [[Crimean War]] against Russia, fought and won with the limited goal of protecting the Ottoman Empire. Some of his aggressive actions, now sometimes termed [[Interventionism (politics)|liberal interventionist]], were highly controversial at the time, and remain so today. For example, he used military force to achieve his main goal of opening China to trade, although his critics focused on his support for the opium trade.<ref>{{cite book|author=Glenn Melancon|title=Britain's China Policy and the Opium Crisis: Balancing Drugs, Violence and National Honour, 1833\u20131840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V527VTyT29gC&pg=PA126|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate |isbn=9780754607045}}</ref> In all his actions Palmerston brought to bear a great deal of patriotic vigour and energy.

In 1813-1814 as ambassador to the Austrian Empire he negotiated the alliances and financing that led to the defeat of Napoleon. In Paris he normalized relations with the newly restored Bourbon government and convinced London they could be trusted.  He worked well with top European diplomats such as his friends [[Klemens von Metternich]] in Vienna  and [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] in Paris. He brought Britain into the center of Continental diplomacy on critical issues, such as the local wars in Greece, Portugal and Belgium.

Disraeli's second term (1874\u20131880) was dominated by the [[Eastern Question]]\u2014the slow decay of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the desire of other European powers, such as Russia, to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the [[Suez Canal Company]] (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the [[Congress of Berlin]] to obtain peace in the Balkans at terms favourable to Britain and unfavourable to Russia, its longstanding enemy. This diplomatic victory over Russia established Disraeli as one of Europe's leading statesmen.  World events thereafter moved against the Conservatives.  Controversial wars in [[Second Anglo-Afghan War|Afghanistan]] and [[Anglo-Zulu War|South Africa]] undermined Disraeli's public support.<ref name=\"Martin Swartz 1985\">Martin Swartz, ''The Politics of British Foreign Policy in the Era of Disraeli and Gladstone'' (1985).</ref>\n\n====Gladstone====\n[[William Ewart Gladstone]] (Prime Minister 1868\u201374, 1880\u201385, 1886, 1892\u201394), the Liberal leader, was much less inclined to imperialism and sought peace as the highest foreign policy goal.  However, historians have been sharply critical of Gladstone's foreign-policy during his second ministry. Paul Hayes says it \"provides one of the most intriguing and perplexing tales of muddle and incompetence in foreign affairs, unsurpassed in modern political history until the days of [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Grey]] and, later, [[Neville Chamberlain]].\"<ref>Paul Hayes, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The Twentieth Century: 1880\u20131939'' (1978) p 1</ref> Gladstone opposed himself to the \"colonial lobby\" which pushed the [[scramble for Africa]].

The region was gravely devastated by the wars of independence, and with weak financial systems, weak governments and repeated coups and internal rebellions. However, the region had a well-developed export sector focused on the foods that were in demand in Europe, especially sugar, coffee, wheat and (after the arrival of refrigeration in the 1860s), beef. There also was a well-developed mining sector. With the Spanish out of the picture, the region in the early 1820s was a devastated region suffering in a deep depression. It urgently needed capital, entrepreneurs, financiers, and shippers. Britain rushed in to fill the void by the middle 1820s, as the London government use its diplomatic power to encourage large-scale investment. The Royal Navy provided protection against piracy. The British established communities of merchants in major cities\u2014including 3000 Britons in Buenos Aires.<ref>R.A.

They supported the independence movement, and persuaded the British government to station commercial consuls in all the major trading centers in Latin America. The British were permanently committed, and it took decades \u2013 until the 1860s \u2013 before the commercial and involvement paid serious dividends. By 1875, Latin America was firmly integrated into transatlantic economy under British leadership. After 1898, the British had to compete commercially with the Americans.<ref>Ronald Hyam, ''Britain's Imperial Century 1815\u20131914'' (2002) pp 57\u201361</ref>\n\nIn long-term perspective, Britain's influence in Latin America was enormous after independence came in the 1820s. Britain deliberately sought to replace the Spanish in economic and cultural affairs.  Military issues and colonization were minor factors. The influence was exerted through diplomacy, trade, banking, and investment in railways and mines. The English language and British cultural norms were transmitted by energetic young British business agents on temporary assignment in the major commercial centers, where they invited locals into the British leisure activities, such as organized sports, and into their transplanted cultural institutions such as clubs and schools.<ref>Alina Silveira,  \"Educating a City's Children: British Immigrants and Primary Education in Buenos Aires (1820\u20131880).\" ''The Americas'' 70#1 (2013): 33\u201362.</ref> The impact on sports was overwhelming, as Latin America enthusiastically took up football (soccer).

British leaders were constantly annoyed from the 1840s to the 1860s by what they saw as Washington's pandering to the democratic mob, as in [[Oregon boundary dispute]] in 1844\u201346. However British middle class public opinion sensed a common \"[[Special Relationship]]\" between the two peoples based on language, migration, evangelical Protestantism, liberal traditions, and extensive trade. This constituency rejected war, forcing London to appease the Americans. During the [[Trent affair]] of late 1861, London drew the line and Washington retreated.<ref>George L. Bernstein, \"Special Relationship and Appeasement: Liberal policy towards America in the age of Palmerston.\" ''Historical Journal'' 41#3 (1998): 725\u2013750.</ref>\n\nBritish public opinion was divided on the American Civil War. The Confederacy tended to have support from the elites\u2014from the aristocracy and gentry, which identified with the landed plantation owners, and from Anglican clergy and some professionals who admired tradition, hierarchy and paternalism. The Union was favored by the middle classes, the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]] in religion, intellectuals, reformers and most factory workers, who saw slavery and forced labor as a threat to the status of the workingman.  The cabinet made the decisions. Chancellor of the Exchequer [[William E Gladstone]], whose family fortune was based on slavery in the West Indies before 1833, supported the Confederacy. Foreign Minister [[Earl Russell|Lord Russell]] wanted neutrality. Prime Minister [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] wavered between support for national independence, his opposition to slavery, and the strong economic advantages of Britain remaining neutral.<ref>A.G. Hopkins American Empire: a Global history (Princeton UP,  2018) pp 231\u201333.</ref>\n\nBritain supplied warships and blockade runners to the Confederacy, but had a large scale trade with the United States and many British men volunteered to fight for the North. Northern food supplies were much more essential to Britain than Southern cotton.<ref>Howard Jones, ''Blue & Gray Diplomacy: A History of Union and Confederate Foreign Relations'' (2010).</ref> After the war, the US demanded reparations (called the [[Alabama Claims]]) for the damages caused by the warships.

Three British leaders played major roles. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] in the 1830\u201365 era considered the Ottoman Empire an essential component in the balance of power, was the most favourable toward Constantinople. [[William Gladstone]] in the 1870s sought to build a Concert of Europe that would support the survival of the empire.

Most of the battles took place in the Crimean peninsula, which the Allies finally seized. London, shocked to discover that France was secretly negotiating with Russia to form a postwar alliance to dominate Europe, dropped its plans to attack St. Petersburg and instead signed a one-sided armistice with Russia that achieved almost none of its war aims. \n[[File:Edouard Dubufe Congr\u00e8s de Paris.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Diplomats at the Congress of Paris, 1856, settled the Crimean War; painting by [[Edouard Louis Dubufe]].]]\n\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] signed March 30, 1856, ended the war.

Moldavia and Wallachia remained under nominal Ottoman rule, but would be granted independent constitutions and national assemblies. However, by 1870, the Russians had regained most of their concessions.<ref>Harold Temperley, \"The Treaty of Paris of 1856 and Its Execution,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (1932) 4#3 pp. 387\u2013414 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1871004 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe war helped modernize warfare by introducing major new technologies such as railways, the telegraph, and modern nursing methods. In the long run the war marked a turning point in Russian domestic and foreign policy. Russian intellectuals used the defeat to demand fundamental reform of the government and social system. The war weakened both Russia and Austria, so they could no longer promote stability. This opened the way for [[Napoleon III]], [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]] (in Italy) and [[Otto von Bismarck]] (in Germany) to launch a series of wars in the 1860s that reshaped Europe.<ref>Stephen J.

The losses were reported in detail in the media and caused revulsion against warfare in Britain, combined with a celebration of the heroic common soldier who demonstrated Christian virtue. The great heroine was [[Florence Nightingale]], whose was hailed for her devotion to caring for the wounded and her emphasis on middle-class efficiency. She typified a moral status as a nurse that was superior to aristocratic militarism in terms of both morality and efficiency.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'' (2011) esp. pp 467\u201380.</ref>\n\nHistorian [[R. B. McCallum]] points out the war was enthusiastically supported by the British populace as it was happening, but the mood changed very dramatically afterwards. Pacifists and critics were unpopular but:\n:in the end they won. [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]] and [[John Bright|Bright]] were true to their principles of foreign policy, which laid down the absolute minimum of intervention in European affairs and a deep moral reprobation of war....When the first enthusiasm was passed, when the dead were mourned, the sufferings revealed, and the cost counted, when in 1870 Russia was able calmly to secure the revocation of the Treaty, which disarmed her in the Black Sea, the view became general of the war was stupid and unnecessary, and effected nothing....The Crimean war remained as a classic example...of how governments may plunge into war, how [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe|strong ambassadors]] may mislead [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|weak prime ministers]], how the public may be worked up into a facile fury, and how the achievements of the war may crumble to nothing. The Bright-Cobden criticism of the war was remembered and to a large extent accepted [especially by the Liberal Party]. Isolation from European entanglements seemed more than ever desirable.<ref>R.B.

In 1914, Britain went to war with the Ottomans and ended their nominal role.  Historian [[A. J. P.

The \"[[Special Relationship]]\" with the United States starting about 1898 allowed Britain to largely relocate its naval forces out of the Western Hemisphere.<ref>Duncan Campbell, ''Unlikely Allies: Britain, America and the Victorian Origins of the Special Relationship'' (2007).</ref>\n\nGermany's Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] dominated European diplomacy 1872\u20131890, with the determination to use the balance of power to keep the peace.  There were no wars.  However he was removed by an aggressive young Kaiser in 1890, allowing French efforts to isolate Germany to become successful. With the formation of the [[Triple Entente]], Germany began to feel encircled. [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who played a major role in foreign policy in the late 1890s under the Salisbury government, repeatedly tried to open talks with Germany about some sort of an alliance.  Germany was not interested.<ref>H.W.

Key markers were the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894, the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] linking France and Great Britain, and finally the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907 which became the [[Triple Entente]].

After 1905, foreign policy was tightly controlled by the Liberal foreign minister [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] (1862\u20131933), who seldom consulted the Cabinet. Grey shared the strong Liberal policy against all wars and against military alliances that would force Britain to take a side in war. However, in the case of the Boer War, Grey held that the Boers had committed an aggression that it was necessary to repulse. The Liberal party split on the issue, with a large faction strongly opposed to the war in Africa<ref>Keith Robbins, \"Grey, Edward, Viscount Grey of Fallodon (1862\u20131933)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2004; online edition, 2011) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33570, accessed 5 Nov 2017]</ref><ref>Denis Judd and Keith Surridge, ''The Boer War: A History'' (2nd ed. 2013),</ref>\n\nThe Triple Entente between Britain, France and Russia is often compared to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] between Germany, Austria\u2013Hungary and Italy, but historians caution against the comparison. The Entente, in contrast to the Triple Alliance or the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], was not an alliance of mutual defence and Britain therefore felt free to make her own foreign policy decisions in 1914. The Liberals were highly moralistic, and by 1914 they have been increasingly convinced that German aggression violated international norms, and specifically that its invasion of neutral Belgium was completely unacceptable in terms of morality, and in terms of British policy against any one power control and the continent of Europe.<ref>K.A.

Tirpitz turned the modest little fleet into a world-class force that could threaten the British Royal Navy. The British responded with new technology typified by the [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|Dreadnought revolution]]. It made every battleship obsolete and, supplemented by the global network of coaling stations and telegraph cables, enabled Britain to stay well in the lead in naval affairs.<ref>Margaret Macmillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914'' (2013) ch 5</ref><ref>Thomas Hoerber, \"Prevail or perish: Anglo-German naval competition at the beginning of the twentieth century,\" ''European Security'' (2011) 20#1, pp. 65\u201379.

Germany was so convinced that the United States as a neutral was playing a decisive role, that it began unrestricted submarine warfare against the United States, which it new it would lead to war in April 1917. The United States then took over Britain's financial role, loaning large sums to Britain, France, Russia, Italy and the others.

Everything went wrong.<ref>Inbal Rose, ''Conservatism and foreign policy during the Lloyd George coalition 1918\u20131922'' (Routledge, 2014).</ref>  The League of Nations, off to a slow start, was a huge let down from utopian dreams.  The Treaty of Versailles had set up a series of temporary organizations, composed of delegations from key powers, to ensure the successful application of the Treaty. The system worked very poorly. The assembly of ambassadors was repeatedly overruled and became a nonentity. Most of the commissions were deeply divided and unable to either make decisions or convince the interested parties to carry them out. The most important commission was on Reparations, and France took full control of it. The new French prime minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] was intensely anti-German, was unrelenting in his demands for huge reparations, and was repeatedly challenged by Germany. France finally invaded parts of Germany, and Berlin responded by imposing a runaway inflation that seriously damage the German economy and also damaged the French economy.   The United States, after refusing to ratify the League in 1920, almost completely disassociated itself from the League.\n\nIn 1921, the [[Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement]] successfully opened trade relations with Communist Russia. Lloyd George was unable to  negotiate full diplomatic relations, as the Russians rejected all repayment of Tsarist era debts, and conservatives in Britain grew exceedingly wary of  the communist threat to European stability.  Lloyd George in 1922 set about to make himself master of peace in the world, especially through a [[Genoa Conference (1922)|world conference in Genoa]] that he expected would rival Paris of 1919 in visibility, and restore his reputation. Everything went wrong. Poincar\u00e9 and the French demanded a military alliance that was far beyond what the British would accept. Germany and Russia made their own [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|sweeping agreement at Rapallo]], which wrecked the Genoa conference.<ref>Sally Marks, ''The Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe, 1918\u20131933'' (2nd ed. 2003) p. 45.</ref>  Finally, Lloyd George decided to support Greece in a war against Turkey in the [[Chanak Crisis]].

Britain played a leading role in the 1927 [[Geneva Naval Conference]] and the  1930 London Conference that led to the [[London Naval Treaty]]. However the refusal of Japan, Germany, Italy and Russia to go along led to the meaningless [[Second London Naval Treaty]] of 1936.

The flow of money from New York dried up, and the system of reparations and payment of debt collapsed in 1931.  The debts were renegotiated in the 1950s.\n\n===Seeking stability in Europe===\nBritain sought peace with Germany through the Locarno treaties of 1925.

In the early 1930s, most Britons saw France, not Germany,  as the chief threat to peace and harmony in Europe. France did not suffer as severe an economic recession, and was the strongest military power, but still it refused British overtures for disarmament.<ref>Marquand, ''Ramsay MacDonald'' p 716.</ref>\n\nThe Dominions (Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand) achieved virtual independence in foreign policy in 1931, though each depended heavily upon British naval protection.

Britain and France led the policy of non-interference in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339). The [[League of Nations]] proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators.  British policy was to \"appease\" them in the hopes they would be satiated.

By 1930 British leaders and intellectuals largely agreed that all major powers shared the blame for war in 1914, and not Germany alone as the [[Treaty of Versailles]] specified.

He is best known for taking a strong anti-Communist position regarding the emerging Cold War, and encouraging the U.S. to take a more active role as budgetary constraints forced Britain to reduce its role in Greece.<ref>Alan Bullock, ''The life and times of Ernest Bevin: vol 3: Foreign Secretary, 1945\u20131951'' (1983)</ref>  However that was not his original plan. At first he envisioned a European \"third force\", led by Britain and France, to mediate between the two superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In 1945\u201346 he hoped that European integration would also allow establish Britain to be free from US economic domination. In January 1946, however, [[Charles De Gaulle]] retired and Bevin expected some sort of \"imminent Sovietization\" would move France to the left. Furthermore, it became clear that American loans and grants were essential to British solvency.  He now decided  on a friendly collaboration with the U.S. hoping to guide its role in the Cold War. and strongly encouraged Washington to assume Britain's old role of helping the Greek government suppress a Communist rebellion through the [[Truman Doctrine]].<ref>Sean Greenwood,  \"Ernest Bevin, France and 'Western Union': August 1945 \u2013 February 1946.\" ''European History Quarterly'' 14.3 (1984): 319\u2013338.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Melvyn P.

ERP required the recipients to organize as the \"Committee on European Economic Co-operation\". Under Bevin the UK took the lead in coordinating support from the Western European nations that accepted the aid. (Soviet satellites turned the money down.) The British economy has started to recover by 1948\u2014the main goal was not so much rescue or recovery as modernization of the economy.  The Marshall Plan wanted to stimulate long-term economic growth. It required the removal all sorts of economic bottlenecks and restrictions, and called for free trade and low tariffs (a long-time American goal). Britain received $3.2 billion; separately Canada gave an unrestricted $1 billion grant. Repayment was not required.  The grants were used to purchase oil, wheat, meat and other foods exported from the two donor nations. These products were in turn purchased by British consumers for pounds, and the revenue became matching funds used by UK government to modernize its economy. Britain also received large loans from the U.S. that were repaid over six decades at low interest, used to balance the budget.<ref>Rhiannon Vickers and Andrew Gamble, ''Manipulating Hegemony: State Power, Labour and the Marshall Plan in Britain'' (2000)  pp 43\u201346.[https://www.questia.com/library/101528658/manipulating-hegemony-state-power-labour-and-the  online at Questia]</ref>\n\n===NATO===\n{{Main|History of NATO}}\nBritish diplomacy set the stage for [[NATO]].

It committed them to collective defence against any armed attack for fifty years.

The cumulative costs of fighting two world wars, however, placed a heavy burden upon the UK economy, and after 1945 the British Empire gradually began to disintegrate, with many territories demanding independence.  The India region split into India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Burma. By the late 1950s, almost all the colonies were independent.

After the collapse of the Portuguese empire in Africa in 1975, South Africa \u2013 which had been Rhodesia's chief supporter \u2013 realized that country was a liability.

For the current situation since 2000 see [[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom]].\n\nBritain from 1750 to the 1910s took pride in an unmatched economic base; comprising industry, finance, shipping and trade that largely dominated the globe. Foreign policy based on [[free trade]] (after 1840) kept the economy flourishing. The overseas [[British Empire]] recovered after the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in 1776, and reached its zenith about 1920. Foreign policy made sure it was never seriously threatened.\n\nAfter expending enormous energy on the defeat of the [[First French Empire]] and [[Napoleon]] (1793\u20131815), British policy focused on achieving a conservative [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] within Europe, with no one country achieving dominance over the affairs of the continent. This had been the basic reason behind the British wars against Napoleon, and the British commitment in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The chief enemy down to 1815 was [[History of France|France]], with its much larger population base and its powerful army. The British were generally [[British military history|successful in their many wars]], with the notable exception of the [[American War of Independence]] (1775\u20131783). In that war Britain, without any major allies, was defeated by the colonials who had the support of the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], while France had support from [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]].<ref>See Jeremy Black,  \"Could the British Have Won the American War of Independence?.\"  ''Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research.'' (Fall 1996), Vol. 74 Issue 299, pp 145\u2013154. [http://hdl.handle.net/1811/30022 online 90-minute video lecture given at Ohio State in 2006; requires Real Player]</ref>\n\nA favoured diplomatic strategy was subsidising the armies of continental allies, such as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], thereby turning London's enormous financial power to military advantage. Britain relied heavily on its [[History of the Royal Navy|Royal Navy]] for security, seeking to keep it the most powerful fleet afloat with a full complement of bases across the globe. British dominance of the seas was vital to the formation of the British Empire, which was achieved through the maintenance of a Navy larger than the next two largest Navies combined for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, prior to the entry of the United States into World War II. The British controlled the oceans. So powerful was the Royal Navy, it needed to do little actual fighting from 1812 to 1914.  Although all of the other [[great power]]s fought with their neighbours, the [[British Army]] had only one relatively limited war (the [[Crimean War]] against the [[Russian Empire]] in 1854\u201356). The Army mostly handled garrison duty, and did have to deal with localized insurrections and colonial conflicts in Asia and Africa.\n\nFor a capsule guide to the wars, see [[List of conflicts involving the United Kingdom]].\n\n==English foreign policy before 1700==\nIn 1500 England had only a modest population (3.8 million) compared to its much larger rivals of France (15 million), Spain (6.5 million), and the Holy Roman Empire (17 million). It was three times larger than its naval rival, the Netherlands, and eight times larger than Scotland.<ref>Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones, ''Atlas of world population history'' (Penguin, 1978) pp. 43, 47, 57, 65,71, 101</ref>  The limited budget, limited ambitions on the continent, avoidance of alliances, and the protection afforded by the English Channel from foreign invasion combined to make foreign affairs less pressing for the British government before 1688. Elite elements paid little attention to Continental affairs before the 1660s, and there was little clamour to enter the [[Thirty Years War]] of 1618\u201348. Historian [[Lawrence Stone]] says England \"was no more than a marginal player in the European power game.\" The increasingly powerful Royal Navy attracted admiration, but London used it to support its growing overseas empire.<ref>Steven C. A. Pincus, ''Protestantism and Patriotism: Ideologies and the Making of English Foreign Policy, 1650\u20131668'' (1996) pp 1\u20137, quote p 1.</ref>\n\n===Tudor foreign policy===\n[[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] (reigned 1485\u20131509) founded the Tudor dynasty that lasted to 1603, and concentrated on establishing peace in England, especially against the threatened rebellions by the newly defeated House of York. Foreign affairs apart from Scotland were not a high priority.  Scotland was an independent country, and peace was agreed to in 1497.  Much of his diplomacy involved treaties for marriages with ruling houses in Europe. He married his eldest daughter [[Margaret Tudor]] to King [[James IV of Scotland]] in 1503. The match did not guarantee peace in the short run but did so in the long run: in 1603 [[James VI and I]], the grandson of the marriage, united the two kingdoms under his rule.  Henry tried to marry [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|his daughter Mary]]  to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|the man who later became Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], but that fell through.  Henry VIII finally married her to King [[Louis XII of France]] as part of a peace treaty in 1514; Louis died after three months and Henry demanded and got most of her dowry back.  The other main diplomatic success of Henry VII was an alliance with Spain, sealed by the marriage in 1501 of his heir Arthur, Prince of Wales, to [[Catherine of Aragon]], Spain's infanta (eldest daughter of the Spanish king). When his Queen died in 1503, Henry VII searched the European marriage market for a diplomatic marriage with a large dowry for himself, but was unable to find a match.<ref>P.S. Crowson ''Tudor Foreign Policy'' (1973) ch 1\u20132.</ref>\n\nArthur died in 1502 and the second son married the widow in 1509, just after he became king as Henry VIII,\n\n====Henry VIII====\n[[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]  (reigned 1509\u20131547) was one of the most flamboyant and famous of all English monarchs. In military terms, he paid special attention to expanding the English Navy, to protect the rapidly expanding merchant fleet.  He also commissioned privateers from the merchant fleets to act as auxiliary [[warship]]s that captured and resold enemy merchant ships.  Some of his foreign and religious policy revolved around annulling his marriage to Catherine in 1533 despite the opposition of the pope\u2014his solution was to remove the Church of England from the pope's authority, thereby launching the [[English Reformation]].<ref>R.B. Wernham, ''Before the Armada: the growth of English foreign policy, 1485\u20131588'' (1966) pp. 111\u201335.</ref>\n\nIn 1510, France, with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the [[League of Cambrai]], was winning a war against Venice. Henry renewed his father's friendship with [[Louis XII of France]], and signed a pact with King Ferdinand of Spain. After [[Pope Julius II]] created the anti-French [[League of Cambrai#Holy League|Holy League]] in October 1511, Henry followed Spain's lead and brought England into the new League.  An initial joint Anglo-Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover [[Aquitaine]] for England, the start of making Henry's dreams of ruling France a reality. The attack failed and it strained the Anglo-Spanish alliance. Nevertheless, the French were pushed out of Italy soon after, and the alliance survived, with both parties keen to win further victories over the French.<ref>J.J. Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' (1958) pp 27\u201334.</ref>\n[[File:Henry VIII with Charles Quint and Pope Leon X circa 1520.jpg|thumb|left|Henry with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (right) and [[Pope Leo X]] (centre), c. 1520]]\n\nOn 30 June 1513, Henry invaded France, and his troops defeated a French army at the [[Battle of the Spurs]] \u2013 a relatively minor result, but one which was seized on by the English for propaganda purposes. Soon after, the English took [[Th\u00e9rouanne]] and handed it over to Maximillian; [[Tournai]], a more significant settlement, followed. Henry had led the army personally, complete with large entourage.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'',  pp 35\u201356.</ref> \nHis absence from the country, however, had prompted [[James IV of Scotland]], to invade England at the behest of Louis.  The English army, overseen by Queen Catherine, decisively defeated the Scots at the [[Battle of Flodden]] on 9 September 1513, in which James IV and many senior Scottish nobles died.<ref>R.L. Mackie, ''King James IV of Scotland: A brief survey of his life and times'' (1976). [https://www.questia.com/library/1455301/king-james-iv-of-scotland-a-brief-survey-of-his-life online]</ref>\n\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] ascended the thrones of both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire following the deaths of his grandfathers, Ferdinand in 1516 and Maximilian in 1519. [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] likewise became king of France upon the death of Louis in 1515, leaving three relatively young rulers and an opportunity for a clean slate. The careful diplomacy of [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]] had resulted in the [[Treaty of London (1518)|Treaty of London]] in 1518, an early non-aggression pact among the major kingdoms of western Europe.<ref>Garrett Mattingly , \"An Early Nonaggression Pact,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 10#1 (1938): 1\u201330. [https://doi.org/10.1086/243493 online]</ref>   In a significant follow-up, Henry met Francis I on 7 June 1520 at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] near [[Calais]] for a fortnight of lavish and extremely expensive entertainment.\nThe hope that warfare was past proved futile. Charles brought his Holy Roman Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France, but also sought to secure an alliance with [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]], then part of Charles' realm, and the continued support of Charles.  Charles [[Battle of Pavia|defeated and captured Francis at Pavia]] and could dictate peace; but he believed he owed Henry nothing. Henry had repeatedly raised taxes to pay for his foreign operations until upscale passive resistance in 1525 forced the ending of the newest tax known as the \"[[Amicable Grant]].\"<ref>G.W. Bernard, ''War, Taxation, and Rebellion in Early Tudor England: Henry VIII, Wolsey, and the Amicable Grant of 1525'' (1986).</ref>  Lack of money ended Henry's plans for an invasion of France and he took England out of the war with the [[Treaty of the More]] on 30 August 1525.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'', pp 135\u201342.</ref>\n\n====New World====\nJust five years after Columbus, in 1497 Henry VII commissioned the Italian mariner [[John Cabot]] who had settled in England, to explore the New World.  Cabot was the first European since the Norsemen to reach parts of what is now Canada, exploring from Newfoundland to as far south as Delaware. He found no gold or spices and the king lost interest.  Colonization was not a high priority for the Tudors, who were much more interested in raiding the Spanish treasure ships than in acquiring their own colonies.<ref>J. A. Williamson, ''The voyages of the Cabots and the English discovery of North America under Henry VII and Henry VIII'' (1929).</ref><\n\n====Conflict with Spain, 1568-1604====\n====Treasure crisis of 1568====\nThe \"Treasure crisis\" of 1568 was Queen Elizabeth's seizure of gold from Spanish ships in English ports in November 1568. Chased by privateers in the English channel, five small Spanish ships carrying gold and silver worth 400,000 florins (\u00a385,000) sought shelter in English harbors at Plymouth and Southampton. The English government headed by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] gave permission. The money was bound for the Netherlands as payment for Spanish soldiers who were fighting rebels there. Queen Elizabeth discovered that the gold was not owned by Spain, but was still owned by Italian bankers.  She decided to seize it, and treated as a loan from the Italian bankers to England.  The bankers agree to her terms, so Elizabeth had the money and she eventually repaid the bankers.  Spain reacted furiously, and seized English property in the Netherlands and Spain.  England reacted by seizing Spanish ships and properties in England.  Spain reacted by imposing an embargo preventing all English imports into the Netherlands. The bitter diplomatic standoff lasted for four years.<ref>Wallace T. MacCaffrey, ''The Shaping of the Elizabethan Regime'' (1968) pp 271\u201390.</ref> However neither side wanted war. In 1573, the [[Convention of Nymegen]] was a treaty where England promised to end support for raids on Spanish shipping by English privateers such as [[Francis Drake]] and [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]]. It was finalized in the Convention of Bristol in August, 1574 in which both sides paid for what they had seized. Trade resumed between England and Spain and relations improved.<ref>John Wagner, ed. ''Historical Dictionary of the Elizabethan World: Britain, Ireland, Europe and America'' (1999) pp 39, 216, 307\u20138.</ref>\n\n===== Armada =====\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)}}\nThe Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604) arose largely from religious differences; the execution of Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in 1587 outraged Spain.  War was never formally declared. Spain was militarily and financially much more powerful, and promoted a Catholic interest in opposition to England's Protestantism. The conflict saw widely separated battles, and began with England's military expedition in 1585 to the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (modern-day Belgium) in support of the resistance of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] to [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] rule.<ref>Charles Beem, ''The Foreign Relations of Elizabeth I'' (2011)</ref>  The English enjoyed a modest victory by \"[[Singeing the King of Spain's Beard]]\" in 1587 at C\u00e1diz, the main port in Spain.  The raid led by [[Francis Drake]] destroyed numerous merchant ships and captured some treasure.  The great English triumph was the decisive defeat of the Spanish invasion attempt by the ill-fated [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.<ref>Garrett Mattingly, ''[[The Armada (book)|The Armada'' (1959)]] is a famous narrative; recent scholarship is reviewed in Colin Martin and Geoffrey Parker, eds., ''The Spanish Armada'' (2nd ed. 1999).</ref> After Elizabeth died in 1603, the new king made peace a high priority and ended the long-simmering conflict in 1604.<ref>Susan Doran, ''Elizabeth I and Foreign policy, 1558\u20131603'' (Routledge, 2002).</ref>\n\n===Stuart foreign policy===\nBy 1600 the conflict with Spain became deadlocked during campaigns in [[Brittany]] and [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Ireland]].  James I, the new king of England made peace with the new King of Spain, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] with the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London in 1604]]. They agreed to cease their military interventions in the Spanish Netherlands and Ireland, respectively, and the English ended high seas [[privateering]] against Spanish merchant ships. [[James VI and I|King James I]] (reigned 1603\u201325)  was sincerely devoted to peace, not just for his three kingdoms, but for Europe as a whole.<ref>Roger Lockyer, ''James VI and I'' (1998) pp 138\u201358.</ref>   He disliked Puritans and Jesuits alike, because of their eagerness for warfare. He called himself \"Rex Pacificus\" (\"King of peace.\")<ref>Malcolm Smuts, \"The making of ''Rex Pacificus'': James VI and I and the Problem of Peace in an Age of Religious War,\" in Daniel Fischlin and Mark Fortier, eds., ''Royal Subjects: Essays on the Writings of James VI and I'' (2002) pp 371\u201387</ref>   Europe was deeply polarized, and on the verge of the massive [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), with the smaller established Protestant states facing the aggression of the larger Catholic empires.  On assuming the throne, James made peace with Catholic Spain, and made it his policy to marry his son to the Spanish Infanta (princess) in the \"[[Spanish Match]]\". The marriage of James' daughter Princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] to [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] on 14 February 1613 was more than the social event of the era; the couple's union had important political and military implications.  Across Europe, the German princes were banding together in the Union of German Protestant Princes, headquartered in Heidelberg, the capital of the Palatine.  King James calculated that his daughter's marriage would give him diplomatic leverage among the Protestants. He thus planned to have a foot in both camps and be able to broker peaceful settlements.  In his na\u00efvet\u00e9, he did not realize that both sides were playing him as a tool for their own goal of achieving destroying the other side. Spain's ambassador [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|Count Gondomar]] knew how to manipulate the king. The Catholics in Spain, as well as the Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], the Vienna-based leader of the Habsburgs and head of the Holy Roman Empire, were both heavily influenced by the Catholic counter-Reformation.  They had the goal of expelling Protestantism from their domains.<ref>W. B. Patterson, \"King James I and the Protestant cause in the crisis of 1618\u201322.\" ''Studies in Church History'' 18 (1982): 319\u2013334.</ref>\n\n[[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Lord Buckingham]] (1592\u20131628), who increasingly was the actual ruler of Britain, wanted an alliance with Spain.  Buckingham took Charles with him to Spain to woo the Infanta in 1623.  However, Spain's terms were that James must drop Britain's anti-Catholic intolerance or no marriage.  Buckingham and Charles were humiliated and Buckingham became the leader of the widespread British demand for a war against Spain.  Meanwhile, the Protestant princes looked to Britain, since it was the strongest of all the Protestant countries, to give military support for their cause.  His son-in-law and daughter became king and queen of Bohemia, which outraged Vienna.  The Thirty Years\u2019 War began, as the Habsburg Emperor ousted the new king and queen of Bohemia, and massacred their followers.  Catholic Bavaria then invaded the Palatine, and James's son-in-law begged for James's military intervention.  James finally realized his policies had backfired and refused these pleas.  He successfully kept Britain out of the European-wide war that proved so heavily devastating for three decades.  James's backup plan was to marry his son Charles to a French Catholic princess, who would bring a handsome dowry.

William's goal was to build coalitions against the powerful French monarchy, protect the autonomy of the Netherlands (where William continued in power) and to keep the Spanish Netherlands (present-date Belgium) out of French hands.

Jones states that King William was given:\n:supreme command within the alliance throughout the Nine Years war.  His experience and knowledge of European affairs made him the indispensable director of Allied diplomatic and military strategy, and he derived additional authority from his enhanced status as king of England \u2013 even the Emperor Leopold...recognized his leadership.  William's English subjects played subordinate or even minor roles in diplomatic and military affairs, having a major share only in the direction of the war at sea.  Parliament and the nation had to provide money, men and ships, and William had found it expedient to explain his intentions...but this did not mean that Parliament or even ministers assisted in the formulation of policy.<ref>J.R. Jones, ''Britain and the World, 1649\u20131815'' (1980) p. 157.</ref>\n\nEngland and France were at war almost continuously until 1713, with a short interlude 1697\u20131701 made possible by the [[Treaty of Ryswick]].<ref>Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714'' (1956)  pp 160\u201379.</ref>  The combined English and Dutch fleets could overpower France in a far-flung naval war, but France still had superiority on land. William wanted to neutralize that advantage by allying with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], the Habsburg Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (1658\u20131705), who was based in Vienna, Austria.  Leopold, however, Was tied down in [[Great Turkish War|war with the Ottoman Empire]] on his eastern frontiers; William worked to achieve a negotiated settlement between the Ottomans and the Empire. William displayed in imaginative Europe-wide strategy, but Louis always managed to come up with a counter play.<ref>For the European context, see J.S. Bromley, ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History, VI: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia, 1688\u20131725'' (1970) pp 154\u2013192, 223\u201367, 284\u201390, 381\u2013415, 741\u201354.</ref>\n\nWilliam was usually supported by the English leadership, which saw France as its greatest enemy. But eventually the expenses, and war weariness, caused second thoughts.  At first, Parliament voted him the funds for his expensive wars, and for his subsidies to smaller allies. Private investors created the [[Bank of England]] in 1694; it provided a sound system that made financing wars much easier by encouraging bankers to loan money.<ref>John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: War, money, and the English state, 1688\u20131783'' (1989) p 133.</ref><ref>Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714'' (1956)  pp 174\u201379.</ref>\n\nIn the long-running [[Nine Years' War]] (1688\u201397) his main strategy was to form a military alliance of England, the Netherlands, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and some smaller states, to attack France at sea, and from land in different directions, while defending the Netherlands.  Louis XIV tried to undermine this strategy by refusing to recognize William as king of England, and by giving diplomatic, military and financial support to a series of pretenders to the English throne, all based in France. William focused most of his attention on foreign policy and foreign wars, spending a great deal of time in the Netherlands (where he continued to hold the dominant political office).  His closest foreign-policy advisers were Dutch, most notably [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland]]; they shared little information with their English counterparts.<ref>David Onnekink, \"\u2018Mynheer Benting now rules over us\u2019: the 1st Earl of Portland and the Re-emergence of the English Favourite, 1689\u201399.\" ''English Historical Review'' 121.492 (2006): 693\u2013713. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3806356 online]</ref>  The net result was that the Netherlands remained independent, and France never took control of the Spanish Netherlands. The wars were very expensive to both sides but inconclusive.  William died just as the continuation war, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], (1702\u20131714), was beginning. It was fought out during the reign of Queen Anne, and ended in a draw.<ref>For summaries of foreign policy see J.R.

Diplomats were poorly selected, poorly funded, and non-professional. The main posts were Paris and The Hague, but the diplomats sent there were more clever in dealing with London politics than they were with diplomatic affairs.  King William III handle foreign policy himself, using Dutch diplomats whenever possible. After 1700, Britain built up the quantity of its diplomatic service in the major capitals, without much attention to quality. Vienna and Berlin were upgraded, but even they were ignored for years at a time. By the 1790s, British diplomats had learned a great deal by closely watching their French rivals; aristocratic exiles from Paris began helping out as well.  For the first time in the French wars, Britain set up an underground intelligence service that was in contact with local dissidents, and helped shape their protests.<ref>Elizabeth Sparrow, \"Secret Service under Pitt's Administrations, 1792\u20131806.\" ''History'' 83.270 (1998): 280\u2013294.</ref> [[William Pitt the Younger]], the Prime Minister during much of the [[French Revolution| French Revolutionary period]], was saddled with the largely incompetent Foreign Secretary, [[Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds]], from 1783 to 1791.

Great Britain and Prussia were the winners. They fought France, Austria, Spain and Russia\u2014nearly all of the other important powers except the Ottoman Empire). The Royal Navy played a major role, and the army and the Treasury played important roles. The war appeared to be a disaster for Prussia, until its fortunes reversed at the last second.  Britain swept up much of the overseas French Empire in North America and India. The financing of war was a critical issue, which Britain handled well, and France handled poorly, leaving itself so deep in debt. That it never fully recovered. [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]]  (1708\u201378) energized the British leadership, and used effective diplomacy and military strategy to achieve his victory.  Britain used the manpower from its American colonies effectively in cooperation with its regulars and its Navy to overwhelm the much less populous French colonial empire in what is now Canada. From a small spark in 1754 in the distant wilderness (near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), the fighting spread to Europe. 1759, was the \"[[annus mirabilis]]\" (\"miraculous year\"), with victory after victory.

Denmark and Sweden agreed with Russia and the three countries signed the agreement forming the League.

It maintained a relatively large and expensive [[Royal Navy]], along with a small standing army. When the need arose for soldiers it hired mercenaries or financed allies who fielded armies. The rising costs of warfare forced a shift in government financing from the income from royal agricultural estates and special imposts and taxes to reliance on customs and excise taxes and, after 1790, an income tax.<ref>John Brewer, ''The Sinews of Power: War, Money and the English State, 1688\u20131783'' (1990)</ref> Working with bankers in the City, the government raised large loans during wartime and paid them off in peacetime.

The British were increasingly angered by Napoleon's reordering of the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. [[Frederick Kagan]] argues that Britain was especially alarmed by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. Britons felt insulted when Napoleon said it deserved no voice in European affairs (even though King George was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire), and ought to restrict the London newspapers that were vilifying him.<ref>Frederick Kagan, ''The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801\u20131805'' (2007) pp 42\u201343</ref>\n\nBritain had a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon's possible threat to its overseas colonies. [[Frank McLynn]] argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a \"mixture of economic motives and national neuroses \u2013 an irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.\"  McLynn concludes that in the long run it proved to be the right choice for Britain, because in the long run Napoleon's intentions were hostile to the British national interest.  Napoleon was not ready for war and so this was the best time for Britain to stop them. Britain seized upon the Malta issue, refusing to follow the terms of the Treaty of Amiens and evacuate the island.<ref>Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014) p 309</ref>\n\nThe deeper British grievance was their perception that Napoleon was taking personal control of Europe, making the international system unstable, and forcing Britain to the sidelines.<ref>John D.

M. Trevelyan]] argues that British diplomacy under Lord Castlereagh played a decisive role:\n:In 1813 and 1814 Castlereagh played the part that William III and Marlborough had played more than a hundred years before, in holding together an alliance of jealous, selfish, weak-kneed states and princes, by a vigour or character and singleness of purpose that held Metternich, the Czar and the King of Prussia on the common track until the goal was reached. It is quite possible that, but for the lead taken by Castlereagh in the allied counsels, France would never have been reduced to her ancient limits, nor Napoleon dethroned.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Macaulay Trevelyan|title=British History in the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCLPc07CzgwC&pg=PA133|year=1923|page=133}}</ref>\n\n* 1803: [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815) against France<ref>See Arthur Bryant, ''Years of Victory, 1802\u20131812'' (1944) for British perspective</ref>\n*1803\u201306: [[War of the Third Coalition]]: Napoleon terminates the Holy Roman Empire.\n* 1803: By the Anglo-Russian agreement, Britain pays a subsidy of \u20a41.5 million pounds for every 100,000 Russian soldiers in the field.

As foreign secretary (1830-4, 1835\u201341 and 1846\u201351) and subsequently as prime minister, Palmerston sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe, sometimes opposing France and at other times aligning with France to do so.<ref>Roman Golicz,  \"Napoleon III, Lord Palmerston and the Entente Cordiale.\" ''History Today'' 50#12 (2000): 10\u201317 online.</ref><ref>David Brown, \"Palmerston and Anglo\u2013French Relations, 1846\u20131865.\" ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 17.4 (2006): 675\u2013692</ref> Thus he was aligned with France in the [[Crimean War]] against Russia, fought and won with the limited goal of protecting the Ottoman Empire. Some of his aggressive actions, now sometimes termed [[Interventionism (politics)|liberal interventionist]], were highly controversial at the time, and remain so today. For example, he used military force to achieve his main goal of opening China to trade, although his critics focused on his support for the opium trade.<ref>{{cite book|author=Glenn Melancon|title=Britain's China Policy and the Opium Crisis: Balancing Drugs, Violence and National Honour, 1833\u20131840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V527VTyT29gC&pg=PA126|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate |isbn=9780754607045}}</ref> In all his actions Palmerston brought to bear a great deal of patriotic vigour and energy.

In 1813-1814 as ambassador to the Austrian Empire he negotiated the alliances and financing that led to the defeat of Napoleon.

He worked well with top European diplomats such as his friends [[Klemens von Metternich]] in Vienna  and [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] in Paris. He brought Britain into the center of Continental diplomacy on critical issues, such as the local wars in Greece, Portugal and Belgium.

Disraeli's second term (1874\u20131880) was dominated by the [[Eastern Question]]\u2014the slow decay of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the desire of other European powers, such as Russia, to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the [[Suez Canal Company]] (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt).

The region was gravely devastated by the wars of independence, and with weak financial systems, weak governments and repeated coups and internal rebellions. However, the region had a well-developed export sector focused on the foods that were in demand in Europe, especially sugar, coffee, wheat and (after the arrival of refrigeration in the 1860s), beef. There also was a well-developed mining sector. With the Spanish out of the picture, the region in the early 1820s was a devastated region suffering in a deep depression. It urgently needed capital, entrepreneurs, financiers, and shippers. Britain rushed in to fill the void by the middle 1820s, as the London government use its diplomatic power to encourage large-scale investment. The Royal Navy provided protection against piracy. The British established communities of merchants in major cities\u2014including 3000 Britons in Buenos Aires.<ref>R.A.

By 1875, Latin America was firmly integrated into transatlantic economy under British leadership.

Britain deliberately sought to replace the Spanish in economic and cultural affairs.  Military issues and colonization were minor factors. The influence was exerted through diplomacy, trade, banking, and investment in railways and mines. The English language and British cultural norms were transmitted by energetic young British business agents on temporary assignment in the major commercial centers, where they invited locals into the British leisure activities, such as organized sports, and into their transplanted cultural institutions such as clubs and schools.<ref>Alina Silveira,  \"Educating a City's Children: British Immigrants and Primary Education in Buenos Aires (1820\u20131880).\" ''The Americas'' 70#1 (2013): 33\u201362.</ref> The impact on sports was overwhelming, as Latin America enthusiastically took up football (soccer).

British leaders were constantly annoyed from the 1840s to the 1860s by what they saw as Washington's pandering to the democratic mob, as in [[Oregon boundary dispute]] in 1844\u201346. However British middle class public opinion sensed a common \"[[Special Relationship]]\" between the two peoples based on language, migration, evangelical Protestantism, liberal traditions, and extensive trade. This constituency rejected war, forcing London to appease the Americans. During the [[Trent affair]] of late 1861, London drew the line and Washington retreated.<ref>George L. Bernstein, \"Special Relationship and Appeasement: Liberal policy towards America in the age of Palmerston.\" ''Historical Journal'' 41#3 (1998): 725\u2013750.</ref>\n\nBritish public opinion was divided on the American Civil War. The Confederacy tended to have support from the elites\u2014from the aristocracy and gentry, which identified with the landed plantation owners, and from Anglican clergy and some professionals who admired tradition, hierarchy and paternalism. The Union was favored by the middle classes, the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]] in religion, intellectuals, reformers and most factory workers, who saw slavery and forced labor as a threat to the status of the workingman.  The cabinet made the decisions. Chancellor of the Exchequer [[William E Gladstone]], whose family fortune was based on slavery in the West Indies before 1833, supported the Confederacy. Foreign Minister [[Earl Russell|Lord Russell]] wanted neutrality. Prime Minister [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] wavered between support for national independence, his opposition to slavery, and the strong economic advantages of Britain remaining neutral.<ref>A.G. Hopkins American Empire: a Global history (Princeton UP,  2018) pp 231\u201333.</ref>\n\nBritain supplied warships and blockade runners to the Confederacy, but had a large scale trade with the United States and many British men volunteered to fight for the North. Northern food supplies were much more essential to Britain than Southern cotton.<ref>Howard Jones, ''Blue & Gray Diplomacy: A History of Union and Confederate Foreign Relations'' (2010).</ref> After the war, the US demanded reparations (called the [[Alabama Claims]]) for the damages caused by the warships.

Three British leaders played major roles. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] in the 1830\u201365 era considered the Ottoman Empire an essential component in the balance of power, was the most favourable toward Constantinople. [[William Gladstone]] in the 1870s sought to build a Concert of Europe that would support the survival of the empire. In the 1880s and 1890s [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] contemplated an orderly dismemberment of it, in such a way as to reduce rivalry between the greater powers.<ref>David Steele, \"Three British Prime Ministers and the Survival of the Ottoman Empire, 1855\u20131902.\" ''Middle Eastern Studies'' 50.1 (2014): 43\u201360.</ref>\n\n====Crimean War 1854\u201356====\n{{main|Crimean War}}\nThe '''Crimean War''' (1854\u201356) was fought between Russia on the one hand and an alliance of Britain, France, Sardinia, and the Ottoman Empire on the other.

The churches quickly settled that problem, but it escalated out of hand has Russia put continuous pressure on the Ottomans. Diplomatic efforts failed. The Sultan declared war against Russia in October 1851. Following an Ottoman naval disaster in November, Britain and France declared war against Russia.<ref>Kingsley Martin,  ''The triumph of Lord Palmerston: a study of public opinion in England before the Crimean War'' (Hutchinson, 1963).

Most of the battles took place in the Crimean peninsula, which the Allies finally seized. London, shocked to discover that France was secretly negotiating with Russia to form a postwar alliance to dominate Europe, dropped its plans to attack St. Petersburg and instead signed a one-sided armistice with Russia that achieved almost none of its war aims. \n[[File:Edouard Dubufe Congr\u00e8s de Paris.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Diplomats at the Congress of Paris, 1856, settled the Crimean War; painting by [[Edouard Louis Dubufe]].]]\n\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] signed March 30, 1856, ended the war. Russia gave up a little land and relinquished its claim to a protectorate over the Christians in the Ottoman domains. The Black Sea was demilitarized, and an international commission was set up to guarantee freedom of commerce and navigation on the Danube River. Moldavia and Wallachia remained under nominal Ottoman rule, but would be granted independent constitutions and national assemblies. However, by 1870, the Russians had regained most of their concessions.<ref>Harold Temperley, \"The Treaty of Paris of 1856 and Its Execution,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (1932) 4#3 pp. 387\u2013414 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1871004 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe war helped modernize warfare by introducing major new technologies such as railways, the telegraph, and modern nursing methods. In the long run the war marked a turning point in Russian domestic and foreign policy. Russian intellectuals used the defeat to demand fundamental reform of the government and social system. The war weakened both Russia and Austria, so they could no longer promote stability. This opened the way for [[Napoleon III]], [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]] (in Italy) and [[Otto von Bismarck]] (in Germany) to launch a series of wars in the 1860s that reshaped Europe.<ref>Stephen J.

The losses were reported in detail in the media and caused revulsion against warfare in Britain, combined with a celebration of the heroic common soldier who demonstrated Christian virtue. The great heroine was [[Florence Nightingale]], whose was hailed for her devotion to caring for the wounded and her emphasis on middle-class efficiency. She typified a moral status as a nurse that was superior to aristocratic militarism in terms of both morality and efficiency.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'' (2011) esp. pp 467\u201380.</ref>\n\nHistorian [[R. B. McCallum]] points out the war was enthusiastically supported by the British populace as it was happening, but the mood changed very dramatically afterwards. Pacifists and critics were unpopular but:\n:in the end they won. [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]] and [[John Bright|Bright]] were true to their principles of foreign policy, which laid down the absolute minimum of intervention in European affairs and a deep moral reprobation of war....When the first enthusiasm was passed, when the dead were mourned, the sufferings revealed, and the cost counted, when in 1870 Russia was able calmly to secure the revocation of the Treaty, which disarmed her in the Black Sea, the view became general of the war was stupid and unnecessary, and effected nothing....The Crimean war remained as a classic example...of how governments may plunge into war, how [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe|strong ambassadors]] may mislead [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|weak prime ministers]], how the public may be worked up into a facile fury, and how the achievements of the war may crumble to nothing. The Bright-Cobden criticism of the war was remembered and to a large extent accepted [especially by the Liberal Party]. Isolation from European entanglements seemed more than ever desirable.<ref>R.B.

In 1914, Britain went to war with the Ottomans and ended their nominal role.  Historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] says that the seizure, which lasted seven decades, \"was a great event; indeed, the only real event in international relations between the Battle of Sedan and the defeat of Russia and the Russo-Japanese war.\"<ref>He adds, \"All the rest were maneuvers which left the combatants at the close of the day exactly where they had started.

The \"[[Special Relationship]]\" with the United States starting about 1898 allowed Britain to largely relocate its naval forces out of the Western Hemisphere.<ref>Duncan Campbell, ''Unlikely Allies: Britain, America and the Victorian Origins of the Special Relationship'' (2007).</ref>\n\nGermany's Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] dominated European diplomacy 1872\u20131890, with the determination to use the balance of power to keep the peace.  There were no wars.  However he was removed by an aggressive young Kaiser in 1890, allowing French efforts to isolate Germany to become successful. With the formation of the [[Triple Entente]], Germany began to feel encircled. [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who played a major role in foreign policy in the late 1890s under the Salisbury government, repeatedly tried to open talks with Germany about some sort of an alliance.  Germany was not interested.<ref>H.W.

Key markers were the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894, the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] linking France and Great Britain, and finally the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907 which became the [[Triple Entente]]. France thus had a formal alliance with Russia, and an informal alignment with Britain, against Germany and Austria.<ref>G.P.

After 1905, foreign policy was tightly controlled by the Liberal foreign minister [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] (1862\u20131933), who seldom consulted the Cabinet. Grey shared the strong Liberal policy against all wars and against military alliances that would force Britain to take a side in war. However, in the case of the Boer War, Grey held that the Boers had committed an aggression that it was necessary to repulse. The Liberal party split on the issue, with a large faction strongly opposed to the war in Africa<ref>Keith Robbins, \"Grey, Edward, Viscount Grey of Fallodon (1862\u20131933)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2004; online edition, 2011) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33570, accessed 5 Nov 2017]</ref><ref>Denis Judd and Keith Surridge, ''The Boer War: A History'' (2nd ed. 2013),</ref>\n\nThe Triple Entente between Britain, France and Russia is often compared to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] between Germany, Austria\u2013Hungary and Italy, but historians caution against the comparison. The Entente, in contrast to the Triple Alliance or the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], was not an alliance of mutual defence and Britain therefore felt free to make her own foreign policy decisions in 1914. The Liberals were highly moralistic, and by 1914 they have been increasingly convinced that German aggression violated international norms, and specifically that its invasion of neutral Belgium was completely unacceptable in terms of morality, and in terms of British policy against any one power control and the continent of Europe.<ref>K.A.

Tirpitz turned the modest little fleet into a world-class force that could threaten the British Royal Navy. The British responded with new technology typified by the [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|Dreadnought revolution]]. It made every battleship obsolete and, supplemented by the global network of coaling stations and telegraph cables, enabled Britain to stay well in the lead in naval affairs.<ref>Margaret Macmillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914'' (2013) ch 5</ref><ref>Thomas Hoerber, \"Prevail or perish: Anglo-German naval competition at the beginning of the twentieth century,\" ''European Security'' (2011) 20#1, pp. 65\u201379.

It tried to stay on friendly relations with the United States, which sold large quantities of raw materials and food, and provided large-scale loans. Germany was so convinced that the United States as a neutral was playing a decisive role, that it began unrestricted submarine warfare against the United States, which it new it would lead to war in April 1917.

Everything went wrong.<ref>Inbal Rose, ''Conservatism and foreign policy during the Lloyd George coalition 1918\u20131922'' (Routledge, 2014).</ref>  The League of Nations, off to a slow start, was a huge let down from utopian dreams.  The Treaty of Versailles had set up a series of temporary organizations, composed of delegations from key powers, to ensure the successful application of the Treaty. The system worked very poorly. The assembly of ambassadors was repeatedly overruled and became a nonentity. Most of the commissions were deeply divided and unable to either make decisions or convince the interested parties to carry them out. The most important commission was on Reparations, and France took full control of it. The new French prime minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] was intensely anti-German, was unrelenting in his demands for huge reparations, and was repeatedly challenged by Germany. France finally invaded parts of Germany, and Berlin responded by imposing a runaway inflation that seriously damage the German economy and also damaged the French economy.   The United States, after refusing to ratify the League in 1920, almost completely disassociated itself from the League.\n\nIn 1921, the [[Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement]] successfully opened trade relations with Communist Russia. Lloyd George was unable to  negotiate full diplomatic relations, as the Russians rejected all repayment of Tsarist era debts, and conservatives in Britain grew exceedingly wary of  the communist threat to European stability.  Lloyd George in 1922 set about to make himself master of peace in the world, especially through a [[Genoa Conference (1922)|world conference in Genoa]] that he expected would rival Paris of 1919 in visibility, and restore his reputation. Everything went wrong. Poincar\u00e9 and the French demanded a military alliance that was far beyond what the British would accept. Germany and Russia made their own [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|sweeping agreement at Rapallo]], which wrecked the Genoa conference.<ref>Sally Marks, ''The Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe, 1918\u20131933'' (2nd ed. 2003) p. 45.</ref>  Finally, Lloyd George decided to support Greece in a war against Turkey in the [[Chanak Crisis]]. It was yet another fiasco as all but two of the Dominions refused support and the British military was hesitant.

Britain played a leading role in the 1927 [[Geneva Naval Conference]] and the  1930 London Conference that led to the [[London Naval Treaty]]. However the refusal of Japan, Germany, Italy and Russia to go along led to the meaningless [[Second London Naval Treaty]] of 1936.  Disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany.<ref>Raymond G.

Britain move toward imperial preference, which meant low tariffs among the Commonwealth of Nations, and higher barriers toward trade with outside countries.  The flow of money from New York dried up, and the system of reparations and payment of debt collapsed in 1931.  The debts were renegotiated in the 1950s.\n\n===Seeking stability in Europe===\nBritain sought peace with Germany through the Locarno treaties of 1925. A main goal was to restore Germany to a peaceful, prosperous state.<ref>Frank Magee, \"Limited Liability? Britain and the Treaty of Locarno\", ''Twentieth Century British History,'' (1995) 6#1, pp. 1\u201322.</ref>\n\nThe success at Locarno in handling the German question impelled Foreign Secretary [[Austen Chamberlain]], working with France and Italy, to find a master solution to the diplomatic problems of Eastern Europe and the Balkans.

In the early 1930s, most Britons saw France, not Germany,  as the chief threat to peace and harmony in Europe. France did not suffer as severe an economic recession, and was the strongest military power, but still it refused British overtures for disarmament.<ref>Marquand, ''Ramsay MacDonald'' p 716.</ref>\n\nThe Dominions (Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand) achieved virtual independence in foreign policy in 1931, though each depended heavily upon British naval protection.

Britain and France led the policy of non-interference in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339). The [[League of Nations]] proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators.  British policy was to \"appease\" them in the hopes they would be satiated.  League-authorized sanctions against Italy for its invasion of Ethiopia had support in Britain but proved a failure and were dropped in 1936.<ref>James C.

By 1930 British leaders and intellectuals largely agreed that all major powers shared the blame for war in 1914, and not Germany alone as the [[Treaty of Versailles]] specified. Therefore, they believed the punitive harshness of the Treaty of Versailles was unwarranted, and this view, adopted by politicians and the public, was largely responsible for supporting appeasement policies down to 1938. That is, German rejections of treaty provisions seemed justified.<ref>Catherine Ann Cline, \"British Historians and the Treaty of Versailles.\" ''Albion'' 20#1 (1988): 43\u201358.</ref>\n\n===Coming of Second World War===\n{{Further|Causes of World War II|Diplomatic history of World War II}}\nBy late 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military.

The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed the border regions of Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>[[David Faber (politician)|David Faber]], ''Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II'' (2010)</ref> Hitler was not satiated and, in March 1939, seized all of Czechoslovakia and menaced Poland.

In 1945\u201346 he hoped that European integration would also allow establish Britain to be free from US economic domination. In January 1946, however, [[Charles De Gaulle]] retired and Bevin expected some sort of \"imminent Sovietization\" would move France to the left. Furthermore it became clear that American loans and grants were essential to British solvency.  He now decided  on a friendly collaboration with the U.S. hoping to guide its role in the Cold War. and strongly encouraged Washington to assume Britain's old role of helping the Greek government suppress a Communist rebellion through the [[Truman Doctrine]].<ref>Sean Greenwood,  \"Ernest Bevin, France and 'Western Union': August 1945 \u2013 February 1946.\" ''European History Quarterly'' 14.3 (1984): 319\u2013338.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Melvyn P.

ERP required the recipients to organize as the \"Committee on European Economic Co-operation\". Under Bevin the UK took the lead in coordinating support from the Western European nations that accepted the aid. (Soviet satellites turned the money down.) The British economy has started to recover by 1948\u2014the main goal was not so much rescue or recovery as modernization of the economy.  The Marshall Plan wanted to stimulate long-term economic growth. It required the removal all sorts of economic bottlenecks and restrictions, and called for free trade and low tariffs (a long-time American goal). Britain received $3.2 billion; separately Canada gave an unrestricted $1 billion grant. Repayment was not required.  The grants were used to purchase oil, wheat, meat and other foods exported from the two donor nations. These products were in turn purchased by British consumers for pounds, and the revenue became matching funds used by UK government to modernize its economy. Britain also received large loans from the U.S. that were repaid over six decades at low interest, used to balance the budget.<ref>Rhiannon Vickers and Andrew Gamble, ''Manipulating Hegemony: State Power, Labour and the Marshall Plan in Britain'' (2000)  pp 43\u201346.[https://www.questia.com/library/101528658/manipulating-hegemony-state-power-labour-and-the  online at Questia]</ref>\n\n===NATO===\n{{Main|History of NATO}}\nBritish diplomacy set the stage for [[NATO]].

The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]].\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by J\u00f3n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh. James Thin and Mercat Press (1990 reprint). {{ISBN|0-901824-25-9}}</ref> recorded in the ''{{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga saga]]}}''\u2014 [[Sweyn Asleifsson]] \"went south, under Ireland, and seized a barge belonging to some monks in Syllingar and plundered it\".<ref name=OrkSaga /> (Chap LXXIII)\n\n<blockquote>...the three chiefs \u2013 Swein, \u00deorbj\u00f6rn and Eirik \u2013 went out on a plundering expedition. They went first to the Su\u00f0reyar [Hebrides], and all along the west to the Syllingar, where they gained a great victory in Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn on Columba's-mass [9 June], and took much booty. Then they returned to the Orkneys.<ref name=OrkSaga /></blockquote>\n\n\"{{lang|non|Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn}}\" literally means \"Mary's Harbour/Haven\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

They were styled ''Governors of Scilly'' and the Godolphins and their Osborne relatives held this position until 1834. In 1834 [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus John Smith]] acquired the lease from the Duchy for \u00a320,000.{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Smith created the title ''Lord Proprietor of the Isles of Scilly'' for himself, and many of his actions were unpopular. The lease remained in his family until it expired for most of the Isles in 1920 when ownership reverted to the Duchy of Cornwall.

The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time.

The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

This is often blamed for high year-on-year fare increases.  There have been various local attempts to create competition, but as yet none have succeeded.\n\nThe scheduled [[helicopter]] service, which previously linked [[Penzance Heliport]] with St Mary's Airport and [[Tresco Heliport]], ceased at the end of October 2012.

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

Gig racing has been said to derive from the race to collect [[marine salvage|salvage]] from shipwrecks on the rocks around Scilly, but the race was actually to deliver a [[harbour pilot|pilot]] onto incoming vessels, to guide them through the hazardous reefs and shallows. (The boats are correctly termed \"pilot gigs\"). The [[World Pilot Gig Championships]] are held annually over the May Day bank holiday weekend. The event originally involved crews from the Islands and a few crews from Cornwall, but in the intervening years the number of gigs attending has increased, with crews coming from all over the South-West and as far afield as the Netherlands and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldgigs.co.uk/|title=World Pilot Gig Championships&nbsp;\u2013 Isles of Scilly |author1=Rick Persich |author2=Chairman World Pilot Gigs Championships Committee |accessdate=26 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe Isles of Scilly feature what is reportedly the smallest [[association football|football]] league in the world, the [[Isles of Scilly Football League]].<ref>Smith, Rory (22 December 2016).

The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]].\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by J\u00f3n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh. James Thin and Mercat Press (1990 reprint). {{ISBN|0-901824-25-9}}</ref> recorded in the ''{{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga saga]]}}''\u2014 [[Sweyn Asleifsson]] \"went south, under Ireland, and seized a barge belonging to some monks in Syllingar and plundered it\".<ref name=OrkSaga /> (Chap LXXIII)\n\n<blockquote>...the three chiefs \u2013 Swein, \u00deorbj\u00f6rn and Eirik \u2013 went out on a plundering expedition. They went first to the Su\u00f0reyar [Hebrides], and all along the west to the Syllingar, where they gained a great victory in Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn on Columba's-mass [9 June], and took much booty. Then they returned to the Orkneys.<ref name=OrkSaga /></blockquote>\n\n\"{{lang|non|Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn}}\" literally means \"Mary's Harbour/Haven\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

The designation covers the entire archipelago, including the uninhabited islands and rocks, and is the smallest such area in the UK. The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles.

The maximum snowfall was {{convert|23|cm|0|abbr=on}} on 12 January 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |publisher=Met Office |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524004028/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |archive-date=24 May 2014  |title=Fact Sheet \u2013 South West England |page=17}}</ref> Summers are not as warm as on the mainland.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

On June 6, 1970, Verdine left Chicago to join the band as their new bassist. Maurice began shopping demo tapes of the band, featuring [[Donny Hathaway]], around to different record labels and the band was thus signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name = \"Nathan-1993\" />\n\n===1970\u20131974: Formation and early years===\nMaurice's [[astrological sign]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], has a primary [[Classical element|elemental]] quality of [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] and seasonal qualities of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] and [[Air (classical element)|Air]], according to [[Astrology and the classical elements#Triplicities by season|classical triplicities]]. Sagittarius in the northern hemisphere occurs in the autumn, whose element is earth, and in the southern hemisphere, it is spring, whose element is air. Hence the omission of [[Water (classical element)|Water]], the fourth [[classical element]]. Based on this, he changed the band's name, to \"Earth, Wind & Fire\".

{"title_page": "History of the socialist movement in the United Kingdom", "text_new": "{{Socialism sidebar |History by country}} \n{{Use British English|date=January 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n'''Socialism in the United Kingdom''' is thought to stretch back to the 19th century from roots arising in the aftermath of the [[English Civil War]]. Notions of socialism in Great Britain have taken many different forms from the [[utopian]] [[philanthropist|philanthropism]] of [[Robert Owen]] through to the [[Reformism|reformist]] electoral project enshrined in the birth of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\n== Origins ==\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] occurred later in Britain than in most of mainland Europe. As in the rest of Europe, various liberal thinkers such as [[Thomas More]] became prominent, but another important current was the emergence of the radical [[Puritan]]s who wanted to reform both religion and the nation. The Puritans were oppressed by both the monarchy and by the [[established church]]. Eventually these pressures exploded in the violent social revolution known as the [[English Civil War]], which many [[Marxist]]s see as the world's first successful bourgeois revolution.\nDuring the war several proto-socialist groups emerged. The most important of these groups were the [[Levellers]], who advocated [[electoral reform]], universal [[trial by jury]], [[progressive taxation]] and the abolition of the monarchy and [[aristocracy]] and of censorship. This was strongly opposed by [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s government, who also persecuted the moderate [[reformist]] group the [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] and the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] utopian group the [[Diggers]].\n\n== The 19th century ==\n=== The Industrial Revolution and Robert Owen ===\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]], the transition from a farming economy to an industrial one, began in the UK over 30 years before the rest of the world.\nTextile mills and coal mines sprang up across the whole country and peasants were taken from the fields to work down the mines, or into the \"Dark, Satanic Mills\", the chimneys of which blacked the sky over [[Lancashire]] and West [[Yorkshire]]. Appalling conditions for workers, combined with support for the [[French Revolution]] turned some intellectuals to socialism.\n\nThe pioneering work of [[Robert Owen]], a Welsh radical, at [[New Lanark]] in Scotland, is sometimes credited as being the birth of British Socialism. He stopped employing Children under the age of 10, and instead arranged for their education, and improved the working and living conditions of all his workers. He also lobbied [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] over child labour, and helped to create the [[co-operative]] movement, before attempting to create a utopian community at [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]].\n\n=== Trade Unions ===\n{{main|Trade unions in the United Kingdom}}\nThe trade union movement in Britain gradually developed from the Medieval [[guild]] system. Unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, but were already widespread in cities such as London. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as [[Luddism]] and had been prominent in struggles such as the [[Radical War]] (or Scottish Insurrection) in [[Scotland]] in 1820, when 60,000 workers went on a [[general strike]], which was soon crushed.\n\nFrom 1830 on, attempts were made to set up national [[general union]]s, most notably Robert Owen's [[Grand National Consolidated Trades Union]] in 1834, which attracted a range of socialists from [[Owenism|Owenites]] to revolutionaries. It played a part in the protests after the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]' case, but soon collapsed.\n\nMilitants turned to [[Chartism]], the aims of which were supported by most socialists, although none appear to have played leading roles.\n\nMore permanent trade unions were established from the 1850s, better resourced but often less radical. The [[London Trades Council]] was founded in 1860, and the [[Sheffield Outrages]] spurred the establishment of the [[Trades Union Congress]] in 1868. Union membership grew as unskilled and women workers were unionised, and socialists such as [[Tom Mann]] played an increasingly prominent role.\n\n=== Christian socialism ===\nThe rise of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Non-Conformist]] religions, in particular [[Methodism]], played a large role in the development of trade unions and of British socialism. The influence of the radical chapels was strongly felt among some industrial workers, especially miners and those in the north of England and Wales.\n\nThe first group calling itself [[Christian Socialists]] formed in 1848 under the leadership of [[Frederick Denison Maurice]]. Its membership mainly consisted of Chartists (see below). The group became dormant after only six years, but there was a considerable revival of Christian socialism in the 1880s, and a number of groups sprang up. Ultimately, Christian socialists dominated the leadership of the [[Independent Labour Party]], including [[James Keir Hardie]].\n\n=== The Chartist movement ===\nThe [[Chartist movement]] of the 1830s and 1840s was the first mass revolutionary movement of the British working-class. Mass meetings and demonstrations involving millions of proletariat and petty-bourgeois were held throughout the country for years.\n\nThe Chartists published several [[petition]]s to the British Parliament (ranging from 1,280,000 to 3,000,000 signatures), the most famous of which was called the [[Chartism|People's Charter]] (hence their name) in 1842, which demanded:\n# Universal suffrage for men.\n# The secret ballot.\n# Removal of property qualifications for members of parliament.\n# Salaries for members of parliament.\n# Electoral districts representing equal numbers of people.\n# Annually elected parliaments.\n\nThe government subsequently subjected the Chartists to brutal reprisals and arrested their leaders. The remaining party then split as a result of a divide in tactics: the ''Moral Force Party'' believed in bureaucratic reformism, while the ''Physical Force Party'' believed in workers' reformism (through strikes, etc.).\n\nThe Chartist movement's reformist goals, although not immediately and directly attained, were gradually achieved. In the same year as the People's Charter was created, the [[British Parliament]] instead responded by passing the 1842 Mining Act. Carefully valving the steam of the working-class movement, Parliament reduced the working day to ten hours in 1847.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/c/h.htm#chartist|title=Glossary of Organisations: Chartists (Chartism)|last=|first=|date=|website=Marxists Internet Archive Encyclopedia of Marxism|publisher=|access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Marx and early Marxism ===\n[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] worked in England, and they influenced small \u00e9migr\u00e9 groups including the [[Communist League]]. Engels' ''Condition of the Working Class in England''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm|title=Conditions of the Working-Class in England Index|last=Engels|first=Frederick|date=|website=Marx/Engels Internet Archive|publisher=|access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref> became a popular expose of conditions for workers, but initially Marxism had little impact among Britain's working class.\n\nThe first nominally Marxist organisation was the [[Social Democratic Federation]], founded in 1882. Engels refused to support the organisation, although Marx's daughter [[Eleanor Marx|Eleanor]] joined.\n\nThe party soon split, with the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] of [[William Morris]] becoming divided between anarchists and Marxists such as Morris and Eleanor Marx. A much later split produced the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]], Britain's oldest existing socialist party, and the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK, 1903)|Socialist Labour Party]].\n\nAlthough Marxism had some impact in Britain, it was far less than in many other European countries, with philosophers such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] having much greater influence. Some non-Marxists{{Who|date=July 2013}} theorise that this was because Britain was amongst the most democratic countries of Europe of the period, the ballot box provided an instrument for change, so a parliamentary, reformist socialism seemed a more promising route than elsewhere.\n\n=== Lib-Labs and the ILP ===\nThe [[Reform League]], which was founded in 1865 to press for universal male suffrage and vote by secret ballot, qualified its demand for suffrage with the phrase \"registered and residential\" shortly before the passing of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. This qualifier excluded a great number of British labourers, casual workers, and unemployed. The change in policy has been attributed to donations received by the League from [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] politicians in 1866 and 1867.<ref name=\"frfi\">{{cite book|title=Labour: A Party Fit For Imperialism|last=Clough|first=Robert|isbn=0905400151}}</ref> At the time, Marx wrote that he and Engels had been \"betrayed [...] in the Reform League where, against our wishes, [Cremer and Oder] have made compromises with the bourgeoisie\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Letter to Becker|last=Marx|first=Karl|date=31 August 1866}}</ref>\n\nHowever, a great deal of collaboration came to exist between the Liberal Party and the leaders of the labour movement, though Marx saw these as effective bribes by the bourgeoisie and the government.<ref>{{cite book|title=Minutes and Documents of the Hague Congress of the First International|last=Marx|first=Karl|publisher=Progress Publishers|year=1976|page=124}}</ref> The [[1867 Reform Act]] passed and enfranchised roughly three million people, around half of whom were working class. This was extended to five million by the [[Representation of the People Act 1884]], which extended the householder's franchise.<ref name=\"frfi\" /> The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was worried about the prospect of a socialist party taking the bulk of the working-class vote, while their great rivals the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] initiated occasional intrigues to encourage socialist candidates to stand against the Liberals.\n\nIn 1874, the Liberals agreed not to put candidates against [[Thomas Burt]] and [[Alexander Macdonald (Lib-Lab politician)|Alexander Macdonald]], two miners' leaders who were standing for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. Both were elected and became known as Liberal-Labour or [[Lib-Lab]]s for short. Other miner's leaders entered Parliament via the same route.\n\nIn 1888, [[Robert Cunninghame-Graham]] the MP for [[Lanarkshire North-West]] since the [[1886 United Kingdom general election|1886 general election]] left the Liberal Party and formed his own, independent, [[Scottish Labour Party (1888)|Scottish Labour Party]], becoming the first socialist MP in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n\nAt the [[1892 United Kingdom general election|1892 general election]], [[Keir Hardie]], another Liberal politician who had joined Cunninghame-Graham in the Scottish Labour Party, was elected as an Independent Labour MP, and this gave him the spur to found a UK-wide [[Independent Labour Party]] in 1893.\n\n== The 20th century ==\n[[File:BritishLeft.png|thumb|600px|Timeline of parties in the broad socialist movement]]\n\nThe early twentieth century saw a number of socialist groups and movements in Britain. As well as the Independent Labour Party and the Social Democratic Federation, there was a mass movement around [[Robert Blatchford]]'s newspaper ''[[The Clarion]]'' from the 1890s to the 1930s; the more intellectual gradualist [[Fabian Society]]; and more radical groups such as the [[Socialist Labour Party (1903-1980)|Socialist Labour Party]]. However, the movement was increasingly dominated by the formation of the [[British Labour Party]].\n\n=== The birth of the Labour Party ===\n{{Main|History of the British Labour Party}}\n\nIn 1900, representatives of various trade unions and of the Independent Labour Party, Fabian Society and Social Democratic Federation agreed to form a Labour Party backed by the unions and with its own whips. The [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee|Labour Representation Committee]] was founded with Keir Hardie as its leader. At the 1900 general election, the LRC won only two seats, and the SDF disaffiliated, but more unions signed up.\n\nThe LRC affiliated to the [[Socialist International]] and in 1906 changed its name to [[The Labour Party (UK)|The Labour Party]]. It formed [[Gladstone-MacDonald pact|an electoral pact]] with the Liberals, intending to cause maximum damage to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] government at the forthcoming election. This was successful, and in the process, 29 Labour MPs were elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].\n\n=== Women's suffrage ===\nThe campaign for women's suffrage in Britain began in the mid-nineteenth century, with many early campaigners including Eleanor Marx being socialists, but many established socialists, including Robert Blatchford and [[Ernest Bax]] opposed or ignored the movement. By the early twentieth century, the campaign had become more militant, but some of its leaders were reluctant to involve working-class women in it. [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] campaigned for enfranchisement among women in the East End of London and eventually built up the [[Workers Socialist Federation]].\n\n=== Syndicalism and World War I ===\nSupporters of [[Daniel De Leon]] in the Social Democratic Federation chiefly in Scotland split to form the [[Socialist Labour Party (1903-1980)|Socialist Labour Party]]. Their fellow [[impossibilism|impossibilists]] in London split from the SDF the following year to form the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (SPGB, still in existence). The remainder of the SDF attempted to form a broader Marxist party, the [[British Socialist Party]]. The SLP and BSP parties came to influence the [[shop steward]] movement, which became particularly prominent in what became known as [[Red Clydeside]]. Socialists such as [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John Maclean]] led strikes and demonstrations for better working conditions and a forty-hour working week.\n\nThis activity took place against the background of the [[First World War]]. The Labour Party, like almost all the Socialist International, enthusiastically supported their country's leadership in the war, as did the leadership of the British Socialist Party. This split the BSP, and a new anti-war leadership emerging.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Swift |first1=David |title=For Class and Country: the Patriotic Left and the First World War |date=2017 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=9781786940025}}</ref>\n\n=== Bolshevism and the CPGB ===\nThe shop steward movement worried many right-wingers, who believed that socialists were fomenting a [[Bolshevik]] revolution in Britain. A [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) was founded, but it attracted only existing left-wing militants, with the British Socialist Party and Workers Socialist Federation joining many Socialist Labour Party activists in it.\n\nThe CPGB soon became known for its loyalty to the line of the [[Comintern]], and proposed the motion to expel [[Leon Trotsky]] from the international. Under the leadership of [[Harry Pollitt]], it finally gained its first MP, and began to expel [[Trotskyist]]s.\n\n=== Labour and the General Strike ===\nThe Labour Party continued to grow as more unions affiliated and more Labour MPs were elected. In 1918, a new constitution was agreed, which laid out several aims of the party. These included [[Clause IV]], calling for \"common ownership\" of key industry. With their success at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]], Labour were able to form their first [[minority government]], led by [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. This government was undermined by the infamous [[Zinoviev Letter]], which was used as evidence of Labour's links with the [[Soviet Union]]. It was later revealed to be a forgery.\n\nIn 1926, British miners went on strike over their appalling working conditions. The situation soon escalated into the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]], but the [[Trade Union Congress]], ostensibly worried about reports of starvation in the [[pit village]]s, called the strike off. The miners tried to continue alone, but without TUC support had eventually to give in.\n\nLabour formed a minority government in [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]] again under MacDonald, but following the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]], the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] engulfed the country. The government split over its response to the crisis. MacDonald and a few supporters agreed to form a [[UK National Government|National Government]] with the Liberals and the Conservatives. The majority of the Labour Party regarded this as a betrayal and expelled them, whereupon they founded [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]].\n\nThe Great Depression devastated the industrial areas of Northern England, Wales and Central Scotland, and the [[Jarrow March]] of unemployed workers from the North East to London to demand jobs defined the period.\n\n=== Ethical socialism ===\n[[Ethical socialism]] is a variant of [[liberal socialism]] developed by British socialists.<ref>John Dearlove, Peter Saunders.

Mosley rose just as quickly on the Labour benches and was a government minister charged with dealing with unemployment during the Great Depression. Mosley proposed the \"Mosley Memorandum\" which suggested the formation of Cabinet committees to deal with specific policy issues, rationalisation and mechanisation in industry to make it more competitive, and a programme of public works. Although the memorandum prefigured [[Keynesian]] policies that would be accepted by later governments, it was too radical a set of proposals for 1930 and both the Labour government and the party rejected it. In response, Mosley left Labour in 1931 to found the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], taking four other Labour MPs with him. The New Party failed to win any seats in 1932 and Mosley subsequently came to support fascism, merging his party with several far-right groups to form the [[British Union of Fascists]].\n\n=== The Spanish Civil War and World War II ===\n[[File:2015-03-07 - ThinkTank - Sasha Taylor - 11.JPG|thumb|WWII badge for the \"Birmingham Socialist [[Air Raid Precautions|ARP]] Canteen Fund\" ]]\n\nThe Independent Labour Party disaffiliated from the Labour Party in 1932, in protest at an erosion of their MPs' independence. For a time, they became a significant left-of-Labour force.\n\nIn 1936, the [[Spanish Civil War]] was viewed by many socialists as a contest against the rise of fascism which it was vital to win. Many CPGB and Independent Labour Party members went to fight for the Republic and with the Stalinist led International Brigades and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]) [[anti-fascist]] forces, including [[George Orwell]] who wrote about his experiences in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.\n\nThe Labour Party leadership always supported British involvement in [[World War II]], and they joined a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|national government]] with the Conservative Party and the Liberals, and agreed a non-contest pact in elections. The CPGB at first supported the war, but after [[Joseph Stalin]] signed a treaty with [[Adolf Hitler]], opposed it. After the [[Nazi Germany|fascist]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], they again supported the war, joined the non-contest pact, and did all in their power to prevent strikes. But strikes did occur, and they were supported by the anti-war Independent Labour Party and the newly formed Trotskyist [[Revolutionary Communist Party (1944-1949)|Revolutionary Communist Party]].\n\n=== The 1945 landslide Labour victory ===\nTo widespread surprise, the Labour Party led by wartime Deputy Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] won a landslide victory over popular war leader [[Winston Churchill]] at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], and implemented their [[social democratic]] programme. They established the [[National Health Service|NHS]], [[nationalised]] some industries (for example, coal mining), and created a [[welfare state]].\n\nThe CPGB also grew on the back of Stalinist successes in Eastern Europe and China, and recorded their best-ever result, with two MPs elected (one in London and another in [[Fife]]). The Trotskyite Revolutionary Communist Party collapsed.\n\nLabour lost power in [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]] and after Clement Attlee retired as party leader in 1955, he was succeeded by the figurehead of the \"right-establishment\" [[Hugh Gaitskell]], against [[Aneurin Bevan]].\n\nAlthough there were some disputes between the [[Bevanites]] and the [[Gaitskellites]], these disputes were more about personality than ideology, and the rift was healed when [[Harold Wilson]], a Bevanite, was elected as Leader of the Labour Party after Gaitskell's sudden death.\n\n=== The 1960s and 1970s ===\nThe [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] briefly gained leverage over Labour Party policy at the beginning of the decade, but soon went into a long eclipse. The [[Vietnam War]], given lukewarm support by [[Harold Wilson]], radicalised a new generation. Significant anti-war protests were organised. Trotskyist groups like the [[International Marxist Group]] and the [[Vietnam Solidarity Campaign]] came to prominence, particularly due to high-profile members like the IMG's [[Tariq Ali]].\n\nAfter the Soviet Union's invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1968, the CPGB became to divide between Stalinists and [[Eurocommunist]]s. The party suffered a series of splits. Various [[Maoist]] inclined elements left, the most significant forming the [[Communist Party of Britain (Marxist-Leninist)]]. Later in 1977, other traditionalist pro-Russian elements left to form the [[New Communist Party of Britain|New Communist Party]].\n\nIn 1969, Wilson's Labour Government introduced ''[[In Place of Strife]]'', a white paper designed to circumvent strikes by imposing compulsory arbitration. Opposed by many trade unionists, including Home Secretary [[James Callaghan]]; it was soon withdrawn. Later legislation passed by [[Edward Heath]]'s Conservative government was successfully resisted as union militants, many close to the CPGB, led the successful [[UK miners' strike (1974)|1974 UK miners' strike]]. More ominously for the left, the unsuccessful [[Grunwick dispute]], and the 1978\u201379 [[Winter of Discontent]] were also blamed on them. The Labour leadership's failure to work with trade unions, or for their opponents an inability to keep them under control, resulted in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|election in 1979]] of an economically liberal Conservative government, led by [[Margaret Thatcher]], which finally ended the post-war political consensus.\n\n=== The 1980s ===\nAfter the 1979 Labour defeat, [[James Callaghan|Jim Callaghan]] tried in vain to keep the left-wing of the party (in which [[Tony Benn]] was prominent) and the right-wing (in which [[Roy Jenkins]] was prominent) together. In 1980, the Labour Party conference was dominated by factional disputes and what Callaghan regarded as [[Bennite]] motions. Callaghan resigned as party leader late that year and was replaced by [[Michael Foot]], a left-winger who by then had distanced himself from Benn but failed to transmit this to the media or the voters. The following year, [[Denis Healey]] only narrowly won the deputy leadership in a contest with Benn.\n\nIn 1981, thirty MPs on the right-wing of the Labour Party defected to found the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], which formed an [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and opinion polls briefly saw the new alliance appear capable of winning a general election.\n\nAt the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], Thatcher benefited from increased popularity, an after effect of the successful [[Falklands War]], and a Labour manifesto which Labour MP [[Gerald Kaufman]] described as \"the longest suicide note in history\". Labour suffered their worst election defeat since 1918 with eight and a half million votes, over three million votes down on the previous general election. Many former Labour voters had voted for the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] instead. The Alliance came close to Labour in terms of votes, but had only a fraction of its seats due to the limitations of the [[first-past-the-post]] system.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm | work=BBC News | title=1983: Thatcher triumphs again | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1983 general election, [[Neil Kinnock]], long associated with the left-wing of the Labour Party, became the new leader. By that point in time, the Labour Party was factionalised between the right, including Healey and deputy leader [[Roy Hattersley]], a \"[[soft left]]\" associated with the [[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]] group, and a \"[[hard left]]\" associated with Benn and the new [[Socialist Campaign Group|Campaign Group]].\n\nThe Trotskyist [[Militant tendency]], using [[Entryism|entryist]] tactics in the Labour Party, had gradually increased their profile. By 1982, they controlled [[Liverpool City Council]], and had a presence in many Constituency Labour Parties. The Labour NEC began to expel Militant members, beginning with their newspaper's \"editorial board\", in effect their Central Committee. A revival in [[municipal socialism]] seemed, for a time, a solution to Conservative hegemony for many on the left. The [[Greater London Council]], led by [[Ken Livingstone]], gained the most attention, seeming genuinely innovative to its support base, but the GLC was abolished by the Conservatives in 1986.\n\nThe defining event of the 1980s for British socialists was the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|1984\u20135 miners' strike]]. Miners in the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], led by [[Arthur Scargill]], struck against the closure of collieries. Despite support in the coalfields, including many miners' wives in [[Women Against Pit Closures]], the strike was eventually lost owing to a union split, amongst other reasons. The Conservatives had already begun to [[privatisation|privatise]] other state industries. Labour lost the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] by a wide margin, although it did manage to reduce the Conservative majority significantly.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393315.stm | work=BBC News | title=1987: Thatcher's third victory | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Socialism and nationalism ===\n[[Scottish independence|Scottish]] and [[Welsh nationalism]] have been the concern of many socialists. Having been raised in the nineteenth century by Liberals also calling for [[Irish Home Rule]], Scottish Home Rule became the official policy of the ILP, and of the Labour Party until 1958. [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John Maclean]] campaigned for a separate Communist Party in Scotland in the 1920s, and when the CPGB refused to support Scottish independence, he formed the [[Scottish Workers Republican Party]]. The poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], a Communist, was also an early member of the [[National Party of Scotland]]. The CPGB eventually changed their position in the 1940s.\n\nThe early nationalist parties had little connection with socialism, but by the 1980s they had become increasingly identified with the left, and in the 1990s [[Plaid Cymru]] declared itself to be a socialist party.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly]], both the [[Scottish National Party]] and Plaid have been challenged by socialists in recent years. The [[Scottish Socialist Party]], who also support [[Scottish independence]] as an immediate goal, has had recent electoral success; it won six [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] in the [[2003 Scottish Parliament election]]. [[Forward Wales]], with a less militant programme, aimed to replicate their success.\n\n[[Irish republicanism]] came to be supported by socialists in Britain. Labour's election manifestos for 1983, 1987 and 1992 included a commitment to [[United Ireland|Irish unification]] by consent.\n\n=== The 1990s ===\nIn 1989 in [[Scotland]], and 1990 for the rest of the UK, the Conservatives introduced the deeply unpopular [[Tax per head|poll tax]]. For the first time in the decade, socialists were able to organise effective opposition, culminating in the \"[[Poll tax riot]]\" on 31 March 1990. Margaret Thatcher's own party compelled her to step down on 22 November that year, and she was replaced by [[John Major]], who abolished the charge in 1991.\n\nThe CPGB dissolved itself in 1991, although their former newspaper, the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]'', continues to be published and follows the programme of the [[Communist Party of Britain]] which was founded in 1988 after an internal crisis in the CPGB led to a split. The Eurocommunists, who had controlled the party's magazine ''[[Marxism Today]]'', formed the [[Democratic Left (United Kingdom)|Democratic Left]]\n\nIn the run-up to the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], polling showed that there might be a [[hung parliament]], but possibly a small Labour majority \u2013 the party's lead on the opinion polls had shrunk and some polls had even seen the Tories creep ahead in spite of the deepening recession. In the event, the Conservatives led by [[John Major]]; won a fourth consecutive election with a majority of 21 seats. This has been attributed to both the Labour Party's premature triumphalism (in particular at the [[Sheffield Rally]]) and the Tories' \"Tax Bombshell\" advertising campaign, which highlighted the increased taxes that a Labour government would impose. This general election defeat was shortly followed by Kinnock's resignation after nearly a decade as leader. And, as had happened in the aftermath of the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election defeat]], there was widespread public and media doubt as to whether a Labour government could be elected again \u2013 without an overhaul of the party's policies, it seemed too difficult to imagine the party being able to win a general election in any situation if it had been unable to do so in the event of a recession and rising unemployment.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393317.stm | work=BBC News | title=1992: Tories win again against odds | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nAfter the brief stewardship of [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], [[Tony Blair]] was elected leader following Smith's sudden death from a heart attack in May 1994. He immediately decided to amend Clause IV, dropping Labour's commitment to public ownership of key industries and utilities, along with other socialist policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/britain1948.html|title=Britain Since 1948|website=www.localhistories.org|access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany members of the party were unhappy with the proposed changes and several unions considered using their block vote to kill the motion, but in the end their leaderships backed down and settled for a new clause declaring the Labour Party a \"democratic socialist party\". However, Labour had been ascendant in the opinion polls since the [[Black Wednesday]] economic fiasco a few months after the 1992 general election, and the increased lead of the polls under Blair's leadership remained strong in spite of the revolt, and the fact that the economy was growing again and unemployment was falling under Major's Conservative government. Labour's popularity was also helped by the fact that the Conservative government was now divided over Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://yougov.co.uk/news/2011/11/11/unity-parties-divided/|title=YouGov {{!}} Unity: Parties divided|last=|first=|date=|website=YouGov: What the world thinks|publisher=|access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nSeveral party members, such as [[Arthur Scargill]], regarded this as a betrayal of Labour's ideology and left the Labour Party. Scargill formed the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK)|Socialist Labour Party]] (SLP) which initially attracted some support, much of which transferred to the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]] on its formation, but the SA has since been wound up and the SLP has become marginalised.\n\nThe Scottish Socialist Party have proven much more successful, while Ken Livingstone became the [[Mayor of London]], standing against an official Labour Party candidate. Livingstone was re-admitted into the Labour Party in time for his re-election in 2004.\n\nUnder Blair, Labour launched a PR campaign to rebrand as ''[[New Labour]]''. The party also introduced women-only shortlists in certain seats and central vetting of Parliamentary candidates to ensure that its candidates were seen as on-message. Labour won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] with a landslide majority of 179 seats; their best result to date.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm | work=BBC News | title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule | date=15 April 2005}}</ref>\n\n==The 21st century==\n{{main|British Left}}\nThe international [[anti-globalisation movement]], while difficult to define, has become a focus for other socialists in the twenty-first century, and many see a reflection of it in the opposition of large sections of the population to the [[2003 Iraq War]].\n\nSeveral minor socialist parties merged in 2003 to form the [[Alliance for Green Socialism]] which is a socialist party that campaigns on a wide variety of policies including; economic, environmental and social.\n\nAfter [[George Galloway]]'s expulsion from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in October 2003 following his controversial statements about the war in [[Iraq]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3205889.stm|title=Galloway expelled by Labour|date=24 October 2003|accessdate=4 July 2013|work=BBC News}}</ref> he became involved in [[Respect Party|Respect \u2013 The Unity Coalition]] (later renamed the Respect Party) in an alliance with the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] and leading figures from the [[Muslim Association of Britain]].

The [[Left Unity (UK)|Left Unity]] political party was founded in November 2013 as a result of the appeal.\n\n=== United Kingdom general election, 2010 ===\n{{Main|2010 United Kingdom general election}}\n\nThe Labour Party was defeated at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], after talks of forming a coalition agreement with the Liberal Democrats failed. During their thirteen years in government, Labour made few changes to the trade union reforms passed by the previous Conservative governments, and the only nationalisation which took place during that time were of several leading banks facing collapse in the [[Late 2000s recession|recession of 2008 and 2009]] under the premiership of [[Gordon Brown]]. The Conservatives returned to power with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] as a [[coalition]] government following a [[hung parliament]]; the first in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|36 years]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8676607.stm|title=David Cameron and Nick Clegg pledge 'united' coalition|date=12 May 2010|accessdate=4 July 2013|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nOther socialists{{Who|date=July 2013}} place their hopes in a trade union revival, perhaps around the \"[[Awkward Squad (trade unions)|Awkward Squad]]\" of the more left-wing trade union leaders, many of whom have joined the [[Labour Representation Committee (2004)|Labour Representation Committee]].

Its co-convenor, [[Colin Fox (politician)|Colin Fox]], sits on the Advisory Board of the [[Yes Scotland]] campaign organisation. The party's support for Scottish independence is rooted in a belief that \"the tearing of the blue out of the Union Jack and the dismantling of the 300-year-old British state would [be] a traumatic psychological blow for the forces of capitalism and conservatism in Britain, Europe and the USA\", and that it would be \"almost as potent in its symbolism as the unravelling of the Soviet Union at the start of the 1990s\". Representatives of the party have also claimed that while the break-up of the United Kingdom would not result in \"instant socialism\", it would cause \"a decisive shift in the balance of ideological and class forces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://links.org.au/node/2323|title=Why the left should back independence|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe campaign for independence has also enjoyed support from a minority of trade unionists. In 2013, a branch of the [[Communication Workers Union (UK)|Communications Workers Union]] covering Edinburgh, Lothians, Fife, Falkirk, and Stirling voted to back a motion describing independence as \"the only way forward for workers in Scotland\", and agreeing to \"do all in our power to secure [a ''Yes''] outcome\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.stv.tv/stirling-central/216300-scottish-postal-workers-hope-to-deliver-yes-vote-for-independence/|title=Scottish postal workers hope to deliver Yes vote for independence|last=|first=|date=4 March 2013|website=STV News|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref> Additionally, the [[Scottish Trades Union Congress]] has refused to take a stance on the referendum, instead laying out \"challenges for both sides of the debate\", in particular calling on [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] to \"outline a practical vision of how social and economic justice can be achieved within the union\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuc.org.uk/news/986/a-just-scotland-stuc-publishes-interim-report-on-scotland-s-constitutional-future |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130424012659/http://www.stuc.org.uk/news/986/a-just-scotland-stuc-publishes-interim-report-on-scotland-s-constitutional-future |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 April 2013 |title=A Just Scotland \u2013 STUC publishes interim report on Scotland's constitutional future |date=25 November 2012 |accessdate=3 April 2013 }}</ref> Other left-wing sections refused to support a nationalist position, instead arguing either for working-class unity or a critical approach to both sides.

Notions of socialism in Great Britain have taken many different forms from the [[utopian]] [[philanthropist|philanthropism]] of [[Robert Owen]] through to the [[Reformism|reformist]] electoral project enshrined in the birth of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\n== Origins ==\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] occurred later in Britain than in most of mainland Europe. As in the rest of Europe, various liberal thinkers such as [[Thomas More]] became prominent, but another important current was the emergence of the radical [[Puritan]]s who wanted to reform both religion and the nation. The Puritans were oppressed by both the monarchy and by the [[established church]]. Eventually these pressures exploded in the violent social revolution known as the [[English Civil War]], which many [[Marxist]]s see as the world's first successful bourgeois revolution.\nDuring the war several proto-socialist groups emerged. The most important of these groups were the [[Levellers]], who advocated [[electoral reform]], universal [[trial by jury]], [[progressive taxation]] and the abolition of the monarchy and [[aristocracy]] and of censorship. This was strongly opposed by [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s government, who also persecuted the moderate [[reformist]] group the [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] and the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] utopian group the [[Diggers]].\n\n== The 19th century ==\n=== The Industrial Revolution and Robert Owen ===\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]], the transition from a farming economy to an industrial one, began in the UK over 30 years before the rest of the world.\nTextile mills and coal mines sprang up across the whole country and peasants were taken from the fields to work down the mines, or into the \"Dark, Satanic Mills\", the chimneys of which blacked the sky over [[Lancashire]] and West [[Yorkshire]]. Appalling conditions for workers, combined with support for the [[French Revolution]] turned some intellectuals to socialism.\n\nThe pioneering work of [[Robert Owen]], a Welsh radical, at [[New Lanark]] in Scotland, is sometimes credited as being the birth of British Socialism. He stopped employing Children under the age of 10, and instead arranged for their education, and improved the working and living conditions of all his workers. He also lobbied [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] over child labour, and helped to create the [[co-operative]] movement, before attempting to create a utopian community at [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]].\n\n=== Trade Unions ===\n{{main|Trade unions in the United Kingdom}}\nThe trade union movement in Britain gradually developed from the Medieval [[guild]] system. Unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, but were already widespread in cities such as London. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as [[Luddism]] and had been prominent in struggles such as the [[Radical War]] (or Scottish Insurrection) in [[Scotland]] in 1820, when 60,000 workers went on a [[general strike]], which was soon crushed.\n\nFrom 1830 on, attempts were made to set up national [[general union]]s, most notably Robert Owen's [[Grand National Consolidated Trades Union]] in 1834, which attracted a range of socialists from [[Owenism|Owenites]] to revolutionaries. It played a part in the protests after the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]' case, but soon collapsed.\n\nMilitants turned to [[Chartism]], the aims of which were supported by most socialists, although none appear to have played leading roles.\n\nMore permanent trade unions were established from the 1850s, better resourced but often less radical. The [[London Trades Council]] was founded in 1860, and the [[Sheffield Outrages]] spurred the establishment of the [[Trades Union Congress]] in 1868. Union membership grew as unskilled and women workers were unionised, and socialists such as [[Tom Mann]] played an increasingly prominent role.\n\n=== Christian socialism ===\nThe rise of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Non-Conformist]] religions, in particular [[Methodism]], played a large role in the development of trade unions and of British socialism. The influence of the radical chapels was strongly felt among some industrial workers, especially miners and those in the north of England and Wales.\n\nThe first group calling itself [[Christian Socialists]] formed in 1848 under the leadership of [[Frederick Denison Maurice]]. Its membership mainly consisted of Chartists (see below). The group became dormant after only six years, but there was a considerable revival of Christian socialism in the 1880s, and a number of groups sprang up. Ultimately, Christian socialists dominated the leadership of the [[Independent Labour Party]], including [[James Keir Hardie]].\n\n=== The Chartist movement ===\nThe [[Chartist movement]] of the 1830s and 1840s was the first mass revolutionary movement of the British working-class. Mass meetings and demonstrations involving millions of proletariat and petty-bourgeois were held throughout the country for years.\n\nThe Chartists published several [[petition]]s to the British Parliament (ranging from 1,280,000 to 3,000,000 signatures), the most famous of which was called the [[Chartism|People's Charter]] (hence their name) in 1842, which demanded:\n# Universal suffrage for men.\n# The secret ballot.\n# Removal of property qualifications for members of parliament.\n# Salaries for members of parliament.\n# Electoral districts representing equal numbers of people.\n# Annually elected parliaments.\n\nThe government subsequently subjected the Chartists to brutal reprisals and arrested their leaders. The remaining party then split as a result of a divide in tactics: the ''Moral Force Party'' believed in bureaucratic reformism, while the ''Physical Force Party'' believed in workers' reformism (through strikes, etc.).\n\nThe Chartist movement's reformist goals, although not immediately and directly attained, were gradually achieved. In the same year as the People's Charter was created, the [[British Parliament]] instead responded by passing the 1842 Mining Act. Carefully valving the steam of the working-class movement, Parliament reduced the working day to ten hours in 1847.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/c/h.htm#chartist|title=Glossary of Organisations: Chartists (Chartism)|last=|first=|date=|website=Marxists Internet Archive Encyclopedia of Marxism|publisher=|access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Marx and early Marxism ===\n[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] worked in England, and they influenced small \u00e9migr\u00e9 groups including the [[Communist League]]. Engels' ''Condition of the Working Class in England''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm|title=Conditions of the Working-Class in England Index|last=Engels|first=Frederick|date=|website=Marx/Engels Internet Archive|publisher=|access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref> became a popular expose of conditions for workers, but initially Marxism had little impact among Britain's working class.\n\nThe first nominally Marxist organisation was the [[Social Democratic Federation]], founded in 1882. Engels refused to support the organisation, although Marx's daughter [[Eleanor Marx|Eleanor]] joined.\n\nThe party soon split, with the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] of [[William Morris]] becoming divided between anarchists and Marxists such as Morris and Eleanor Marx. A much later split produced the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]], Britain's oldest existing socialist party, and the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK, 1903)|Socialist Labour Party]].\n\nAlthough Marxism had some impact in Britain, it was far less than in many other European countries, with philosophers such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] having much greater influence. Some non-Marxists{{Who|date=July 2013}} theorise that this was because Britain was amongst the most democratic countries of Europe of the period, the ballot box provided an instrument for change, so a parliamentary, reformist socialism seemed a more promising route than elsewhere.\n\n=== Lib-Labs and the ILP ===\nThe [[Reform League]], which was founded in 1865 to press for universal male suffrage and vote by secret ballot, qualified its demand for suffrage with the phrase \"registered and residential\" shortly before the passing of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. This qualifier excluded a great number of British labourers, casual workers, and unemployed. The change in policy has been attributed to donations received by the League from [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] politicians in 1866 and 1867.<ref name=\"frfi\">{{cite book|title=Labour: A Party Fit For Imperialism|last=Clough|first=Robert|isbn=0905400151}}</ref> At the time, Marx wrote that he and Engels had been \"betrayed [...] in the Reform League where, against our wishes, [Cremer and Oder] have made compromises with the bourgeoisie\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Letter to Becker|last=Marx|first=Karl|date=31 August 1866}}</ref>\n\nHowever, a great deal of collaboration came to exist between the Liberal Party and the leaders of the labour movement, though Marx saw these as effective bribes by the bourgeoisie and the government.<ref>{{cite book|title=Minutes and Documents of the Hague Congress of the First International|last=Marx|first=Karl|publisher=Progress Publishers|year=1976|page=124}}</ref> The [[1867 Reform Act]] passed and enfranchised roughly three million people, around half of whom were working class. This was extended to five million by the [[Representation of the People Act 1884]], which extended the householder's franchise.<ref name=\"frfi\" /> The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was worried about the prospect of a socialist party taking the bulk of the working-class vote, while their great rivals the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] initiated occasional intrigues to encourage socialist candidates to stand against the Liberals.\n\nIn 1874, the Liberals agreed not to put candidates against [[Thomas Burt]] and [[Alexander Macdonald (Lib-Lab politician)|Alexander Macdonald]], two miners' leaders who were standing for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. Both were elected and became known as Liberal-Labour or [[Lib-Lab]]s for short. Other miner's leaders entered Parliament via the same route.\n\nIn 1888, [[Robert Cunninghame-Graham]] the MP for [[Lanarkshire North-West]] since the [[1886 United Kingdom general election|1886 general election]] left the Liberal Party and formed his own, independent, [[Scottish Labour Party (1888)|Scottish Labour Party]], becoming the first socialist MP in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n\nAt the [[1892 United Kingdom general election|1892 general election]], [[Keir Hardie]], another Liberal politician who had joined Cunninghame-Graham in the Scottish Labour Party, was elected as an Independent Labour MP, and this gave him the spur to found a UK-wide [[Independent Labour Party]] in 1893.\n\n== The 20th century ==\n[[File:BritishLeft.png|thumb|600px|Timeline of parties in the broad socialist movement]]\n\nThe early twentieth century saw a number of socialist groups and movements in Britain. As well as the Independent Labour Party and the Social Democratic Federation, there was a mass movement around [[Robert Blatchford]]'s newspaper ''[[The Clarion]]'' from the 1890s to the 1930s; the more intellectual gradualist [[Fabian Society]]; and more radical groups such as the [[Socialist Labour Party (1903-1980)|Socialist Labour Party]]. However, the movement was increasingly dominated by the formation of the [[British Labour Party]].\n\n=== The birth of the Labour Party ===\n{{Main|History of the British Labour Party}}\n\nIn 1900, representatives of various trade unions and of the Independent Labour Party, Fabian Society and Social Democratic Federation agreed to form a Labour Party backed by the unions and with its own whips. The [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee|Labour Representation Committee]] was founded with Keir Hardie as its leader. At the 1900 general election, the LRC won only two seats, and the SDF disaffiliated, but more unions signed up.\n\nThe LRC affiliated to the [[Socialist International]] and in 1906 changed its name to [[The Labour Party (UK)|The Labour Party]]. It formed [[Gladstone-MacDonald pact|an electoral pact]] with the Liberals, intending to cause maximum damage to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] government at the forthcoming election. This was successful, and in the process, 29 Labour MPs were elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].\n\n=== Women's suffrage ===\nThe campaign for women's suffrage in Britain began in the mid-nineteenth century, with many early campaigners including Eleanor Marx being socialists, but many established socialists, including Robert Blatchford and [[Ernest Bax]] opposed or ignored the movement. By the early twentieth century, the campaign had become more militant, but some of its leaders were reluctant to involve working class women in it. [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] campaigned for enfranchisement among women in the East End of London and eventually built up the [[Workers Socialist Federation]].\n\n=== Syndicalism and World War I ===\nSupporters of [[Daniel De Leon]] in the Social Democratic Federation chiefly in Scotland split to form the [[Socialist Labour Party (1903-1980)|Socialist Labour Party]]. Their fellow [[impossibilism|impossibilists]] in London split from the SDF the following year to form the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (SPGB, still in existence). The remainder of the SDF attempted to form a broader Marxist party, the [[British Socialist Party]]. The SLP and BSP parties came to influence the [[shop steward]] movement, which became particularly prominent in what became known as [[Red Clydeside]]. Socialists such as [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John Maclean]] led strikes and demonstrations for better working conditions and a forty-hour working week.\n\nThis activity took place against the background of the [[First World War]]. The Labour Party, like almost all the Socialist International, enthusiastically supported their country's leadership in the war, as did the leadership of the British Socialist Party. This split the BSP, and a new anti-war leadership emerging.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Swift |first1=David |title=For Class and Country: the Patriotic Left and the First World War |date=2017 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=9781786940025}}</ref>\n\n=== Bolshevism and the CPGB ===\nThe shop steward movement worried many right-wingers, who believed that socialists were fomenting a [[Bolshevik]] revolution in Britain. A [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) was founded, but it attracted only existing left-wing militants, with the British Socialist Party and Workers Socialist Federation joining many Socialist Labour Party activists in it.\n\nThe CPGB soon became known for its loyalty to the line of the [[Comintern]], and proposed the motion to expel [[Leon Trotsky]] from the international. Under the leadership of [[Harry Pollitt]], it finally gained its first MP, and began to expel [[Trotskyist]]s.\n\n=== Labour and the General Strike ===\nThe Labour Party continued to grow as more unions affiliated and more Labour MPs were elected. In 1918, a new constitution was agreed, which laid out several aims of the party. These included [[Clause IV]], calling for \"common ownership\" of key industry. With their success at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]], Labour were able to form their first [[minority government]], led by [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. This government was undermined by the infamous [[Zinoviev Letter]], which was used as evidence of Labour's links with the [[Soviet Union]]. It was later revealed to be a forgery.\n\nIn 1926, British miners went on strike over their appalling working conditions. The situation soon escalated into the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]], but the [[Trade Union Congress]], ostensibly worried about reports of starvation in the [[pit village]]s, called the strike off. The miners tried to continue alone, but without TUC support had eventually to give in.\n\nLabour formed a minority government in [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]] again under MacDonald, but following the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]], the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] engulfed the country. The government split over its response to the crisis. MacDonald and a few supporters agreed to form a [[UK National Government|National Government]] with the Liberals and the Conservatives. The majority of the Labour Party regarded this as a betrayal and expelled them, whereupon they founded [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]].\n\nThe Great Depression devastated the industrial areas of Northern England, Wales and Central Scotland, and the [[Jarrow March]] of unemployed workers from the North East to London to demand jobs defined the period.\n\n=== Ethical socialism ===\n[[Ethical socialism]] is a variant of [[liberal socialism]] developed by British socialists.<ref>John Dearlove, Peter Saunders.

Mosley rose just as quickly on the Labour benches and was a government minister charged with dealing with unemployment during the Great Depression. Mosley proposed the \"Mosley Memorandum\" which suggested the formation of Cabinet committees to deal with specific policy issues, rationalisation and mechanisation in industry to make it more competitive, and a programme of public works. Although the memorandum prefigured [[Keynesian]] policies that would be accepted by later governments, it was too radical a set of proposals for 1930 and both the Labour government and the party rejected it. In response, Mosley left Labour in 1931 to found the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], taking four other Labour MPs with him. The New Party failed to win any seats in 1932 and Mosley subsequently came to support fascism, merging his party with several far-right groups to form the [[British Union of Fascists]].\n\n=== The Spanish Civil War and World War II ===\n[[File:2015-03-07 - ThinkTank - Sasha Taylor - 11.JPG|thumb|WWII badge for the \"Birmingham Socialist [[Air Raid Precautions|ARP]] Canteen Fund\" ]]\n\nThe Independent Labour Party disaffiliated from the Labour Party in 1932, in protest at an erosion of their MPs' independence. For a time, they became a significant left-of-Labour force.\n\nIn 1936, the [[Spanish Civil War]] was viewed by many socialists as a contest against the rise of fascism which it was vital to win. Many CPGB and Independent Labour Party members went to fight for the Republic and with the Stalinist led International Brigades and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]) [[anti-fascist]] forces, including [[George Orwell]] who wrote about his experiences in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.\n\nThe Labour Party leadership always supported British involvement in [[World War II]], and they joined a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|national government]] with the Conservative Party and the Liberals, and agreed a non-contest pact in elections. The CPGB at first supported the war, but after [[Joseph Stalin]] signed a treaty with [[Adolf Hitler]], opposed it. After the [[Nazi Germany|fascist]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], they again supported the war, joined the non-contest pact, and did all in their power to prevent strikes. But strikes did occur, and they were supported by the anti-war Independent Labour Party and the newly formed Trotskyist [[Revolutionary Communist Party (1944-1949)|Revolutionary Communist Party]].\n\n=== The 1945 landslide Labour victory ===\nTo widespread surprise, the Labour Party led by wartime Deputy Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] won a landslide victory over popular war leader [[Winston Churchill]] at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], and implemented their [[social democratic]] programme. They established the [[National Health Service|NHS]], [[nationalised]] some industries (for example, coal mining), and created a [[welfare state]].\n\nThe CPGB also grew on the back of Stalinist successes in Eastern Europe and China, and recorded their best-ever result, with two MPs elected (one in London and another in [[Fife]]). The Trotskyite Revolutionary Communist Party collapsed.\n\nLabour lost power in [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]] and after Clement Attlee retired as party leader in 1955, he was succeeded by the figurehead of the \"right-establishment\" [[Hugh Gaitskell]], against [[Aneurin Bevan]].\n\nAlthough there were some disputes between the [[Bevanites]] and the [[Gaitskellites]], these disputes were more about personality than ideology, and the rift was healed when [[Harold Wilson]], a Bevanite, was elected as Leader of the Labour Party after Gaitskell's sudden death.\n\n=== The 1960s and 1970s ===\nThe [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] briefly gained leverage over Labour Party policy at the beginning of the decade, but soon went into a long eclipse. The [[Vietnam War]], given lukewarm support by [[Harold Wilson]], radicalised a new generation. Significant anti-war protests were organised. Trotskyist groups like the [[International Marxist Group]] and the [[Vietnam Solidarity Campaign]] came to prominence, particularly due to high-profile members like the IMG's [[Tariq Ali]].\n\nAfter the Soviet Union's invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1968, the CPGB became to divide between Stalinists and [[Eurocommunist]]s. The party suffered a series of splits. Various [[Maoist]] inclined elements left, the most significant forming the [[Communist Party of Britain (Marxist-Leninist)]]. Later in 1977, other traditionalist pro-Russian elements left to form the [[New Communist Party of Britain|New Communist Party]].\n\nIn 1969, Wilson's Labour Government introduced ''[[In Place of Strife]]'', a white paper designed to circumvent strikes by imposing compulsory arbitration. Opposed by many trade unionists, including Home Secretary [[James Callaghan]]; it was soon withdrawn. Later legislation passed by [[Edward Heath]]'s Conservative government was successfully resisted as union militants, many close to the CPGB, led the successful [[UK miners' strike (1974)|1974 UK miners' strike]]. More ominously for the left, the unsuccessful [[Grunwick dispute]], and the 1978\u201379 [[Winter of Discontent]] were also blamed on them. The Labour leadership's failure to work with trade unions, or for their opponents an inability to keep them under control, resulted in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|election in 1979]] of an economically liberal Conservative government, led by [[Margaret Thatcher]], which finally ended the post-war political consensus.\n\n=== The 1980s ===\nAfter the 1979 Labour defeat, [[James Callaghan|Jim Callaghan]] tried in vain to keep the left-wing of the party (in which [[Tony Benn]] was prominent) and the right-wing (in which [[Roy Jenkins]] was prominent) together. In 1980, the Labour Party conference was dominated by factional disputes and what Callaghan regarded as [[Bennite]] motions. Callaghan resigned as party leader late that year and was replaced by [[Michael Foot]], a left-winger who by then had distanced himself from Benn but failed to transmit this to the media or the voters. The following year, [[Denis Healey]] only narrowly won the deputy leadership in a contest with Benn.\n\nIn 1981, thirty MPs on the right-wing of the Labour Party defected to found the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], which formed an [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and opinion polls briefly saw the new alliance appear capable of winning a general election.\n\nAt the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], Thatcher benefited from increased popularity, an after effect of the successful [[Falklands War]], and a Labour manifesto which Labour MP [[Gerald Kaufman]] described as \"the longest suicide note in history\". Labour suffered their worst election defeat since 1918 with eight and a half million votes, over three million votes down on the previous general election. Many former Labour voters had voted for the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] instead. The Alliance came close to Labour in terms of votes, but had only a fraction of its seats due to the limitations of the [[first-past-the-post]] system.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm | work=BBC News | title=1983: Thatcher triumphs again | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1983 general election, [[Neil Kinnock]], long associated with the left-wing of the Labour Party, became the new leader. By that point in time, the Labour Party was factionalised between the right, including Healey and deputy leader [[Roy Hattersley]], a \"[[soft left]]\" associated with the [[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]] group, and a \"[[hard left]]\" associated with Benn and the new [[Socialist Campaign Group|Campaign Group]].\n\nThe Trotskyist [[Militant tendency]], using [[Entryism|entryist]] tactics in the Labour Party, had gradually increased their profile. By 1982, they controlled [[Liverpool City Council]], and had a presence in many Constituency Labour Parties. The Labour NEC began to expel Militant members, beginning with their newspaper's \"editorial board\", in effect their Central Committee. A revival in [[municipal socialism]] seemed, for a time, a solution to Conservative hegemony for many on the left. The [[Greater London Council]], led by [[Ken Livingstone]], gained the most attention, seeming genuinely innovative to its support base, but the GLC was abolished by the Conservatives in 1986.\n\nThe defining event of the 1980s for British socialists was the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|1984\u20135 miners' strike]]. Miners in the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], led by [[Arthur Scargill]], struck against the closure of collieries. Despite support in the coalfields, including many miners' wives in [[Women Against Pit Closures]], the strike was eventually lost owing to a union split, amongst other reasons. The Conservatives had already begun to [[privatisation|privatise]] other state industries. Labour lost the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] by a wide margin, although it did manage to reduce the Conservative majority significantly.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393315.stm | work=BBC News | title=1987: Thatcher's third victory | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Socialism and nationalism ===\n[[Scottish independence|Scottish]] and [[Welsh nationalism]] have been the concern of many socialists. Having been raised in the nineteenth century by Liberals also calling for [[Irish Home Rule]], Scottish Home Rule became the official policy of the ILP, and of the Labour Party until 1958. [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John Maclean]] campaigned for a separate Communist Party in Scotland in the 1920s, and when the CPGB refused to support Scottish independence, he formed the [[Scottish Workers Republican Party]]. The poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], a Communist, was also an early member of the [[National Party of Scotland]]. The CPGB eventually changed their position in the 1940s.\n\nThe early nationalist parties had little connection with socialism, but by the 1980s they had become increasingly identified with the left, and in the 1990s [[Plaid Cymru]] declared itself to be a socialist party.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly]], both the [[Scottish National Party]] and Plaid have been challenged by socialists in recent years. The [[Scottish Socialist Party]], who also support [[Scottish independence]] as an immediate goal, has had recent electoral success; it won six [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] in the [[2003 Scottish Parliament election]]. [[Forward Wales]], with a less militant programme, aimed to replicate their success.\n\n[[Irish republicanism]] came to be supported by socialists in Britain. Labour's election manifestos for 1983, 1987 and 1992 included a commitment to [[United Ireland|Irish unification]] by consent.\n\n=== The 1990s ===\nIn 1989 in [[Scotland]], and 1990 for the rest of the UK, the Conservatives introduced the deeply unpopular [[Tax per head|poll tax]]. For the first time in the decade, socialists were able to organise effective opposition, culminating in the \"[[Poll tax riot]]\" on 31 March 1990. Margaret Thatcher's own party compelled her to step down on 22 November that year, and she was replaced by [[John Major]], who abolished the charge in 1991.\n\nThe CPGB dissolved itself in 1991, although their former newspaper, the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]'', continues to be published and follows the programme of the [[Communist Party of Britain]] which was founded in 1988 after an internal crisis in the CPGB led to a split. The Eurocommunists, who had controlled the party's magazine ''[[Marxism Today]]'', formed the [[Democratic Left (United Kingdom)|Democratic Left]]\n\nIn the run-up to the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], polling showed that there might be a [[hung parliament]], but possibly a small Labour majority \u2013 the party's lead on the opinion polls had shrunk and some polls had even seen the Tories creep ahead in spite of the deepening recession. In the event, the Conservatives led by [[John Major]]; won a fourth consecutive election with a majority of 21 seats. This has been attributed to both the Labour Party's premature triumphalism (in particular at the [[Sheffield Rally]]) and the Tories' \"Tax Bombshell\" advertising campaign, which highlighted the increased taxes that a Labour government would impose. This general election defeat was shortly followed by Kinnock's resignation after nearly a decade as leader. And, as had happened in the aftermath of the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election defeat]], there was widespread public and media doubt as to whether a Labour government could be elected again \u2013 without an overhaul of the party's policies, it seemed too difficult to imagine the party being able to win a general election in any situation if it had been unable to do so in the event of a recession and rising unemployment.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393317.stm | work=BBC News | title=1992: Tories win again against odds | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nAfter the brief stewardship of [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], [[Tony Blair]] was elected leader following Smith's sudden death from a heart attack in May 1994. He immediately decided to amend Clause IV, dropping Labour's commitment to public ownership of key industries and utilities, along with other socialist policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/britain1948.html|title=Britain Since 1948|website=www.localhistories.org|access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany members of the party were unhappy with the proposed changes and several unions considered using their block vote to kill the motion, but in the end their leaderships backed down and settled for a new clause declaring the Labour Party a \"democratic socialist party\". However, Labour had been ascendant in the opinion polls since the [[Black Wednesday]] economic fiasco a few months after the 1992 general election, and the increased lead of the polls under Blair's leadership remained strong in spite of the revolt, and the fact that the economy was growing again and unemployment was falling under Major's Conservative government. Labour's popularity was also helped by the fact that the Conservative government was now divided over Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://yougov.co.uk/news/2011/11/11/unity-parties-divided/|title=YouGov {{!}} Unity: Parties divided|last=|first=|date=|website=YouGov: What the world thinks|publisher=|access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nSeveral party members, such as [[Arthur Scargill]], regarded this as a betrayal of Labour's ideology and left the Labour Party. Scargill formed the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK)|Socialist Labour Party]] (SLP) which initially attracted some support, much of which transferred to the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]] on its formation, but the SA has since been wound up and the SLP has become marginalised.\n\nThe Scottish Socialist Party have proven much more successful, while Ken Livingstone became the [[Mayor of London]], standing against an official Labour Party candidate. Livingstone was re-admitted into the Labour Party in time for his re-election in 2004.\n\nUnder Blair, Labour launched a PR campaign to rebrand as ''[[New Labour]]''. The party also introduced women-only shortlists in certain seats and central vetting of Parliamentary candidates to ensure that its candidates were seen as on-message. Labour won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] with a landslide majority of 179 seats; their best result to date.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm | work=BBC News | title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule | date=15 April 2005}}</ref>\n\n==The 21st century==\n{{main|British Left}}\nThe international [[anti-globalisation movement]], while difficult to define, has become a focus for other socialists in the twenty-first century, and many see a reflection of it in the opposition of large sections of the population to the [[2003 Iraq War]].\n\nSeveral minor socialist parties merged in 2003 to form the [[Alliance for Green Socialism]] which is a socialist party that campaigns on a wide variety of policies including; economic, environmental and social.\n\nAfter [[George Galloway]]'s expulsion from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in October 2003 following his controversial statements about the war in [[Iraq]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3205889.stm|title=Galloway expelled by Labour|date=24 October 2003|accessdate=4 July 2013|work=BBC News}}</ref> he became involved in [[Respect Party|Respect \u2013 The Unity Coalition]] (later renamed the Respect Party) in an alliance with the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] and leading figures from the [[Muslim Association of Britain]].

The [[Left Unity (UK)|Left Unity]] political party was founded in November 2013 as a result of the appeal.\n\n=== United Kingdom general election, 2010 ===\n{{Main|2010 United Kingdom general election}}\n\nThe Labour Party was defeated at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], after talks of forming a coalition agreement with the Liberal Democrats failed. During their thirteen years in government, Labour made few changes to the trade union reforms passed by the previous Conservative governments, and the only nationalisation which took place during that time were of several leading banks facing collapse in the [[Late 2000s recession|recession of 2008 and 2009]] under the premiership of [[Gordon Brown]]. The Conservatives returned to power with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] as a [[coalition]] government following a [[hung parliament]]; the first in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|36 years]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8676607.stm|title=David Cameron and Nick Clegg pledge 'united' coalition|date=12 May 2010|accessdate=4 July 2013|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nOther socialists{{Who|date=July 2013}} place their hopes in a trade union revival, perhaps around the \"[[Awkward Squad (trade unions)|Awkward Squad]]\" of the more left-wing trade union leaders, many of whom have joined the [[Labour Representation Committee (2004)|Labour Representation Committee]].

Its co-convenor, [[Colin Fox (politician)|Colin Fox]], sits on the Advisory Board of the [[Yes Scotland]] campaign organisation. The party's support for Scottish independence is rooted in a belief that \"the tearing of the blue out of the Union Jack and the dismantling of the 300-year-old British state would [be] a traumatic psychological blow for the forces of capitalism and conservatism in Britain, Europe and the USA\", and that it would be \"almost as potent in its symbolism as the unravelling of the Soviet Union at the start of the 1990s\". Representatives of the party have also claimed that while the break-up of the United Kingdom would not result in \"instant socialism\", it would cause \"a decisive shift in the balance of ideological and class forces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://links.org.au/node/2323|title=Why the left should back independence|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe campaign for independence has also enjoyed support from a minority of trade unionists. In 2013, a branch of the [[Communication Workers Union (UK)|Communications Workers Union]] covering Edinburgh, Lothians, Fife, Falkirk, and Stirling voted to back a motion describing independence as \"the only way forward for workers in Scotland\", and agreeing to \"do all in our power to secure [a ''Yes''] outcome\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.stv.tv/stirling-central/216300-scottish-postal-workers-hope-to-deliver-yes-vote-for-independence/|title=Scottish postal workers hope to deliver Yes vote for independence|last=|first=|date=4 March 2013|website=STV News|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref> Additionally, the [[Scottish Trades Union Congress]] has refused to take a stance on the referendum, instead laying out \"challenges for both sides of the debate\", in particular calling on [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] to \"outline a practical vision of how social and economic justice can be achieved within the union\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuc.org.uk/news/986/a-just-scotland-stuc-publishes-interim-report-on-scotland-s-constitutional-future |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130424012659/http://www.stuc.org.uk/news/986/a-just-scotland-stuc-publishes-interim-report-on-scotland-s-constitutional-future |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 April 2013 |title=A Just Scotland \u2013 STUC publishes interim report on Scotland's constitutional future |date=25 November 2012 |accessdate=3 April 2013 }}</ref> Other left-wing sections refused to support a nationalist position, instead arguing either for working-class unity or a critical approach to both sides.

These isolated links expanded during the [[Railway Mania|railway boom of the 1840s]] into a national network, although still run by dozens of competing companies. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained (see [[railway mania]]). The entire network was brought under government control during the [[First World War]] and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were demonstrated. However, the government resisted calls for the [[nationalization|nationalisation]] of the network. In 1923, almost all the remaining companies were [[Railways Act 1921|grouped]] into the \"Big Four\": the [[Great Western Railway]], the [[London and North Eastern Railway]], the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] and the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]]. The \"Big Four\" were joint-stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947.\n\nFrom the start of 1948, the \"Big Four\" were [[nationalization|nationalised]] to form [[British Railways]]. Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Declining passenger numbers and financial losses in the late 1950s and early 1960s prompted the closure of many branch and main lines, and small stations, under the [[Beeching Axe]]. [[high-speed rail|High-speed]] inter-city trains were introduced in the 1970s. The 1980s saw severe cuts in [[rail subsidies]] and above-[[inflation]] increases in fares and losses decreased. [[Privatisation of British Rail|Railway operations were privatised]] during 1994\u20131997. Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to [[Railtrack]], whilst passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the freight services sold outright. Since privatisation, passenger volumes have increased to their highest ever level, but whether this is due to [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|privatisation is disputed]]. The [[Hatfield rail crash|Hatfield accident]] set in motion the series of events that resulted in the ultimate collapse of Railtrack and its replacement with [[Network Rail]], a state-owned, not-for-dividend company.\n\n== Before 1830: The pioneers==\n\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Great Britain to 1830}}\n\nA [[wagonway]], essentially a railway powered by animals drawing the cars or wagons, was used by German miners at [[Caldbeck]], [[Cumbria]], England, perhaps from the 1560s.<ref>Warren Allison, Samuel Murphy and Richard Smith, ''An Early Railway in the German Mines of Caldbeck'' in G.

They used simply straight and parallel rails of timber on which carts with simple flanged iron wheels were drawn by horses, enabling several wagons to be moved simultaneously. The first public railway in the world was the [[Lake Lock Rail Road]], a [[narrow gauge railway]] built near [[Wakefield]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Retracing the First Public Railway.

Its earliest \"railways\" were straight and were constructed from parallel rails of timber on which ran horse-drawn carts. These were succeeded in 1793 when [[Benjamin Outram]] constructed a mile-long tramway with L-shaped [[cast iron]] rails. These rails became obsolete when [[William Jessop]] began to manufacture cast iron rails without guiding ledges - the wheels of the carts had [[flange]]s instead. Cast iron is brittle and so the rails tended to break easily. Consequently, in 1820, [[John Birkenshaw]] introduced a method of rolling [[wrought iron]] rails, which were used from then onwards.\n\n[[Image:Horsetrain 1870.jpg|thumb|left|The first passenger service was at [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway|Oystermouth]] in 1807, photograph from 1870]]\nThe first passenger-carrying public railway was opened by the [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]] at Oystermouth in 1807, using [[horsecar|horse-drawn carriages]] on an existing [[tram]]line.\n\nIn 1802, [[Richard Trevithick]] designed and built the first (unnamed) [[steam locomotive]] to run on smooth rails.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life of Richard Trevithick: With an Account of His Inventions, Volume 1 |url=https://archive.org/details/liferichardtrev01trevgoog |last=Trevithick |first=Francis |publisher=E. & F.N.

This meant that the wheels were coupled, allowing better traction. A year later, [[George Stephenson]] improved on that design with his first locomotive ''[[Bl\u00fccher (locomotive)|Bl\u00fccher]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sapiensman.com/old_trains/english.htm |title=History of the locomotives. |accessdate=24 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205042721/http://sapiensman.com/old_trains/english.htm |archivedate=5 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which was the first locomotive to use single-flanged wheels.\n\nThat design persuaded the backers of the proposed [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] to appoint Stephenson as [[Engineer]] for the line in 1821. While traffic was originally intended to be horse-drawn, Stephenson carried out a fresh survey of the route to allow steam haulage. The Act was subsequently amended to allow the usage of steam locomotives and also to allow passengers to be carried on the railway. The 25-mile (40&nbsp;km) long route opened on 27 September 1825 and, with the aid of Stephenson's ''[[Locomotion No 1]]'', was the first locomotive-hauled public railway in the world.\n\n== 1830 &ndash; 1922: Early development==\n\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Great Britain 1830\u20131922}}\n\nIn 1830 the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] opened. This set the pattern for modern railways. It was the world's first inter-city passenger railway and the first to have 'scheduled' services, terminal stations and services as we know them today. The railways carried freight and passengers with also the world's first goods terminal station at the [[Park Lane railway goods station]] at Liverpool's south docks, accessed by the 1.26 mile [[Wapping Tunnel]]. In 1836, at the [[Liverpool]] end the line was extended to [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street station]] in Liverpool's city centre via a 1.1 mile long tunnel.\n\nMany of the first public railways were built as local rail links operated by small private railway companies. With increasing rapidity, more and more lines were built, often with scant regard for their potential for traffic. The 1840s were by far the biggest decade for railway growth. In 1840, when the decade began, railway lines in Britain were few and scattered but, within ten years, a virtually complete network had been laid down and the vast majority of towns and villages had a rail connection{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and sometimes two or three. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the pioneering independent railway companies amalgamated or were bought by competitors, until only a handful of larger companies remained (see [[Railway Mania]]).\n\nThe period also saw a steady increase in government involvement, especially in safety matters. The 1840 \"[[Railway Regulation Act 1840|Act for Regulating Railways]]\"<ref>''[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=57 1840 Railway Regulation Act]'', originally published by HMSO; link is to ''The Railways Archive''</ref> empowered the [[Board of Trade]] to appoint railway inspectors.

The \"Big Four\" were joint-stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947.\n\n[[Image:Bittern locomotive king's cross.JPG|left|thumb|The [[LNER Class A4]] [[Streamliner|streamlined]] loco hauled express trains of the 1930s offered a high-speed alternative to road transport]]\nThe competition from road transport during the 1920s and 1930s greatly reduced the revenue available to the railways, even though the needs for maintenance on the network had never been higher, as investment had been deferred over the past decade. Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage through the construction of roads subsidised by the taxpayer, while restricting the rail industry's ability to use flexible pricing because it was held to nationally agreed rate cards. The government response was to commission several inconclusive reports; the [[Salter Report]] of 1933 finally recommended that road transport should be taxed directly to fund the roads and increased [[Vehicle Excise Duty]] and fuel duties were introduced. It also noted that many small lines would never be likely to compete with road haulage. Although these road pricing changes helped their survival, the railways entered a period of slow decline, owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the companies' managements joined together, effectively operating as one company. Assisting the country's 'war effort' put a severe strain on the railways' resources and a substantial maintenance backlog developed. After 1945, for both practical and ideological reasons, the government decided to bring the rail service into the [[public sector]].\n\n== 1948 &ndash; 1994: British Rail==\n[[File:British Railways filmstrip (2).jpg|thumb|British Rail filmstrip showing how the railways were unified under BR.]]\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948\u20131994}}\nFrom the start of 1948, the railways were [[nationalization|nationalised]] to form [[British Railways]] (latterly \"British Rail\") under the control of the [[British Transport Commission]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=67| title=Transport Act 1947| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1947| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=25 November 2006}}</ref> Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable.

A patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies developed in the late 18th century. These isolated links expanded during the [[Railway Mania|railway boom of the 1840s]] into a national network, although still run by dozens of competing companies. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained (see [[railway mania]]). The entire network was brought under government control during the [[First World War]] and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were demonstrated. However, the government resisted calls for the [[nationalization|nationalisation]] of the network. In 1923, almost all the remaining companies were [[Railways Act 1921|grouped]] into the \"Big Four\": the [[Great Western Railway]], the [[London and North Eastern Railway]], the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] and the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]]. The \"Big Four\" were joint-stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947.\n\nFrom the start of 1948, the \"Big Four\" were [[nationalization|nationalised]] to form [[British Railways]]. Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Declining passenger numbers and financial losses in the late 1950s and early 1960s prompted the closure of many branch and main lines, and small stations, under the [[Beeching Axe]]. [[high-speed rail|High-speed]] inter-city trains were introduced in the 1970s. The 1980s saw severe cuts in [[rail subsidies]] and above-[[inflation]] increases in fares and losses decreased. [[Privatisation of British Rail|Railway operations were privatised]] during 1994-1997. Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to [[Railtrack]], whilst passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the freight services sold outright. Since privatisation, passenger volumes have increased to their highest ever level, but whether this is due to [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|privatisation is disputed]]. The [[Hatfield rail crash|Hatfield accident]] set in motion the series of events that resulted in the ultimate collapse of Railtrack and its replacement with [[Network Rail]], a state-owned, not-for-dividend company.\n\n== Before 1830: The pioneers==\n\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Great Britain to 1830}}\n\nA [[wagonway]], essentially a railway powered by animals drawing the cars or wagons, was used by German miners at [[Caldbeck]], [[Cumbria]], England, perhaps from the 1560s.<ref>Warren Allison, Samuel Murphy and Richard Smith, ''An Early Railway in the German Mines of Caldbeck'' in G.

They used simply straight and parallel rails of timber on which carts with simple flanged iron wheels were drawn by horses, enabling several wagons to be moved simultaneously. The first public railway in the world was the [[Lake Lock Rail Road]], a [[narrow gauge railway]] built near [[Wakefield]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Retracing the First Public Railway.

Its earliest \"railways\" were straight and were constructed from parallel rails of timber on which ran horse-drawn carts. These were succeeded in 1793 when [[Benjamin Outram]] constructed a mile-long tramway with L-shaped [[cast iron]] rails. These rails became obsolete when [[William Jessop]] began to manufacture cast iron rails without guiding ledges - the wheels of the carts had [[flange]]s instead. Cast iron is brittle and so the rails tended to break easily. Consequently, in 1820, [[John Birkenshaw]] introduced a method of rolling [[wrought iron]] rails, which were used from then onwards.\n\n[[Image:Horsetrain 1870.jpg|thumb|left|The first passenger service was at [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway|Oystermouth]] in 1807, photograph from 1870]]\nThe first passenger-carrying public railway was opened by the [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]] at Oystermouth in 1807, using [[horsecar|horse-drawn carriages]] on an existing [[tram]]line.\n\nIn 1802, [[Richard Trevithick]] designed and built the first (unnamed) [[steam locomotive]] to run on smooth rails.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life of Richard Trevithick: With an Account of His Inventions, Volume 1 |url=https://archive.org/details/liferichardtrev01trevgoog |last=Trevithick |first=Francis |publisher=E. & F.N.

This meant that the wheels were coupled, allowing better traction. A year later, [[George Stephenson]] improved on that design with his first locomotive ''[[Bl\u00fccher (locomotive)|Bl\u00fccher]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sapiensman.com/old_trains/english.htm |title=History of the locomotives. |accessdate=24 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205042721/http://sapiensman.com/old_trains/english.htm |archivedate=5 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which was the first locomotive to use single-flanged wheels.\n\nThat design persuaded the backers of the proposed [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] to appoint Stephenson as [[Engineer]] for the line in 1821. While traffic was originally intended to be horse-drawn, Stephenson carried out a fresh survey of the route to allow steam haulage. The Act was subsequently amended to allow the usage of steam locomotives and also to allow passengers to be carried on the railway. The 25-mile (40&nbsp;km) long route opened on 27 September 1825 and, with the aid of Stephenson's ''[[Locomotion No 1]]'', was the first locomotive-hauled public railway in the world.\n\n== 1830 &ndash; 1922: Early development==\n\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Great Britain 1830\u20131922}}\n\nIn 1830 the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] opened. This set the pattern for modern railways. It was the world's first inter-city passenger railway and the first to have 'scheduled' services, terminal stations and services as we know them today. The railways carried freight and passengers with also the world's first goods terminal station at the [[Park Lane railway goods station]] at Liverpool's south docks, accessed by the 1.26 mile [[Wapping Tunnel]]. In 1836, at the [[Liverpool]] end the line was extended to [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street station]] in Liverpool's city centre via a 1.1 mile long tunnel.\n\nMany of the first public railways were built as local rail links operated by small private railway companies. With increasing rapidity, more and more lines were built, often with scant regard for their potential for traffic. The 1840s were by far the biggest decade for railway growth. In 1840, when the decade began, railway lines in Britain were few and scattered but, within ten years, a virtually complete network had been laid down and the vast majority of towns and villages had a rail connection{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and sometimes two or three. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the pioneering independent railway companies amalgamated or were bought by competitors, until only a handful of larger companies remained (see [[Railway Mania]]).\n\nThe period also saw a steady increase in government involvement, especially in safety matters. The 1840 \"[[Railway Regulation Act 1840|Act for Regulating Railways]]\"<ref>''[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=57 1840 Railway Regulation Act]'', originally published by HMSO; link is to ''The Railways Archive''</ref> empowered the [[Board of Trade]] to appoint railway inspectors.

Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage through the construction of roads subsidised by the taxpayer, while restricting the rail industry's ability to use flexible pricing because it was held to nationally agreed rate cards. The government response was to commission several inconclusive reports; the [[Salter Report]] of 1933 finally recommended that road transport should be taxed directly to fund the roads and increased [[Vehicle Excise Duty]] and fuel duties were introduced. It also noted that many small lines would never be likely to compete with road haulage. Although these road pricing changes helped their survival, the railways entered a period of slow decline, owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the companies' managements joined together, effectively operating as one company. Assisting the country's 'war effort' put a severe strain on the railways' resources and a substantial maintenance backlog developed. After 1945, for both practical and ideological reasons, the government decided to bring the rail service into the [[public sector]].\n\n== 1948 &ndash; 1994: British Rail==\n[[File:British Railways filmstrip (2).jpg|thumb|British Rail filmstrip showing how the railways were unified under BR.]]\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948\u20131994}}\nFrom the start of 1948, the railways were [[nationalization|nationalised]] to form [[British Railways]] (latterly \"British Rail\") under the control of the [[British Transport Commission]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=67| title=Transport Act 1947| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1947| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=25 November 2006}}</ref> Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Regeneration of track and stations was completed by 1954. Rail revenue fell and, in 1955, the network again ceased to be profitable.

TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)\"\n* \"Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes.

Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, Nebraska; Omaha, Nebraska; Nebraska City, Nebraska; St. Joseph, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\"\n* \"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface.

TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year.

In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\"\n* \"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska.
