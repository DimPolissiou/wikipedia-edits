At that time, the National Defense Commission was a commission subordinate to the Central People\u2019s Committee, which was the highest leadership institution in North Korea from 1972 until 1998.\n\nThe 1972 North Korean constitution stated that the [[President of North Korea]] is also the Chairman of the National Defense Commission, as well as the supreme commander of the country\u2019s armed forces. [[Kim Il-sung]], who was the President of North Korea, was the Chairman of the National Defense Commission from 28 December 1972 until 9 April 1993.\n\nOn 22 May 1992, the position became known as the '''Chairman of the National Defense Commission of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea''' (Korean: \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d \uad6d\ubc29\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \uc704\uc6d0\uc7a5) following the approval of an amendment to the 1972 constitution that made the National Defense Commission into a separate institution from the Central People\u2019s Committee. The amendment expanded the Chairman\u2019s powers to become the head of the highest military leadership institution in North Korea.\n\nThe 1992 constitutional amendment no longer required the President to also be the Chairman of the National Defense Commission and the supreme commander of the armed forces. This allowed [[Kim Jong-il]], who is Kim Il-sung\u2019s designated successor, to be elected as Chairman of the National Defense Commission on 9 April 1993. Prior to his election, Kim Jong-il was elected as first vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission on 24 May 1990 and became the supreme commander of the [[Korean People's Army|Korean People\u2019s Army]] on 24 December 1991.\n\nFollowing [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|Kim Il-sung\u2019s death on 8 July 1994]], another constitutional amendment was approved on 5 September 1998 which further expanded the powers of the Chairman of the National Defense Commission. The amendment enshrined Kim Il-sung as North Korea\u2019s eternal President and abolished the position. While it is not stated by the amended constitution, the National Defense Commission became the de facto highest leadership institution in the country with its Chairman holding the highest office of the state.\n\nDespite the 1998 constitutional amendment effectively making the Chairman of the National Defense Commission the highest office in North Korea, it did not have the status of head of state. The [[President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly|President of the Presidium of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly]] was designated as the country\u2019s head of state from 1998 until 2019.\n\nOn 9 April 2009, the powers of the Chairman of the National Defense Commission was expanded through another constitutional amendment. The amendment designated the Chairman as the supreme leader of the country. The Chairman was given the power to direct all state affairs and conclude important treaties with foreign countries. The Chairman can also appoint or dismiss important national defense officials, grant special pardons, declare a state of emergency and a state of war and issue mobilization order.\n\nAfter his election as Chairman of the National Defense Commission in 1993, Kim Jong-il was re-elected in September 1998, September 2003 and April 2009, and served in this position until [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|his death on 17 December 2011]].\n\n=== First Chairman of the National Defense Commission ===\nFollowing Kim Jong Il\u2019s death, the position of Chairman of the National Defense Commission remained vacant from December 2011 until April 2012.\n\nA constitutional amendment was approved on 13 April 2012 which enshrined Kim Jong Il as the '''eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea''' (Korean: \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d \uc601\uc6d0\ud55c \uad6d\ubc29\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \uc704\uc6d0\uc7a5). The amendment also created the position of '''First Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea''' (Korean: \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d \uad6d\ubc29\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \uc81c1\uc704\uc6d0\uc7a5) which was designated as the supreme leader of the country.\n\nKim Jong-un, who is Kim Jong-il\u2019s designated successor, was elected as first Chairman of the National Defense Commission on 13 April 2012 and was re-elected in April 2014.\n\n=== Chairman of the State Affairs Commission ===\nOn 29 June 2016, a constitutional amendment was approved that created the State Affairs Commission to replace the National Defense Commission as the highest leadership institution in North Korea. The amendment also created the position of Chairman of the State Affairs Commission.\n\nKim Jong-un was elected as Chairman of the State Affairs Commission on 29 June 2016 and was re-elected on 11 April 2019.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOn 11 April 2019, the constitution was amended to make the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission the head of state of North Korea. Another constitutional amendment on 29 August of the same year gave the Chairman the power to promulgate the ordinances of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly and the decrees and decisions of the State Affairs Commission and appoint North Korea\u2019s diplomatic representatives to foreign countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/north-korea-changes-constitution-to-solidify-kim-jong-uns-rule.html|title=North Korea changes constitution to solidify Kim Jong Un's rule|date=2019-08-30|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n== Election ==\nAccording to the Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission is elected by the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> It requires that the election should be according to the \u201cconsensus of the entire Korean people.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe election of the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission takes place during a session of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly.<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea]] sends a proposal to the Supreme People's Assembly for a candidate to be elected as the SAC Chairman.

At that time, the National Defense Commission was a commission subordinate to the Central People\u2019s Committee, which was the highest leadership institution in North Korea from 1972 until 1998.\n\nThe 1972 North Korean constitution stated that the [[President of North Korea]] is also the Chairman of the National Defense Commission, as well as the supreme commander of the country\u2019s armed forces. [[Kim Il-sung]], who was the President of North Korea, was the Chairman of the National Defense Commission from 28 December 1972 until 9 April 1993.\n\nOn 22 May 1992, the position became known as the '''Chairman of the National Defense Commission of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea''' (Korean: \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d \uad6d\ubc29\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \uc704\uc6d0\uc7a5) following the approval of an amendment to the 1972 constitution that made the National Defense Commission into a separate institution from the Central People\u2019s Committee. The amendment expanded the Chairman\u2019s powers to become the head of the highest military leadership institution in North Korea.\n\nThe 1992 constitutional amendment no longer required the President to also be the Chairman of the National Defense Commission and the supreme commander of the armed forces. This allowed [[Kim Jong-il]], who is Kim Il-sung\u2019s designated successor, to be elected as Chairman of the National Defense Commission on 9 April 1993. Prior to his election, Kim Jong-il was elected as first vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission on 24 May 1990 and became the supreme commander of the [[Korean People's Army|Korean People\u2019s Army]] on 24 December 1991.\n\nFollowing [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|Kim Il-sung\u2019s death on 8 July 1994]], another constitutional amendment was approved on 5 September 1998 which further expanded the powers of the Chairman of the National Defense Commission. The amendment enshrined Kim Il-sung as North Korea\u2019s eternal President and abolished the position. While it is not stated by the amended constitution, the National Defense Commission became the de facto highest leadership institution in the country with its Chairman holding the highest office of the state.\n\nDespite the 1998 constitutional amendment effectively making the Chairman of the National Defense Commission the highest office in North Korea, it did not have the status of head of state. The [[President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly|President of the Presidium of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly]] was designated as the country\u2019s head of state from 1998 until 2019.\n\nOn 9 April 2009, the powers of the Chairman of the National Defense Commission was expanded through another constitutional amendment. The amendment designated the Chairman as the supreme leader of the country. The Chairman was given the power to direct all state affairs and conclude important treaties with foreign countries. The Chairman can also appoint or dismiss important national defense officials, grant special pardons, declare a state of emergency and a state of war and issue mobilization order.\n\nAfter his election as Chairman of the National Defense Commission in 1993, Kim Jong-il was re-elected in September 1998, September 2003 and April 2009, and served in this position until [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|his death on 17 December 2011]].\n\n=== First Chairman of the National Defense Commission ===\nFollowing Kim Jong Il\u2019s death, the position of Chairman of the National Defense Commission remained vacant from December 2011 until April 2012.\n\nA constitutional amendment was approved on 13 April 2012 which enshrined Kim Jong Il as the '''eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea''' (Korean: \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d \uc601\uc6d0\ud55c \uad6d\ubc29\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \uc704\uc6d0\uc7a5). The amendment also created the position of '''First Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea''' (Korean: \uc870\uc120\ubbfc\uc8fc\uc8fc\uc758\uc778\ubbfc\uacf5\ud654\uad6d \uad6d\ubc29\uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \uc81c1\uc704\uc6d0\uc7a5) which was designated as the supreme leader of the country.\n\nKim Jong-un, who is Kim Jong-il\u2019s designated successor, was elected as first Chairman of the National Defense Commission on 13 April 2012 and was re-elected in April 2014.\n\n=== Chairman of the State Affairs Commission ===\nOn 29 June 2016, a constitutional amendment was approved that created the State Affairs Commission to replace the National Defense Commission as the highest leadership institution in North Korea. The amendment also created the position of Chairman of the State Affairs Commission.\n\nKim Jong-un was elected as Chairman of the State Affairs Commission on 29 June 2016 and was re-elected on 11 April 2019.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOn 11 April 2019, the constitution was amended to make the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission the head of state of North Korea. Another constitutional amendment on 29 August of the same year gave the Chairman the power to promulgate the ordinances of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly and the decrees and decisions of the State Affairs Commission and appoint North Korea\u2019s diplomatic representatives to foreign countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/north-korea-changes-constitution-to-solidify-kim-jong-uns-rule.html|title=North Korea changes constitution to solidify Kim Jong Un's rule|date=2019-08-30|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n== Election ==\nAccording to the Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission is elected by the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> It requires that the election should be according to the \u201cconsensus of the entire Korean people.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe election of the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission takes place during a session of the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly.<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea]] sends a proposal to the Supreme People's Assembly for a candidate to be elected as the SAC Chairman.

Then, the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly unanimously votes for the candidate.

[[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples first settled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina in 3200 BC. During the [[Eneolithic]] period, the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]], several Indo-European archaeological cultures were centered in or around Vojvodina, including the [[Vu\u010dedol culture]], the [[Vatin culture]], and the [[Bosut culture]], among others.\n\nBefore the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC, Indo-European peoples of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], [[Thracian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] origin inhabited this area. The first states organized in this area were the Celtic [[Scordisci|State of the Scordisci]] (3rd century BC-1st century AD) with capital in [[Singidunum]] ([[Belgrade]]), and the [[Dacian Kingdom]] of [[Burebista]] (1st century BC).\n\nDuring Roman rule, [[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was one of the four capital cities of the [[Roman Empire]], and six [[Roman Emperors]] were born in this city or in its surroundings. The city was also the capital of several Roman administrative units, including [[Pannonia Inferior]], [[Pannonia Secunda]], the [[Diocese of Pannonia]], and the [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]].\n\nRoman rule lasted until the 5th century, after which the region came into the possession of various peoples and states. While [[Banat]] was a part of the Roman province of [[Dacia]], [[Syrmia]] belonged to the Roman province of [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]]. [[Ba\u010dka]] was not part of the Roman Empire and was populated and ruled by Sarmatian [[Iazyges]].\n\n===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===\nAfter the Romans were driven away from this region, various Indo-European and Turkic peoples and states ruled in the area. These peoples included Goths, Sarmatians, Huns, Gepids and Avars. For regional history, the largest in importance was a Gepid state, which had its capital in Sirmium. According to the 7th-century ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'', [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] gave the region of Syrmia to a Bulgar leader named [[Kuber]] circa 680. The Bulgars of Kuber moved south with Maurus to Macedonia where they co-operated with [[Tervel]] in the 8th century.\n[[File:Ara\u010da 5.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Ara\u010da]] church]]\n[[Slavs]] settled today's Vojvodina in the 6th and 7th centuries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Vojvodina/997/Slovenski-grobovi-uz-reku-Galadsku|title=Slovenski grobovi uz reku Galadsku|publisher=Blic.rs|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the Balkans. Slavic tribes that lived in the territory of present-day Vojvodina included Abodrites, Severans, Brani\u010devci and Timo\u010dani.\n\nIn the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the Bulgarian Empire, [[Great Moravia]] and Ljudevit's Pannonian Duchy. During the Bulgarian administration (9th century), local Bulgarian dukes, [[Salan]] and [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], ruled over the region. Salan's residence was Titel, while that of Glad was possibly in the rumoured rampart of Galad or perhaps in the Kladovo (Gladovo) in eastern Serbia. Glad's descendant was the duke Ahtum, another local ruler from the 11th century who opposed the establishment of Hungarian rule over the region.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn the village of [[\u010celarevo]] archaeologists have also found traces of people who practised the Judaic religion. Bunard\u017ei\u0107 dated Avar-Bulgar graves excavated in \u010celarevo, containing skulls with Mongolian features and Judaic symbols, to the late 8th and 9th centuries. Erdely and Vilkhnovich consider the graves to belong to the [[Kabars]] who eventually broke ties with the Khazar Empire between the 830s and 862. (Three other [[Khazar]] tribes joined the [[Magyars]] and took part in the Magyar conquest of the Carpathian basin including what is now Vojvodina in 895\u2013907.){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Hungarian rule===\n[[File:\u0411\u0410\u0427,\u0412\u041e\u0408\u0412\u041e\u0414\u0418\u041d\u0410,\u0421\u0420\u0411\u0418\u0408\u0410..,,.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ba\u010d Fortress]]]]\nFollowing territorial disputes with Byzantine and Bulgarian states, most of Vojvodina became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between 10th and 12th century and remained under Hungarian administration until the 16th century (Following periods of Ottoman and Habsburg administrations, Hungarian political dominance over most of the region was established again in 1867 and over entire region in 1882, after abolition of the Habsburg Military Frontier).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe regional demographic balance started changing in the 11th century when Magyars began to replace the local Slavic population.

In 1526 [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|Jovan Nenad]], a leader of Serb mercenaries, established his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Syrmia]]. He created an ephemeral independent state, with [[Subotica]] as its capital.\n\nAt the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself Serbian Emperor in Subotica. Taking advantage of the extremely confused military and political situation, the Hungarian noblemen from the region joined forces against him and defeated the Serbian troops in the summer of 1527. Emperor Jovan Nenad was assassinated and his state collapsed. After the fall of emperor's state, the supreme military commander of Jovan Nenad's army, [[Radoslav \u010celnik]], established his own temporary state in the region of Syrmia, where he ruled as Ottoman vassal.\n\nA few decades later, the whole region was added to the [[Ottoman Empire]], which ruled over it until the end of the 17th and the first half of the 18th century, when it was incorporated into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] of 1699, between [[Great Turkish War|Holy League]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], marked the withdrawal of the Ottoman forces from [[Central Europe]], and the supremacy of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in that part of the continent. According to the treaty, the western part of Vojvodina passed to Habsburgs. The eastern part (eastern Syrmia and [[Teme\u015fvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Province of Tam\u0131\u015fvar]]) remained in Ottoman hands until Austrian conquest in 1716. This new border change was ratified by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] in 1718.\n\n===Habsburg rule===\n\n====Hungarian Crown land (1699\u20131849)====\nDuring the [[Great Serb Migrations|Great Serb Migration]], Serbs from Ottoman territories settled in the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the 17th century (in 1690). Most settled in what is now Hungary, with the lesser part settling in western Vojvodina. All Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy gained the status of a recognized nation with extensive rights, in exchange for providing a border militia (in the [[Military Frontier]]) that could be mobilized against invaders from the south (such as the Ottomans), as well as in case of civil unrest in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAt the beginning of Habsburg rule, most of the region was integrated into the Military Frontier, while western parts of Ba\u010dka were put under civil administration within the County of Ba\u010d. Later, the civil administration was expanded to other (mostly northern) parts of the region, while southern parts remained under military administration. The eastern part of this area was held again by the [[Ottoman Empire]] between 1787\u201388, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792)|Russo-Turkish War]]. In 1716, [[Vienna]] temporarily forbade settlement by Hungarians and Jews in the area, while large numbers of German speakers were settled in the region from Bavaria and southern areas, in order to repopulate it and develop agriculture. From 1782, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Hungarians and [[ethnic Germans]] settled in larger numbers.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Serbia and Vojvodina 1848.png|thumb|left|Proclaimed borders of Serbian Vojvodina at the May Assembly (1848) and autonomous Ottoman [[Principality of Serbia]]]]\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848\u201349 revolutions]], Vojvodina was a site of war between Serbs and Hungarians, due to the opposite national conceptions of these two peoples. At the [[May Assembly]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]] (13\u201315 May 1848), Serbs declared the constitution of the ''[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]]'' (''Serbian Duchy''), a Serbian autonomous region within the [[Austrian Empire]].

By this decision, the Serbian autonomous region created in 1848 was transformed into the new Austrian [[crown land]] known as '''[[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]'''.

But, Banat was a separate autonomous region ruled by its ethnic German minority. \n\nThe occupying powers committed numerous crimes against the civilian population, especially against Serbs, Jews and Roma; the Jewish population of Vojvodina was almost completely killed or deported. In total, Axis (German, Croatian and Hungarian) occupational authorities killed about 50,000 citizens of Vojvodina (mostly Serbs, Jews and Roma) while more than 280,000 people were interned, arrested, violated or tortured.<ref>Popov, Dr Du\u0161an, ''Vojvodina, Enciklopedija Novog Sada, sveska 5'', Novi Sad, 1996, pg. 196.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Many historians and authors describe the [[Ustashe]] regime's mass killings as [[Persecution of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia|genocide of the Serbs]], including [[Raphael Lemkin]].

During and after the military administration, several thousands of citizens were killed. Victims were mostly ethnic Germans, but Hungarian and Serb populations were also killed. Both the war-time Axis occupational authorities and the post-war communist authorities ran concentration/prison camps in the territory of Vojvodina. (see [[List of concentration and internment camps]]). While war-time prisoners in these camps were mostly Jews, Serbs and communists, post-war camps were formed for ethnic Germans (historically known as [[Danube Swabians]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMost Vojvodina ethnic Germans (about 200,000) fled the region in 1944, together with the defeated German army.<ref>Dragomir Jankov, ''Vojvodina \u2013 propadanje jednog regiona'', Novi Sad, 2004, page 76.</ref> Most of those who remained in the region (about 150,000) were sent to some of the villages cordoned off as prisons.

Instead of the previous name (Danube Banovina), the region regained its historical name of Vojvodina, while its capital city remained Novi Sad. When the final borders of Vojvodina were defined, Baranja was assigned to Croatia, while the northern part of the Ma\u010dva region was assigned to Vojvodina.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFor decades, the province enjoyed only a small level of autonomy within Serbia. Under the 1974 Yugoslav constitution, it gained extensive rights of self-rule, as both Kosovo and Vojvodina were given ''de facto'' veto power in the Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments. Changes to their status could not be made without the consent of the two Provincial Assemblies.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe 1974 Serbian constitution, adopted at the same time, reiterated that \"the Socialist Republic of Serbia comprises the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] and the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], which originated in the common struggle of nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia in the National Liberation War (the Second World War) and socialist revolution\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nUnder the rule of Serbian president [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], a series of protests against Vojvodina's party leadership took place during the summer and autumn of 1988, which forced it to resign. Eventually Vojvodina and Kosovo had to accept Serbia's constitutional amendments that practically dismissed the autonomy of the provinces in Serbia. Vojvodina and Kosovo lost elements of statehood in September 1990 when the new constitution of the Republic of Serbia was adopted.\n\nVojvodina was still referred to as an autonomous province of Serbia, but most of its autonomous powers \u2013 including, crucially, its vote on the Yugoslav collective presidency \u2013 were transferred to the control of Belgrade, the capital. The province still had its own parliament and government, and some other autonomous functions as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/dissertationen/tomic-dorde-2014-11-28/PDF/tomic.pdf|title=\"Phantomgrenzen\" in Zeiten des Umbruchs \u2013 die Autonomieidee in der Vojvodina der 1990er Jahre|author=\u0110or\u0111e Tomi\u0107|date=28 November 2014}} Dissertation.

Monthly and weekly publications in minority languages include ''[[Hrvatska rije\u010d]]'' (\"Croatian Word\") in Croatian, ''[[Hlas \u013dudu]]'' (\"The Voice of the People\") in Slovak, ''[[Libertatea (Vojvodina)|Libertatea]]'' (\"Freedom\") in Romanian, and ''[[Ruske slovo|\u0420\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e]]'' (\"Rusyn Word\") in Rusyn. There is also ''[[Bunjeva\u010dke novine]]'' (\"The Bunjevac newspaper\") in Bunjevac.\n\nPublic Broadcasting Service of Vojvodina was founded in 1974 as Radio Television of Novi Sad, as an equal member of the association of JRT \u2013 Yugoslav Radio Television. Radio Novi Sad's first broadcast was on November 29, 1949. During the NATO bombing in the spring of 1999, the RT Novi Sad building of 20 thousand square meters was completely destroyed along with its basic production and technical premises . The Venac terrestrial broadcasting site was heavily damaged.\n\nThe Radio-Television of Vojvodina produces and broadcasts regional programming on two channels, RTV1 (Serbian language) and RTV2 (minority languages), and three radio frequencies: Radio Novi Sad 1 (Serbian), Radio Novi Sad 2 (Hungarian), Radio Novi Sad 3 (other minority communities).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=Radio-Television of Vojvodina|accessdate=22 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Serbia Vojka from southwest IMG 9207.JPG|thumb|right|Vojvodina is known as ''Serbia's breadbasket'']]\nThe economy of Vojvodina is largely based on developed food industry and fertile agricultural soil. Agriculture is a priority sector in Vojvodina. Traditionally, it has always been a significant part of the local economy and a generator of positive results, due to the abundance of fertile agricultural land which makes up 84% of its territory. The share of agribusiness in the total industrial production is 40%, that is 30% in the total exports of Vojvodina.\n\nThe metal industry of Vojvodina has a long tradition and consists of smaller metal processing companies for components manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, of original equipment manufacturers (OEM) with their own brand name products. Vojvodina Metal Cluster gathers 116 companies with 6,300 employees. Other branches of industry are also developed such as the chemical industry, electrical industry, oil industry and construction industry. In the past decade, ICT sector has been growing rapidly and has taken significant role in Vojvodina's economic development.\n\nHigh- tech sector is a fast-growing sector in Vojvodina. Software development represents the main source of revenue, particularly development of ERP solutions, Java applications and mobile applications. IT sector companies mainly deal with software outsourcing, based on demands of international clients or with development of their own software products for purposes of domestic and international market.\nVojvodina pays particular attention to interregional and cross-border economic cooperation, as well as to implementation of priorities defined within the EU Strategy for the Danube Region.<ref name=\"vojvodina.gov.rs\"/>\n\nSome of the companies from Vojvodina:\n*[[Naftna Industrija Srbije]]\n*[[Srbijagas]]\n*[[HIP Petrohemija]]\n*[[Apatin Brewery]]\n*[[Novi Sad Fair|Novosadski sajam]]\n\nVojvodina promotes its investment potentials through the [[Vojvodina Investment Promotion]] (VIP) agency, which was founded by the Parliament of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.\n\n===Transport===\nThere are many important roads which pass through Vojvodina. First of all, the motorway [[A1 (Serbia)|A1 motorway]] which goes from Central Europe and the Horgos border crossing to Hungary, via Novi Sad to Belgrade and further to the southeast toward Ni\u0161, where it branches: one way leads east to the border with Bulgaria; the other to the south, towards Greece. Motorway [[A3 (Serbia)|A3]] in Srem separates the west, towards the neighboring Croatia and further to Western Europe. There is also a network of regional and local roads and railway lines.\n\nThe three largest rivers in Vojvodina are navigable stream. Danube River with a length of 588 kilometers and its tributaries Tisa (168&nbsp;km), Sava (206&nbsp;km) and Bega (75&nbsp;km). Among them was dug extensive network of irrigation canals, drainage and transport, with a total length of {{cvt|939|km}}, of which {{cvt|673|km}} navigable.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Vojvodina}}\nTourist destinations in Vojvodina include well known [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monasteries on [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] mountain, numerous hunting grounds, cultural-historical monuments, different folklores, interesting galleries and museums, plain landscapes with a lot of greenery, big rivers, canals and lakes, sandy terrain [[Deliblatska Pe\u0161\u010dara]] (\"the European Sahara\"), etc.\nIn the last few years, [[Exit (festival)|Exit]] has been very popular among the European summer music festivals.<ref>{{cite

[[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples first settled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina in 3200 BC. During the [[Eneolithic]] period, the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]], several Indo-European archaeological cultures were centered in or around Vojvodina, including the [[Vu\u010dedol culture]], the [[Vatin culture]], and the [[Bosut culture]], among others.\n\nBefore the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC, Indo-European peoples of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], [[Thracian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] origin inhabited this area. The first states organized in this area were the Celtic [[Scordisci|State of the Scordisci]] (3rd century BC-1st century AD) with capital in [[Singidunum]] ([[Belgrade]]), and the [[Dacian Kingdom]] of [[Burebista]] (1st century BC).\n\nDuring Roman rule, [[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was one of the four capital cities of the [[Roman Empire]], and six [[Roman Emperors]] were born in this city or in its surroundings. The city was also the capital of several Roman administrative units, including [[Pannonia Inferior]], [[Pannonia Secunda]], the [[Diocese of Pannonia]], and the [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]].\n\nRoman rule lasted until the 5th century, after which the region came into the possession of various peoples and states. While [[Banat]] was a part of the Roman province of [[Dacia]], [[Syrmia]] belonged to the Roman province of [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]]. [[Ba\u010dka]] was not part of the Roman Empire and was populated and ruled by Sarmatian [[Iazyges]].\n\n===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===\nAfter the Romans were driven away from this region, various Indo-European and Turkic peoples and states ruled in the area. These peoples included Goths, Sarmatians, Huns, Gepids and Avars. For regional history, the largest in importance was a Gepid state, which had its capital in Sirmium. According to the 7th-century ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'', [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] gave the region of Syrmia to a Bulgar leader named [[Kuber]] circa 680. The Bulgars of Kuber moved south with Maurus to Macedonia where they co-operated with [[Tervel]] in the 8th century.\n[[File:Ara\u010da 5.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Ara\u010da]] church]]\n[[Slavs]] settled today's Vojvodina in the 6th and 7th centuries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Vojvodina/997/Slovenski-grobovi-uz-reku-Galadsku|title=Slovenski grobovi uz reku Galadsku|publisher=Blic.rs|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the Balkans. Slavic tribes that lived in the territory of present-day Vojvodina included Abodrites, Severans, Brani\u010devci and Timo\u010dani.\n\nIn the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the Bulgarian Empire, [[Great Moravia]] and Ljudevit's Pannonian Duchy. During the Bulgarian administration (9th century), local Bulgarian dukes, [[Salan]] and [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], ruled over the region. Salan's residence was Titel, while that of Glad was possibly in the rumoured rampart of Galad or perhaps in the Kladovo (Gladovo) in eastern Serbia. Glad's descendant was the duke Ahtum, another local ruler from the 11th century who opposed the establishment of Hungarian rule over the region.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn the village of [[\u010celarevo]] archaeologists have also found traces of people who practised the Judaic religion. Bunard\u017ei\u0107 dated Avar-Bulgar graves excavated in \u010celarevo, containing skulls with Mongolian features and Judaic symbols, to the late 8th and 9th centuries. Erdely and Vilkhnovich consider the graves to belong to the [[Kabars]] who eventually broke ties with the Khazar Empire between the 830s and 862. (Three other [[Khazar]] tribes joined the [[Magyars]] and took part in the Magyar conquest of the Carpathian basin including what is now Vojvodina in 895\u2013907.){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Hungarian rule===\n[[File:\u0411\u0410\u0427,\u0412\u041e\u0408\u0412\u041e\u0414\u0418\u041d\u0410,\u0421\u0420\u0411\u0418\u0408\u0410..,,.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ba\u010d Fortress]]]]\nFollowing territorial disputes with Byzantine and Bulgarian states, most of Vojvodina became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between 10th and 12th century and remained under Hungarian administration until the 16th century (Following periods of Ottoman and Habsburg administrations, Hungarian political dominance over most of the region was established again in 1867 and over entire region in 1882, after abolition of the Habsburg Military Frontier).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe regional demographic balance started changing in the 11th century when Magyars began to replace the local Slavic population.

In 1526 [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|Jovan Nenad]], a leader of Serb mercenaries, established his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Syrmia]]. He created an ephemeral independent state, with [[Subotica]] as its capital.\n\nAt the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself Serbian Emperor in Subotica. Taking advantage of the extremely confused military and political situation, the Hungarian noblemen from the region joined forces against him and defeated the Serbian troops in the summer of 1527. Emperor Jovan Nenad was assassinated and his state collapsed. After the fall of emperor's state, the supreme military commander of Jovan Nenad's army, [[Radoslav \u010celnik]], established his own temporary state in the region of Syrmia, where he ruled as Ottoman vassal.\n\nA few decades later, the whole region was added to the [[Ottoman Empire]], which ruled over it until the end of the 17th and the first half of the 18th century, when it was incorporated into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] of 1699, between [[Great Turkish War|Holy League]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], marked the withdrawal of the Ottoman forces from [[Central Europe]], and the supremacy of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in that part of the continent. According to the treaty, the western part of Vojvodina passed to Habsburgs. The eastern part (eastern Syrmia and [[Teme\u015fvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Province of Tam\u0131\u015fvar]]) remained in Ottoman hands until Austrian conquest in 1716. This new border change was ratified by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] in 1718.\n\n===Habsburg rule===\n\n====Hungarian Crown land (1699\u20131849)====\nDuring the [[Great Serb Migrations|Great Serb Migration]], Serbs from Ottoman territories settled in the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the 17th century (in 1690). Most settled in what is now Hungary, with the lesser part settling in western Vojvodina. All Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy gained the status of a recognized nation with extensive rights, in exchange for providing a border militia (in the [[Military Frontier]]) that could be mobilized against invaders from the south (such as the Ottomans), as well as in case of civil unrest in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAt the beginning of Habsburg rule, most of the region was integrated into the Military Frontier, while western parts of Ba\u010dka were put under civil administration within the County of Ba\u010d. Later, the civil administration was expanded to other (mostly northern) parts of the region, while southern parts remained under military administration. The eastern part of this area was held again by the [[Ottoman Empire]] between 1787\u201388, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792)|Russo-Turkish War]]. In 1716, [[Vienna]] temporarily forbade settlement by Hungarians and Jews in the area, while large numbers of German speakers were settled in the region from Bavaria and southern areas, in order to repopulate it and develop agriculture. From 1782, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Hungarians and [[ethnic Germans]] settled in larger numbers.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Serbia and Vojvodina 1848.png|thumb|left|Proclaimed borders of Serbian Vojvodina at the May Assembly (1848) and autonomous Ottoman [[Principality of Serbia]]]]\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848\u201349 revolutions]], Vojvodina was a site of war between Serbs and Hungarians, due to the opposite national conceptions of these two peoples. At the [[May Assembly]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]] (13\u201315 May 1848), Serbs declared the constitution of the ''[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]]'' (''Serbian Duchy''), a Serbian autonomous region within the [[Austrian Empire]].

By this decision, the Serbian autonomous region created in 1848 was transformed into the new Austrian [[crown land]] known as '''[[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]'''.

During and after the military administration, several thousands of citizens were killed. Victims were mostly ethnic Germans, but Hungarian and Serb populations were also killed. Both the war-time Axis occupational authorities and the post-war communist authorities ran concentration/prison camps in the territory of Vojvodina. (see [[List of concentration and internment camps]]). While war-time prisoners in these camps were mostly Jews, Serbs and communists, post-war camps were formed for ethnic Germans (historically known as [[Danube Swabians]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMost Vojvodina ethnic Germans (about 200,000) fled the region in 1944, together with the defeated German army.<ref>Dragomir Jankov, ''Vojvodina \u2013 propadanje jednog regiona'', Novi Sad, 2004, page 76.</ref> Most of those who remained in the region (about 150,000) were sent to some of the villages cordoned off as prisons.

Instead of the previous name (Danube Banovina), the region regained its historical name of Vojvodina, while its capital city remained Novi Sad. When the final borders of Vojvodina were defined, Baranja was assigned to Croatia, while the northern part of the Ma\u010dva region was assigned to Vojvodina.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFor decades, the province enjoyed only a small level of autonomy within Serbia. Under the 1974 Yugoslav constitution, it gained extensive rights of self-rule, as both Kosovo and Vojvodina were given ''de facto'' veto power in the Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments. Changes to their status could not be made without the consent of the two Provincial Assemblies.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe 1974 Serbian constitution, adopted at the same time, reiterated that \"the Socialist Republic of Serbia comprises the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] and the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], which originated in the common struggle of nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia in the National Liberation War (the Second World War) and socialist revolution\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nUnder the rule of Serbian president [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], a series of protests against Vojvodina's party leadership took place during the summer and autumn of 1988, which forced it to resign. Eventually Vojvodina and Kosovo had to accept Serbia's constitutional amendments that practically dismissed the autonomy of the provinces in Serbia. Vojvodina and Kosovo lost elements of statehood in September 1990 when the new constitution of the Republic of Serbia was adopted.\n\nVojvodina was still referred to as an autonomous province of Serbia, but most of its autonomous powers \u2013 including, crucially, its vote on the Yugoslav collective presidency \u2013 were transferred to the control of Belgrade, the capital. The province still had its own parliament and government, and some other autonomous functions as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/dissertationen/tomic-dorde-2014-11-28/PDF/tomic.pdf|title=\"Phantomgrenzen\" in Zeiten des Umbruchs \u2013 die Autonomieidee in der Vojvodina der 1990er Jahre|author=\u0110or\u0111e Tomi\u0107|date=28 November 2014}} Dissertation.

Monthly and weekly publications in minority languages include ''[[Hrvatska rije\u010d]]'' (\"Croatian Word\") in Croatian, ''[[Hlas \u013dudu]]'' (\"The Voice of the People\") in Slovak, ''[[Libertatea (Vojvodina)|Libertatea]]'' (\"Freedom\") in Romanian, and ''[[Ruske slovo|\u0420\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e]]'' (\"Rusyn Word\") in Rusyn. There is also ''[[Bunjeva\u010dke novine]]'' (\"The Bunjevac newspaper\") in Bunjevac.\n\nPublic Broadcasting Service of Vojvodina was founded in 1974 as Radio Television of Novi Sad, as an equal member of the association of JRT \u2013 Yugoslav Radio Television. Radio Novi Sad's first broadcast was on November 29, 1949. During the NATO bombing in the spring of 1999, the RT Novi Sad building of 20 thousand square meters was completely destroyed along with its basic production and technical premises . The Venac terrestrial broadcasting site was heavily damaged.\n\nThe Radio-Television of Vojvodina produces and broadcasts regional programming on two channels, RTV1 (Serbian language) and RTV2 (minority languages), and three radio frequencies: Radio Novi Sad 1 (Serbian), Radio Novi Sad 2 (Hungarian), Radio Novi Sad 3 (other minority communities).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=Radio-Television of Vojvodina|accessdate=22 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Serbia Vojka from southwest IMG 9207.JPG|thumb|right|Vojvodina is known as ''Serbia's breadbasket'']]\nThe economy of Vojvodina is largely based on developed food industry and fertile agricultural soil. Agriculture is a priority sector in Vojvodina. Traditionally, it has always been a significant part of the local economy and a generator of positive results, due to the abundance of fertile agricultural land which makes up 84% of its territory. The share of agribusiness in the total industrial production is 40%, that is 30% in the total exports of Vojvodina.\n\nThe metal industry of Vojvodina has a long tradition and consists of smaller metal processing companies for components manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, of original equipment manufacturers (OEM) with their own brand name products. Vojvodina Metal Cluster gathers 116 companies with 6,300 employees. Other branches of industry are also developed such as the chemical industry, electrical industry, oil industry and construction industry. In the past decade, ICT sector has been growing rapidly and has taken significant role in Vojvodina's economic development.\n\nHigh- tech sector is a fast-growing sector in Vojvodina. Software development represents the main source of revenue, particularly development of ERP solutions, Java applications and mobile applications. IT sector companies mainly deal with software outsourcing, based on demands of international clients or with development of their own software products for purposes of domestic and international market.\nVojvodina pays particular attention to interregional and cross-border economic cooperation, as well as to implementation of priorities defined within the EU Strategy for the Danube Region.<ref name=\"vojvodina.gov.rs\"/>\n\nSome of the companies from Vojvodina:\n*[[Naftna Industrija Srbije]]\n*[[Srbijagas]]\n*[[HIP Petrohemija]]\n*[[Apatin Brewery]]\n*[[Novi Sad Fair|Novosadski sajam]]\n\nVojvodina promotes its investment potentials through the [[Vojvodina Investment Promotion]] (VIP) agency, which was founded by the Parliament of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.\n\n===Transport===\nThere are many important roads which pass through Vojvodina. First of all, the motorway [[A1 (Serbia)|A1 motorway]] which goes from Central Europe and the Horgos border crossing to Hungary, via Novi Sad to Belgrade and further to the southeast toward Ni\u0161, where it branches: one way leads east to the border with Bulgaria; the other to the south, towards Greece. Motorway [[A3 (Serbia)|A3]] in Srem separates the west, towards the neighboring Croatia and further to Western Europe. There is also a network of regional and local roads and railway lines.\n\nThe three largest rivers in Vojvodina are navigable stream. Danube River with a length of 588 kilometers and its tributaries Tisa (168&nbsp;km), Sava (206&nbsp;km) and Bega (75&nbsp;km). Among them was dug extensive network of irrigation canals, drainage and transport, with a total length of {{cvt|939|km}}, of which {{cvt|673|km}} navigable.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Vojvodina}}\nTourist destinations in Vojvodina include well known [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monasteries on [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] mountain, numerous hunting grounds, cultural-historical monuments, different folklores, interesting galleries and museums, plain landscapes with a lot of greenery, big rivers, canals and lakes, sandy terrain [[Deliblatska Pe\u0161\u010dara]] (\"the European Sahara\"), etc.\nIn the last few years, [[Exit (festival)|Exit]] has been very popular among the European summer music festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vojvodinaonline.com/?lang=en|title=Vojvodina online \u2013 Tourism Organisation of Vojvodina|work=vojvodinaonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vojvodina Autonomist Movement]]\n*[[Rinflaj\u0161]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Vojvodina}}\n*{{in lang|en|sr}} [http://www.vojvodina.gov.rs/ Government of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]\n*{{in lang|en|sr}} [http://www.skupstinavojvodine.gov.rs/ Assembly of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]\n*{{in lang|en|sr}} [http://www.region.vojvodina.gov.rs/ Provincial Secretariat for Regional and International Cooperation]\n*{{in lang|en|sr}} [http://www.vojvodinaonline.com/ Tourism organization of Vojvodina]\n*{{in lang|en|sr}} [http://www.vojvodinacafe.rs/ VojvodinaCafe \u2013 All about Vojvodina]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100712111010/http://www.explorevojvodina.com/ Useful information about Vojvodina, Parks of Nature, River Expedition, Wine Trails, Cities, Etno, Adventure and more]\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=101201340841926980085.000484d76165f9e421e7c&z=14/ Interactive map of Novi Sad]\n*[[commons:Atlas of Vojvodina|Atlas of Vojvodina (Wikimedia Commons)]]\n*[http://www.anem.org.rs/mape/index-en.htm Statistical information about municipalities of Vojvodina]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070310215502/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-244&srt=npan&col=aohdq&pt=c&va=&geo=-3987 List of largest cities of Vojvodina]\n*{{in lang|hu}} [http://vajdasag.rs ''The encyclopedia of Vojvodina'']\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{Political divisions of Serbia}}\n{{Republics and autonomous provinces of the former Yugoslavia}}\n{{Serbia topics}}\n{{Autonomous provinces of Serbia}}\n{{Statistical regions of Serbia}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Vojvodina| ]]\n[[Category:Autonomous provinces of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Statistical regions of Serbia]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1944]]\n[[Category:Historical regions in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Autonomous regions]]\n[[Category:Serbian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Romanian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Hungarian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Croatian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Slovak-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Regions of Europe with multiple official languages]]\n[[Category:1944 establishments in Yugoslavia]]\n", "name_user": "Parkwells", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHungarian Crown land (1860\u20131876):changes in administration - correct wording", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vojvodina"}

The family came from Skelton close to [[Marton, Middlesbrough|Marton]], birthplace of [[Captain James Cook]], to whom the family claimed ancestry through Mrs Wild.{{sfn|Bickel 2001|p=27}}<ref name=\"visit\" /> Her father was Robert Cook, who claimed to be a grandson of the great explorer. By 1875 the Wild family had moved from Skelton to [[Stickford]] in Lincolnshire, and in late 1880 moved again to [[Wheldrake]] near [[York]].<ref name=\"visit\" />\n\nWild's family next moved to the village of [[Eversholt, Bedfordshire|Eversholt]] in Bedfordshire.<ref name=\"visit\" /> Here his father was appointed clerk of the Eversholt Parochial Charity at [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]].{{sfn|Nature Obit, 30 September 1939}} Frank Wild was educated at [[Bedford]]. He joined the [[Merchant Navy]] in 1889 at the age of 16, receiving his early training in sail in the clipper ship ''Sobraon''. In the Merchant Navy he rose to the rank of second officer. In 1900, aged 26, he joined the [[Royal Navy]]. The 1901 census shows that at that time he was serving as an [[Able seaman]] aged 27 on {{HMS|Edinburgh|1882|6}}, anchored in [[Sheerness]] Harbour.\n\n== Antarctic exploration ==\n[[File:TheSouthernParty.jpg|thumb|Frank Wild (left side) beside Shackleton]]\nFrank Wild took part in the following Antarctic expeditions:\n\n* In 1901 he was a member of [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s crew as an [[Able seaman]] on the ''[[RRS Discovery|Discovery]]'', along with [[Ernest Shackleton]] who was then a sub-lieutenant.\n* He was with Shackleton on the [[Nimrod Expedition|Nimrod Expedition 1908\u20131909]] and was a member of the team that crossed the Ross Barrier and [[Beardmore Glacier]] at a record latitude of 88\u00ba23'S.\n* In 1911 he joined [[Douglas Mawson]]'s ''[[SY Aurora|Aurora]]'' expedition and was in charge of the western base on the [[Shackleton Ice Shelf]].\n* He served as Shackleton's second-in-command on Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914\u20131916)]].\n* He was second-in-command of the [[Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition]] (1921\u201322).\n\nAs second-in-command of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Wild was left in charge of twenty-one men on desolate [[Elephant Island]] as Shackleton and a crew of five made their epic rescue mission to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] aboard a lifeboat. From 24 April to 30 August 1916 Wild and his crew waited on Elephant Island, surviving on a diet of seal, penguin and seaweed. They were finally rescued by Shackleton aboard the Chilean ship ''[[Yelcho (1906)|Yelcho]]''. [[Point Wild]] on Elephant Island is named after Frank Wild, with a monument dedicated to the Chilean captain [[Luis Pardo]] who rescued him and his men.\n\nOn returning to the United Kingdom in 1916, Wild volunteered for duty during [[World War I]] and was made a temporary lieutenant in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]]. After taking a [[Russian language]] course, Wild became the [[Royal Navy]]'s transport officer at [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]], where he superintended the war materials which arrived during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied intervention in Russia]]. After the war, Wild went to South Africa where he farmed in [[Nyasaland|British Nyasaland]] with [[Francis Howard Bickerton|Francis Bickerton]] and [[James McIlroy (surgeon)|James McIlroy]], two former Antarctic comrades.<ref name=\"stein\" />\n\nFrom 1921 to 1922 Wild was second-in-command of the [[Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition]], a poorly equipped expedition with no clear plan, and a small ship, the ''[[Quest (ship)|Quest]]''. [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] died of a heart attack on [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] during the expedition, and Wild took over command and completed the journey, combating unfavourable weather to Elephant Island and along the Antarctic coast.<ref name=\"stein\" />\n\nFrank Wild's younger brother [[Ernest Wild]] also went on to become a [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] seaman and [[Antarctic]] explorer, receiving a [[Polar Medal]].\n\n==Later years==\n{{more citations needed|section|date = December 2015}}\nOn 24 October 1922 Frank Wild married Vera Alexandra Altman (n\u00e9e Bogosoff), the widow of a tea planter of [[Borneo]], at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] Registry Office. They had first met in 1918 when Wild was serving in Russia, and he had assisted her to obtain a passage home to England. After the [[Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition]] Wild returned to South Africa with Vera where he continued to farm. He bought some land in the Mkuzi valley in [[Natal Province|Zululand]] where he tried to grow cotton.\n\nThe enterprise was a financial disaster and after five years of drought followed by flood, Wild gave up. Next he was involved in railway construction and for a time had some success with a contract to extend the South African railway to the border with [[Swaziland]]. However, the contract ended and he was forced to seek employment elsewhere.<ref name=\"visit\" />\n\nWild's marriage to Vera was in difficulty shortly after arriving in Zululand and she asked for a divorce, which became absolute on 27 December 1928. Next, Wild took a temporary job as a hotel barman at Gollel in [[Swaziland]] which was owned by a friend of his. Caught in the 1930 Depression, he was forced to move from job to job, including working as a battery manager at a diamond mine which went bankrupt, prospecting in [[Rhodesia]] and managing a quarry. He subsidised his meagre income by giving the occasional lecture on the ''[[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Endurance]]'' expedition.\n\nHe married for the second time on 18 March 1931. His new wife, Beatrice (Trixie) Lydia Rhys Rowbotham, was 47&nbsp;years old and ten years his junior. They settled in [[Germiston]] where in 1932 he worked supervising a stone-crushing machine at a [[Witwatersrand]] gold mine. Very happily married, the following four years saw relative peace and calm and Wild earned enough money not only to buy a car (a [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]]) but to take two well needed holidays in the hinterland and coast of South Africa.\n\nDue to ill health he was forced to leave the mining job and he was given a job by his brother-in-law Pat O'Brien Frost to oversee the building of Frost's house in Haenertsburg in the Eastern Transvaal. However, he had little respect for Frost; that and the demands of building the house in an extremely remote part of the country caused him to return to [[Johannesburg]]. By now he was in poor health but retained his characteristic kind, calm countenance. With the offer of a job as a store-keeper on the Babrosco Mine near [[Klerksdorp]] from his friend Jack Scott, the mining magnate, he and Trixie finally found the peace they were seeking. He had also been awarded the [[Civil List pension]] from Downing Street.\n\nFrank Wild died of [[pneumonia]] and [[diabetes]] in Klerksdorp on 19 August 1939, aged 66&nbsp;years. He was cremated on 23 August 1939 at the Braamfontein Cemetery in [[Johannesburg]].\n\n==Honours and memorials==\nWild was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|New Year Honours List]] of 1920 and in May 1923 he was made a [[Freeman of the City of London#Borough Freedom of the City of London|Freeman of the City of London]].<ref name=\"Ward coolantarctica\" /> He was also the recipient of a number of awards for his contributions to exploration and for advancing geography: He received the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s [[Back Award]] in 1916 and the Society's [[Patron's Medal]] in 1924.\n\n[[Cape Wild]] and [[Point Wild]] on [[Elephant Island]] in the Antarctic are named after him, as is [[Mount Wild (Queen Alexandra Range)|Mount Wild]] in the Queen Alexandra Range and [[Mount Wild (Graham Land)|Mount Wild]] in Graham Land.

The inscription on the rough-hewn granite block set to mark the spot reads \"Frank Wild 1873\u20131939, Shackleton's right-hand man.\"\n\nWild's relatives and Shackleton's granddaughter, the Hon.&nbsp;Alexandra Shackleton, attended a service conducted by the Rev Dr Richard Hines, rector of the [[Falkland Islands]]. Butler said, \"''His ashes will now be where they were always supposed to be. It just took them a long time getting there.''\"{{sfn|Telegraph, ''Forgotten hero'', 8 December 2011}} The journey to South Georgia, the service and the interment were the subject of a [[BBC Radio 4]] programme in the ''[[Crossing Continents]]'' series.\n\nOn 25 November 2011 the Government of [[South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands]] issued a set of commemorative postage stamps honouring Frank Wild along with other Antarctic pioneers.

In 1900, aged 26, he joined the [[Royal Navy]]. The 1901 census shows that at that time he was serving as an [[Able seaman]] aged 27 on {{HMS|Edinburgh|1882|6}}, anchored in [[Sheerness]] Harbour.\n\n== Antarctic exploration ==\n[[File:TheSouthernParty.jpg|thumb|Frank Wild (left side) beside Shackleton]]\nFrank Wild took part in the following Antarctic expeditions:\n\n* In 1901 he was a member of [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s crew as an [[Able seaman]] on the ''[[RRS Discovery|Discovery]]'', along with [[Ernest Shackleton]] who was then a sub-lieutenant.\n* He was with Shackleton on the [[Nimrod Expedition|Nimrod Expedition 1908\u20131909]] and was a member of the team that crossed the Ross Barrier and [[Beardmore Glacier]] at a record latitude of 88\u00ba23'S.\n* In 1911 he joined [[Douglas Mawson]]'s ''[[SY Aurora|Aurora]]'' expedition and was in charge of the western base on the [[Shackleton Ice Shelf]].\n* He served as Shackleton's second-in-command on Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914\u20131916)]].\n* He was second-in-command of the [[Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition]] (1921\u201322).\n\nAs second-in-command of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Wild was left in charge of twenty-one men on desolate [[Elephant Island]] as Shackleton and a crew of five made their epic rescue mission to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] aboard a lifeboat. From 24 April to 30 August 1916 Wild and his crew waited on Elephant Island, surviving on a diet of seal, penguin and seaweed. They were finally rescued by Shackleton aboard the Chilean ship ''[[Yelcho (1906)|Yelcho]]''. [[Point Wild]] on Elephant Island is named after Frank Wild, with a monument dedicated to the Chilean captain [[Luis Pardo]] who rescued him and his men.\n\nOn returning to the United Kingdom in 1916, Wild volunteered for duty during [[World War I]] and was made a temporary lieutenant in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]].

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIn 1995, Stephen Wynne from Liverpool created a separate company based in Texas using the [[DeLorean Motor Company (Texas)|DeLorean Motor Company]] name. Wynne acquired the trademark on the stylized DMC logo, along with the remaining parts inventory of the original DeLorean Motor Company. The company rebuilds cars at its [[Humble, Texas]], location using a combination of [[new old stock]] (NOS) parts, original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and reproduction parts on a made-to-order basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delorean.com/index-5.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718103728/http://www.delorean.com/index-5.html|archivedate=July 18, 2011|title=New build cars|publisher=DeLorean Motor Company|accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nAfter several delays and cost overruns, production finally began in late 1980.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\n[[File:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|thumb|Early pull strap]]\n[[File:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|thumb|Later-style one-piece bolster]]\n[[File:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|thumb|Mid-1981 silver wheel]]\n\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 | pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n\n===Prototypes and pilot cars===\nOnly one of two DeLorean prototypes still exists.<ref>{{cite web |author=PJ Grady Europe |url=http://www.pjgrady.co.uk/GenericContent.aspx?PageType=Delorean_Repairs&ShowContent=Prototype_Restoration.html |publisher=DeLorean PJ Grady Europe |title=Delorean Repairs |accessdate=January 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421053458/http://www.pjgrady.co.uk/GenericContent.aspx?PageType=Delorean_Repairs&ShowContent=Prototype_Restoration.html |archivedate=April 21, 2014  }}</ref> Prototype 1 sold at the bankruptcy auction in 1984 for $37,000.<ref name=\"upi.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/25/DeLorean-prototype-cars-sell-at-auction-for-total-58000/3565470206800/ |title=DeLorean prototype cars sell at auction for total $58,000 |access-date=June 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602233213/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/25/DeLorean-prototype-cars-sell-at-auction-for-total-58000/3565470206800/ |archive-date=June 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The car remained in a private collection until 2005 when it was sold to the owner of DeLorean Motor Company of Florida (DMCFL) where it received a complete restoration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/4041986_1587-1976-delorean-dmc-12-original-prototype |title=1587: 1976 DeLorean DMC-12 Original Prototype |access-date=June 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602234250/https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/4041986_1587-1976-delorean-dmc-12-original-prototype |archive-date=June 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Proto 1 is now on display at DMCFL.

VIN 510 is understood to be the first of this batch of cars converted and was later sold at the factory auction in 1984. The other 12 cars were auctioned off by the receivers in early 1983. As a result, several of these cars were registered at the same time and have the Northern Irish registration (license) number \"SIJ xxxx\".

This car is the only factory-authorized right-hand-drive black-interior automatic car and is owned by Andrew Withers, former editor of the UK DeLorean Owners Club.\n# The second batch were registered and used by the factory in Northern Ireland, with registration numbers (license plates), AXI 1697, AXI 1698, AXI 1699 and are referred to by enthusiasts as the \"AXI cars\".

They all had roof-mounted radio antennas, indicator repeater lights, no side marker lights, white forward-facing door lights, fog-light switch, and textured body rubstrips on the stainless panels. No [[catalytic converters]] or [[Oxygen sensor|lambda equipment]] were fitted, as British legislation did not require them. VIN 5565 with the registration number AXI 1697 was a fully UK homologated example, which was shown at the British motor show at Birmingham, UK in October 1982.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIn 1995, Stephen Wynne from Liverpool created a separate company based in Texas using the [[DeLorean Motor Company (Texas)|DeLorean Motor Company]] name. Wynne acquired the trademark on the stylized DMC logo, along with the remaining parts inventory of the original DeLorean Motor Company. The company rebuilds cars at its [[Humble, Texas]], location using a combination of [[new old stock]] (NOS) parts, original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and reproduction parts on a made-to-order basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delorean.com/index-5.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718103728/http://www.delorean.com/index-5.html|archivedate=July 18, 2011|title=New build cars|publisher=DeLorean Motor Company|accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nAfter several delays and cost overruns, production finally began in late 1980.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\n[[File:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|thumb|Early pull strap]]\n[[File:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|thumb|Later-style one-piece bolster]]\n[[File:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|thumb|Mid-1981 silver wheel]]\n\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 | pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n\n===Prototypes and pilot cars===\nOnly one of two DeLorean prototypes still exists.<ref>{{cite web |author=PJ Grady Europe |url=http://www.pjgrady.co.uk/GenericContent.aspx?PageType=Delorean_Repairs&ShowContent=Prototype_Restoration.html |publisher=DeLorean PJ Grady Europe |title=Delorean Repairs |accessdate=January 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421053458/http://www.pjgrady.co.uk/GenericContent.aspx?PageType=Delorean_Repairs&ShowContent=Prototype_Restoration.html |archivedate=April 21, 2014  }}</ref> Prototype 1 sold at the bankruptcy auction in 1984 for $37,000.<ref name=\"upi.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/25/DeLorean-prototype-cars-sell-at-auction-for-total-58000/3565470206800/ |title=DeLorean prototype cars sell at auction for total $58,000 |access-date=June 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602233213/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/25/DeLorean-prototype-cars-sell-at-auction-for-total-58000/3565470206800/ |archive-date=June 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The car remained in a private collection until 2005 when it was sold to the owner of DeLorean Motor Company of Florida (DMCFL) where it received a complete restoration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/4041986_1587-1976-delorean-dmc-12-original-prototype |title=1587: 1976 DeLorean DMC-12 Original Prototype |access-date=June 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602234250/https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/4041986_1587-1976-delorean-dmc-12-original-prototype |archive-date=June 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Proto 1 is now on display at DMCFL.

VIN 510 is understood to be the first of this batch of cars converted and was later sold at the factory auction in 1984. The other 12 cars were auctioned off by the receivers in early 1983. As a result, several of these cars were registered at the same time and have the Northern Irish registration (license) number \"SIJ xxxx\". All of this first batch of cars had a black interior and all had manual transmission, except VIN 12175. This car is the only factory-authorized right-hand-drive black-interior automatic car and is owned by Andrew Withers, former editor of the UK DeLorean Owners Club.\n# The second batch were registered and used by the factory in Northern Ireland, with registration numbers (license plates), AXI 1697, AXI 1698, AXI 1699 and are referred to by enthusiasts as the \"AXI cars\". These three cars (VINs 5565, 5592 and 5638) differ from the first Wooler-Hodec cars in several ways. They all had roof-mounted radio antennas, indicator repeater lights, no side marker lights, white forward-facing door lights, fog-light switch, and textured body rubstrips on the stainless panels. No [[catalytic converters]] or [[Oxygen sensor|lambda equipment]] were fitted, as British legislation did not require them. VIN 5565 with the registration number AXI 1697 was a fully UK homologated example, which was shown at the British motor show at Birmingham, UK in October 1982. It includes a unique rearward-facing twin exhaust, no catalytic converters and the UK-specification engine as used by Volvo, but retaining the usual Renault ancillaries. The transmission final drive was also set at 3.88:1 versus the standard 3.44:1. Attention was paid to other unique details such as correctly offset wing mirrors.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nA common misconception surrounding the factory-authorized right-hand-drive DeLoreans is that they were all fitted with different, so-called \"Euro-spec\", tail lights<ref name=\"rubberlight\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deloreans.co.uk/features/eurospec/big_pics/rubberlight02.jpg |publisher=DeLorean Owners Club UK |title=Reference image illustrating so-called \"Euro-spec\" tail light unit |accessdate=December 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724223141/http://www.deloreans.co.uk/features/eurospec/big_pics/rubberlight02.jpg |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}</ref> as part of the right-hand-drive conversion program. This is not the case. Due to the nature of these cars as prototypes, they were not officially type-approved for use in the UK.

The extent of these modifications varies between the first batch of \"Wooler-Hodec\" cars and the later \"AXI\" cars:\n\nAll of the 13 Wooler-Hodec cars were modified to the OEM front turn-signal lens fixing method in order to make them fit flush with the front fascia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deloreans.co.uk/features/eurospec/big_pics/frontrepeater01.jpg |publisher=DeLorean Owners Club UK |title=Reference image illustrating modified front turn signal lens |accessdate=December 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712013859/http://www.deloreans.co.uk/features/eurospec/big_pics/frontrepeater01.jpg |archivedate=July 12, 2011 }}</ref> The cars' headlights were also changed for right-hand-drive spec lights that incorporate a UK sidelight feature.

P. L. 90-542; U.S.C. 1271 et seq. 2 October 1968. https://www.rivers.gov/documents/act/complete-act.pdf. Web. 8 August 2018.</ref>), enacted by [[United States Congress|the U.S. Congress]] to preserve certain [[river]]s with outstanding natural, cultural, and recreational values in a free-flowing condition for the enjoyment of present and future generations.\n\nThe Act is notable for safeguarding the special character of these rivers, while also recognizing the potential for their appropriate use and development. It encourages river management that crosses political boundaries and promotes public participation in developing goals for river protection. The Act, signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the height of the United States environmental era, states:<blockquote>\"It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States that certain selected rivers of the Nation which, with their immediate environments, possess outstandingly remarkable scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic, cultural or other similar values, shall be preserved in free-flowing condition, and that they and their immediate environments shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations. The Congress declares that the established national policy of dams and other construction at appropriate sections of the rivers of the United States needs to be complemented by a policy that would preserve other selected rivers or sections thereof in their free-flowing condition to protect the water quality of such rivers and to fulfill other vital national conservation purposes.\" (Wild & Scenic Rivers Act)<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>The Act established the [[List of National Wild and Scenic Rivers|National Wild and Scenic Rivers System]] to protect and enhance rivers found to be regionally and nationally significant. Rivers may be designated by Congress or, if certain requirements are met, the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. Each designated river is administered by either a federal, state, or tribal agency, or as a partnership between any number of these government entities and local [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s. Designated segments need not include the entire river and may include headwaters and tributaries. For federally administered rivers, the designated boundaries generally average one-quarter mile on either bank in the lower 48 states and one-half mile on rivers outside [[National Park Service|national parks]] in [[Alaska]] in order to protect river-related values.\n\nAs of August 2018, the National System protects over 12,700 miles of 209 rivers in 40 states and the [[Puerto Rico|Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]]; this is less than one-quarter of one percent of the nation's rivers, which flow over 3.5 million miles across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/habitat-conservation/river-habitat|title=River Habitat|last=NOAA|website=https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/habitat-conservation/river-habitat}}</ref> By comparison, more than 75,000 large [[dam]]s across the country have modified at least 600,000 miles, or about 17%, of American rivers.\n\n==History==\nThe National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act was an outgrowth of the recommendations of a Presidential commission, the [[Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission]] (ORRRC).  Among other things, the commission recommended that the nation protect wild rivers and scenic rivers from development that would substantially change their free-flowing nature and values. At this time, the country was also experiencing rapid degradation of its water resources due to municipal and industrial effluent being released into the nation's rivers. Many waterways and the fish in them were toxic, rendering them unusable by surrounding communities. Populations of aquatic species were declining and people were being relocated from their communities due to rampant dam building. All across the country people were writing letters imploring the President and First lady to protect their beloved rivers. Ultimately, the act was sponsored by Sen. [[Frank Church]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]-[[Idaho]]) and signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on October 2, 1968. A [[river]], or river section, may be designated by the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] or the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. In 1968, as part of the original act, eight rivers were designated as National Wild and Scenic Rivers ([[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater]], [[Eleven Point National Wild and Scenic River|Eleven Point]], [[Feather River|Feather]], [[Rio Grande Wild and Scenic River|Rio Grande]], [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue]], [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin\u2013Minnesota)|St. Croix]], [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon]], and [[Wolf River (Fox River)|Wolf]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rivers.gov/act.php|title=Wild & Scenic River Act Amendments|last=|first=|date=|website=National Wild and Scenic Rivers System|publisher=National Wild and Scenic Rivers|access-date=January 9, 2016}}</ref>  {{As of|November 2018}}, 209 rivers, totaling 12,754 miles of river in 40 states and Puerto Rico, have Wild and Scenic status.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=About the WSR Act|url=http://www.rivers.gov/wsr-act.php|website=National Wild and Scenic Rivers System|accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref> By comparison, more than 75,000 large dams across the country have modified at least 600,000 miles, or about 17%, of American rivers.\n[[File:Wild & Scenic Taunton River.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Taunton River]] in [[Massachusetts]] is a Wild & Scenic River.]]\nSelected rivers in the United States are preserved for possessing Outstandingly Remarkable Values (ORVs) that fall into the 8 categories: Scenic, Recreation, Geologic, Fish, Wildlife, Historic, Culture, or Other similar values.

National Wild and Scenic designation essentially vetoes the licensing of new dams on, or directly affecting the designated section of river.  It also provides strong protection against federally funded bank and channel alterations that adversely affect river values, protects riverfront public lands from new oil, gas, and mineral development, and creates a federal reserved water right to protect flow-dependent values such as fish habitat.\n\n==Classifications==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nDesignation as a Wild and Scenic River is not the same as a [[national park]] designation, and generally does not confer the same protections as a [[Wilderness Area]] designation. Wild and Scenic designation specifically protects the free-flowing nature of rivers in both federal and non-federal areas, something the Wilderness Act and other federal designations cannot do. Despite misplaced fears, WSR designation does not alter private property rights.\n\nFederally administered National Wild and Scenic Rivers are managed by one or more of the four principal land-managing agencies of the federal government. Of the 209 National Wild and Scenic Rivers, the majority are managed by the [[U.S. Forest Service]], followed by the National Park Service; some of those managed by the NPS are [[List of the United States National Park System official units|official units]], while others are part of other parks. The remaining WSR are managed under the [[Bureau of Land Management]]'s National Conservation Lands (originally called the [[National Landscape Conservation System]]) and the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] in Alaska.\n\nState-managed Wild and Scenic Rivers are subject to the same protections as federally administered rivers. These state rivers can be added to the National System by the Secretary of the Interior following an application by the governor of the state the river flows through.\n\nDesignated rivers are assigned one or more classifications: Wild, Scenic, or Recreational.  These classifications are based on the developmental character of the river's surroundings on the date of designation. Wild rivers are the most remote and undeveloped while Recreational rivers often have many access points, roads, railroads, bridges, and homes located within the designated corridor. Scenic rivers tend to fall somewhere between the Wild and Recreational level of development. It is important to note that a river's classification is not related to the value(s) that made it worthy of designation. For instance, recreation may not be an outstanding value on a river with a recreational classification, nor scenery on a river classified as scenic. Notably, Wild and Scenic Rivers receive the same standard of protection regardless of classification.\n\n== 50th Anniversary of Wild and Scenic Rivers Act ==\nIn 2018, America continues to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rivers.gov/wsr50/index.php|title=Celebrating 50 Years - Wild & Scenic Rivers System|website=rivers.gov|access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2018, 20 miles of East Rosebud Creek in Montana were designated as a Wild and Scenic, the first Wild and Scenic designation in Montana in over 40 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanrivers.org/conservation-resource/montana-stream-becomes-first-wild-and-scenic-river-protected-in-50th-anniversary-year/|title=Montana Stream Becomes First Wild and Scenic River Protected in 50th Anniversary Year|last=Fiebig|first=Mike|date=2 August 2018|website=American Rivers|access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Proposed additions==\n*[[Nashua River Wild and Scenic River Study Act (H.R. 412; 113th Congress)]] \u2013 proposed a study of the [[Nashua River]] in [[Massachusetts]] for possible inclusion in the system.<ref name=412sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 412 \u2013 Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/412|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=23 June 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed Protection Act|Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed Protection Act (H.R. 723; 113th Congress)]] - proposed a study of segments of the [[Beaver River (Rhode Island)|Beaver]], [[Chipuxet River|Chipuxet]], [[Queen River (Rhode Island)|Queen]], [[Wood River (Pawcatuck River tributary)|Wood]], and [[Pawcatuck River|Pawcatuck]] Rivers in Rhode Island and Connecticut for possible additions to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of National Wild and Scenic Rivers]]\n*[[Frank and John Craighead]]\n*[[Wild river]]\n*[[Wilderness Act]]\n*[[National Trails System]]\n*[[Protected areas of the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|National Wild and Scenic Rivers}}\n*[http://www.rivers.gov/ National Wild and Scenic Rivers System]\n*[http://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/wildriv.html Wild and Scenic Rivers Act]\n\n{{US Protected Areas}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1968 in the environment]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of the United States|National Wild and Scenic River]]\n[[Category:Wild and Scenic Rivers of the United States| ]]\n[[Category:1968 in American law]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Conservation effort of certain rivers in the United States and its territories}}\n[[File:US-NationalWildAndScenicRiversSystem-Logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|Logo of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System]]\n[[File:National Wild and Scenic River signing.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Lyndon B.

After the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] the FitzWilliams, who had previously  been among  the largest landowners in Dublin, were dispossessed of most of their lands. Thomas's\nfather spent some years in [[France]] and fought for [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in England during the [[English Civil War]],  becoming Governor of [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''History of Dublin'' Alexander Thom and Co. 1902-1920 Vol.2 p. 20</ref> In 1655 William  and his elder brother [[Oliver FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]], having made their peace with the English  Parliament, were allowed to recover part of the family estate. After the [[Restoration of Charles II]] the FitzWilliams, with their record of loyalty to the Crown, were in high favour with the new regime,  and recovered the remainder of their lands including their main seat, [[Merrion Castle]]. Thomas' father succeeded to the Viscountcy in 1667 and Thomas himself three years later. He  also inherited considerable estates in [[County Westmeath]] from his maternal uncle Thomas Luttrell.\n\n==Religion and politics==\nThomas's  father was an open and devout [[Roman Catholic]],   who was attended at his death by several  [[Catholic priests]],   and married his daughters into Catholic families.<ref>Ball, p.20</ref> Thomas shared his father's  religious beliefs: according to tradition he gave money for  the building  of a Catholic  Mass house at [[Booterstown]].\n\nWhen [[James II]] succeeded to the throne Thomas enthusiastically supported his pro-Catholic policy and for the next few years  he was a political  figure of some importance. James appointed him to the [[Privy Council of Ireland]], and made him a Commissioner of the Treasury. During the Williamite Wars he was  given a military command: in 1691 he raised a troop for the  relief of the [[Siege of Limerick (1691)|Siege of Limerick]] but was defeated in a clash with Wiliamite forces.<ref name=\"Ball\">Ball, p. 21</ref>\n\nAfter the downfall of the Jacobite cause, Lord FitzWilliam was the subject of an [[Act of Attainder]], but the attainder was later reversed, whether because of the family's record of loyalty to the Crown, or because of their wealth and influence, is unclear.   He took his seat in the [[Irish House of Lords]] in 1695, but although  he was willing to swear allegiance to [[William III of England|William III]],  his conscience forbade him to join the [[Church of Ireland]] and he withdrew from the House.<ref name=\"Ball\" /> No further action was taken against him.

After the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] the FitzWilliams, who had previously  been among  the largest landowners in Dublin, were dispossessed of most of their lands. Thomas's\nfather spent some years in [[France]] and fought for [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in England during the [[English Civil War]],  becoming Governor of [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''History of Dublin'' Alexander Thom and Co. 1902-1920 Vol.2 p. 20</ref> In 1655 William  and his elder brother [[Oliver FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]], having made their peace with the English  Parliament, were allowed to recover part of the family estate. After the [[Restoration of Charles II]] the FitzWilliams, with their record of loyalty to the Crown, were in high favour with the new regime,  and recovered the remainder of their lands including their main seat, [[Merrion Castle]]. Thomas' father succeeded to the Viscountcy in 1667 and Thomas himself three years later. He  also inherited considerable estates in [[County Westmeath]] from his maternal uncle Thomas Luttrell.\n\n==Religion and politics==\nThomas's  father was an open and devout [[Roman Catholic]],   who was attended at his death by several  [[Catholic priests]],   and married his daughters into Catholic families.<ref>Ball, p.20</ref> Thomas shared his father's  religious beliefs: according to tradition he gave money for  the building  of a Catholic  Mass house at [[Booterstown]].\n\nWhen [[James II]] succeeded to the throne Thomas enthusiastically supported his pro-Catholic policy and for the next few years  he was a political  figure of some importance. James appointed him to the [[Privy Council of Ireland]], and made him a Commissioner of the Treasury. During the Williamite Wars he was  given a military command: in 1691 he raised a troop for the  relief of the [[Siege of Limerick (1691)|Siege of Limerick]] but was defeated in a clash with Wiliamite forces.<ref name=\"Ball\">Ball, p. 21</ref>\n\nAfter the downfall of the Jacobite cause, Lord FitzWilliam was the subject of an [[Act of Attainder]], but the attainder was later reversed, whether because of the family's record of loyalty to the Crown, or because of their wealth and influence, is unclear.   He took his seat in the [[Irish House of Lords]] in 1695, but although  he was willing to swear allegiance to [[William III of England|William III]],  his conscience forbade him to join the [[Church of Ireland]] and he withdrew from the House.<ref name=\"Ball\" /> No further action was taken against him and he died  still in full possession of his estates on  20 February 1704.\n\n==Family==\nLord FitzWilliam married firstly Mary Stapleton, daughter of the leading Parliamentarian Sir [[Philip Stapleton]] and his first wife Frances Hotham: this was  a somewhat surprising marriage,  given the deep divisions   about religion and politics between the two families.<ref name=\"Ball\" /> They had one surviving son-\n*[[Richard FitzWilliam, 5th Viscount FitzWilliam]].\nHe married secondly Elizabeth Pitt, daughter of George Pitt of [[Stratfield Saye|Strathfieldsaye]]; she was a distant cousin of [[William Pitt the Elder]].

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
