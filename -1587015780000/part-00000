The white fillets are laid out at regular spacing, which does not always coincide with the rough spacing of the joints.]] \nProfessional \"tuckpointers\" use tuckpointing tools, which depending on the country and local trade terminology sometimes may be termed \"jointers\", \"tuck irons\"<ref name=\":0\" /> or \"tuckpointing irons\" (primarily in London where the trade originated).\n\nTuckpointing tools were originally made from [[Wrought_iron|wrought iron]] by [[Blacksmith|blacksmiths]] in England during the 18th century.  Modern tuckpointing tools are constructed from hardened [[tool steel]]. Tuckpointing tools typically have a wooden or synthetic handle that is attached to the tool surface by a metal [[ferrule]]. The tool surface itself has a sharp-pointed front and a flat, beaded or grooved base; the sharp point aids the user in smoothing the tuckpointed line. This is similar in principle to the pointed floats used by concrete finishers to smooth out a surface.\n\nThe thickness and width of a tuckpointing tool is variable, with common measurements ranging from 1 mm to 14 mm. The thickness and width of these tools are heavily dependent upon the mason's personal preference and the type of brick or stonework that they are tuckpointing. Wider tools are often used when tuckpointing stonework.\n\nThere are many different types of tuckpointing tools now available:\n\"Standard Tuckpointing Tools (flat bottomed)\",\n\"Square Beaded Tuckpointing Tool\",\n\"Round Beaded Tuckpointing Tools\", \n\"Stub nose and Long nose Tuckpointing tools\", and also rarer\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\".\n\nStandard or flat bottomed tuckpointing tools were once the most commonly used tuckpointing tools, primarily because of the ease at which they could be manufactured by early blacksmiths. Standard tuckpointing tools are very versatile and can be used for a variety of different jobs ranging from very fine detail work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.\n\nTuckpointing tools are sometimes \"beaded\". First, beaded tuckpointing tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined, and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork. In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction.\n\nThe lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.\n\nSquare beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm ground round profiles.\n\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. \n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.\n\nTuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade.

The white fillets are laid out at regular spacing, which does not always coincide with the rough spacing of the joints.]] \nProfessional \"tuckpointers\" use tuckpointing tools, which depending on the country and local trade terminology sometimes may be termed \"jointers\", \"tuck irons\"<ref name=\":0\" /> or \"tuckpointing irons\" (primarily in London where the trade originated).\n\nTuckpointing tools were originally made from [[Wrought_iron|wrought iron]] by [[Blacksmith|blacksmiths]] in England during the 18th century.  Modern tuckpointing tools are constructed from hardened [[tool steel]]. Tuckpointing tools typically have a wooden or synthetic handle that is attached to the tool surface by a metal [[ferrule]]. The tool surface itself has a sharp-pointed front and a flat, beaded or grooved base; the sharp point aids the user in smoothing the tuckpointed line. This is similar in principle to the pointed floats used by concrete finishers to smooth out a surface.\n\nThe thickness and width of a tuckpointing tool is variable, with common measurements ranging from 1 mm to 14 mm. The thickness and width of these tools are heavily dependent upon the mason's personal preference and the type of brick or stonework that they are tuckpointing. Wider tools are often used when tuckpointing stonework.\n\nThere are many different types of tuckpointing tools now available:\n\"Standard Tuckpointing Tools (flat bottomed)\",\n\"Square Beaded Tuckpointing Tool\",\n\"Round Beaded Tuckpointing Tools\", \n\"Stubnose and Longnose Tuckpointing tools\", and also rarer\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\".\n\nStandard or flat bottomed tuckpointing tools were once the most commonly used tuckpointing tools, primarily because of the ease at which they could be manufactured by early blacksmiths. Standard tuckpointing tools are very versatile and can be used for a variety of different jobs ranging from very fine detail work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.\n\nTuckpointing tools are sometimes \"beaded\". First, beaded tuckpointing tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined, and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork. In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction.\n\nThe lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.\n\nSquare beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm ground round profiles.\n\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. \n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.\n\nTuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade. Many historic homes with classic [[Italianate architecture]] like the Werribee Mansion at [[Werribee Park]], in Victoria, Australia west of Melbourne, are great examples of recent tuckpointing which display the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between the bluestone architecture.\n\n==References==\n<references />\nhttps://www.masonrymagazine.com/blog/2008/09/01/tuckpointing-and-repointing-tools/\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Bricks]]\n[[Category:Stonemasonry]]\n", "name_user": "Muhammadalishahid856", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckpointing"}

The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

In 1724, [[Norridgewock]], a Native [[fortification|stronghold]] on the [[Kennebec River]], was destroyed by a [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] [[militia]]. Subsequently, the region became less dangerous, and Sanford was first settled in 1739. Incorporated a town in 1768, it was named after Peleg Sanford.
