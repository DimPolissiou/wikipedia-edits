During his early career he spent 18 years with Greater London Council and Inner London Education Authority, working on major development and regeneration projects but is known for his energy and climate change work, particularly decentralised energy in Woking, London and Sydney.\n\nIn 1999, Jones was awarded an MBE in the New Year\u2019s honours list for services to energy and water efficiency.\nGreater London Council/Inner London Education Authority\n\nFrom 1971 to 1989 Jones worked for the Greater London Council (1971 to 1986) and the Inner London Education Authority (1986 to 1989) on major development and regeneration projects both as an engineer and senior manager, including London housing projects, Andover Town Development, County Hall projects, Burgess Park new lake and park, the first networked Building Energy Management System in the UK and various school and college projects. Jones was a member of the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Management Board from 1983 to 1986 and a member of the Department of Building and Property Services Management Board from 1986 to 1989.\n\n'''Woking Borough Council'''\n\nFrom 1989 to 2004 Jones worked for Woking Borough Council, initially as building services manager and then as energy services manager. He was instrumental in establishing the Council\u2019s energy and environmental services company Thameswey Ltd of which he was a director (1999 to 2004) and its public/private joint venture company Thameswey Energy Ltd which developed and implemented decentralised energy projects in both the public and private sectors.\n\nDuring his time at Woking, Jones reduced CO2 emissions by 77.5% from 1990 levels to 2004, improved the energy efficiency of the existing housing stock within its area by 30% from 1996 to 2004 and undertook groundbreaking work on energy and water efficiency, [[private wire]] CHP cogeneration and trigeneration decentralised energy systems, environmentally friendly waste recycling/recovery and energy from waste technologies, alternative fuels for transport, renewable energy and fuel cells. Under Jones, Woking installed 81 private wire decentralised energy systems, nearly 10% of the UK\u2019s total installed solar energy photovoltaics and the first fuel cell CHP in the UK. Woking was able to implement private wire networks under the UK\u2019s exempt licensing regime .\n\nIn 2001, Jones was instrumental in Woking being awarded a Queens Award for Enterprise: Sustainable Development for his work in the development of local sustainable community energy systems, the only local authority ever to receive a Queens Award for Enterprise.\n\n'''London Climate Change Agency'''\n\nIn 2004, the then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone recruited Jones to head up his new climate change agency for London as chief executive officer (2004 to 2008) of the London Climate Change Agency Ltd (LCCA), a municipal company that developed and implemented projects in the sectors that impact on climate change, especially in the energy, water, waste and transport sectors. In addition to being chief executive officer of the LCCA, Jones was also the LCCA\u2019s executive director of the London ESCO Ltd and the LCCA\u2019s director of the Better Buildings Partnership Ltd, a company limited by guarantee between the LCCA and major landlords in London to reduce CO2 emissions from major commercial and public buildings.\n\nDuring his time in London Jones set up and ran the LCCA, developed the energy and climate change elements of the London Plan, Mayor\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan and the new Mayoral Climate Change Statutory Duty as well as developing and implementing decentralised energy and renewable energy projects in London. One of the key projects that Jones implemented was the procurement and establishment of the London ESCO, a public/private joint venture Energy Services Company between the LCCA Ltd and EDF Energy plc, which designs, finances, builds and operates decentralised energy systems for both new and existing development.\n\nJones is credited with the removal of the regulatory barriers to decentralised energy in the UK with the high level advocacy and lobbying that led to the creation of a separate electricity supply licence for decentralised energy or distributed generation to supply electricity over the local distribution network, otherwise known as the \u2018virtual private wire\u2019 over public wires principle. The UK Energy Regulator \u2013 the Office of Electricity and Gas Markets enacted the new licence in March 2009 .\n\nOn 22 May 2008, Jones appeared in an interview, shot in London and Woking, as part of the Australian ABC\u2019s ''Catalyst'' programme (2008 Episode 14). The story featured Jones past work in Woking and the LCCA\u2019s plans for implementing decentralised energy systems in London. This led to Jones being invited to visit Sydney as a guest of the City of Sydney and the New South Wales state government. A public talk \u2018City Talk: Green Transformers, revolutionising energy generation for a Sustainable Sydney\u2019 was held on Tuesday 22 July 2008 at the Theatre Royal, MLC Centre, King St, Sydney. The visit also included media coverage, like that on ABC Radio National\u2019s Saturday Extra programme.\n\n'''Sustainable Environment Foundation'''\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009 Jones was a director-trustee of the Sustainable Environment Foundation, a foundation that promotes for the benefit and advances the education of the public the conservation, protection and improvement of the physical and natural environment.\n\n'''Allan Jones Energy and climate change'''\n\nFrom 2008 to 2009 Jones worked as an energy and climate change consultant both in the UK and overseas, including working for the City of Sydney on a number of energy and climate change projects and advising on the delivery of the climate change targets in Sustainable Sydney 2030, in particular on  trigeneration and other green infrastructure.\n\n===City of Sydney===\nIn 2009, Jones was appointed as chief development officer, energy and climate change by the City of Sydney to provide leadership, strategic direction and high level advocacy to promote the changes which support the development and delivery of green infrastructure within the City as set out in Sustainable Sydney 2030. Sydney has an ambitious target to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 70% by 2030 from 2006 levels which will require at least 330&nbsp;MWe of combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) or trigeneration to deliver 70% of the city\u2019s electricity requirements by 2030 with the remainder coming from local renewable energy.\n\nTo deliver these targets Jones developed a green infrastructure plan for the city, which is being put into action at two levels: for the city as a whole and by the City of Sydney leading the way and installing local generation and green infrastructure projects in its own operations. This \"show by doing\" principle had been previously adopted in Woking and London to demonstrate that if the public sector leads, others will follow.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAt the first level, decentralised energy master plans, trigeneration, renewable energy and Advanced Waste Treatment, Decentralised Water and Automated Waste Master Plans are being developed to create a citywide green infrastructure plan which will be embedded into the City\u2019s master plan and operations.\n\nAt the second level, the city is implementing a range of projects to reduce its own CO2 emissions by 48% from 2009 to 2012 as a first step towards the city\u2019s own 70% reduction in CO2 emissions target for its own buildings and operations. This has led to a series of building energy efficiency retrofit and renewable energy projects which have already seen an 18% reduction in CO2 emissions in the first year of the project.\n\nAt the second level, the city has already reduced greenhouse gas emissions in its buildings by 18% from 2009 to 2011 by building energy efficiency retrofits and has let a further building energy and water efficiency retrofit contract to reduce emissions by a further 24%, increasing the total emission reductions to 42% by the end of 2012. The city has also let contracts to replace all city-owned street lighting with LEDs over the next three years which will reduce emissions in city-owned street lighting by 51% and to install 1.25&nbsp;MWp of precinct scale solar photovoltaics on more than 30 of the city\u2019s buildings over the next two years.{{When|date=October 2016}}\n\nFollowing completion of the two-year-long procurement process Cogent Energy (owned by Origin Energy) was appointed by Sydney as the energy services provider to design, finance, build, operate and maintain the citywide trigeneration network. Heads of agreement were signed in April 2012 and the development agreement was executed in August 2012.\n\n== External links ==\n'''City of Sydney'''\n* Sustainable Sydney 2030 [http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/vision/objectives/sustainable-sydney-2030 homepage]\n* Powering Sydney [http://www.sydney2030.com.au/development-in-2030/city-wide-projects/powering-sydney-allan-jones Sustainable Sydney 2030 website] \n* Low carbon energy in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105337/http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/2030/thedirections/LowCarbonCity.asp City of Sydney]\n* Daily Telegraph [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw-act/we-pay-for-city-power-waste/story-e6freuzi-1225873252083 We pay for city power waste]\n* Sydney Morning Herald [http://www.smh.com.au/environment/energy-smart/city-council-to-take-alternative-route-to-renewable-energy-20100530-wnir.html City council to take alternative route to renewable energy]\n* The Australian [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/opinion/city-of-sydney-embraces-tri-generation-power/story-e6frg9if-1225864242695 City of Sydney embraces tri-generation power]\n* The Fifth Estate  [http://www.thefifthestate.com.au/archives/11836 Sydney \u2013 The emerald city\u2019s colour of green]\n* Australian Design Review [http://www.australiandesignreview.com/news/15582-Renewable-energy-expert-to-join-City-of-Sydney Renewable energy expert to join City of Sydney]\n* Australian ABC Television's 'Stateline'  [http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2010/04/09/2869093.htm Greener energy for communities]\n* Australian ABC Radio National's 'Saturday Extra' [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/saturdayextra/stories/2008/2314663.htm# transcript] and [http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/current/audioonly/sea_20080726.mp3 mp3 podcast]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* Australian ABC Radio's 'The World Today' [http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2008/s2310848.htm transcript] and  [http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/news/audio/twt/200807/20080722-twt6-climate.mp3 mp3 podcast]\n* Sydney Morning Herald [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/07/22/1216492455066.html coverage of July 2008 Australian visit]\n* City of Sydney 'City Talk' [http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/podcasts/audio.asp Green Transformers, revolutionising energy generation for a Sustainable Sydney podcast] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20091024175700/http://cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/podcasts/Documents/2167036-v1-SYDNEY_CITY_TALK_22_JULY_2008.pdf pdf of overhead]\n* City of Sydney City Talks 2010 [http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/podcasts/citytalks/default/default.asp Sydney's Energy Revolution -

In 1968, the French arm was taken over by the aerospace company [[Snecma]], now a part of the French [[Safran|Safran Group]] and [[Peralada Group]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forum-auto.com/automobiles-mythiques-exception/section5/sujet381347.htm |title=La Hispano-Suiza \u2013 Anciennes Oldies \u2013 FORUM Anciennes \u2013 FORUM auto mythiques et d'exception |publisher=Forum-auto.com |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613010259/http://www.forum-auto.com/automobiles-mythiques-exception/section5/sujet381347.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nIn 1898 a Spanish artillery captain, [[Emilio de la Cuadra]], started electric automobile production in [[Barcelona]] under the name of '''La Cuadra'''. In [[Paris]], De la Cuadra met the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] engineer [[Marc Birkigt]] and hired him to work for the company in Spain. Under his direction two types of La Cuadra gasoline-powered engine cars were started immediately, one equipped with a 4.5 hp single-cylinder explosion engine and another 7-cylinder two-cylinder model, 5 hp. In 1900, these two explosion engines were the first designed and built in Spain by La Cuadra from a Birkigt design. These cars had four wheels, the previous two directional, clutch mechanisms, 3-speed gearbox, chain drive and suspension by crossbows. Two complete vehicles were completed, and there were some more under construction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aeha.cat/hispano-suiza|title=Hispano Suiza|website=Associaci\u00f3 d'Estudis His\u00f2rics de l'automoci\u00f3 {{!}} AEHA|language=es-ES|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> At some point in 1902, the ownership changed hands to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Castro Fern\u00e1ndez and became '''''F\u00e1brica Hispano-Suiza de Autom\u00f3viles''''' (''Spanish-Swiss Automobile Factory'') but this company went [[bankrupt]] in December 1903.\n\nYet another restructuring took place in 1904, creating '''''La Hispano-Suiza F\u00e1brica de Autom\u00f3viles''''', under Castro's direction, also based in Barcelona. Four new engines were introduced in the next year and a half; a 3.8-litre and 7.4-litre four-cylinder and a pair of big six-cylinder engines were produced. This company managed to avoid bankruptcy and its largest operations remained in Barcelona until 1946, where cars, trucks, buses, aero engines and weapons were produced. Other factories in Spain were at [[Ripoll]], [[Seville]], and [[Guadalajara (Spain)|Guadalajara]].\n\nIn 1910 [[Jean Chassagne]] competed with a Hispano-Suiza together with works drivers Pilleveridier and Zucarelli in the Coupe des Voiturettes Boulogne and the Catalan Cup Races, gaining second and fourth places respectively. France was soon proving to be a larger market for Hispano-Suiza's luxury cars than Spain. In 1911, an assembly factory called '''''Hispano France''''' began operating in the Paris suburb of [[Levallois-Perret]]. Production was moved to larger factories at [[Bois-Colombes]], under the name Hispano-Suiza in 1914 and soon became Hispano-Suiza's main plant for producing the largest, most costly models.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Hispano Suiza 8 A Brussel.jpg|thumb|A Brussels museum-preserved Hispano-Suiza HS.8A SOHC aviation engine from World War I]]\nWith the start of [[World War I]], Hispano-Suiza turned to the design and production of [[aircraft engine]]s under the direction of [[Marc Birkigt]]. His chief engineer during this period was another Swiss, [[Louis Massuger]]. Traditionally, aircraft engines were manufactured by machining separate steel cylinders and then bolting these assemblies directly to the crankcase. Birkigt's [[Hispano-Suiza 8|novel solution]] called for the engine block to be formed from a single piece of cast aluminum, and into which thin steel liners were secured. Manufacturing an engine in this way simplified construction and resulted in a lighter, yet stronger more durable engine. Thus, Birkigt's new construction method created the first practical, and what are commonly known today as, \"cast block\" engines. His aluminum cast block V-8 design was also noteworthy for incorporating overhead camshafts, propeller reduction gearing and other desirable features that would not appear together on competitors' engines until the late 1920s. Another major design feature, for the later HS.8B line was the use of a hollow propeller shaft for [[Hispano-Suiza 8#Variants|both the 8B and 8C gear-reduction versions]], which when used for the HS.8C versions specifically engineered to accommodate one, to allow heavy calibre (usually 37&nbsp;mm) projectiles firing through the hollow propeller shaft, avoiding the need for a [[synchronization gear]], a feature used in future Hispano-Suiza military engines. Hispano-Suiza's aero engines, produced at its own factories and under license, became the most commonly used aero engines in the French and British air forces, powering over half the alliance's fighter aircraft.<ref>Browne, T.C. \"Retrospect: 1924 Hispano-Suiza H6c Speedster\", ''Motor Trend'', 4/84, p.118.</ref>\n\n===1918\u20131936===\n[[File:Hispano Suiza 1918.jpg|thumb|Share of the Hispano-Suiza Fabrica de Automoviles SA, issued December 21, 1918]]\nAfter World War I, Hispano-Suiza returned to automobile manufacturing and in 1919 they introduced the [[Hispano-Suiza H6]]. The H6 featured an inline 6-cylinder [[overhead camshaft engine]] based on the features of its V8 aluminium World War I aircraft engines and had coachwork done by well known coachbuilders like [[Hibbard & Darrin]] and [[D'Ieteren]].<ref>[[Georgano, G. N.]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''. London: Grange-Universal, 1985</ref>\n\nLicences for Hispano-Suiza patents were much in demand from prestige car manufacturers world-wide. [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] used a number of Hispano-Suiza patents. For instance, for many years Rolls Royce installed Hispano-Suiza designed power brakes in its vehicles.\n\nIn 1923 the French arm of Hispano-Suiza was incorporated as the '''''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise Hispano-Suiza''''', the Spanish parent company retaining control with 71% of the share capital. The French subsidiary was granted a large degree of financial and project independence to bring design and production direction into closer contact with its main markets but overall direction remained at Barcelona. This arrangement increased the importance of the Bois-Colombes plant near Paris as Hispano-Suiza's premier luxury car plant, and while the Spanish operations continued to produce luxury cars, mostly the smaller, less expensive models, production in Spain moved increasingly to the production of buses, trucks, and aircraft engines at several plants located around the country.\n\nThrough the 1920s and into the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza built a series of luxury cars with overhead camshaft engines of increasing performance. On the other hand, in the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza's V-12 car engines reverted to pushrod valve actuation to reduce engine noise.\n\nDuring this time, Hispano-Suiza released the 37.2 Hispano-Suiza car built at the Bois-Colombes works.[[File:Hispano-suiza-hood-ornament.JPG|thumb|right|Hispano-Suiza stork hood ornament.]]\n\nThe mascot statuette atop the radiator after World War I was the [[stork]], the symbol of the French province of [[Alsace]], taken from the squadron emblem painted on the side of a Hispano-Suiza powered fighter aircraft that had been flown by the World War I French ace [[Georges Guynemer]].\n\nThe [[Hispano-Suiza T49]] was also designed and made by the Spanish company between 1924 and 1944; it was the Spanish version of the French H6B model with a 6-cylinder engine of 8,000 cm3, 160 hp and a maximum speed of 177 km / h.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/motor/reportajes/abci-modelos-hispano-suiza-entre-vehiculos-mas-bellos-historia-201810311241_noticia.html|title=Hispano-Suiza cl\u00e1sicos, entre los veh\u00edculos m\u00e1s bellos de la historia|date=2018-10-31|website=abc|language=es|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1925, Carlos Ballester obtained permission to represent Hispano-Suiza in Argentina. The agreement consisted of a phase in which the chassis were imported, followed by complete domestic production in Argentina. Thus '''''[[Hispano Argentina F\u00e1brica de Autom\u00f3viles]]''''' (HAFDASA) was born, for the production of Hispano-Suiza motors and automobiles, and also the production of spare parts for other car, truck, and bus manufacturers.\n\n===Spanish Civil War and WWII===\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936, the regional government of Catalonia, on behalf of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], collectivized control of Hispano-Suiza's Spanish factories and placed the company on a war footing. The company was divided into three sections:\n* aircraft engines and cannons\n* cars and trucks\n* machine tools\nBecause of the international isolation of the Spanish republic, the Spanish arm of the company suffered from shortages.\n\nIn 1937, the French government took control of the French subsidiary of Hispano-Suiza with a 51 per cent share of the capital for the provision of war materiel, renaming the company ''La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019exploitation des mat\u00e9riels Hispano-Suiza''. In 1938, the French company ceased automobile production and concentrated on aircraft engine production. At the time, Hispano-Suiza had just introduced a new series of water-cooled [[V12 engine|V-12]] engines and the [[Hispano-Suiza 12Y]] was in great demand for practically every type of French aircraft. However, without the Spanish factories, Hispano-Suiza lacked the capacity to deliver enough engines for the rapidly growing French air force, and many new French fighter aircraft remained grounded for the lack of an engine when World War II began.\n\nA development of the era were a series of 20&nbsp;mm [[autocannon]], first the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.9]], followed by the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]]. The 404 was licensed for production in Britain and equipped almost all [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] fighter aircraft during the war. Production was also set up in the US, but these versions never matured even though the [[USAAC]] and [[US Navy]] both wanted to use it in place of their existing [[.50 BMG]] weapons. A lesser-known success was the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.820]], a higher performance 20&nbsp;mm design that was also used in the US as the M139. A variation of the 20&nbsp;mm guns used on the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] aircraft were produced by [[International Harvester]].<ref name=\"International Harvester Corporation\">International Harvester Corporation. \"Mr. Dealer Plan Now for the Future\", Harvester World, Volume 34, Number 11, November 1943, p.16. Harvester Press, Chicago, 1943.</ref> In 1970 Hispano-Suiza sold their armaments division to [[Oerlikon Contraves|Oerlikon]], the HS.820 becoming the KAD.\n\nIn 1940, Hispano-Suiza, together with the Spanish bank Banco Urquijo and a group of Spanish industrial companies, founded the 'Sociedad Ib\u00e9rica de Autom\u00f3viles de Turismo' (S.I.A.T.). This led to Spain's first mass-production car maker, [[SEAT]]. After the civil war, Hispano-Suiza in Spain was severely affected by the devastated economy and the trade embargoes imposed by the allies. In 1946, Hispano-Suiza sold off its Spanish automotive assets to ENASA, a public company belonging to the [[Instituto Nacional de Industria]], the maker of Pegaso trucks.\n[[File:Hispano-Suiza Carmen Genf 2019 1Y7A5641.jpg|thumb|1,005 hp Hispano Suiza Carmen in Geneva Motor Show 2019]]\n\n===1950s\u2013Today===\nAfter the Second World War, the French arm of Hispano-Suiza continued primarily as an aerospace firm. Between 1945 and 1955, it was building the [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] under license, designing [[landing gear]] in 1950 and [[Martin-Baker]] [[ejection seat]]s in 1955. The company's attention turned increasingly to turbine manufacturing and, in 1968, it was taken over and became a division of [[SNECMA]]. In 1999, Hispano-Suiza moved its turbine operations to a new factory in [[Bezons]], outside [[Paris]], using the original factories for power transmissions and accessory systems for jet engines. In 2005, SNECMA merged with [[SAGEM]] to form [[SAFRAN]].\n\nThe brand saw an attempt at a revival in the automotive sector with the showing of a model at the 2010 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. However the planned production never materialised.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lieberman |first=Jonny |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/03/02/geneva-2010-hispano-suiza-debuts-the-hispano-suiza/ |title=Geneva 2010: Hispano Suiza debuts the...

engine and components manufacturer. It is best known for its pre-World War II luxury cars and aviation engines. In 1923, its French subsidiary became a semi-autonomous partnership with the Spanish parent company. In 1946, the Spanish parent company sold all its Spanish automotive assets to [[Enasa]]. In 1968, the French arm was taken over by the aerospace company [[Snecma]], now a part of the French [[Safran|Safran Group]] and [[Peralada Group]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forum-auto.com/automobiles-mythiques-exception/section5/sujet381347.htm |title=La Hispano-Suiza \u2013 Anciennes Oldies \u2013 FORUM Anciennes \u2013 FORUM auto mythiques et d'exception |publisher=Forum-auto.com |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613010259/http://www.forum-auto.com/automobiles-mythiques-exception/section5/sujet381347.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nIn 1898 a Spanish artillery captain, [[Emilio de la Cuadra]], started electric automobile production in [[Barcelona]] under the name of '''La Cuadra'''. In [[Paris]], De la Cuadra met the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] engineer [[Marc Birkigt]] and hired him to work for the company in Spain. Under his direction two types of La Cuadra gasoline-powered engine cars were started immediately, one equipped with a 4.5 hp single-cylinder explosion engine and another 7-cylinder two-cylinder model, 5 hp. In 1900, these two explosion engines were the first designed and built in Spain by La Cuadra from a Birkigt design. These cars had four wheels, the previous two directional, clutch mechanisms, 3-speed gearbox, chain drive and suspension by crossbows. Two complete vehicles were completed, and there were some more under construction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aeha.cat/hispano-suiza|title=Hispano Suiza|website=Associaci\u00f3 d'Estudis His\u00f2rics de l'automoci\u00f3 {{!}} AEHA|language=es-ES|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> At some point in 1902, the ownership changed hands to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Castro Fern\u00e1ndez and became '''''F\u00e1brica Hispano-Suiza de Autom\u00f3viles''''' (''Spanish-Swiss Automobile Factory'') but this company went [[bankrupt]] in December 1903.\n\nYet another restructuring took place in 1904, creating '''''La Hispano-Suiza F\u00e1brica de Autom\u00f3viles''''', under Castro's direction, also based in Barcelona. Four new engines were introduced in the next year and a half; a 3.8-litre and 7.4-litre four-cylinder and a pair of big six-cylinder engines were produced. This company managed to avoid bankruptcy and its largest operations remained in Barcelona until 1946, where cars, trucks, buses, aero engines and weapons were produced. Other factories in Spain were at [[Ripoll]], [[Seville]], and [[Guadalajara (Spain)|Guadalajara]].\n\nIn 1910 [[Jean Chassagne]] competed with a Hispano-Suiza together with works drivers Pilleveridier and Zucarelli in the Coupe des Voiturettes Boulogne and the Catalan Cup Races, gaining second and fourth places respectively. France was soon proving to be a larger market for Hispano-Suiza's luxury cars than Spain. In 1911, an assembly factory called '''''Hispano France''''' began operating in the Paris suburb of [[Levallois-Perret]]. Production was moved to larger factories at [[Bois-Colombes]], under the name Hispano-Suiza in 1914 and soon became Hispano-Suiza's main plant for producing the largest, most costly models.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Hispano Suiza 8 A Brussel.jpg|thumb|A Brussels museum-preserved Hispano-Suiza HS.8A SOHC aviation engine from World War I]]\nWith the start of [[World War I]], Hispano-Suiza turned to the design and production of [[aircraft engine]]s under the direction of [[Marc Birkigt]]. His chief engineer during this period was another Swiss, [[Louis Massuger]]. Traditionally, aircraft engines were manufactured by machining separate steel cylinders and then bolting these assemblies directly to the crankcase. Birkigt's [[Hispano-Suiza 8|novel solution]] called for the engine block to be formed from a single piece of cast aluminum, and into which thin steel liners were secured. Manufacturing an engine in this way simplified construction and resulted in a lighter, yet stronger more durable engine. Thus, Birkigt's new construction method created the first practical, and what are commonly known today as, \"cast block\" engines. His aluminum cast block V-8 design was also noteworthy for incorporating overhead camshafts, propeller reduction gearing and other desirable features that would not appear together on competitors' engines until the late 1920s. Another major design feature, for the later HS.8B line was the use of a hollow propeller shaft for [[Hispano-Suiza 8#Variants|both the 8B and 8C gear-reduction versions]], which when used for the HS.8C versions specifically engineered to accommodate one, to allow heavy calibre (usually 37&nbsp;mm) projectiles firing through the hollow propeller shaft, avoiding the need for a [[synchronization gear]], a feature used in future Hispano-Suiza military engines. Hispano-Suiza's aero engines, produced at its own factories and under license, became the most commonly used aero engines in the French and British air forces, powering over half the alliance's fighter aircraft.<ref>Browne, T.C. \"Retrospect: 1924 Hispano-Suiza H6c Speedster\", ''Motor Trend'', 4/84, p.118.</ref>\n\n===1918\u20131936===\n[[File:Hispano Suiza 1918.jpg|thumb|Share of the Hispano-Suiza Fabrica de Automoviles SA, issued December 21, 1918]]\nAfter World War I, Hispano-Suiza returned to automobile manufacturing and in 1919 they introduced the [[Hispano-Suiza H6]]. The H6 featured an inline 6-cylinder [[overhead cam]] engine based on the features of its V8 aluminium World War I aircraft engines and had coachwork done by well known coachbuilders like [[Hibbard & Darrin]] and [[D'Ieteren]].<ref>[[Georgano, G. N.]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''. London: Grange-Universal, 1985</ref>\n\nLicences for Hispano-Suiza patents were much in demand from prestige car manufacturers world-wide. [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] used a number of Hispano-Suiza patents. For instance, for many years Rolls Royce installed Hispano-Suiza designed power brakes in its vehicles.\n\nIn 1923 the French arm of Hispano-Suiza was incorporated as the '''''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise Hispano-Suiza''''', the Spanish parent company retaining control with 71% of the share capital. The French subsidiary was granted a large degree of financial and project independence to bring design and production direction into closer contact with its main markets but overall direction remained at Barcelona. This arrangement increased the importance of the Bois-Colombes plant near Paris as Hispano-Suiza's premier luxury car plant, and while the Spanish operations continued to produce luxury cars, mostly the smaller, less expensive models, production in Spain moved increasingly to the production of buses, trucks, and aircraft engines at several plants located around the country.\n\nThrough the 1920s and into the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza built a series of luxury cars with overhead camshaft engines of increasing performance. On the other hand, in the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza's V-12 car engines reverted to pushrod valve actuation to reduce engine noise.\n\nDuring this time, Hispano-Suiza released the 37.2 Hispano-Suiza car built at the Bois-Colombes works.[[File:Hispano-suiza-hood-ornament.JPG|thumb|right|Hispano-Suiza stork hood ornament.]]\n\nThe mascot statuette atop the radiator after World War I was the [[stork]], the symbol of the French province of [[Alsace]], taken from the squadron emblem painted on the side of a Hispano-Suiza powered fighter aircraft that had been flown by the World War I French ace [[Georges Guynemer]].\n\nThe [[Hispano-Suiza T49]] was also designed and made by the Spanish company between 1924 and 1944; it was the Spanish version of the French H6B model with a 6-cylinder engine of 8,000 cm3, 160 hp and a maximum speed of 177 km / h.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/motor/reportajes/abci-modelos-hispano-suiza-entre-vehiculos-mas-bellos-historia-201810311241_noticia.html|title=Hispano-Suiza cl\u00e1sicos, entre los veh\u00edculos m\u00e1s bellos de la historia|date=2018-10-31|website=abc|language=es|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1925, Carlos Ballester obtained permission to represent Hispano-Suiza in Argentina. The agreement consisted of a phase in which the chassis were imported, followed by complete domestic production in Argentina. Thus '''''[[Hispano Argentina F\u00e1brica de Autom\u00f3viles]]''''' (HAFDASA) was born, for the production of Hispano-Suiza motors and automobiles, and also the production of spare parts for other car, truck, and bus manufacturers.\n\n===Spanish Civil War and WWII===\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936, the regional government of Catalonia, on behalf of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], collectivized control of Hispano-Suiza's Spanish factories and placed the company on a war footing. The company was divided into three sections:\n* aircraft engines and cannons\n* cars and trucks\n* machine tools\nBecause of the international isolation of the Spanish republic, the Spanish arm of the company suffered from shortages.\n\nIn 1937, the French government took control of the French subsidiary of Hispano-Suiza with a 51 per cent share of the capital for the provision of war materiel, renaming the company ''La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019exploitation des mat\u00e9riels Hispano-Suiza''. In 1938, the French company ceased automobile production and concentrated on aircraft engine production. At the time, Hispano-Suiza had just introduced a new series of water-cooled [[V12 engine|V-12]] engines and the [[Hispano-Suiza 12Y]] was in great demand for practically every type of French aircraft. However, without the Spanish factories, Hispano-Suiza lacked the capacity to deliver enough engines for the rapidly growing French air force, and many new French fighter aircraft remained grounded for the lack of an engine when World War II began.\n\nA development of the era were a series of 20&nbsp;mm [[autocannon]], first the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.9]], followed by the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]]. The 404 was licensed for production in Britain and equipped almost all [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] fighter aircraft during the war. Production was also set up in the US, but these versions never matured even though the [[USAAC]] and [[US Navy]] both wanted to use it in place of their existing [[.50 BMG]] weapons. A lesser-known success was the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.820]], a higher performance 20&nbsp;mm design that was also used in the US as the M139. A variation of the 20&nbsp;mm guns used on the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] aircraft were produced by [[International Harvester]].<ref name=\"International Harvester Corporation\">International Harvester Corporation. \"Mr. Dealer Plan Now for the Future\", Harvester World, Volume 34, Number 11, November 1943, p.16. Harvester Press, Chicago, 1943.</ref> In 1970 Hispano-Suiza sold their armaments division to [[Oerlikon Contraves|Oerlikon]], the HS.820 becoming the KAD.\n\nIn 1940, Hispano-Suiza, together with the Spanish bank Banco Urquijo and a group of Spanish industrial companies, founded the 'Sociedad Ib\u00e9rica de Autom\u00f3viles de Turismo' (S.I.A.T.). This led to Spain's first mass-production car maker, [[SEAT]]. After the civil war, Hispano-Suiza in Spain was severely affected by the devastated economy and the trade embargoes imposed by the allies. In 1946, Hispano-Suiza sold off its Spanish automotive assets to ENASA, a public company belonging to the [[Instituto Nacional de Industria]], the maker of Pegaso trucks.\n[[File:Hispano-Suiza Carmen Genf 2019 1Y7A5641.jpg|thumb|1,005 hp Hispano Suiza Carmen in Geneva Motor Show 2019]]\n\n===1950s\u2013Today===\nAfter the Second World War, the French arm of Hispano-Suiza continued primarily as an aerospace firm. Between 1945 and 1955, it was building the [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] under license, designing [[landing gear]] in 1950 and [[Martin-Baker]] [[ejection seat]]s in 1955. The company's attention turned increasingly to turbine manufacturing and, in 1968, it was taken over and became a division of [[SNECMA]]. In 1999, Hispano-Suiza moved its turbine operations to a new factory in [[Bezons]], outside [[Paris]], using the original factories for power transmissions and accessory systems for jet engines. In 2005, SNECMA merged with [[SAGEM]] to form [[SAFRAN]].\n\nThe brand saw an attempt at a revival in the automotive sector with the showing of a model at the 2010 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. However the planned production never materialised.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lieberman |first=Jonny |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/03/02/geneva-2010-hispano-suiza-debuts-the-hispano-suiza/ |title=Geneva 2010: Hispano Suiza debuts the...

I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy,\" said Corgan in the ''Adore'' reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, \"he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow of what he was feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style\u2014like [[honkytonk]]. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician.\"<ref>[[David Wild|Wild, David]]. \"'Adore' of Perceptions\", ''Adore'' reissue liner notes, 2014.

I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy,\" said Corgan in the ''Adore'' reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, \"he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow of what he was feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style\u2014like [[honkytonk]]. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician.\"<ref>[[David Wild|Wild, David]]. \"'Adore' of Perceptions\", ''Adore'' reissue liner notes, 2014.
