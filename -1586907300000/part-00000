Its modern development began in the late 19th century with the vogue for the first health resorts. In the early 20th century Portoro\u017e became one of the grandest seaside resorts in [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]], along with [[Opatija|Abbazia]], [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]], then as part of the [[Austrian Littoral]].<ref>http://www.istrabenz.si/slo/turizem/950</ref> It is now one of Slovenia's major tourist areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran.si/index.php?page=static&item=1&tree_root=1 |title=Piran Municipality site|accessdate=2012-01-31|ref=harv}}</ref> Located in the centre is the [[Kempinski Palace Portoro\u017e|Hotel Palace]], once one of the most important resorts for the [[Austro-Hungarian monarchy]], and currently one of the finest hotels between [[Venice]] and [[Dubrovnik]].<ref>http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro\u017e {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223001/http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro%C5%BE |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nThe settlement and its surrounding areas are served by [[Portoro\u017e Airport|Portoro\u017e International Airport]] which is located in the nearby village of [[Se\u010dovlje]].\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the settlement is directly connected to that of the neighbouring town of [[Piran]], with [[illyrians|Illyrian]] settlers already living there in the prehistoric era. They were followed by [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, which were later conquered and annexed by the [[Roman Empire]] in 178 B.C. Archaeological finds suggest that in this period many farms and villas, also named ''villae rusticae'', were built in the area. A large development of the area followed only after the demise of the empire, with enlargement of the number of settlers seeking shelter from attacks by the [[Barbarians]].\n\nIn the 7th century, the area was a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Due to increasing dissatisfaction with the feudal rule, as well as the rising power of the [[Venetian Republic]], the settlement of Pirano signed a trade treaty with [[Venice]], which included a lesser degree of autonomy.\n\n[[File:Postcard of Portoro\u017e 1912 (3).jpg|thumb|left|Portoro\u017e in 1912]]\nOne of the first religious orders who came to this area was the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictines]]. \nIn the 12th century, the broader region already had four monasteries and even more churches. Among those, one of the oldest was the church of ''Our Lady of the Rosary'', which stood by the bay in the beginnings of the 13th century. Its name was ''Sancta Maria Roxe'' or ''S. Maria delle Rose'', and in 1251 the bay was named by it ''Portus sanctae Mariae de Rosa''.\n\nOne of the most important roles in the history of the settlement was the monastery of Saint Laurence, where the Benedictines healed rheumatic illnesses, ascites and other diseases with concentrated saltwater and saline mud. In 1210, the area was overtaken by the Patriarchy of Aquileia.\n\nIn the 13th century, Pirano entered a brief war from December 1282 to January 1283, in which it was defeated by the Venetian Republic. [[File:Razglednica Portoro\u017ea 1915 (3).jpg|thumb|right|250px|upright|Portoro\u017e's bath in 1915]]\n\nDuring the second Venetian rule, it was, contrary to other towns on the [[Istria]]n peninsula, loyal to Venetian rule, and as such gained special privileges within the republic, which in turn caused the local economy to boom. In 1797, Venetian rule came to a close as the [[Austrian Empire]] took over the area for a brief period until 1806. From 1806 to 1813, the entire Istrian Peninsula became part of the [[Illyrian Provinces]].\n\nA period of economic growth followed during the second Austrian rule, with enlargement of trade and locally important salt pans in nearby [[Lucija]] and [[Se\u010dovlje]]. In the aftermath of the [[World War I|Great War]], the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] determined the Istrian peninsula to be from that point on a part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nUnder the royal and then fascist rule, the area found itself amidst economic decline and civil conflicts between the populace and the state. In [[World War II]], the area had not seen much action, although the important industrial hub of Trieste suffered multiple bombings. In the aftermath of the war, the settlement found itself in the [[United Nations]]-administered [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. After the dissolution of the Trieste state it became a part of [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055511/http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Portoro\u017e is mainly based on tourism and the [[casino|gambling industry]]. The facilities include a marina,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinap.si/ |title=Marina Portoro\u017e site|accessdate=2012-12-30|ref=harv}}</ref> numerous sporting facilities and several casinos, along with many hotels and apartment complexes.\n\n===Tourism development===\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the leaders of the [[Pirano]] municipality and local doctors decided to stimulate tourism in the region, by offering health treatment by concentrated salt water and salina mud, and from 1879 onwards Dr. [[Giovanni Lugnano]] the first to offer such treatment to various visitors.\nIn 1885 after several years of successful start of a new branch of industry, constructions of new complexes and villas began, and in 1890 the predecessor of the famous Hotel Palace was built. Among the new settlers were various prominent figures, such as Antonelli, Dragovina, Furian, Frennez, Langer, Rastelli, Reinlaner and Salvetti.\nBecause of the new branch of healthcare treatment that emerged in ''Porto Rose'', the ministry of interior affairs declared the settlement to be a health resort.\nIn 1908 Dr. [[Orazio Pupini]], a prominent Austrian doctor with a noticeable treatment history opened a sanatorium. He was also the main doctor of the Austrian Railways, and a member of the Austrian Doctors\u2019 Association.\nIn 1902 The [[Parenzana]] Railway system was introduced which increased the popularity of the region, but was later dissolved because of decreased interests.[[File:Portoro\u017e 1957.jpg|thumb|left|upright|240px|Palace Hotel in 1957]]\nIn 1909 the era of construction of private villas ended with opening of a much bigger building for standards at the time; the ''Palace Cur Hotel'', later known as [[Palace Hotel, Portoro\u017e|Palace Hotel]]. At the initial opening ceremony, in 1910, the Hotel Palace was already named \u00bbthe most beautiful hotel on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast\u00ab. The hotel was equipped with the most modern therapeutic accessories, and for the needs of high importance guests a casino was built.\n\nThe thriving community was halted by World War I, and a few years after the war (In which they came under the [[Italy|Italian rule]]) in 1928 they included a new electric therapy among their treatment programmes. In the whole interwar period the settlement was slowly regaining its former glory when World War II  severely crippled it again. The crisis lasted until 1968 when renovations and new constructions under the new entity of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] began to take place along the whole region. In this time they began to build the settlement's infrastructure with the casino doing the bulk of the investments in reconstructing the [[Portoro\u017e Airport|sports airfield]] in nearby [[Se\u010dovlje]] and building the multi-purpose [[Avditorij Portoro\u017e|auditorium]] in 1972. In 1976 two hotel complexes were constructed in Bernardin, in the following year another was added in the same area.<ref name=\"slovensko-morje.net\">{{cite web|url=http://slovensko-morje.net/index.php?page%3Dnews%26view_news%3D5401 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609043918/http://slovensko-morje.net/index.php?page=news |archivedate=2015-06-09 }}</ref> In the same year they began transforming the [[Lucija, Piran|Lucija saltworks]] into a marina for smaller vessels.<ref name=\"svet24.si\">http://svet24.si/clanek/526942816c4f9/kaj-najbolj-zaznamuje-portoroz</ref>  Since the secession of [[Slovenian War of Independence|Slovenia]] from Yugoslavia, Portoro\u017e became one of the most important tourist sites in the country.<ref>http://www.piran.si/index.php?item=138&page=static</ref>\n<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/biz/mareaslo/zgod.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602034758/http://www.angelfire.com/biz/mareaslo/zgod.html |date=2016-06-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Gambling===\nThe first casino to be opened was in Villa San Lorenzo, on 27 July 1913, and was run by the ''Casino des Etrangers'' society. It only lasted briefly for not more than a few months before being shut down.[[File:Portoroz (10) (3955614179).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Hotel Palace in present day]]\nThe industry faded away in the northern Adriatic region, until 1963, when ''Zavod za pospe\u0161evanje turizma'', whose president was Anton Nino Spinelli, proposed a reopening of the casino. The next year the first casino in the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]], and the second within [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] beside the one in [[Opatija]] opened. In 1972, the company moved into the newly built and much larger [[Grand hotel Metropol]], where they employed around 450 people. Having a large budget surplus, they began investing in the settlement's infrastructure.<ref name=\"svet24.si\"/>\nToday there are multiple casinos located in Portoro\u017e, such as [[Casino Riviera]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casino-riviera.si/pc.asp?xpath%3D%26xpathid%3D%26lang%3Dslo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714155409/http://www.casino-riviera.si/pc.asp?xpath=&xpathid=&lang=slo |archivedate=2014-07-14 }}</ref> [[Grand Casino (Portoro\u017e)|Grand Casino]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernardingroup.si/si/metropol-resort/hoteli/grand-hotel-metropol/casino |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618174650/http://www.bernardingroup.si/si/metropol-resort/hoteli/grand-hotel-metropol/casino |archivedate=2014-06-18 }}</ref> and [[Casino Bernardin]], located in the town's hotel complex of Bernardin.<ref>http://www.casino-bernardin.si/</ref>\n\n===Bernardin===\nBernardin is a tourist complex located in the western part of Portoro\u017e.

In the early 20th century Portoro\u017e became one of the grandest seaside resorts in [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]], along with [[Opatija|Abbazia]], [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]], then as part of the [[Austrian Littoral]].<ref>http://www.istrabenz.si/slo/turizem/950</ref> It is now one of Slovenia's major tourist areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran.si/index.php?page=static&item=1&tree_root=1 |title=Piran Municipality site|accessdate=2012-01-31|ref=harv}}</ref> Located in the centre is the [[Kempinski Palace Portoro\u017e|Hotel Palace]], once one of the most important resorts for the [[Austro-Hungarian monarchy]], and currently one of the finest hotels between [[Venice]] and [[Dubrovnik]].<ref>http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro\u017e {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223001/http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro%C5%BE |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nThe settlement and its surrounding areas are served by [[Portoro\u017e Airport|Portoro\u017e International Airport]] which is located in the nearby village of [[Se\u010dovlje]].\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the settlement is directly connected to that of the neighbouring town of [[Piran]], with [[illyrians|Illyrian]] settlers already living there in the prehistoric era. They were followed by [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, which were later conquered and annexed by the [[Roman Empire]] in 178 B.C. Archaeological finds suggest that in this period many farms and villas, also named ''villae rusticae'', were built in the area. A large development of the area followed only after the demise of the empire, with enlargement of the number of settlers seeking shelter from attacks by the [[Barbarians]].\n\nIn the 7th century, the area was a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Due to increasing dissatisfaction with the feudal rule, as well as the rising power of the [[Venetian Republic]], the settlement of Pirano signed a trade treaty with [[Venice]], which included a lesser degree of autonomy.\n\n[[File:Postcard of Portoro\u017e 1912 (3).jpg|thumb|left|Portoro\u017e in 1912]]\nOne of the first religious orders who came to this area was the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictines]]. \nIn the 12th century, the broader region already had four monasteries and even more churches. Among those, one of the oldest was the church of ''Our Lady of the Rosary'', which stood by the bay in the beginnings of the 13th century. Its name was ''Sancta Maria Roxe'' or ''S. Maria delle Rose'', and in 1251 the bay was named by it ''Portus sanctae Mariae de Rosa''.\n\nOne of the most important roles in the history of the settlement was the monastery of Saint Laurence, where the Benedictines healed rheumatic illnesses, ascites and other diseases with concentrated saltwater and saline mud. In 1210, the area was overtaken by the Patriarchy of Aquileia.\n\nIn the 13th century, Pirano entered a brief war from December 1282 to January 1283, in which it was defeated by the Venetian Republic. [[File:Razglednica Portoro\u017ea 1915 (3).jpg|thumb|right|250px|upright|Portoro\u017e's bath in 1915]]\n\nDuring the second Venetian rule, it was, contrary to other towns on the [[Istria]]n peninsula, loyal to Venetian rule, and as such gained special privileges within the republic, which in turn caused the local economy to boom. In 1797, Venetian rule came to a close as the [[Austrian Empire]] took over the area for a brief period until 1806. From 1806 to 1813, the entire Istrian Peninsula became part of the [[Illyrian Provinces]].\n\nA period of economic growth followed during the second Austrian rule, with enlargement of trade and locally important salt pans in nearby [[Lucija]] and [[Se\u010dovlje]]. In the aftermath of the [[World War I|Great War]], the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] determined the Istrian peninsula to be from that point on a part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nUnder the royal and then fascist rule, the area found itself amidst economic decline and civil conflicts between the populace and the state. In [[World War II]], the area had not seen much action, although the important industrial hub of Trieste suffered multiple bombings. In the aftermath of the war, the settlement found itself in the [[United Nations]]-administered [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. After the dissolution of the Trieste state it became a part of [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055511/http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Portoro\u017e is mainly based on tourism and the [[casino|gambling industry]]. The facilities include a marina,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinap.si/ |title=Marina Portoro\u017e site|accessdate=2012-12-30|ref=harv}}</ref> numerous sporting facilities and several casinos, along with many hotels and apartment complexes.\n\n===Tourism development===\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the leaders of the [[Pirano]] municipality and local doctors decided to stimulate tourism in the region, by offering health treatment by concentrated salt water and salina mud, and from 1879 onwards Dr. [[Giovanni Lugnano]] the first to offer such treatment to various visitors.\nIn 1885 after several years of successful start of a new branch of industry, constructions of new complexes and villas began, and in 1890 the predecessor of the famous Hotel Palace was built. Among the new settlers were various prominent figures, such as Antonelli, Dragovina, Furian, Frennez, Langer, Rastelli, Reinlaner and Salvetti.\nBecause of the new branch of healthcare treatment that emerged in ''Porto Rose'', the ministry of interior affairs declared the settlement to be a health resort.\nIn 1908 Dr. [[Orazio Pupini]], a prominent Austrian doctor with a noticeable treatment history opened a sanatorium. He was also the main doctor of the Austrian Railways, and a member of the Austrian Doctors\u2019 Association.\nIn 1902 The [[Parenzana]] Railway system was introduced which increased the popularity of the region, but was later dissolved because of decreased interests.[[File:Portoro\u017e 1957.jpg|thumb|left|upright|240px|Palace Hotel in 1957]]\nIn 1909 the era of construction of private villas ended with opening of a much bigger building for standards at the time; the ''Palace Cur Hotel'', later known as [[Palace Hotel, Portoro\u017e|Palace Hotel]]. At the initial opening ceremony, in 1910, the Hotel Palace was already named \u00bbthe most beautiful hotel on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast\u00ab. The hotel was equipped with the most modern therapeutic accessories, and for the needs of high importance guests a casino was built.\n\nThe thriving community was halted by World War I, and a few years after the war (In which they came under the [[Italy|Italian rule]]) in 1928 they included a new electric therapy among their treatment programmes. In the whole interwar period the settlement was slowly regaining its former glory when World War II  severely crippled it again. The crisis lasted until 1968 when renovations and new constructions under the new entity of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] began to take place along the whole region. In this time they began to build the settlement's infrastructure with the casino doing the bulk of the investments in reconstructing the [[Portoro\u017e Airport|sports airfield]] in nearby [[Se\u010dovlje]] and building the multi-purpose [[Avditorij Portoro\u017e|auditorium]] in 1972. In 1976 two hotel complexes were constructed in Bernardin, in the following year another was added in the same area.<ref name=\"slovensko-morje.net\">{{cite web|url=http://slovensko-morje.net/index.php?page%3Dnews%26view_news%3D5401 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609043918/http://slovensko-morje.net/index.php?page=news |archivedate=2015-06-09 }}</ref> In the same year they began transforming the [[Lucija, Piran|Lucija saltworks]] into a marina for smaller vessels.<ref name=\"svet24.si\">http://svet24.si/clanek/526942816c4f9/kaj-najbolj-zaznamuje-portoroz</ref>  Since the secession of [[Slovenian War of Independence|Slovenia]] from Yugoslavia, Portoro\u017e became one of the most important tourist sites in the country.<ref>http://www.piran.si/index.php?item=138&page=static</ref>\n<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/biz/mareaslo/zgod.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602034758/http://www.angelfire.com/biz/mareaslo/zgod.html |date=2016-06-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Gambling===\nThe first casino to be opened was in Villa San Lorenzo, on 27 July 1913, and was run by the ''Casino des Etrangers'' society. It only lasted briefly for not more than a few months before being shut down.[[File:Portoroz (10) (3955614179).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Hotel Palace in present day]]\nThe industry faded away in the northern Adriatic region, until 1963, when ''Zavod za pospe\u0161evanje turizma'', whose president was Anton Nino Spinelli, proposed a reopening of the casino. The next year the first casino in the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]], and the second within [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] beside the one in [[Opatija]] opened. In 1972, the company moved into the newly built and much larger [[Grand hotel Metropol]], where they employed around 450 people.

The religion of 'Snapeism' was active from 2005-2011. The Snapists (popularly known as the Snapewives) worshipped the Severus Snape character.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alderton|first1=Zoe|title='Snapewives' and 'Snapeism': A Fiction-Based Religion within the Harry Potter Fandom|journal=Religions|date=3 March 2014|volume=5|issue=1|pages=219\u2013267|doi=10.3390/rel5010219}}</ref> The Snapists were mocked by the majority of the fandom, especially the JournalFen community 'fandom_wank', for their unorthodox belief systems. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has argued for the validity of fandom faiths.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Davidsen|first1=Markus A.|title=Fiction-Based Religion: Conceptualising a New Category Against History-Based Religion and Fandom|journal=Culture and Religion|volume=14|issue=4|pages=378\u2013395|doi=10.1080/14755610.2013.838798|year=2013|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/48123/Davidsen2013ConceptualisingFiction-basedReligion_Postprint.pdf?sequence=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cusack|first1=Carole|title=Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith|date=2010|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham}}</ref>\n\nThe Snapists exist within a context of 'canon scepticism' - the belief that Rowling is a flawed interpreter of the Harry Potter universe who misrepresents the objective reality of certain characters and plot developments.<ref name=\"Alderton Snapewives\">{{cite journal|last1=Alderton|first1=Zoe|title='Snapewives' and 'Snapeism': A Fiction-Based Religion within the Harry Potter Fandom|journal=Religions|date=3 March 2014|volume=5|issue=1|page=224|doi=10.3390/rel5010219}}</ref> The Snapists believe that Rowling has misinterpreted Snape and disrespected him as a character. They also feel that Snape can contact them and provide them with help and guidance in life.\n\n==\"Ship debates\"==\n{{further|Shipping (fandom)#Harry Potter fandom}}\nIn the fandom the word \"ship\" and its derivatives like \"shipping\" or \"shipper\" are commonly used as shorthand for the word \"relationship.\"\n\nThe ''Harry Potter'' series generated ship debates with supporters of the prospective relationship between [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and his close female friend [[Hermione Granger]] at odds with supporters of Hermione ending up instead with [[Ron Weasley]], close friend of both, as well as  supporters of Harry ending up with [[Ginny Weasley]], Ron's younger sister.\n\nQuotes from Rowling which seemed to contradict the possibility of Harry ending up with Hermione were usually countered by claiming them to be deliberate obfuscations designed to lure astute observation off-course (though such claims were far from undisputed, given that these allegedly vague quotes included such phrases as \"[Harry and Hermione] are very platonic friends\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-pressclubtransc.htm |title=1999: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K. Rowling interviews on the web |publisher=Accio-quote.org |date=20 October 1999 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> and were repeated on at least three different occasions).\n\nAn interview with J.K. Rowling conducted by fansite webmasters Emerson Spartz ([[MuggleNet]]) and Melissa Anelli ([[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]]) shortly after the book's release turned out to be quite controversial. During the interview Spartz commented that Harry/Hermione shippers were \"delusional\", to which Rowling chuckled, though making it clear that she did not share the sentiment and that the Harry/Hermione fans were \"still valued members of her readership\". This incident resulted in an uproar among Harry/Hermione shippers. The uproar was loud enough to merit an article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/03/DDG0RE1DDI1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Neva | last=Chonin | title=If you're an obsessed Harry Potter fan, Voldemort isn't the problem. It's Hermione versus Ginny | date=24 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nRowling's attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated, as she revealed in that interview. She explained:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm |title=2005: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K.

A long time. Occasionally I had to, because there were weird news stories or something that I would have to go and check, because I was supposed to have said something I hadn\u2019t said. I had never gone and looked at fan sites, and then one day I did and oh&nbsp;\u2014 my&nbsp;\u2014 god. Five hours later or something, I get up from the computer shaking slightly [all laugh]. 'What is going on?\u2019 And it was during that first mammoth session that I met the shippers, and it was a most extraordinary thing.

You were delusional; you saw what you wanted to see and you have no one to blame for that but yourselves.}}\n\nRowling has continued to make references, less humorous and more, to the severity of the shipper conflicts. In one instance she has joked about trying to think of ways of proving to Emerson, when inviting him for the aforementioned interview, that it was really her and not \"some angry Harry/Hermione shipper trying to lure him down a dark alleyway\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=21 |title=Meeting Melissa and Emerson |website=[[J.

She went on to say that perhaps with marriage counseling Ron and Hermione would have been all right.<ref>West, Kelly.

There are two primary forms: internet-based roleplay and live-action roleplay, or [[LARP]].\n\nLARPing often involves re-enacting or creating an original Quidditch team.

Advancement in such games is usually dependent on live chat, multiplayer cooperation, and fighting as opposed to taking classes or simply posting to earn points for one's \"house\"; like at Hogwarts, players in forum-based games are sometimes sorted into a different group distinguishing different values within a person.\n\nRoleplaying also occurs in [[Improv comedy|long-form improvisational]] theater. Several American and British improv troupes are devoted to the Potter genre. These include Melbourne's ''[https://www.improvisedpotter.com.au/ Completely Improvised Potter] London's [[Potted Potter]]'' and Los Angeles's ''[http://harrypotterimprov.com/ The Show That Shall Not Be Named].''\n\n==Iconic landmarks tours==\n[[Image:Glenfinnan Viaduct, Scotland.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The [[Glenfinnan viaduct]], which the [[Hogwarts Express]] passes over when it travels to Hogwarts in the films.]]\nSome travel agencies have organised a subdivision to create tours specifically highlighting iconic landmarks in the world of ''Harry Potter''.

To this end, clues from the earlier books and deliberate hints from [[J. K. Rowling]] (in interviews and on her website) were heavily scrutinised by fans. In particular, fan essays were published on websites such as [[Mugglenet]] (the \"world famous editorials\"), the [[Harry Potter Lexicon]] and [[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]] (Scribbulus project) among others: offering theories, comment and analysis on all aspects of the series. The [[Yahoo]] discussion list [[Harry Potter for Grown Ups]] (founded in 1999) is also noteworthy for its detailed criticism and discussion of the Harry Potter books.\n\nSpeculation intensified with the July 2005 publication of ''[[Half-Blood Prince]]'' and the detailed post-publication interview given by Rowling to Mugglenet and The Leaky Cauldron.<ref>{{cite web|author=MuggleNet |url=http://www.mugglenet.com/jkrinterview.shtml |title=Emerson and Melissa's J.K.

Late additions to the fan scene (prior to the publication of ''[[Deathly Hallows]]'') included BeyondHogwarts.com (the successor to DumbledoreIsNotDead.com), which billed itself as \"the only ongoing online Harry Potter fan conference\", as well as Book7.co.uk, which offered a hypothetical \"evidence-based synopsis\" of the seventh novel.

The religion of 'Snapeism' was active from 2005-2011. The Snapists (popularly known as the Snapewives) worshipped the Severus Snape character.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alderton|first1=Zoe|title='Snapewives' and 'Snapeism': A Fiction-Based Religion within the Harry Potter Fandom|journal=Religions|date=3 March 2014|volume=5|issue=1|pages=219\u2013267|doi=10.3390/rel5010219}}</ref> The Snapists were mocked by the majority of the fandom, especially the JournalFen community 'fandom_wank', for their unorthodox belief systems.

They also feel that Snape can contact them and provide them with help and guidance in life.\n\n==\"Ship debates\"==\n{{further|Shipping (fandom)#Harry Potter fandom}}\nIn the fandom the word \"ship\" and its derivatives like \"shipping\" or \"shipper\" are commonly used as shorthand for the word \"relationship.\"\n\nThe ''Harry Potter'' series generated ship debates with supporters of the prospective relationship between [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and his close female friend [[Hermione Granger]] at odds with supporters of Hermione ending up instead with [[Ron Weasley]], close friend of both, as well as  supporters of Harry ending up with [[Ginny Weasley]], Ron's younger sister.\n\nQuotes from Rowling which seemed to contradict the possibility of Harry ending up with Hermione were usually countered by claiming them to be deliberate obfuscations designed to lure astute observation off-course (though such claims were far from undisputed, given that these allegedly vague quotes included such phrases as \"[Harry and Hermione] are very platonic friends\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-pressclubtransc.htm |title=1999: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K.

Rowling conducted by fansite webmasters Emerson Spartz ([[MuggleNet]]) and Melissa Anelli ([[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]]) shortly after the book's release turned out to be quite controversial. During the interview Spartz commented that Harry/Hermione shippers were \"delusional\", to which Rowling chuckled, though making it clear that she did not share the sentiment and that the Harry/Hermione fans were \"still valued members of her readership\". This incident resulted in an uproar among Harry/Hermione shippers. The uproar was loud enough to merit an article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/03/DDG0RE1DDI1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Neva | last=Chonin | title=If you're an obsessed Harry Potter fan, Voldemort isn't the problem. It's Hermione versus Ginny | date=24 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nRowling's attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated, as she revealed in that interview. She explained:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm |title=2005: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K.

Although not a full [[MMORPG]] format, Chamber of Chat is set up with 3D virtual chatrooms and avatars where fans can socially interact with each other in [[Pictionary]] and Harry Potter [[Trivia]]l games or participate in discussion groups about Harry Potter or Film media or perform plays as a theater group to other fans as audience. They hold special community event such as Harry Potters Birthday or Halloween and have seasonal house competitions.  Fans are able to create their own avatars, collect or be rewarded coins to purchase furniture items for their own \"clubhouse\". However, the website emphasizes more social interaction between fans' avatars to stimulate the Hogwarts student experience. \"Chamber of Chat is a graphical Social Virtual World with a few [[Facebook]] plug-ins.

Interactive gaming can include [[player versus player]] features, a form of currency for making purchases in stores, and [[non-player characters]] such as monsters that must be fought to gain levels and experience points. However, these features are more prevalent in games that are not forum-based. Advancement in such games is usually dependent on live chat, multiplayer cooperation, and fighting as opposed to taking classes or simply posting to earn points for one's \"house\"; like at Hogwarts, players in forum-based games are sometimes sorted into a different group distinguishing different values within a person.\n\nRoleplaying also occurs in [[Improv comedy|long-form improvisational]] theater. Several American and British improv troupes are devoted to the Potter genre.

Converts to Christianity typically make a vow of [[repentance]] from past [[sin]]s, accept [[Jesus]] as their Savior and vow to follow his teachings as found in the [[New Testament]].\n\nDifferent sects of Christianity may perform various different kinds of rituals or ceremonies on a convert in order to initiate them into a community of believers. The most commonly accepted ritual of conversion in Christianity is through [[baptism]], but this is not universally accepted among Christian denominations. A period of instruction and study almost always ensues before a person is formally converted into Christianity, but the length of this period varies, sometimes as short as a few weeks and possibly less, and other times, up to as long as a year or possibly more. \n\nMost mainline Christian denominations will accept conversion into other denominations as valid, so long as a baptism with water in the name of the [[Trinity]] took place, but some may accept a simple profession of faith in Jesus as Lord as being all that was needed for true conversion.<ref>[https://www.gotquestions.org/what-is-a-Christian.html]</ref> Other Christians may not accept conversions performed in other denominations and certain communities may be discriminated against as heretical. This is most true for many nontrinitarian sects, which many mainstream Christian denominations (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant) reject as having valid forms of conversion. Consequently, many nontrinitarian sects spiritually isolate themselves in that they may only consider their conversions valid and not those of mainstream Christianity.\n\nSocial scientists have shown great interest in the Christian conversion as a religious experience that believers describe as strengthening their faith and changing their lives.<ref>Peter G.

''The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity.'' University of California Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-520-21859-0}}</ref>\n\n==Methods of conversion==\n===Introduction===\nChristian denominations vary on the exact procedures of conversion. More traditional Christian groups such as the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Orthodox Church]], [[Lutherans]], [[Anglicans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and some [[Reformed]] Christians consider the [[sacrament]] of [[baptism]] in the name of the Trinity to be the moment of conversion. All of these groups teach the doctrine of [[baptismal regeneration]], that is, once baptized, all past sins, including [[original sin]], are washed away and a person becomes justified before God. Through baptism, one is incorporated into the body of believers, called the [[Christian Church|Church]], and may rightly be considered a Christian. Some of these groups may also administer other sacraments in the process of conversion such as [[confirmation]]. Some Evangelical Christians, like [[Baptist]], and [[Pentecostals]], do not believe baptism is necessary for salvation and conversion, but only that a profession of faith is enough. Christians also differ on how old someone must be to convert. More traditional groups of Christians believe conversion is not restricted to age, and tend to [[Infant baptism|baptize infants.]] Evangelical Christians do not baptize children because they see conversion as a deeply personal decision.\n\n===Instructions===\nBefore conversion takes place, converts, also called \"catechumens\", must undergo a period of instruction. In the Catholic Church,  this usually involves spending a few months preparing in [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|RCIA]] (Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults), where catechumens spend time learning about the Christian faith and the teachings of the Bible and the Church. In the Orthodox Church, it can take up to a full year of studying and participation before one is baptized. Protestant denominations and other Christian groups have various other ways of instructing converts which may focus heavily on the Bible.\n\n===Baptism/Confirmation===\n[[File:Child baptism with water.jpg|thumb|Baptism of a child by affusion.]] \nThere are different modes of baptism in Christianity, these include [[Immersion baptism|immersion]], [[affusion]] (pouring), and [[aspersion]] (sprinkling). The way in which a person is baptized depends on the denomination one enters. Almost all baptisms share in common the use of the Trinitarian formula (in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) by the minister while baptizing the convert. The Roman Catholic Church primarily baptizes with affusion but occasionally does so with immersion.<ref>Can.854 Baptism is to be conferred either by immersion or by pouring; the prescripts of the conference of bishops are to be observed.</ref> Orthodox Christians and some Eastern Catholics baptize by triple immersion upon invocation of the Trinity<ref>We are commanded to baptize by threefold immersion in water, in the name of the Holy Trinity. The Scriptures and the writings of the church affirm this.[http://www.orthodox.net/articles/baptism.html]</ref>; the only time the Orthodox Church permits other forms of baptism is in the case of an emergency.\n\nProtestants baptize in a number of different ways. Many Anglicans and Lutherans baptize by affusion, whereas Presbyterians and Congregationalists typically baptize with aspersion.<ref>\"Presbyterians baptize by aspersion -- sprinkling of water on the head -- in the name of God, the Father; God, the Son; and God, the Holy Spirit.\",[http://peopleof.oureverydaylife.com/baptism-performed-presbyterian-church-7961.html]</ref> Others, like Methodists, may conduct all three forms of baptism. Many Evangelical Protestants insist that only full immersion baptism is valid, basing this on the New Testament [[Koine Greek|Greek]] word for baptism \"baptizo\" (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03c9) which can be translated as \"dipping\" or \"submersion.\"\n\nDepending on which of these denominations one enters, the sacrament of [[Confirmation]], also known as [[Chrismation]] by eastern Christians, may be immediately administered after the baptism. In the [[Latin Church|Latin Catholic Church]], infants who are baptized are not confirmed, but instead must wait until they're in their teens to be confirmed. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, and many [[Eastern Catholic]] Churches, infants are Chrismated and communed by a priest or bishop immediately after they are baptized. When an adult convert enters the Catholic or Orthodox Church, they are immediately confirmed after baptism, upon which, a clergy member will anoint the forehead with [[olive oil]] (or in the case of Byzantine Christians, the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, breast, hands, and feet), calling upon the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] to seal the convert with his gifts.<ref>United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Rite of Christian Initiations of Adults: \"After the Baptism the newly baptized are dressed in white garments and presented with a candle lighted from the Paschal Candle. They are then Confirmed by the priest or bishop who lays hands on their heads, and invokes the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. He then anoints them with the oil called Sacred Chrism. The Mass continues with the newly baptized participating in the general intercessions and in bringing gifts to the altar. At Communion, the newly baptized receive the Eucharist, Christ's Body and Blood, for the first time.\"</ref><ref>\"Holy Baptism is the first of seven Sacraments in the Orthodox Christian Church. Together with the Sacrament of Holy Chrism it joins the candidate to the Mystical Body of Christ, the Church.\",[http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/Baptism.htm]</ref> After confirmation ensues, the convert is invited to partake of [[first communion]]. These rites usually occur on [[Easter Vigil]]. \n\nPersons who convert to most mainline Protestant groups will be received via baptism and be initiated further by any traditions the particular denomination holds to.\n\n[[Oneness Pentecostals]] baptize converts by full immersion in the name of Jesus alone, a departure from the usual form of baptism. They base this off of certain passages found in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. Unlike most Pentecostals, Oneness Pentecostals believe baptism is necessary for salvation. Although, they do not baptize infants, stressing that conversion is a personal decision.\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) teach that baptism is the first [[sacrament]], called an [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] in LDS theology, following conversion and is required for membership in the LDS Church. Baptism, according to the LDS theology, requires that the convert be [[age of accountability|accountable]] ([[credobaptism]]), that it be by immersion, and that it be performed by an authorized [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] holder. As the LDS Church does not recognize the priesthood authority of other churches, all converts, even those from other Christian denominations, are required to be baptized. Following baptism, a convert is confirmed a member of the LDS Church and receives the [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|Gift of the Holy Ghost]] by the [[laying on of hands]] of a [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]] holder.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b/priesthood-and-church-government/lesson-5-performing-priesthood-ordinances?lang=eng Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part B: Performing Priesthood Ordinances], \u00a7Confirmation.</ref>\n\n===Evangelical Christianity===\n[[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestants]] do not consider baptism to be necessary for salvation. Because of this, instead of baptism, a person becomes a Christian the moment they profess Jesus as their Lord and Savior. Evangelicals base this off of their interpretation of certain verses in the Bible.{{Bibleref2c|Rom|10:9}} {{Bibleref2c|Rom|5:1}} \n\nThis may be expressed at some Evangelical church services where the Pastor may conduct an \"[[altar call]]\", inviting non-Christian persons to go up publicly and \"receive\" Jesus into their hearts to become Christian. \n\nAs a result of this belief, many Evangelicals do not practice infant baptism and from this they profess one must be able to make the decision on their own to convert to Christianity. Nevertheless, Evangelicals do practice [[Believer's baptism|baptism]], but it is seen as a simple public pronouncement of faith in Christ rather than a means of [[Grace in Christianity|grace]].\n\n===Lutheranism===\n[[File:RepentanceisContrition&faith.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' divides repentance into two parts: \"One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the [[Law_and_Gospel#The_Book_of_Concord|knowledge of sin]]; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of [[Absolution#Lutheranism|absolution]], and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors.\"<ref>[http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article12 Augsburg Confession, Article XII: Of Repentance]</ref>]]\n\nIn Lutheranism, conversion or regeneration in the strict sense of the term is the work of divine grace<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Peter|1:3|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|1:9|31}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|2:7|31}}, {{bibleverse||Titus|3:5|31}}</ref> and power<ref>{{bibleverse||Ephesians|1:19|31}}, {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:12|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|1:13|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|6:26|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|5:17}}</ref> by which man, born of the flesh,<ref>{{bibleverse||John|3:6|31}}</ref> and void of all power to think,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|3:5|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|2:14|31}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:18|31}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|5:8|31}}</ref> to will,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|6:5|31}}, {{bibleverse||Genesis|8:2|31}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|8:7|31}}</ref> or to do<ref>{{bibleverse||Philippians|1:6|31}}, {{bibleverse||Philippians|2:13|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|15:45|31}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|7:14|31}}</ref> any good thing, and dead in sin<ref>{{bibleverse||Colossians|2:13|31}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|2:5|31}}</ref> is, through the gospel and holy baptism,<ref>{{bibleverse||James|1:18|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|1:23|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|3:5|31}}, {{bibleverse||Titus|3:5|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|4:15|31}}, {{bibleverse||Galatians|4:19|31}}</ref> taken<ref>{{bibleverse||Colossians|1:12-13|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:25|31}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|31:18|31}}</ref> from a state of sin and wrath and spiritual death<ref>{{bibleverse||Romans|3:9-23|31}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|6:17|31}}, {{bibleverse||Job|15:14|31}}, {{bibleverse||Psalm|14:3|31}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|2:3|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:10|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:25|31}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|26:18|31}}</ref> into a state of spiritual life of faith and grace,<ref>{{bibleverse||Ephesians|2:5|31}}, {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:13|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|3:5|31}}, {{bibleverse||Titus|3:5|31}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|20:21|31}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|26:18|31}}</ref> rendered able to will and to do what is spiritually good<ref>{{bibleverse||Philippians|2:13|31}}</ref> and, especially, made actually to accept the benefits of the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Peter|1:3|31}}, {{bibleverse||Galatians|3:26|31}}, {{bibleverse||Galatians|4:5|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:10|31}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|26:18|31}}</ref><ref>Augustus Lawrence Graebner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=93ErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA136&vq Lutheran Cyclopedia] p. 136, \"Conversion\"</ref>\n\n==Conversion between denominations==\nMost denominations accept one's baptism performed by another denomination. Nearly always, the baptism must have been with water and performed in the name of the [[Trinity]]. Such converts are usually received by a formal rite which normally also includes taking communion in the denomination and possibly being confirmed. The similarity of belief necessary for acceptance of a baptism under a different denomination is called \"Like Faith and Practice\" or sometimes \"Right Method, Right Medium, Right Meaning\". \n\n===Catholicism===\nThe Catholic Church considers all forms of baptism with water, including full immersion, affusion, and aspersion, that are done in the name of the Trinity as valid.<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church 1256, \"The ordinary ministers of Baptism are the bishop and priest and, in the Latin Church, also the deacon. In case of necessity, anyone, even a non-baptized person, with the required intention, can baptize, by using the Trinitarian baptismal formula. The intention required is to will to do what the Church does when she baptizes. The Church finds the reason for this possibility in the universal saving will of God and the necessity of Baptism for salvation.\"</ref> \n\nProtestants (Lutherans, Anglicans, [[Presbyterians]], [[Baptists]], [[Assemblies of God]], Methodists, etc.) who convert to Catholicism are usually not baptized,<ref>Code of Canon Law, Part I, Baptism, Chapter III:\"Those baptized in a non-Catholic ecclesial community must not be baptized conditionally unless, after an examination of the matter and the form of the words used in the conferral of baptism and a consideration of the intention of the baptized adult and the minister of the baptism, a serious reason exists to doubt the validity of the baptism.\"</ref> but instead are asked to make a simple profession of faith at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on an ordinary Sunday. Confirmation usually follows (though not always), and the convert proceeds to receive first communion. \n\nEastern Christians (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and [[Church of the East|Assyrians]]), are only asked to make a simple profession of faith and then begin participation in the [[Eucharist]] without having to be confirmed due to the Catholic Church recognizing eastern Christian sacraments.<ref>UNITATIS REDINTEGRATIO, Chapter III: CHURCHES AND ECCLESIAL COMMUNITIES SEPARATED FROM THE ROMAN APOSTOLIC SEE; \"These [Eastern] Churches, although separated from us, possess true sacraments, above all by apostolic succession, the priesthood and the Eucharist, whereby they are linked with us in closest intimacy. Therefore some worship in common (communicatio in sacris), given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not only possible but to be encouraged.\"</ref> Eastern Christians who convert to the Catholic Church are automatically enrolled into the eastern rite corresponding to the Church they originated from regardless of what [[sui juris]] Church they entered the Catholic Church through.<ref>1990 Code of Canons of Oriental Churches, Canon 35; \"Baptized non-Catholics coming into full communion with the Catholic Church should retain and practice their own rite everywhere in the world and should observe it as much as humanly possible. Thus, they are to be enrolled in the Church sui iuris of the same rite with due regard for the right of approaching the Apostolic See in special cases of persons, communities or regions.\"</ref>\n\nThe amount of instruction before reception varies depending on how active the person has been in their Christian life, and how informed they are about the faith. Validly baptized persons coming from previous denominations do not have to be enrolled in [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|RCIA]] because the Church does not consider them catechumens since their baptism has already made them Christians. Private instructions may be given by a priest, which can last from a few weeks to a few months at most.  After instructions have ensued, the person may be asked to pick a sponsor for confirmation if the pastor decides to perform the sacrament. \n\n[[Mormons]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Oneness Pentecostals]], [[Christadelphians]], [[Christian Science|Christian Scientist]], and other groups who hold to nontrinitarianism and/or who do not baptize in the \"proper\" Trinitarian formula are received into the Catholic Church through baptism due to the Catholic Church not recognizing nontrinitarian baptisms.<ref>THE QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF BAPTISM CONFERRED IN THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS [https://www.ewtn.com/library/theology/mormbap1.htm]</ref> [[Quakers]] and members of the [[Salvation Army]] are also baptized because neither church practices baptism. \n\nConverts into any of the Eastern Catholic Churches, 23 sui juris Churches in full communion with the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], are usually received by the traditions of that particular Church.\n\n===Orthodoxy===\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church there are different opinions held by bishops and theologians on how to receive Christians coming from other denominations. Some will only accept Orthodox baptism done by triple immersion, and thus will rebaptize all converts. Generally, most jurisdictions will accept baptism done in another denomination by [[Economy (religion)|economy]], as long as it has been done with water in the name of the Trinity; this is the position held by the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]].<ref>Saint George Greek Orthodox Church, Conversion, [http://www.stgeorgegoc.org/pastors-corner/catechism-conversion]</ref> Most converts from other Christian denominations with baptisms in the Trinitarian formula (Catholics, Protestants, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrians) are received by [[chrismation]] and a profession of faith, or, in the cases of some Catholics and Non-Chalcedonian Christians, be received during [[Confession (religion)|confession]] as their chrismation (confirmation) in their former Church would be deemed valid. Protestant confirmation is not deemed valid by the Orthodox Church.\n\nSome Eastern Orthodox groups, such as the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia]] (ROCOR), a semi-autonomous part of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] since 2007, chooses to rebaptize all converts to Orthodoxy including Protestants and Catholics as well as most Oriental Orthodox. Since ROCOR is a fully canonical part of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Orthodox Christians who converted from another Christian denomination without being baptized again, but were received simply by chrismation or confession in their respective jurisdiction, are still communed by ROCOR clergy since Orthodox are not to doubt the validity of someone's conversion to the Orthodox faith. \n\nThe Orthodox Church baptizes all Christians coming from nontrinitarian denominations because the Orthodox Church does not consider nontrinitarian baptisms as valid. \n\nOriental Orthodox reception of converts from other Christian denominations varies greatly. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] accepts all baptisms done in the Eastern Orthodox Church, and since April 2017, accepts those baptisms done in the Roman Catholic Church. The [[Armenian Apostolic]], the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], and the [[Malankara Orthodox Church]] are generally willing to accept any baptism done with water in the name of the Trinity.<ref>http://www.malankara.com/baptism.html</ref>\n\n===Protestantism===\nMost [[mainline Protestant]] groups hold that baptism performed with water in the name of the Trinity is valid and will accept converts who had been baptized within a previous Christian denominations in accordance with their particular customs. \n\nSome [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] groups like [[Baptist|Baptists]] and [[Pentecostals]] do not consider baptism done by sprinkling or pouring as valid and might rebaptize a convert from another denomination by full immersion.\n\n===Others===\nMormons do not recognize baptisms done in Christian denominations and will rebaptize using the Trinitarian formula (although they reject the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity) and confirm converts.\n\nOneness Pentecostals only accept baptism done in the name of Jesus, and subsequently, baptize converts from previous denominations who were not previously baptized in this particular formula.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses baptize all converts including those already baptized in previous denominations.\n\n== Examples from the New Testament ==\n{{Faith primary|date=August 2016}}\nThe conversion of the [[Apostle Peter]], as recorded in the Bible,{{Bibleref2c|Luke|5:1-11}} {{Bibleref2c|Matt.|4:18-22}} serves as a classic example of \"a previously non-Christian person entering upon the Christian way of life\":\n\n{{quote|As Luke tells the story, it was the miraculous catch of fish that awakened Peter's consciousness to an awareness that there was more to Jesus than meets the eye. Peter found himself in the presence of someone or something which elicited from him that most natural of all gestures of awe, reverence, and holy fear\u2014he fell on his knees. This gesture was accompanied by a confession of his own wretched condition: \"Leave me, Lord; I am a sinful man\".{{Bibleref2c|Lk|5:9}} Once again, however, this insight is incomplete. Immediately a new life, a new direction is held out to Peter. \"Do not be afraid; from now on it is men you will catch\".{{Bibleref2c-nb|Lk|5:11}} And Peter followed Jesus, leaving everything behind.<ref name=\"Hanigan\">Hanigan, James P. \"Conversion and Christian Ethics.\" Online: {{cite web |url=http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/apr1983/v40-1-article3.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502195942/http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/apr1983/v40-1-article3.htm |archivedate=2012-05-02 }}. Accessed 17 June 2009</ref>}}\n\nThe Gospels speak of the coming of the Kingdom with power from on high and while Jesus was alive on earth he was still under the Jewish Law being obedient to its rules and regulations. Jesus though was given all authority in heaven and on earth, even the authority to forgive sins which before only God could do. While alive on the cross he did forgive the thief who asked him because he had that authority. In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|28:19-20}}, Jesus' last command was for his disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he had commanded.\n\nIn {{Bibleref2|Acts|1-2}} we see the start of the Christian church with the Holy Spirit coming down, and Peter preaching to the crowd about how their sins, along with the help of wicked men, crucified the savior. Their response was \"what shall we do?\" Peter's response to their faith was, \u201cRepent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off\u2014for all whom the Lord our God will call.\u201d\n\nAnother dramatic conversion to Christianity occurred in the life of the [[Apostle Paul]]{{Bibleref2c|Acts|9}} whose formal name had been Saul of Tarsus. He was a [[Zealot#Paul the Apostle|zealot]] for the cause of [[Second Temple Judaism]] who had been \"breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord\".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|9:1}} While traveling to [[Early centers of Christianity#Damascus|Damascus]] to arrest [[Jewish Christians]], he fell to the ground upon being surrounded by a bright light \"from heaven\". He heard a voice accusing him: \"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?\"{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|9:4}} The experience rendered him temporarily blind. The voice directed him to go on to Damascus where he was cured and baptized by [[Ananias of Damascus]], was described as being filled with the [[Holy Spirit]], and began to passionately proclaim the Christian [[gospel]] (good news).\n\nIn the book of Romans there is a description of what transpires through water baptism.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|6:2-4||6:2-4}} We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? (repentance) Or don\u2019t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. (Being immersed in water through baptism is like Jesus being buried in the tomb and being brought up out of the water is like Jesus' resurrection to a new life, i.e., born again by water and Spirit)\n\nHanigan perceives a common \"death and rebirth\" experience in these and other conversions which he describes as \"encounters with the living God\". His analysis is that these individuals responded not so much out of a sense of guilt, but from their awe, reverence, and holy fear of God's presence.

Converts to Christianity typically make a vow of [[repentance]] from past [[sin]]s, accept [[Jesus]] as their Savior and vow to follow his teachings as found in the [[New Testament]].\n\nDifferent sects of Christianity may perform various different kinds of rituals or ceremonies on a convert in order to initiate them into a community of believers. The most commonly accepted ritual of conversion in Christianity is through [[baptism]], but this is not universally accepted among Christian denominations. A period of instruction and study almost always ensues before a person is formally converted into Christianity, but the length of this period varies, sometimes as short as a few weeks and possibly less, and other times, up to as long as a year or possibly more. \n\nMost mainline Christian denominations will accept conversion into other denominations as valid, so long as a baptism with water in the name of the [[Trinity]] took place, but some may accept a simple profession of faith in Jesus as Lord as being all that was needed for true conversion.<ref>[https://www.gotquestions.org/what-is-a-Christian.html]</ref> Other Christians may not accept conversions performed in other denominations and certain communities may be discriminated against as heretical. This is most true for many nontrinitarian sects, which many mainstream Christian denominations (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant) reject as having valid forms of conversion. Consequently, many nontrinitarian sects spiritually isolate themselves in that they may only consider their conversions valid and not those of mainstream Christianity.\n\nSocial scientists have shown great interest in the Christian conversion as a religious experience that believers describe as strengthening their faith and changing their lives.<ref>Peter G.

More traditional Christian groups such as the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Orthodox Church]], [[Lutherans]], [[Anglicans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and some [[Reformed]] Christians consider the [[sacrament]] of [[baptism]] in the name of the Trinity to be the moment of conversion. All of these groups teach the doctrine of [[baptismal regeneration]], that is, once baptized, all past sins, including [[original sin]], are washed away and a person becomes justified before God. Through baptism, one is incorporated into the body of believers, called the [[Christian Church|Church]], and may rightly be considered a Christian. Some of these groups may also administer other sacraments in the process of conversion such as [[confirmation]]. Some Evangelical Christians, like [[Baptist]], and [[Pentecostals]], do not believe baptism is necessary for salvation and conversion, but only that a profession of faith is enough. Christians also differ on how old someone must be to convert. More traditional groups of Christians believe conversion is not restricted to age, and tend to [[Infant baptism|baptize infants.]] Evangelical Christians do not baptize children because they see conversion as a deeply personal decision.\n\n===Instructions===\nBefore conversion takes place, converts, also called \"catechumens\", must undergo a period of instruction. In the Catholic Church,  this usually involves spending a few months preparing in [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|RCIA]] (Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults), where catechumens spend time learning about the Christian faith and the teachings of the Bible and the Church. In the Orthodox Church, it can take up to a full year of studying and participation before one is baptized. Protestant denominations and other Christian groups have various other ways of instructing converts which may focus heavily on the Bible.\n\n===Baptism/Confirmation===\n[[File:Child baptism with water.jpg|thumb|Baptism of a child by affusion.]] \nThere are different modes of baptism in Christianity, these include [[Immersion baptism|immersion]], [[affusion]] (pouring), and [[aspersion]] (sprinkling). The way in which a person is baptized depends on the denomination one enters. Almost all baptisms share in common the use of the Trinitarian formula (in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) by the minister while baptizing the convert. The Roman Catholic Church primarily baptizes with affusion but occasionally does so with immersion.<ref>Can.854 Baptism is to be conferred either by immersion or by pouring; the prescripts of the conference of bishops are to be observed.</ref> Orthodox Christians and some Eastern Catholics baptize by triple immersion upon invocation of the Trinity<ref>We are commanded to baptize by threefold immersion in water, in the name of the Holy Trinity. The Scriptures and the writings of the church affirm this.[http://www.orthodox.net/articles/baptism.html]</ref>; the only time the Orthodox Church permits other forms of baptism is in the case of an emergency.\n\nProtestants baptize in a number of different ways. Many Anglicans and Lutherans baptize by affusion, whereas Presbyterians and Congregationalists typically baptize with aspersion.<ref>\"Presbyterians baptize by aspersion -- sprinkling of water on the head -- in the name of God, the Father; God, the Son; and God, the Holy Spirit.\",[http://peopleof.oureverydaylife.com/baptism-performed-presbyterian-church-7961.html]</ref> Others, like Methodists, may conduct all three forms of baptism. Many Evangelical Protestants insist that only full immersion baptism is valid, basing this on the New Testament [[Koine Greek|Greek]] word for baptism \"baptizo\" (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03c9) which can be translated as \"dipping\" or \"submersion.\"\n\nDepending on which of these denominations one enters, the sacrament of [[Confirmation]], also known as [[Chrismation]] by eastern Christians, may be immediately administered after the baptism. In the [[Latin Church|Latin Catholic Church]], infants who are baptized are not confirmed, but instead must wait until they're in their teens to be confirmed. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, and many [[Eastern Catholic]] Churches, infants are Chrismated and communed by a priest or bishop immediately after they are baptized. When an adult convert enters the Catholic or Orthodox Church, they are immediately confirmed after baptism, upon which, a clergy member will anoint the forehead with [[olive oil]] (or in the case of Byzantine Christians, the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, breast, hands, and feet), calling upon the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] to seal the convert with his gifts.<ref>United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Rite of Christian Initiations of Adults: \"After the Baptism the newly baptized are dressed in white garments and presented with a candle lighted from the Paschal Candle. They are then Confirmed by the priest or bishop who lays hands on their heads, and invokes the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. He then anoints them with the oil called Sacred Chrism. The Mass continues with the newly baptized participating in the general intercessions and in bringing gifts to the altar. At Communion, the newly baptized receive the Eucharist, Christ's Body and Blood, for the first time.\"</ref><ref>\"Holy Baptism is the first of seven Sacraments in the Orthodox Christian Church. Together with the Sacrament of Holy Chrism it joins the candidate to the Mystical Body of Christ, the Church.\",[http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/Baptism.htm]</ref> After confirmation ensues, the convert is invited to partake of [[first communion]]. These rites usually occur on [[Easter Vigil]]. \n\nPersons who convert to most mainline Protestant groups will be received via baptism and be initiated further by any traditions the particular denomination holds to.\n\n[[Oneness Pentecostals]] baptize converts by full immersion in the name of Jesus alone, a departure from the usual form of baptism. They base this off of certain passages found in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. Unlike most Pentecostals, Oneness Pentecostals believe baptism is necessary for salvation. Although, they do not baptize infants, stressing that conversion is a personal decision.\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) teach that baptism is the first [[sacrament]], called an [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] in LDS theology, following conversion and is required for membership in the LDS Church. Baptism, according to the LDS theology, requires that the convert be [[age of accountability|accountable]] ([[credobaptism]]), that it be by immersion, and that it be performed by an authorized [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] holder. As the LDS Church does not recognize the priesthood authority of other churches, all converts, even those from other Christian denominations, are required to be baptized. Following baptism, a convert is confirmed a member of the LDS Church and receives the [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|Gift of the Holy Ghost]] by the [[laying on of hands]] of a [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]] holder.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b/priesthood-and-church-government/lesson-5-performing-priesthood-ordinances?lang=eng Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part B: Performing Priesthood Ordinances], \u00a7Confirmation.</ref>\n\n===Evangelical Christianity===\n[[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestants]] do not consider baptism to be necessary for salvation. Because of this, instead of baptism, a person becomes a Christian the moment they profess Jesus as their Lord and Savior. Evangelicals base this off of their interpretation of certain verses in the Bible.{{Bibleref2c|Rom|10:9}} {{Bibleref2c|Rom|5:1}} \n\nThis may be expressed at some Evangelical church services where the Pastor may conduct an \"[[altar call]]\", inviting non-Christian persons to go up publicly and \"receive\" Jesus into their hearts to become Christian. \n\nAs a result of this belief, many Evangelicals do not practice infant baptism and from this they profess one must be able to make the decision on their own to convert to Christianity. Nevertheless, Evangelicals do practice [[Believer's baptism|baptism]], but it is seen as a simple public pronouncement of faith in Christ rather than a means of [[Grace in Christianity|grace]].\n\n===Lutheranism===\n[[File:RepentanceisContrition&faith.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' divides repentance into two parts: \"One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the [[Law_and_Gospel#The_Book_of_Concord|knowledge of sin]]; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of [[Absolution#Lutheranism|absolution]], and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors.\"<ref>[http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article12 Augsburg Confession, Article XII: Of Repentance]</ref>]]\n\nIn Lutheranism, conversion or regeneration in the strict sense of the term is the work of divine grace<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Peter|1:3|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|1:9|31}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|2:7|31}}, {{bibleverse||Titus|3:5|31}}</ref> and power<ref>{{bibleverse||Ephesians|1:19|31}}, {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:12|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|1:13|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|6:26|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|5:17}}</ref> by which man, born of the flesh,<ref>{{bibleverse||John|3:6|31}}</ref> and void of all power to think,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|3:5|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|2:14|31}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:18|31}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|5:8|31}}</ref> to will,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|6:5|31}}, {{bibleverse||Genesis|8:2|31}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|8:7|31}}</ref> or to do<ref>{{bibleverse||Philippians|1:6|31}}, {{bibleverse||Philippians|2:13|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|15:45|31}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|7:14|31}}</ref> any good thing, and dead in sin<ref>{{bibleverse||Colossians|2:13|31}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|2:5|31}}</ref> is, through the gospel and holy baptism,<ref>{{bibleverse||James|1:18|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|1:23|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|3:5|31}}, {{bibleverse||Titus|3:5|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|4:15|31}}, {{bibleverse||Galatians|4:19|31}}</ref> taken<ref>{{bibleverse||Colossians|1:12-13|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:25|31}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|31:18|31}}</ref> from a state of sin and wrath and spiritual death<ref>{{bibleverse||Romans|3:9-23|31}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|6:17|31}}, {{bibleverse||Job|15:14|31}}, {{bibleverse||Psalm|14:3|31}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|2:3|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:10|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:25|31}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|26:18|31}}</ref> into a state of spiritual life of faith and grace,<ref>{{bibleverse||Ephesians|2:5|31}}, {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:13|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|3:5|31}}, {{bibleverse||Titus|3:5|31}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|20:21|31}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|26:18|31}}</ref> rendered able to will and to do what is spiritually good<ref>{{bibleverse||Philippians|2:13|31}}</ref> and, especially, made actually to accept the benefits of the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Peter|1:3|31}}, {{bibleverse||Galatians|3:26|31}}, {{bibleverse||Galatians|4:5|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:10|31}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|26:18|31}}</ref><ref>Augustus Lawrence Graebner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=93ErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA136&vq Lutheran Cyclopedia] p. 136, \"Conversion\"</ref>\n\n==Conversion between denominations==\nMost denominations accept one's baptism performed by another denomination. Nearly always, the baptism must have been with water and performed in the name of the [[Trinity]]. Such converts are usually received by a formal rite which normally also includes taking communion in the denomination and possibly being confirmed. The similarity of belief necessary for acceptance of a baptism under a different denomination is called \"Like Faith and Practice\" or sometimes \"Right Method, Right Medium, Right Meaning\". \n\n===Catholicism===\nThe Catholic Church considers all forms of baptism with water, including full immersion, affusion, and aspersion, that are done in the name of the Trinity as valid.<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church 1256, \"The ordinary ministers of Baptism are the bishop and priest and, in the Latin Church, also the deacon. In case of necessity, anyone, even a non-baptized person, with the required intention, can baptize, by using the Trinitarian baptismal formula. The intention required is to will to do what the Church does when she baptizes. The Church finds the reason for this possibility in the universal saving will of God and the necessity of Baptism for salvation.\"</ref> \n\nProtestants (Lutherans, Anglicans, [[Presbyterians]], [[Baptists]], [[Assemblies of God]], Methodists, etc.) who convert to Catholicism are usually not baptized,<ref>Code of Canon Law, Part I, Baptism, Chapter III:\"Those baptized in a non-Catholic ecclesial community must not be baptized conditionally unless, after an examination of the matter and the form of the words used in the conferral of baptism and a consideration of the intention of the baptized adult and the minister of the baptism, a serious reason exists to doubt the validity of the baptism.\"</ref> but instead are asked to make a simple profession of faith at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on an ordinary Sunday. Confirmation usually follows (though not always), and the convert proceeds to receive first communion. \n\nEastern Christians (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and [[Church of the East|Assyrians]]), are only asked to make a simple profession of faith and then begin participation in the [[Eucharist]] without having to be confirmed due to the Catholic Church recognizing eastern Christian sacraments.<ref>UNITATIS REDINTEGRATIO, Chapter III: CHURCHES AND ECCLESIAL COMMUNITIES SEPARATED FROM THE ROMAN APOSTOLIC SEE; \"These [Eastern] Churches, although separated from us, possess true sacraments, above all by apostolic succession, the priesthood and the Eucharist, whereby they are linked with us in closest intimacy. Therefore some worship in common (communicatio in sacris), given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not only possible but to be encouraged.\"</ref> Eastern Christians who convert to the Catholic Church are automatically enrolled into the eastern rite corresponding to the Church they originated from regardless of what [[sui juris]] Church they entered the Catholic Church through.<ref>1990 Code of Canons of Oriental Churches, Canon 35; \"Baptized non-Catholics coming into full communion with the Catholic Church should retain and practice their own rite everywhere in the world and should observe it as much as humanly possible. Thus, they are to be enrolled in the Church sui iuris of the same rite with due regard for the right of approaching the Apostolic See in special cases of persons, communities or regions.\"</ref>\n\nThe amount of instruction before reception varies depending on how active the person has been in their Christian life, and how informed they are about the faith. Validly baptized persons coming from previous denominations do not have to be enrolled in [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|RCIA]] because the Church does not consider them catechumens since their baptism has already made them Christians. Private instructions may be given by a priest, which can last from a few weeks to a few months at most.  After instructions have ensued, the person may be asked to pick a sponsor for confirmation if the pastor decides to perform the sacrament. \n\n[[Mormons]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Oneness Pentecostals]], [[Christadelphians]], [[Christian Science|Christian Scientist]], and other groups who hold to nontrinitarianism and/or who do not baptize in the \"proper\" Trinitarian formula are received into the Catholic Church through baptism due to the Catholic Church not recognizing nontrinitarian baptisms.<ref>THE QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF BAPTISM CONFERRED IN THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS [https://www.ewtn.com/library/theology/mormbap1.htm]</ref> [[Quakers]] and members of the [[Salvation Army]] are also baptized because neither church practices baptism. \n\nConverts into any of the Eastern Catholic Churches, 23 sui juris Churches in full communion with the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], are usually received by the traditions of that particular Church.\n\n===Orthodoxy===\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church there are different opinions held by bishops and theologians on how to receive Christians coming from other denominations. Some will only accept Orthodox baptism done by triple immersion, and thus will rebaptize all converts. Generally, most jurisdictions will accept baptism done in another denomination by [[Economy (religion)|economy]], as long as it has been done with water in the name of the Trinity; this is the position held by the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]].<ref>Saint George Greek Orthodox Church, Conversion, [http://www.stgeorgegoc.org/pastors-corner/catechism-conversion]</ref> Most converts from other Christian denominations with baptisms in the Trinitarian formula (Catholics, Protestants, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrians) are received by [[chrismation]] and a profession of faith, or, in the cases of some Catholics and Non-Chalcedonian Christians, be received during [[Confession (religion)|confession]] as their chrismation (confirmation) in their former Church would be deemed valid. Protestant confirmation is not deemed valid by the Orthodox Church.\n\nSome Eastern Orthodox groups, such as the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia]] (ROCOR), a semi-autonomous part of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] since 2007, chooses to rebaptize all converts to Orthodoxy including Protestants and Catholics as well as most Oriental Orthodox. Since ROCOR is a fully canonical part of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Orthodox Christians who converted from another Christian denomination without being baptized again, but were received simply by chrismation or confession in their respective jurisdiction, are still communed by ROCOR clergy since Orthodox are not to doubt the validity of someone's conversion to the Orthodox faith. \n\nThe Orthodox Church baptizes all Christians coming from nontrinitarian denominations because the Orthodox Church does not consider nontrinitarian baptisms as valid. \n\nOriental Orthodox reception of converts from other Christian denominations varies greatly. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] accepts all baptisms done in the Eastern Orthodox Church, and since April 2017, accepts those baptisms done in the Roman Catholic Church. The [[Armenian Apostolic]], the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], and the [[Malankara Orthodox Church]] are generally willing to accept any baptism done with water in the name of the Trinity.<ref>http://www.malankara.com/baptism.html</ref>\n\n===Protestantism===\nMost [[mainline Protestant]] groups hold that baptism performed with water in the name of the Trinity is valid and will accept converts who had been baptized within a previous Christian denominations in accordance with their particular customs. \n\nSome [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] groups like [[Baptist|Baptists]] and [[Pentecostals]] do not consider baptism done by sprinkling or pouring as valid and might rebaptize a convert from another denomination by full immersion.\n\n===Others===\nMormons do not recognize baptisms done in Christian denominations and will rebaptize using the Trinitarian formula (although they reject the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity) and confirm converts.\n\nOneness Pentecostals only accept baptism done in the name of Jesus, and subsequently, baptize converts from previous denominations who were not previously baptized in this particular formula.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses baptize all converts including those already baptized in previous denominations.\n\n== Examples from the New Testament ==\n{{Faith primary|date=August 2016}}\nThe conversion of the [[Apostle Peter]], as recorded in the Bible,{{Bibleref2c|Luke|5:1-11}} {{Bibleref2c|Matt.|4:18-22}} serves as a classic example of \"a previously non-Christian person entering upon the Christian way of life\":\n\n{{quote|As Luke tells the story, it was the miraculous catch of fish that awakened Peter's consciousness to an awareness that there was more to Jesus than meets the eye. Peter found himself in the presence of someone or something which elicited from him that most natural of all gestures of awe, reverence, and holy fear\u2014he fell on his knees. This gesture was accompanied by a confession of his own wretched condition: \"Leave me, Lord; I am a sinful man\".{{Bibleref2c|Lk|5:9}} Once again, however, this insight is incomplete. Immediately a new life, a new direction is held out to Peter. \"Do not be afraid; from now on it is men you will catch\".{{Bibleref2c-nb|Lk|5:11}} And Peter followed Jesus, leaving everything behind.<ref name=\"Hanigan\">Hanigan, James P. \"Conversion and Christian Ethics.\" Online: {{cite web |url=http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/apr1983/v40-1-article3.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502195942/http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/apr1983/v40-1-article3.htm |archivedate=2012-05-02 }}. Accessed 17 June 2009</ref>}}\n\nThe Gospels speak of the coming of the Kingdom with power from on high and while Jesus was alive on earth he was still under the Jewish Law being obedient to its rules and regulations. Jesus though was given all authority in heaven and on earth, even the authority to forgive sins which before only God could do. While alive on the cross he did forgive the thief who asked him because he had that authority. In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|28:19-20}}, Jesus' last command was for his disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he had commanded.\n\nIn {{Bibleref2|Acts|1-2}} we see the start of the Christian church with the Holy Spirit coming down, and Peter preaching to the crowd about how their sins, along with the help of wicked men, crucified the savior. Their response was \"what shall we do?\" Peter's response to their faith was, \u201cRepent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off\u2014for all whom the Lord our God will call.\u201d\n\nAnother dramatic conversion to Christianity occurred in the life of the [[Apostle Paul]]{{Bibleref2c|Acts|9}} whose formal name had been Saul of Tarsus. He was a [[Zealot#Paul the Apostle|zealot]] for the cause of [[Second Temple Judaism]] who had been \"breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord\".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|9:1}} While traveling to [[Early centers of Christianity#Damascus|Damascus]] to arrest [[Jewish Christians]], he fell to the ground upon being surrounded by a bright light \"from heaven\". He heard a voice accusing him: \"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?\"{{Bibleref2c-nb|Acts|9:4}} The experience rendered him temporarily blind. The voice directed him to go on to Damascus where he was cured and baptized by [[Ananias of Damascus]], was described as being filled with the [[Holy Spirit]], and began to passionately proclaim the Christian [[gospel]] (good news).\n\nIn the book of Romans there is a description of what transpires through water baptism.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Rom|6:2-4||6:2-4}} We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? (repentance) Or don\u2019t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. (Being immersed in water through baptism is like Jesus being buried in the tomb and being brought up out of the water is like Jesus' resurrection to a new life, i.e., born again by water and Spirit)\n\nHanigan perceives a common \"death and rebirth\" experience in these and other conversions which he describes as \"encounters with the living God\". His analysis is that these individuals responded not so much out of a sense of guilt, but from their awe, reverence, and holy fear of God's presence. The pattern, he writes, begins with God taking initiative in the individual's life. Then, the person responds by acknowledging and confessing personal lostness and sinfulness, and then accepting a [[Universal call to holiness|call to holiness]].<ref name=\"Hanigan\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n* [[Conversion of the Jews]]\n* [[Credo]]\n* [[Engel Scale]]\n* [[Forced conversion]]\n* [[List of converts to Christianity]]\n* [[Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults]] (RCIA)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Christian Soteriology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conversion To Christianity}}\n[[Category:Conversion to Christianity| ]]\n", "name_user": "Illegitimate Barrister", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLutheranism", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_to_Christianity"}

She added that it is \"a disappointing comeback from an artist who has a track record in creating hits\", as it is \"one romp that never reaches climax\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> ''[[Evening Standard]]''{{'}}s David Smyth expressed his disappointment in the album's subject matter, but complimented its production: \"In fact, so single-minded is his [Bieber] approach this time that it feels like she's [Baldwin] his only intended audience\", and thus Bieber's audience at his tour \"are going to be underwhelmed by the unchanging, lounging pace of the new material, gently ticking beats and lack of memorable choruses\".<ref name=\"ES\" /> \n\nRating the album a 4.5 out of 10, Jayson Greene of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that \"''Changes'' settles into a middle-distance, stream-friendly murmur that is more sleepy than salacious\", adding that its songs \"are all cold angles and frictionless surfaces, devoid of intimacy and heat\".

He stated that the album emulates the early 2000s, but it \"doesn't do so reverentially, nor does it borrow from a sonic palette to make it new again\", resulting in an \"uninspired and confused\" record, that \"lacks the emotional maturity\" to translate Bieber's marriage. He described Bieber's treatment of sex on the album is \"instant, bountiful, in your face, but ultimately unrealistic and devoid of any eroticism\" like [[pornography]].

He described Bieber's treatment of sex on the album is \"instant, bountiful, in your face, but ultimately unrealistic and devoid of any eroticism\" like [[pornography]].

After graduating first of his year from [[Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris]] in 1930, he worked as an embassy secretary in [[Athens]] between 1933 and 1938. Back in Paris, he had to resign in 1940 for personal reasons before being reintegrated in 1943 and finally ending his diplomatic career in 1945. In his novels, he often treated controversial themes and his work put him at odds with the [[Roman Catholic]] church.\n\nHe wrote openly about his [[homoerotic]] experiences in boarding school in his 1943 first novel ''[[Les amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res]]'' (''Particular Friendships''\u2014a term used in seminaries to refer to friendships seen as too close and exclusive, often incorrectly translated as \"Special Friendships\"), which won the coveted [[prix Renaudot]] in 1944. The book was made into a film of the same name  which was released in 1964. On the set, Peyrefitte met the 12-year-old [[Alain-Philippe Malagnac d'Argens de Vill\u00e8le]];<ref>R. Peyrefitte, ''Propos secrets'', 1977, pp. 285\u2013289; ''L'Enfant de c\u0153ur'', 1978, pp. 9 and 29.</ref> and both fell in love. Peyrefitte tells the story of their relationship in ''Notre amour'' (\"Our Love\" \u2013 1967) and ''L'Enfant de c\u0153ur'' (\"Child of the Heart\" \u2013 1978).  Malagnac later married [[performer]] [[Amanda Lear]].\n\nA cultivator of scandal, Peyrefitte attacked the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[Pope Pius&nbsp;XII]] in his book ''Les Cl\u00e9s de saint Pierre'' (1953), which earned him the nickname of \"Pope of the Homosexuals\".

After graduating first of his year from [[Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris]] in 1930, he worked as an embassy secretary in [[Athens]] between 1933 and 1938. Back in Paris, he had to resign in 1940 for personal reasons before being reintegrated in 1943 and finally ending his diplomatic career in 1945. In his novels, he often treated controversial themes and his work put him at odds with the [[Roman Catholic]] church.\n\nHe wrote openly about his [[homoerotic]] experiences in boarding school in his 1943 first novel ''[[Les amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res]]'' (''Particular Friendships''\u2014a term used in seminaries to refer to friendships seen as too close and exclusive, often incorrectly translated as \"Special Friendships\"), which won the coveted [[prix Renaudot]] in 1944. The book was made into a film of the same name  which was released in 1964. On the set, Peyrefitte met the 12-year-old [[Alain-Philippe Malagnac d'Argens de Vill\u00e8le]];<ref>R. Peyrefitte, ''Propos secrets'', 1977, pp. 285\u2013289; ''L'Enfant de c\u0153ur'', 1978, pp. 9 and 29.</ref> and both fell in love. Peyrefitte tells the story of their relationship in ''Notre amour'' (\"Our Love\" \u2013 1967) and ''L'Enfant de c\u0153ur'' (\"Child of the Heart\" \u2013 1978).  Malagnac later married [[performer]] [[Amanda Lear]].\n\nA cultivator of scandal, Peyrefitte attacked the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[Pope Pius&nbsp;XII]] in his book ''Les Cl\u00e9s de saint Pierre'' (1953), which earned him the nickname of \"Pope of the Homosexuals\". The publication of the book started a bitter quarrel with [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]]. Mauriac threatened to resign from the paper he was working with at the time, ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', if it did not stop carrying advertisements for the book.

Formed in 1968, they were all arrested and charged for selling hand gel and toilet roll at extortionate prices.\n\nRush is known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, [[fantasy]], and philosophy. The band's musical style has changed several times over the years, from a blues-inspired [[hard rock]] beginning, later moving into [[progressive rock]], and including a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers. In the early 1990s, Rush returned to a guitar-driven hard rock sound, which continued for the rest of their career. Rush announced plans to cease large-scale touring at the end of 2015, following the conclusion of their [[R40 Live Tour]].

Produced by record engineer and musician [[Rupert Hine]], these two albums saw Rush shedding much of its keyboard-saturated sound. Beginning with ''Presto'' (1989), the band opted for arrangements notably more guitar-centric than the previous two studio albums. Although synthesizers were still used in many songs, the instrument was no longer featured as the centrepiece of Rush's compositions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/presto-mw0000654443 |title=Presto |work=Allmusic.com |author=Gregory Heaney |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref> Continuing this trend, ''Roll the Bones'' (1991) extended the use of the standard three-instrument approach with even less focus on synthesizers than its predecessor. While musically these albums do not deviate significantly from a general pop-rock sound, Rush incorporated traces of other musical styles. \"Roll the Bones\", for example exhibits funk and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] elements, and the instrumental track \"[[Rush instrumentals#Where's My Thing?|Where's My Thing?]]\" features several jazz components.<ref>''Roll the Bones'' [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17152|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic:].

Peart took a hiatus to mourn and reflect, during which he travelled extensively throughout North America on his BMW motorcycle, covering {{convert|88,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush included a capacious rack of [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] in their concert equipment to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound \"events\" in real-time to match the sounds on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members shared duties throughout most songs. Each member had one or more [[MIDI controller]]s, which were loaded with different sounds for each song, and used available limbs to trigger the sounds while simultaneously playing their primary instrument(s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|title=Rush Rolls Again|date=September 2002|publisher=OnStage Magazine|accessdate=December 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2002}}</ref> It was with this technology that the group was able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity fans had come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of [[backing tracks]] or employing an additional band member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm|title=Backstage Club Newsletter|date=March 1990|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> The band members' coordinated use of pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to \"play\" sampled instruments and audio events was subtly visible in their live performances, especially so on [[R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour]], their 2005 concert DVD.{{citation needed|date = March 2018}}\n\nA staple of Rush's concerts was a Neil Peart drum solo. Peart's drum solos included a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, making each performance unique. Each successive tour saw the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favour of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart had used [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] [[Sound module|trigger pads]] to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a [[marimba]], [[harp]], [[temple blocks]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], glockenspiel, [[Bell (instrument)|orchestra bells]], tubular bells, and [[vibraslap]] as well as other, more esoteric percussion.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOne prominent feature of Rush's concerts were props on stage, at one point called \"diversions\". These props have included washing machines, vintage popcorn poppers, or animations and inflatable rabbits emerging from giant hats behind the band.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Joyce|first1=Mike|title=Colorful Diversions From Rush|work=The Washington Post|date=May 9, 1990}}</ref> Starting in the mid-90s, the props often took up Lee's side of the stage ([[Blocking (stage)|stage left]]) as a way to balance out the amp stacks on Lifeson's side (stage right) when Lee opted to use a venue's house system instead of amps.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nRush actively participates in philanthropic causes. The band was one of several hometown favourites to play [[Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto]], also dubbed SARStock, at [[Downsview Park]] in Toronto on July 30, 2003, with an attendance of over half a million people.

Formed in 1968, the band went through several configurations until arriving at its longest and classic line-up when Peart replaced original drummer [[John Rutsey]] in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first tour of the United States.\n\nRush is known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, [[fantasy]], and philosophy. The band's musical style has changed several times over the years, from a blues-inspired [[hard rock]] beginning, later moving into [[progressive rock]], and including a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers. In the early 1990s, Rush returned to a guitar-driven hard rock sound, which continued for the rest of their career. Rush announced plans to cease large-scale touring at the end of 2015, following the conclusion of their [[R40 Live Tour]]. After nearly three years of an uncertain future, Lifeson reluctantly announced in January 2018 that the band was not going to continue.<ref name=\"blabbermouth.net\">{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rush-guitarist-alex-lifeson-we-have-no-plans-to-tour-or-record-any-more-were-basically-done/|title=RUSH Guitarist ALEX LIFESON: \"We Have No Plans To Tour Or Record Anymore.

To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush included a capacious rack of [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] in their concert equipment to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound \"events\" in real-time to match the sounds on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members shared duties throughout most songs. Each member had one or more [[MIDI controller]]s, which were loaded with different sounds for each song, and used available limbs to trigger the sounds while simultaneously playing their primary instrument(s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|title=Rush Rolls Again|date=September 2002|publisher=OnStage Magazine|accessdate=December 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2002}}</ref> It was with this technology that the group was able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity fans had come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of [[backing tracks]] or employing an additional band member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm|title=Backstage Club Newsletter|date=March 1990|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> The band members' coordinated use of pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to \"play\" sampled instruments and audio events was subtly visible in their live performances, especially so on [[R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour]], their 2005 concert DVD.{{citation needed|date = March 2018}}\n\nA staple of Rush's concerts was a Neil Peart drum solo. Peart's drum solos included a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, making each performance unique. Each successive tour saw the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favour of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart had used [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] [[Sound module|trigger pads]] to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a [[marimba]], [[harp]], [[temple blocks]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], glockenspiel, [[Bell (instrument)|orchestra bells]], tubular bells, and [[vibraslap]] as well as other, more esoteric percussion.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOne prominent feature of Rush's concerts were props on stage, at one point called \"diversions\". These props have included washing machines, vintage popcorn poppers, or animations and inflatable rabbits emerging from giant hats behind the band.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Joyce|first1=Mike|title=Colorful Diversions From Rush|work=The Washington Post|date=May 9, 1990}}</ref> Starting in the mid-90s, the props often took up Lee's side of the stage ([[Blocking (stage)|stage left]]) as a way to balance out the amp stacks on Lifeson's side (stage right) when Lee opted to use a venue's house system instead of amps.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nRush actively participates in philanthropic causes. The band was one of several hometown favourites to play [[Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto]], also dubbed SARStock, at [[Downsview Park]] in Toronto on July 30, 2003, with an attendance of over half a million people.

Strong [[wind shear]], which disrupts the formation of cyclones, as well as a lack of weather disturbances favorable for development in the South [[Atlantic Ocean]], make any strong tropical system extremely rare, and [[Hurricane Catarina]] in 2004 is the only recorded South [[Atlantic hurricane]] in history. South Atlantic storms have developed year-round, with activity peaking during the months from November through May in this basin. Since 2011, the [[Brazilian Navy]] Hydrographic Center has assigned [[Lists of tropical cyclone names#South Atlantic|names]] to tropical and subtropical systems in the western side of the [[Tropical cyclone basins|basin]], near the eastern coast of Brazil, when they have sustained wind speeds of at least {{cvt|65|km/h|mph}}, the generally accepted minimum sustained wind speed for a disturbance to be designated as a [[tropical storm]] in the North Atlantic basin.

Strong [[wind shear]], which disrupts the formation of cyclones, as well as a lack of weather disturbances favorable for development in the South [[Atlantic Ocean]], make any strong tropical system extremely rare, and [[Hurricane Catarina]] in 2004 is the only recorded South [[Atlantic hurricane]] in history. South Atlantic storms have developed year-round, with activity peaking during the months from November through May in this basin. Since 2011, the [[Brazilian Navy]] Hydrographic Center has assigned [[Lists of tropical cyclone names#South Atlantic|names]] to tropical and subtropical systems in the western side of the [[Tropical cyclone basins|basin]], near the eastern coast of Brazil, when they have sustained wind speeds of at least {{cvt|65|km/h|mph}}, the generally accepted minimum sustained wind speed for a disturbance to be designated as a [[tropical storm]] in the North Atlantic basin.

Door-to-door inquiries on MacKieth Street also produced a woman who remembered hearing female screams on the evening of Jemima's murder, although this individual could not recall the precise time. Consequently, police considered this information of little use to their inquiry.\n\n==Initial investigation==\nAlthough the [[City of Glasgow Police]] noted several striking similarities between the murders of Patricia Docker and Jemima McDonald, including that both women had attended the Barrowland Ballroom on the evening of their murder, been beaten before being strangled to death with a ligature, were menstruating, and had their handbags taken from the crime scene. Initially, both murders were not considered to be the work of the same perpetrator.{{sfn|Lloyd|1986|p=194}}\n\nDespite extensive public appeals, the investigation into the murder of Patricia Docker in 1968 had quickly become a [[cold case]]. Police had little information, owing to both a lack of [[witness]]es and hard evidence.{{sfn|Lloyd|1986|p=193}} The investigation had also been severely hindered by  investigators discovering three days after her death that Patricia had attended the Barrowland Ballroom on the evening of her murder.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/i-think-bible-john-already-11923937|title=False Information Doomed Bible John Probe from the Start|website=The Daily Record|last=Silvester|first=Norman|date=28 January 2018|accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DANCING+WITH+DEATH%3B+CHASING+KILLERS%3A+RETIRED+COP+JOE+JACKSON+ON+THE...-a0186026767|title=Dancing With Death: Chasing Killers|publisher=[[The Free Library]]|website=Daily Record|last=Jackson|first=Joe|date=1 October 2008|accessdate=30 May 2013}}</ref> Eighteen months later, following the discovery of Jemima McDonald, police became aware of remarkable similarities to the murder of Patricia Docker. Although police did not conclusively link both murders to the same perpetrator, they could not completely discount this theory. In addition, police were certain the perpetrator or perpetrators held a high degree of local geographical knowledge. However, they may have been a stranger to the district, as none of the eyewitnesses with whom investigators conversed directly knew the individual(s) seen in the company of either woman prior to her murder.<ref name=\"Herald Scotland\"/>\n[[File:Barrowlands, Glasgow - geograph.org.uk - 663608.jpg|thumb|right|The Barrowland Ballroom, seen here in 2011.

Detectives were also blamed by proprietors for a sharp decrease in attendance figures.{{sfn|Lloyd|1986|pp=196-197}}\n\n===Helen Puttock===\nOn 31 October 1969, a man walking his dog discovered the body of 29-year-old Helen Puttock behind a [[tenement]] in the [[Scotstoun]] district of Glasgow. Her body was found beside a drainpipe in the back garden of her Earl Street flat. She had been stripped partially naked, extensively beaten about the face before being raped, then strangled to death with one of her own stockings.{{sfn|Lloyd|1986|p=201}} The contents of her handbag had been scattered close to her body, although the handbag itself was missing from the crime scene. Grass and weed stains upon the soles of Helen's feet and shoes indicated that she had engaged in a ferocious struggle with her killer. She had evidently at one point attempted to scale a nearby railway embankment. Her body also bore a deep [[forensic dentistry|bite mark]] on her upper right thigh.<ref name=\"Skelton2\"/> Her murderer had placed her [[sanitary towel]] beneath her left arm. As had been the case with the two previous victims, Helen had been menstruating at the time of her murder.{{sfn|Whittington-Egan|Whittington-Egan|1992|p=17}}\n\nThe evening prior to her murder, Helen and her sister, Jean Langford, had been to the Barrowland Ballroom, where both had become acquainted with men named John.

She had been stripped partially naked, extensively beaten about the face before being raped, then strangled to death with one of her own stockings.{{sfn|Lloyd|1986|p=201}} The contents of her handbag had been scattered close to her body, although the handbag itself was missing from the crime scene. Grass and weed stains upon the soles of Helen's feet and shoes indicated that she had engaged in a ferocious struggle with her killer.

Her body also bore a deep [[forensic dentistry|bite mark]] on her upper right thigh.<ref name=\"Skelton2\"/> Her murderer had placed her [[sanitary towel]] beneath her left arm.

Criticism has also been levelled against the police for potentially hampering their own investigation by prematurely jumping to the conclusion that all three murders had been committed by the same person.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jeffrey|first=Robert|year=2006|title=Crimes Past: Glasgow's Crimes of the Century|publisher=Black and White Publishing}}</ref>{{refn|group=n|[[David Wilson (criminologist)|Professor David Wilson]] has stated that a lapse of time approximating 18 months is not unusual between a serial killer's first and second murders.<ref name=Wilson>{{Cite news|title=Scots murderer Peter Tobin is Bible John, says UK serial killer expert|date=13 June 2010|work=Daily Record|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/scots-murderer-peter-tobin-is-bible-1061592|accessdate=4 March 2019|last=McPherson|first=Lynn}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930208&slug=1684320 |title=Serial Killer Says He'd Do It Again |last=Oak Kim |first=Myung |date=8 February 1993 |website=[[The Seattle Times]] |access-date=25 January 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125214432/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930208&slug=1684320 |archivedate=25 January 2017 }}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1983, an anonymous individual contacted [[Strathclyde Police]].
