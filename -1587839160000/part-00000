Thompson, Bruce W. Ferguson and Scott L. Webster. Initial capitalization for Orbital was provided by Fred C Alcorn, a Texas oilman and Sam Dunnam, a Texas businessman in September 1982. In 1985, Orbital procured its first contract for providing up to four transfer orbital stage (TOS) vehicles to NASA. In 1987, the seeds for the [[Orbcomm (satellite)|Orbcomm]] constellation were planted when Orbital began investigating a system using [[low Earth orbit]] satellites to collect data from remote locations. In 1988, Orbital acquired Space Data Corporation in Arizona- one of the world's leading suppliers of suborbital rockets- thereby broadening its rocket business and manufacturing capabilities. This was followed by the opening of a new facility in Chandler, Arizona in 1989 to house the company's expanding rocket business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbital.com/CorporateInformation/Milestones/1982-1989/|title= Orbital Milestones 1982-1989|publisher=Orbital.com |date=June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the company successfully carried out eight space missions, highlighted by the initial launch of the [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]] rocket, the world's first privately developed space launch vehicle (the claim of being the first privately developed space launch vehicle can be contested as Pegasus received significant funding from [[NASA]] and [[DARPA]], and a predecessor private rocket exists, the [[Conestoga (rocket)|Conestoga]] rocket)<!-- Pegasus was mostly funded by NASA and DARPA.  Is this really privately developed? And also the claim of being the first privately funded and developed rocket is contested by the Conestoga rocket-->. Shortly following the successful Pegasus launch, Orbital conducted an [[initial public offering|IPO]] in 1990 and began trading on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange. In 1993, Orbital established its headquarters in [[Dulles, Virginia|Dulles]], [[Virginia]]. In the same year (1994), Orbital successfully conducted the inaugural launch of the [[Minotaur-C|Taurus]] (now renamed as [[Minotaur-C]]) rocket.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Orbital continued expanding its missile defense systems business with a $900 million award to develop, build, test and support interceptor booster vehicles. In 2006 Orbital conducted its 500th mission since the company's founding with products that included satellites, launch vehicles, and missile defense systems. In 2007, the first interplanetary spacecraft built by Orbital, [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]] was launched on an eight-year, three-billion-mile journey to the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. A major milestone in the company's history was in 2008 when it received a long-term NASA contract to provide cargo transportation services to and from the [[International Space Station|International Space Station (ISS)]] with a value of approximately $1.9 billion for missions from 2011 to 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orbital.com/CorporateInformation/Milestones/2000-2009| title=Orbital Milestones 2000\u20132009| publisher= Orbital | date=June 2014}}</ref> Orbital used its [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus spacecraft]] and [[Antares (rocket)|Antares]] rocket to transport cargo to ISS following the success of [[Cygnus Orb-D1]] and [[Cygnus CRS Orb-1]].\n\n===Acquisitions===\n\nOrbital Science made a number of strategic acquisitions in the 1990s and 2000s to strengthen its position in the satellite market.\n\nIn 1994, Orbital completed acquisition of [[Fairchild Industries]]'s subsidiary Space and Defense Corporation, and merged the Fairchild Space business with its own satellite design and manufacturing division.<ref name=\"Fairchild\" /> The electronics business of this subsidiary was later sold off in 2000.<ref name=\"Fairchild\">[http://spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=2710 Orbital to Sell Fairchild Defense Unit to Smiths Industries for $100 Million]\", SpaceRef, September 27, 2000.</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Orbital acquired CTA, Inc, a company having designed and built the first geostationary \"lightsat\" under contract to Indonesia for Asia's first Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) television broadcast program - providing an entry into the fast-growing [[Geosynchronous orbit|Geosynchronous (GEO)]] communications satellite market.<ref name=\"Orbital Milestones\">{{cite web|url=http://www.orbital.com/CorporateInformation/Milestones/1990-1999/|title= Orbital Milestones 1990-1999|publisher=Orbital.com |date=June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Orbital acquired the Gilbert, Arizona-based satellite development and manufacturing unit from [[General Dynamics]] to complement its main satellite manufacturing facility in Dulles, Virginia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.orbital.com/CorporateInformation/Milestones/2010-Present/ |title=Orbital Milestones 2010-present |publisher=Orbital |date=June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630125342/http://www.orbital.com/CorporateInformation/Milestones/2010-Present/ |archivedate=2014-06-30 }}</ref>\n\n===Merger===\nOn April 29, 2014, Orbital Sciences announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with [[Alliant Techsystems]] to combine Orbital and ATK's Aerospace and Defense (A&D) Groups to create a $4.5 billion (combined calendar year 2013 annual revenue), 13000-person company.

Thompson, Bruce W. Ferguson and Scott L. Webster. Initial capitalization for Orbital was provided by Fred C Alcorn, a Texas oilman and Sam Dunnam, a Texas businessman in September 1982. In 1985, Orbital procured its first contract for providing up to four transfer orbital stage (TOS) vehicles to NASA. In 1987, the seeds for the [[Orbcomm (satellite)|Orbcomm]] constellation were planted when Orbital began investigating a system using [[low Earth orbit]] satellites to collect data from remote locations. In 1988, Orbital acquired Space Data Corporation in Arizona- one of the world's leading suppliers of suborbital rockets- thereby broadening its rocket business and manufacturing capabilities. This was followed by the opening of a new facility in Chandler, Arizona in 1989 to house the company's expanding rocket business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbital.com/CorporateInformation/Milestones/1982-1989/|title= Orbital Milestones 1982-1989|publisher=Orbital.com |date=June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the company successfully carried out eight space missions, highlighted by the initial launch of the [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]] rocket, the world's first privately developed space launch vehicle (the claim of being the first privately developed space launch vehicle can be contested as Pegasus received significant funding from [[NASA]] and [[DARPA]], and a predecessor private rocket exists, the [[Conestoga (rocket)|Conestoga]] rocket)<!-- Pegasus was mostly funded by NASA and DARPA.  Is this really privately developed? And also the claim of being the first privately funded and developed rocket is contested by the Conestoga rocket-->. Shortly following the successful Pegasus launch, Orbital conducted an [[initial public offering|IPO]] in 1990 and began trading on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange. In 1993, Orbital established its headquarters in [[Dulles, Virginia|Dulles]], [[Virginia]]. In the same year (1994), Orbital successfully conducted the inaugural launch of the [[Minotaur-C|Taurus]] (now renamed as [[Minotaur-C]]) rocket.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Orbital continued expanding its missile defense systems business with a $900 million award to develop, build, test and support interceptor booster vehicles. In 2006 Orbital conducted its 500th mission since the company's founding with products that included satellites, launch vehicles, and missile defense systems.

For example, Orbital's GEOStar-1 spacecraft provides a compact platform optimized for [[Geostationary orbit|GEO]] missions (adaptable for [[Medium Earth orbit|MEO]] for launch aboard [[Minotaur (rocket)|Minotaur]], [[Falcon (rocket family)|Falcon]], and [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle|EELV]] launch vehicles to deliver resilient capabilities in a relatively short period of time (years instead of decades).<ref name=\"National Security Systems\"/> \nOrbital's [[hosted payload]] capabilities in national security systems include the ''Hosted Infrared Payload'' ''(CHIRP)'' program for the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. The wide-field of view sensor was hosted on an Orbital-built commercial GEO communications satellite. Orbital's hosted payload program takes advantage of the high frequency of commercial satellite launches and the excess resources that typically exist on a commercial communications satellite to provide frequent and low-cost access to space for National Security Systems.<ref name=\"National Security Systems\"/>\n\n===Advanced flight systems===\nOrbital's current advanced flight systems programs include the contract with [[Stratolaunch Systems]] to design a new intermediate-class rocket to be carried aloft and launched from the largest aircraft ever built-[[Scaled Composites Stratolaunch|Stratolaunch carrier aircraft]]. Orbital is responsible for the program's overall systems engineering, and the development, production, test, and operations of the air-launch rocket and related ground operations, including payload and launch vehicle integration. A demo launch is currently scheduled for 2017.\nOrbital's heritage programs in advanced flight systems include the NASA [[Orbital Sciences X-34|X-34]] and [[NASA X-43|X-43]] programs, and the [[Orion (spacecraft)#Launch Abort System|Orion Launch Abort System]], among others.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.orbital.com/AdvancedSystems/AdvancedLaunchSystems/| title=Advanced Flight Systems| publisher=Orbital| date=June 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614042534/http://www.orbital.com/AdvancedSystems/AdvancedLaunchSystems/| archivedate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Commercial Resupply Services]]\n* [[NewSpace]]\n* [[SpaceX]]\n* [[Space exploration]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.orbital.com Orbital Sciences Corporation official website]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Orbital Sciences Corporation| ]]\n[[Category:Companies formerly listed on the New York Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Aerospace companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Commercial launch service providers]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Dulles, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1982]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1982]]\n[[Category:Private spaceflight companies]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft manufacturers]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 2015]]\n[[Category:2015 disestablishments in Virginia]]\n", "name_user": "V35b", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAcquisitions:\"Orbital Science made a number of strategic acquisitions ...to strengthen their position ...\" -> \"Orbital Science made a number of strategic acquisitions ...to strengthen its position ...\" The antecedent of possessive pronoun is the singular noun Orbital Sciences.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_Sciences_Corporation"}
