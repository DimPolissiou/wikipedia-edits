In 1974, Bakiyev served in the ranks of the Soviet Army. In 1979, he moved to Jalal-Abad where, from 1979 to 1985, he worked at the plug-in connectors factory. Between 1990-91 he worked as the first secretary of the Kok-Yangak City Committee of the Communist Party of Kirghizia. Starting in 1995, he was the Governor of the Jalal-Abad Region, and Governor of the Chui Region.

A fire on board the French ship ignited her cargo, causing a massive explosion that devastated the [[Richmond, Nova Scotia|Richmond district]] of Halifax.

On the ''Mont-Blanc'', the impact damaged [[benzole|benzol]] barrels stored on deck, leaking vapors which were ignited by sparks from the collision, setting off a fire on board that quickly grew out of control. Approximately 20 minutes later at 9:04:35&nbsp;am, the ''Mont-Blanc'' exploded.\n\nNearly all structures within an 800-metre (half-mile) radius, including the community of Richmond, were obliterated.{{sfn|Armstrong|2002|p=42}} A [[Longitudinal wave|pressure wave]] snapped trees, bent iron rails, demolished buildings, grounded vessels (including ''Imo'', which was washed ashore by the ensuing [[tsunami]]), and scattered fragments of ''Mont-Blanc'' for kilometres. Across the harbour, in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]], there was also widespread damage.<ref name=cbc/>  A tsunami created by the blast wiped out the community of the [[Mi'kmaq]] [[First Nation]] who had lived in the [[Tufts Cove, Nova Scotia|Tufts Cove]] area for generations.\n\nRelief efforts began almost immediately, and hospitals quickly became full. Rescue trains began arriving the day of the explosion from across Nova Scotia and [[New Brunswick]] while other trains from central Canada and the [[northeastern United States]] were impeded by blizzards. Construction of temporary shelters to house the many people left homeless began soon after the disaster. The initial judicial inquiry found ''Mont-Blanc'' to have been responsible for the disaster, but a later appeal determined that both vessels were to blame.

of 6 December 1917. {{SS|Mont-Blanc}}, a French [[cargo ship]] laden with [[Explosive material|high explosives]], collided with the Norwegian vessel {{SS|Imo}} in the Narrows, a strait connecting the upper [[Halifax Harbour]] to [[Bedford Basin]]. A fire on board the French ship ignited her cargo, causing a massive explosion that devastated the [[Richmond, Nova Scotia|Richmond district]] of Halifax. Approximately 2,000 people were killed by the blast, debris, fires, or collapsed buildings, and an estimated 9,000 others were injured.<ref name=cbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/halifaxexplosion/he2_ruins/he2_ruins_explosion.html |title=Halifax Explosion 1917 |publisher=CBC |date=19 September 2003 |accessdate=25 February 2011}}</ref>  The blast was the [[Largest artificial non-nuclear explosions#Rank order of largest conventional explosions/detonations by magnitude|largest man-made explosion]] at the time,<ref name=TimeDisaster>{{cite book |title= Time: Disasters that Shook the World |publisher= Time Home Entertainment |year=2012 |page=56 |isbn=978-1-60320-247-3}}</ref> releasing the equivalent energy of roughly {{convert |2.9|ktonTNT|GJ||lk=on}}.{{sfn|Ruffman|Howell|1994|p=276}}\n\n''Mont-Blanc'' was under orders from the French government to carry her cargo from [[New York City]] via Halifax to [[Bordeaux]], France. At roughly 8:45&nbsp;am, she collided at low speed, approximately one knot ({{cvt|1.2|mph|disp=or}}), with the unladen ''Imo'', chartered by the [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]] to pick up a cargo of relief supplies in New York. On the ''Mont-Blanc'', the impact damaged [[benzole|benzol]] barrels stored on deck, leaking vapors which were ignited by sparks from the collision, setting off a fire on board that quickly grew out of control. Approximately 20 minutes later at 9:04:35&nbsp;am, the ''Mont-Blanc'' exploded.\n\nNearly all structures within an 800-metre (half-mile) radius, including the community of Richmond, were obliterated.{{sfn|Armstrong|2002|p=42}} A [[Longitudinal wave|pressure wave]] snapped trees, bent iron rails, demolished buildings, grounded vessels (including ''Imo'', which was washed ashore by the ensuing [[tsunami]]), and scattered fragments of ''Mont-Blanc'' for kilometres. Across the harbour, in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]], there was also widespread damage.<ref name=cbc/>  A tsunami created by the blast wiped out the community of the [[Mi'kmaq]] [[First Nation]] who had lived in the [[Tufts Cove, Nova Scotia|Tufts Cove]] area for generations.\n\nRelief efforts began almost immediately, and hospitals quickly became full. Rescue trains began arriving the day of the explosion from across Nova Scotia and [[New Brunswick]] while other trains from central Canada and the [[northeastern United States]] were impeded by blizzards. Construction of temporary shelters to house the many people left homeless began soon after the disaster. The initial judicial inquiry found ''Mont-Blanc'' to have been responsible for the disaster, but a later appeal determined that both vessels were to blame.

An extensive comparison of 130 major explosions by Halifax historian Jay White in 1994 concluded that \"Halifax Harbour remains unchallenged in overall magnitude as long as five criteria are considered together: number of casualties, force of blast, radius of devastation, quantity of explosive material, and total value of property destroyed.\"{{sfn|Ruffman|Howell|1994|p=266}} For many years afterward, the Halifax Explosion was the standard by which all large blasts were measured. For instance, in its report on the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' wrote that the explosive power of the [[Little Boy]] bomb was seven times that of the Halifax Explosion.<ref name=TimeDisaster/>\n\nThe many eye injuries resulting from the disaster led to better understanding on the part of physicians of how to care for damaged eyes, and \"with the recently formed [[Canadian National Institute for the Blind]], Halifax became internationally known as a centre for care for the blind\", according to [[Dalhousie University]] professor Victoria Allen.<ref name=jogc>{{cite journal|author=Allen, Victoria|title=Barometer rising|journal=JOGC|volume=33|issue=7|date=July 2011|pages=693\u2013694|pmid=21851762|doi=10.1016/S1701-2163(16)34952-0}}</ref> The lack of coordinated [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] care in such a disaster was also noted by [[William E.

Another way this is expressed is to imagine that two worlds are constructed that differ only by parity \u2014 the \"real\" world and the \"mirror\" world, where left and right are swapped. If an interaction is parity symmetric, it produces the same outcomes in both \"worlds\".<ref name=\"Wu1957\"/>\n\nThe aim of Wu's experiment was to determine if this was the case for the weak interaction by looking at whether the decay products of cobalt-60 were being emitted preferentially in one direction or not. This would signify the violation of parity symmetry because if the weak interaction were parity conserving, the decay emissions should be emitted with equal probability in all directions. As stated by Wu et al.:\n{{Quote|If an asymmetry in the distribution between \u03b8 and 180\u00b0\u2212\u03b8 (where \u03b8 is the angle between the orientation of the parent nuclei and the momentum of the electrons) is observed, it provides unequivocal proof that parity is not conserved in beta decay.<ref name=\"Wu1957\"/>}}\n\nThe reason for this is that the cobalt-60 nucleus carries [[Spin (physics)|spin]], and spin does not change direction under parity (because angular momentum is an [[axial vector]]). Conversely, the direction that the decay products are emitted ''is'' changed under parity because momentum is a [[polar vector]]. In other words, in the \"real\" world, if the cobalt-60 nuclear spin and the decay product emissions were both in roughly the same direction, then in the \"mirror\" world, they would be in roughly opposite directions, because the emission direction would have been flipped, but the spin direction would not.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/boyd/warwick_week/neutrino_physics/weak.pdf\n |title=The Weak Interaction\n |last=Boyd\n |first=Steve\n |date=2016-04-20\n |access-date=2019-12-08\n |website=Warwick University\n }}</ref>\n\nThis would be a clear difference in the behaviour of the weak interaction between both \"worlds\", and hence the weak interaction could not be said to be parity symmetric. The only way that the weak interaction could be parity symmetric is if there were no preference in the direction of emission, because then a flip in the direction of emissions in the \"mirror\" world would look no different than the \"real\" world because there were equal numbers of emissions in both directions anyway.\n\n== Experiment ==\nThe experiment monitored the decay of [[cobalt-60]] (<sup>60</sup>Co) atoms that were aligned by a uniform magnetic field (the polarizing field) and cooled to near [[absolute zero]] so that thermal motions did not ruin the alignment.<ref name=Wroblewski>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Wroblewski |first=Andrzej K.\n |year=2008\n |title=The downfall of parity: The revolution that happened fifty years ago\n |journal=[[Acta Physica Polonica B]]\n |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=251\u2013264\n |bibcode=2008AcPPB..39..251W\n |url=https://inspirehep.net/record/807786/files/v39p0251.pdf\n}}</ref> Cobalt-60 is an [[unstable isotope|unstable]] [[isotopes of cobalt|isotope of cobalt]] that decays by [[beta decay]] to the stable isotope [[nickel-60]] (<sup>60</sup>Ni). During this decay, one of the [[neutron]]s in the cobalt-60 nucleus decays to a [[proton]] by emitting an [[electron]] (e<sup>&minus;</sup>) and an [[electron antineutrino]] ({{overline|&nu;}}<sub>e</sub>). The resulting nickel nucleus, however, is in an [[excited state]] and promptly decays to its ground state by emitting two [[gamma ray]]s (&gamma;). Hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is:\n\n:<math>{}^{60}_{27}\\text{Co}  \\rightarrow  {}^{60}_{28}\\text{Ni} + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e + 2{\\gamma}</math>\n\nGamma rays are photons, and their release from the nickel-60 nucleus is an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] (EM) process. This is important because EM was known to respect parity conservation, and therefore they would be emitted roughly equally in all directions (they would be distributed roughly \"isotropically\"). Hence, the distribution of the emitted electrons could be compared to the distribution of the emitted gamma rays in order to compare whether they too were being emitted isotropically. In other words, the distribution of the gamma rays acted as a [[Scientific control|control]] for the distribution of the emitted electrons. Another benefit of the emitted gamma rays was that it was known that the degree to which they were ''not'' distributed perfectly equally in all directions (the \"anisotropy\" of their distribution) could be used to determine how well the cobalt-60 nuclei had been aligned (how well their [[Spin (physics)|spins]] were aligned).<ref name=Ambler>{{cite journal\n |last1=Ambler |first1=E.\n |last2=Grace |first2=M.

This is because an unaligned sample of nuclei could be expected to be orientated randomly, and thus the electron emissions would be random and the experiment would detect equal numbers of electron emissions in all directions, even if they were being emitted from each individual nucleus in only one direction.\n\nThe experiment then essentially counted the rate of emission for gamma rays and electrons in two distinct directions and compared their values. This rate was measured over time and with the polarizing field orientated in opposite directions. If the counting rates for the electrons did not differ significantly from those of the gamma rays, then there would have been evidence to suggest that parity was indeed conserved by the weak interaction. If, however, the counting rates were significantly different, then there would be strong evidence that the weak interaction does indeed violate parity conservation.\n\n===Materials and methods===\n[[File:Wu-Experiment (English).png|thumb|275px|Schematic illustration of the Wu experiment]]\nThe experimental challenge in this experiment was to obtain the highest possible polarization of the <sup>60</sup>Co nuclei. Due to the very small magnetic moments of the nuclei as compared to electrons, high magnetic fields were required at extremely low temperatures, far lower than could be achieved by liquid helium cooling alone. The low temperatures were achieved using the method of [[adiabatic demagnetization]]. Radioactive cobalt was deposited as a thin surface layer on a crystal of cerium-magnesium nitrate, a paramagnetic salt with a highly anisotropic [[Land\u00e9 g-factor]].\n\nThe salt was magnetized along the axis of high g-factor, and the temperature was lowered to 1.2&nbsp;K by pumping the helium to low pressure. Shutting off the horizontal magnetic field resulted in the temperature decreasing to about 0.003&nbsp;K. The horizontal magnet was opened up, allowing room for a vertical solenoid to be introduced and switched on to align the cobalt nuclei either upwards or downwards. Only a negligible increase in temperature was caused by the solenoid magnetic field, since the magnetic field orientation of the solenoid was in the direction of low g-factor.

This is inherent in the nature of the weak interaction.  Previously, if the scientists on Earth were to communicate with a newly discovered planet's scientist, and they had never met in person, it would not have been possible for each group to determine unambiguously the other group's left and right.  With the Wu experiment, it is possible to communicate to the other group what the words left and right mean exactly and unambiguously.

The right part of the particle simply does not feel the weak interaction.  If the down quark did not have mass it would not oscillate, and its right part would be quite stable by itself.

Another way this is expressed is to imagine that two worlds are constructed that differ only by parity \u2014 the \"real\" world and the \"mirror\" world, where left and right are swapped. If an interaction is parity symmetric, it produces the same outcomes in both \"worlds\".<ref name=\"Wu1957\"/>\n\nThe aim of Wu's experiment was to determine if this was the case for the weak interaction by looking at whether the decay products of cobalt-60 were being emitted preferentially in one direction or not. This would signify the violation of parity symmetry because if the weak interaction were parity conserving, the decay emissions should be emitted with equal probability in all directions. As stated by Wu et al.:\n{{Quote|If an asymmetry in the distribution between \u03b8 and 180\u00b0\u2212\u03b8 (where \u03b8 is the angle between the orientation of the parent nuclei and the momentum of the electrons) is observed, it provides unequivocal proof that parity is not conserved in beta decay.<ref name=\"Wu1957\"/>}}\n\nThe reason for this is that the cobalt-60 nucleus carries [[Spin (physics)|spin]], and spin does not change direction under parity (because angular momentum is an [[axial vector]]). Conversely, the direction that the decay products are emitted ''is'' changed under parity because momentum is a [[polar vector]]. In other words, in the \"real\" world, if the cobalt-60 nuclear spin and the decay product emissions were both in roughly the same direction, then in the \"mirror\" world, they would be in roughly opposite directions, because the emission direction would have been flipped, but the spin direction would not.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/boyd/warwick_week/neutrino_physics/weak.pdf\n |title=The Weak Interaction\n |last=Boyd\n |first=Steve\n |date=2016-04-20\n |access-date=2019-12-08\n |website=Warwick University\n }}</ref>\n\nThis would be a clear difference in the behaviour of the weak interaction between both \"worlds\", and hence the weak interaction could not be said to be parity symmetric. The only way that the weak interaction could be parity symmetric is if there were no preference in the direction of emission, because then a flip in the direction of emissions in the \"mirror\" world would look no different than the \"real\" world because there were equal numbers of emissions in both directions anyway.\n\n== Experiment ==\nThe experiment monitored the decay of [[cobalt-60]] (<sup>60</sup>Co) atoms that were aligned by a uniform magnetic field (the polarizing field) and cooled to near [[absolute zero]] so that thermal motions did not ruin the alignment.<ref name=Wroblewski>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Wroblewski |first=Andrzej K.\n |year=2008\n |title=The downfall of parity: The revolution that happened fifty years ago\n |journal=[[Acta Physica Polonica B]]\n |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=251\u2013264\n |bibcode=2008AcPPB..39..251W\n |url=https://inspirehep.net/record/807786/files/v39p0251.pdf\n}}</ref> Cobalt-60 is an [[unstable isotope|unstable]] [[isotopes of cobalt|isotope of cobalt]] that decays by [[beta decay]] to the stable isotope [[nickel-60]] (<sup>60</sup>Ni). During this decay, one of the [[neutron]]s in the cobalt-60 nucleus decays to a [[proton]] by emitting an [[electron]] (e<sup>&minus;</sup>) and an [[electron antineutrino]] ({{overline|&nu;}}<sub>e</sub>). The resulting nickel nucleus, however, is in an [[excited state]] and promptly decays to its ground state by emitting two [[gamma ray]]s (&gamma;). Hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is:\n\n:<math>{}^{60}_{27}\\text{Co}  \\rightarrow  {}^{60}_{28}\\text{Ni} + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e + 2{\\gamma}</math>\n\nGamma rays are photons, and their release from the nickel-60 nucleus is an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] (EM) process. This is important because EM was known to respect parity conservation, and therefore they would be emitted roughly equally in all directions (they would be distributed roughly \"isotropically\"). Hence, the distribution of the emitted electrons could be compared to the distribution of the emitted gamma rays in order to compare whether they too were being emitted isotropically. In other words, the distribution of the gamma rays acted as a [[Scientific control|control]] for the distribution of the emitted electrons. Another benefit of the emitted gamma rays was that it was known that the degree to which they were ''not'' distributed perfectly equally in all directions (the \"anisotropy\" of their distribution) could be used to determine how well the cobalt-60 nuclei had been aligned (how well their [[Spin (physics)|spins]] were aligned).<ref name=Ambler>{{cite journal\n |last1=Ambler |first1=E.\n |last2=Grace |first2=M.

This is because an unaligned sample of nuclei could be expected to be orientated randomly, and thus the electron emissions would be random and the experiment would detect equal numbers of electron emissions in all directions, even if they were being emitted from each individual nucleus in only one direction.\n\nThe experiment then essentially counted the rate of emission for gamma rays and electrons in two distinct directions and compared their values. This rate was measured over time and with the polarizing field orientated in opposite directions. If the counting rates for the electrons did not differ significantly from those of the gamma rays, then there would have been evidence to suggest that parity was indeed conserved by the weak interaction. If, however, the counting rates were significantly different, then there would be strong evidence that the weak interaction does indeed violate parity conservation.\n\n===Materials and methods===\n[[File:Wu-Experiment (English).png|thumb|275px|Schematic illustration of the Wu experiment]]\nThe experimental challenge in this experiment was to obtain the highest possible polarization of the <sup>60</sup>Co nuclei. Due to the very small magnetic moments of the nuclei as compared to electrons, high magnetic fields were required at extremely low temperatures, far lower than could be achieved by liquid helium cooling alone. The low temperatures were achieved using the method of [[adiabatic demagnetization]]. Radioactive cobalt was deposited as a thin surface layer on a crystal of cerium-magnesium nitrate, a paramagnetic salt with a highly anisotropic [[Land\u00e9 g-factor]].\n\nThe salt was magnetized along the axis of high g-factor, and the temperature was lowered to 1.2&nbsp;K by pumping the helium to low pressure. Shutting off the horizontal magnetic field resulted in the temperature decreasing to about 0.003&nbsp;K. The horizontal magnet was opened up, allowing room for a vertical solenoid to be introduced and switched on to align the cobalt nuclei either upwards or downwards. Only a negligible increase in temperature was caused by the solenoid magnetic field, since the magnetic field orientation of the solenoid was in the direction of low g-factor.

If parity were conserved in beta decay, the emitted electrons would have had no preferred direction of decay relative to the nuclear spin, and the asymmetry in emission direction would have been close to the value for the gamma rays. However, Wu observed that the electrons were emitted in a direction preferentially opposite to that of the gamma rays with an asymmetry significantly greater than the gamma ray anisotropy value. That is, most of the electrons favored a very specific direction of decay, specifically opposite to that of the nuclear spin.<ref name=\"Wu1957\"/> The observed electron asymmetry also did not change sign when the polarizing field was reversed, meaning that the asymmetry was not being caused by [[remanent magnetization|remanence]] in the samples.

This is inherent in the nature of the weak interaction.  Previously, if the scientists on Earth were to communicate with a newly discovered planet's scientist, and they had never met in person, it would not have been possible for each group to determine unambiguously the other group's left and right.  With the Wu experiment, it is possible to communicate to the other group what the words left and right mean exactly and unambiguously.  The Wu experiment has finally solved the [[Ozma problem]] which is to give an unambiguous definition of left and right scientifically.<ref name=\"Gardner2005\">\n{{cite book\n |last=Gardner\n |first=M.\n |year=2005\n |title=The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings\n |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newambidextrousu00mart/page/215 215\u2013218]\n |edition=3rd Revised\n |publisher=[[Courier Corporation]]\n |isbn=978-0-486-44244-0\n |url-access=registration\n |url=https://archive.org/details/newambidextrousu00mart/page/215\n }}</ref>\n \nAt the [[fundamental particle|fundamental]] level (as depicted in the [[Feynman diagram]] on the right), Beta decay is caused by the conversion of the negatively charged ({{nowrap|\u2212{{sfrac|1|3}} [[elementary charge|e]]}}) [[down quark]] to the positively charged ({{nowrap|+{{sfrac|2|3}} e}}) [[up quark]] by emission of a [[W boson|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson]]; the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} boson subsequently decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino:\n:{{Subatomic particle|down quark}} \u2192 {{Subatomic particle|up quark}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron Antineutrino}}.\n\nThe quark has a [[Chirality (physics)|left]] part and a [[Chirality (physics)|right]] part.  As it walks across the spacetime, it oscillates back and forth from right part to left part and from left part to right part.  From analyzing the Wu experiment's demonstration of parity violation, it can be deduced that only the left part of down quarks decay and the weak interaction involves only the left part of quarks and leptons (or the right part of antiquarks and antileptons).  The right part of the particle simply does not feel the weak interaction.  If the down quark did not have mass it would not oscillate, and its right part would be quite stable by itself.  Yet, because the down quark is massive, it oscillates and decays.<ref name=\"LedermanHill2013\">\n{{cite book\n |last1=Lederman |first1=L. M.\n |last2=Hill |first2=C.

Since it is currently known that neutrinos have a small mass, it has been proposed that right-handed neutrinos and left-handed antineutrinos could exist.

The community is predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]] by religion, as opposed to the [[Croats]] who are [[Roman Catholic]].\n\nIn some regions of modern-day Croatia, mainly in southern [[Dalmatia]], [[ethnic Serbs]] have been present from the [[Early Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=}} Serbs from modern-day Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina started actively migrating to Croatia in several migration waves after 1538 when the [[Emperor Ferdinand I]] granted them the right to settle on the territory of the [[Military Frontier]]. In exchange for land and exemption from taxation, they had to conduct military service and participate in the protection of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s border against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They populated the [[Dalmatian hinterland]], [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Syrmia|Western Syrmia]]. After the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918 (later renamed to Yugoslavia), a few thousand Serbs moved to Croatian territory. During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Serbs were targeted for extermination as part of [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide]] by [[Usta\u0161e]]. After the beginning of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia's proclamation of independence, the Serbs living in Croatia rebelled against the Croatian government and proclaimed the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) on parts of Croatian territory, which led to the [[Croatian War of Independence]].

The Venetian government welcomed immigrants, as they protected possessions against the Ottomans. The [[Morlachs]], former Ottoman subjects, helped Venice triple its size in Dalmatia. The bishop of Makarska described how many people migrated from the Ottoman Empire to Venetian territories. Major population movements into Venetian Dalmatia occurred during the 1670s and 1680s.

In 1918, it became part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which immediately joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe formation of the Serbian identity of Vlahs in Croatia began in the 18th century under the influence of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] (SPC), and most of the local Orthodox priests of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] who were educated in monasteries outside Croatia under the guidance of SPC clergy who came to the southwestern region of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] during the [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]] (1690\u20131739).

The [[Serbianisation]] of the Vlachs in southern Croatia was the result of the hierarchical linkage of Orthodox Vlachs from southern Croatian territories, at the time ruled by the Venetians, with the SPC in northern Croatia, which strengthened the ritual and ecclesiastical connection of the Vlachs with the Serb immigrants.<ref>Introduction by Mirko Valenti\u0107 in: Mile Bogovi\u0107: Katoli\u010dka Crkva i Pravoslavlje u Dalmaciji za vrijeme mleta\u010dke vladavine, Kr\u0161\u0107anska sada\u0161njost/\u0160kolska knjiga, Zagreb, 1993., p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, the Serbian thought began spreading among the Orthodox Christians in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]. At first through the religious denomination, and by the time as a sign of national affiliation. There was also a brief occurrence when certain Catholic intellectuals, predominantly in [[Dubrovnik]], were won over by the Serbian thought.

According to the 1844 [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]]'s Na\u010dertanije, they intended to establish a Serbian Empire on the territory of the collapsed Ottoman Empire. At first, its borders were supposed to be the borders of the Ottoman Empire and the Slavs in them, but they gradually expanded to the territory of present-day Croatia (including the Military Frointaire and Dalmatia).<ref name=\"auto\">Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, Prologue in: Mihovil Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 11</ref> To accomplish this, the ground had to be prepared, so that diplomacy and the military would have a stronger base for taking action. The bases for this was the Serbian state law, and where it wasn't possible to appropriate the land with it, the argument of nationality, and when that argument couldn't be applied, then it was necessary to \"create\" the Serbs among the target population, if not among all, then among the majority. The main target were Orthodox Christians in the neighboring, non-Serb countries. In 1848/50, Serbian government organized a secret network of agents who propagated the Serbian ideas. Those agents were concealed as cultural workers. The famous agents were [[Georgije Nikolajevi\u0107]] and [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The 'creation' of new Serbs was carried out by identification of Orthodox Christianity in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina only with Serbs.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/67500|title=The Serbian question in Croatian politics, 1848\u20131918|first=Markus|last=Tomislav|date=1 April 2011|journal=Review of Croatian History|volume=VI|issue=1}}</ref> Another argument used in the areas with no Orthodox Christians was identifying people who spoke [[Shtokavian]] with the Serbs. The idea \"all Shtokavians are Serbs\" was created by German Slavists in the 1850s, and was promoted by the Austrian government who wanted to equalize Croats and Serbs so that it could more easily rule the Croatian lands and in the next stage conquer Serbia and penetrate across [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"matica.hr\">http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/427/Srpski%20jezik%20nije%20\u0161tokavski/</ref> The idea was that it was easier to \"govern Belgrade and Zagreb if the same language was spoken in them\". Geostrategic position of Belgrade in relation to Zagreb further contributed to favoring the Serbs whom Austrians did not perceive as a danger, unlike Croats who had own language, politicians, national consciousness, laws, military tradition and prepared army, as well as international [[Election in Cetin|treaties which have affirmed their rights]], so Austrians needed someone (Serbs) to discipline the Croats. The same was done by Hungary which became a strong political factor after 1848 and that wished to expand into the [[Southeast Europe]], which was particularly strong during the reign of [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] over Croatia.<ref name=\"matica.hr\"/>\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Matija Ban]], poet and dramatist, member of [[Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik]]<br />'''Right:''' [[Josip Runjanin]], composer of [[Lijepa na\u0161a domovino|Croatian national anthem]]\n| width1    = 130\n| image1    = MatijaBan.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| image2    = Josip Runjanin.png\n}}\n[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutionary 1848]] and the process of building a modern Croatian nation resulted in closer co-operation between Croats and Serbs and recognition of their equality in the sense of [[Illyrian Movement]] (also known as the Croatian National Revival) and [[Yugoslavia]]n ideas.

Following Croat enthusiasm with the successful 1878 [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], during which many Croatian soldiers died, and them seeking unification of Dalmatia and the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, the conflict between Croats and Serbs was inevitable.<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\">{{cite web|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20000813/podlistak.htm|title=SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, NEDJELJA 13. kolovoza 2000. \u2013 podlistak: Preokret i odvajanje|website=arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr}}</ref> In 1879, Serbs from Bukovica voted for the Italian candidate instead of Croat [[Miho Klai\u0107]].<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\"/> This event was called by People's Party's supporters ''Bukovica betrail''.

The community is predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]] by religion, as opposed to the [[Croats]] who are [[Roman Catholic]].\n\nIn some regions of modern-day Croatia, mainly in southern [[Dalmatia]], [[ethnic Serbs]] have been present from the [[Early Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=}} Serbs from modern-day Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina started actively migrating to Croatia in several migration waves after 1538 when the [[Emperor Ferdinand I]] granted them the right to settle on the territory of the [[Military Frontier]]. In exchange for land and exemption from taxation, they had to conduct military service and participate in the protection of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s border against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They populated the [[Dalmatian hinterland]], [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Syrmia|Western Syrmia]]. After the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918 (later renamed to Yugoslavia), a few thousand Serbs moved to Croatian territory. During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Serbs were targeted for extermination as part of [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide]] by [[Usta\u0161e]]. After the beginning of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia's proclamation of independence, the Serbs living in Croatia rebelled against the Croatian government and proclaimed the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) on parts of Croatian territory, which led to the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. After the Croatian Army's [[Operation Storm]], the RSK ceased to exist, its territory was reincorporated into Croatia, and approximately 200,000 Serbs fled the country.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there were 186,633 Serbs living in Croatia (4.4% of the population) which are recognized as a national minority by the Croatian Constitution and therefore have 3 permanent seats in the [[Croatian Parliament]].\n\n==Overview==\nTraditional elements of their identity are the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]], [[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic script]] and military history, while modern elements are [[Serbian language|language]] and [[Serbian literature|literature]], civic, social and political values, concern for ethnic status and national organisation, and celebration of the [[Liberation of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:514233-Srbi-u-Hrvatskoj-zabrinuti-da-ce-nestati|title=Srbi u Hrvatskoj zabrinuti da \u0107e nestati}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2011 census there were 186,633 ethnic [[Serbs]] living in Croatia, 4.4% of the total population.

In the summer of 1685, Cosmi, the Archbishop of Split, wrote that Morlach leader [[Stojan Jankovi\u0107]] had brought 300 families with him to Dalmatia, and also that around Trogir and Split there were 5,000 refugees from Ottoman lands, without food; this was seen as a serious threat to the defense of Dalmatia.

The [[Serbianisation]] of the Vlachs in southern Croatia was the result of the hierarchical linkage of Orthodox Vlachs from southern Croatian territories, at the time ruled by the Venetians, with the SPC in northern Croatia, which strengthened the ritual and ecclesiastical connection of the Vlachs with the Serb immigrants.<ref>Introduction by Mirko Valenti\u0107 in: Mile Bogovi\u0107: Katoli\u010dka Crkva i Pravoslavlje u Dalmaciji za vrijeme mleta\u010dke vladavine, Kr\u0161\u0107anska sada\u0161njost/\u0160kolska knjiga, Zagreb, 1993., p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, the Serbian thought began spreading among the Orthodox Christians in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]].

At first, its borders were supposed to be the borders of the Ottoman Empire and the Slavs in them, but they gradually expanded to the territory of present-day Croatia (including the Military Frointaire and Dalmatia).<ref name=\"auto\">Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, Prologue in: Mihovil Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 11</ref> To accomplish this, the ground had to be prepared, so that diplomacy and the military would have a stronger base for taking action. The bases for this was the Serbian state law, and where it wasn't possible to appropriate the land with it, the argument of nationality, and when that argument couldn't be applied, then it was necessary to \"create\" the Serbs among the target population, if not among all, then among the majority. The main target were Orthodox Christians in the neighboring, non-Serb countries. In 1848/50, Serbian government organized a secret network of agents who propagated the Serbian ideas. Those agents were concealed as cultural workers. The famous agents were [[Georgije Nikolajevi\u0107]] and [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The 'creation' of new Serbs was carried out by identification of Orthodox Christianity in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina only with Serbs.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/67500|title=The Serbian question in Croatian politics, 1848\u20131918|first=Markus|last=Tomislav|date=1 April 2011|journal=Review of Croatian History|volume=VI|issue=1}}</ref> Another argument used in the areas with no Orthodox Christians was identifying people who spoke [[Shtokavian]] with the Serbs. The idea \"all Shtokavians are Serbs\" was created by German Slavists in the 1850s, and was promoted by the Austrian government who wanted to equalize Croats and Serbs so that it could more easily rule the Croatian lands and in the next stage conquer Serbia and penetrate across [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"matica.hr\">http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/427/Srpski%20jezik%20nije%20\u0161tokavski/</ref> The idea was that it was easier to \"govern Belgrade and Zagreb if the same language was spoken in them\".

The output from Centaur Press ranged from small stories illustrated by his first wife Joan Stanton to the substantial hardback series ''Centaur Classics'', which included such titles as Leland's five-volume ''Itinerary in England and Wales'', Tyndale's translation of the ''Pentateuch'', and Burns' ''Commonplace Book''.<ref name=\"Lister\" /> The company expanded into humane education releasing titles on topics such as vegetarianism, animal rights, and related philosophy. The firm also published works of fiction (''So Say Banana Bird''), classical literature and philosophy (''The Myths of Plato'') and poetry.\n\n===Vegetarianism===\n\nWynne-Tyson was the author of the book, ''Food for a Future: The Ecological Priority of a Humane Diet'', first published in 1975. It was republished as ''Food for a Future: The Complete Case For Vegetarianism'', in 1979. The book argues from anatomy, physiology, and pathology that humans are naturally vegetarian and provides ecological necessities for giving up eating and slaughtering animals.<ref name=\"New Scientist\">Tudge, Colin.

The output from Centaur Press ranged from small stories illustrated by his first wife Joan Stanton to the substantial hardback series ''Centaur Classics'', which included such titles as Leland's five-volume ''Itinerary in England and Wales'', Tyndale's translation of the ''Pentateuch'', and Burns' ''Commonplace Book''.<ref name=\"Lister\" /> The company expanded into humane education releasing titles on topics such as vegetarianism, animal rights, and related philosophy. The firm also published works of fiction (''So Say Banana Bird''), classical literature and philosophy (''The Myths of Plato'') and poetry.\n\n===Vegetarianism===\n\nWynne-Tyson was the author of the book, ''Food for a Future: The Ecological Priority of a Humane Diet'', first published in 1975. It was republished as ''Food for a Future: The Complete Case For Vegetarianism'', in 1979. The book argues from anatomy, physiology, and pathology that humans are naturally vegetarian and provides ecological necessities for giving up eating and slaughtering animals.<ref name=\"New Scientist\">Tudge, Colin.

{"title_page": "Mberengwa District", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=February 2008}}\n[[File:Agincourt Mine Mberengwa by kevinzim.jpg|thumb|Agincourt Mine in Mberengwa|upright]]\n[[File:Musicians playing Zimbabwean pop music 2005.jpg|thumb|Musicians playing Zimbabwean pop music in Danga, 2005]]\n'''Mberengwa''' is a district in [[Midlands (Zimbabwe)|Midlands]] province in [[Zimbabwe]]. The district is now divided into sub-districts: Mberengwa North, East, West and South. It is bounded by Gwanda in Mberengwa west, and by Zvishavane in its northern zone, to the south it stretches to Neshuro, Chikombedzi and bounded by Manyuchi dam.\n\n==Local government==\n\n[[Mberengwa Rural District Council]] is the local authority over Mberengwa District. The district comprises 4 parliamentary constituencies with a total of 37 councillors overseeing the same number of wards. \nthe wards are distributed as follows;\n* [[Mberengwa-East (parliamentary constituency)|Mberengwa-East Constituency]] has 7 wards\n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 20.\n\n* [[Mberengwa-West (parliamentary constituency)|Mberengwa-West Constituency]] has 8 wards;\n13, 14, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34.\n\n* [[Mberengwa-North (parliamentary constituency)|Mberengwa-North Constituency]] has 12 wards;\n1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 35, 36 and 37.\n\n* [[Mberengwa-South (parliamentary constituency)|Mberengwa-South Constituency]] has 10 wards; \n18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28.\n\n==Background==\nThe name \"Mberengwa\" itself comes from the [[Ikalanga language|Karanga]] phrase '''Mbere-yeingwa'''. The other plausible theory about the meaning of Mberengwa is 'verengwa' which is an act of census believed to have been conducted by the Lemba people stationed at Mount Mberengwa after a terrible plague. Clans that had been counted and accounted for became Mberengwa. After the census various clans of the Lemba migrated to different parts of the district including Thohoyandou in Venda, South Africa. This name is still used as a clan name by the Hadji tribe of the Lemba (Mzezewas) still stationed near the mountain. The Hadji clan in South Africa also uses Mbelengwa (with an 'L'from their local Venda language) to describe themselves. Mount Mberengwa is one of the highest mountains in Zimbabwe, but not as high as the mountains in the Eastern Highlands. Pre-Independence in 1980, the mountain and district was also called Belingwe which was a colonial adulteration of Mberengwa.[https://www.citypopulation.de/php/zimbabwe-admin.php?adm2id=706]\n\nThe indigenous languages spoken in Mberengwa are mainly Karanga and Ndebele. Pfumbi, a variation of Karanga which is also close to Kalanga, has also been spoken in chief Muketi areas. The Pfumbi quickly assimilated into the Karanga and most of them crossed Mwenezi river and settled in the Maranda and Shayamavhudzi areas in southern Masvingo. It is thought that Pfumbi used to be more widespread than this in the past before the onset of Shona as the compulsory vernacular language to be taught in schools. One name which retains a trace of that past up to now is Mupandashango school, which in the Shona form of today would be Mupandasango. It is possible to meet people called Mashango (Masango) The use of words with velar fricatives, once represented by the letter \"x\", but now abandoned by orthography since the 1956 Samukange-led standardization of Shona, is another example that clearly and closely links the Karanga of Mberengwa with Kalanga with which it used to relate in places west of the current district as well as in the Gwanda West Nicholson area where the Jaunda version of Kalanga used to abound, and in Mwenezi. These are words like \"xwera, xare, xwitaidza\". Many areas of Zvishavane share a lot in common with the Karanga language spoken in Mberengwa. Generally, Shona can be considered to be foreign to the Mberengwa area. Many Ndebele speakers were settled in the Mberengwa district throughout the 1900s, on their own accord or because of colonial government relocations meant to pave way for White farms and mines in their areas of original settlement such as the De Beers ranch and other places in the Somabula and Shangani areas. Because of these new arrivals, Ndebele words are used freely in Mberengwa's Karanga, which is a natural process of borrowing and adaptation among closely settled and interacting peoples. In Mashonaland where immigrant workers of Malawian origin were found in numbers, Zezuru (Shona) borrowed and adapted words like \"tsano, kabanga, wondonga\" etc. n.b. A lot of words were brought in from Karanga, Shona, Manyika and utilized there. Examples are \"dhuku (doek), bhurukwa (broek), jon'hosi (from Afrikaans for [young ox])\" and others. As in Kalanga, the use of \"l\" in words like \"dla\" or \"tla\" (to eat, to fear) is part of the Karanga language and not a borrowing from Ndebele language.\n\nThe other tribe that forms the great party of Mberengwa is the Shoko clan. It has four families that share the mapiravana chieftainship namely Wadawareva, manonose, Sukira and Makonese. The current chief is called Rungano.\n\n==Operations==\n\nThe district is prone to droughts and high temperatures, but abundant in minerals like gold, iron ore, emeralds and asbestos. Buchwa Mine, Vanguard Mine, Sandawana and C Mine are all in Mberengwa.\n\nIt is known for its riches in minerals and fauna. Gold is mined at C Mine and other small claims mines scattered around Mberengwa. Emeralds are mined at Sandawana while Vanguard Mine was once a major player in asbestos production till the 1980s when asbestos lost its importance to the world. Chrome was mined at Rhonda and Inyala mines, but these closed down due to the disastrous effects of the Zimbabwean crisis and Zimbabwe's liberation struggle. Cattle ranching is a major farming activity.\n\nMataga growth point, is the centre which provides goods and services to the rural population of mberengwa. Mataga growth point is where the creation of balanced socio-economic developments of Mataga occurs. Most micro-level planning for Mberengwa occures here.\n\n==Education==\n\nThe district has a number of missionary-run schools that run up to A-Level, notably [[Chegato High School|Chegato]] and [[Musume]], Masase and [[Mnene]]. After 1980, the government constructed a number of rural day secondary schools also known as \"Upper Tops\" among them Guruva, Chovuragu, Bubwe, Zvamagwiro, Mabika, Maringambizi, Mbuya Nehanda, Bayayi, Murerezi, Chegute, Svita, Chizungu, Madenyika, Sviba, Makuva, Funye, Vuronga, Mposi, Ruzengwe, Chingoma, Vutsanana, Zvomukonde, Chemimwe, Vutika, Rengwe and Chomusenda. They have helped improve the education standards as well as creating education opportunities for many rural children. There are missionary-run hospitals and clinics. Most of the schools and hospitals are run by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Zimbabwe. Non-governmental organizations like [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] have or had had programs operating there as well.\n\n==Sports==\nPrimary and secondary schools in Mberengwa compete yearly in football tournaments. There is a trophy won, originally funded by the [[Coca-Cola Company]]. Soccer is the most favored sport in the district.\n\nApart from soccer, gollball is also a popular sport for visually impaired school children. Over the years basketball has gained momentum especially amongst high schools. Mission schools under the Evangelical Lutheran Church compete in the E L C Z sports tournament which are held yearly. They are rotated amongst the schools. Sporting activities such as soccer, netball, basketball, volleyball, etc. are competed. One year focuses on track events then the next year focuses on field events.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mberengwa RDC]]\n\n{{coord|20|29|S|29|55|E|region:ZW_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{Geography of Zimbabwe}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Mberengwa District| ]]\n[[Category:Districts of Zimbabwe]]\n[[Category:Districts in Midlands Province]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=February 2008}}\n[[File:Agincourt Mine Mberengwa by kevinzim.jpg|thumb|Agincourt Mine in Mberengwa|upright]]\n[[File:Musicians playing Zimbabwean pop music 2005.jpg|thumb|Musicians playing Zimbabwean pop music in Danga, 2005]]\n'''Mberengwa''' is a district in [[Midlands (Zimbabwe)|Midlands]] province in [[Zimbabwe]].

R. Vijayakumari]]), the latter is an orphan and lives with her uncle's family. Sundaram travels to the USA for further studies. When Sundaram returns four years later, he was shocked to see that his mother Vedhavalli ([[M. V. Rajamma]]) is a widow and was told that his father Sambasivam committed suicide due to the disgrace that he was unable to pay back the loans.\n\nSundaram leaves to Bombay for an interview, where comes across the murder of broker Govindan and is shocked to see that the murderer is Punniyakodi ([[S. V. Ranga Rao]]), who is later introduced as Gomathi's father in a police investigation. Sundaram helps Punniyakodi to escape and in turn is suspected by the police instead. Police Superintendent Raja ([[S. S. Rajendran]]) is appointed to investigate the murder case. When Gomathi's uncle refuses to let her marry Sundaram, she leaves home, following Vedhavalli to Madurai. Sundaram travels back to Madras where he bumps into Susila ([[Sharada (actress)|Saratha]]) on the road. Sundaram finds Govindan's family and offers help, who initially refuses but later accepts when persuaded and explained to. While leaving Govindan's house, Sundaram learns that Punniyakodi is living as a fugitive, had changed his name as James and staying with a crook Kanthan (O. A. K. Thevar). Sundaram seeks his friend Dass's ([[R. Muthuraman]]) help in taking care of Punniyakodi for the time being, goes to Madurai and explains to Vedhavalli and Gomathi that he is a murderer and wanted by the police, but Vedhavalli refuses to accept Sundaram as her son due to the conviction.\n\nSundaram, upon reading an advertisement in the newspaper, joins as a tuition teacher in disguise as Kalamegam. There, Sundaram learns that Susila's father is Justice  Somanathan ([[S. V. Sahasranamam]]), her cousin is Inspector Raja, servants Arasan ([[Nagesh]]) and Kanniyamma ([[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]). Meanwhile, Superintendent Raja hatches a plan to move Vedhavalli and Gomathi to Dass's house so to ease the capture Sundaram if he happens to visit them, but James leaves Dass's home following Kanthan's temptation. Susila refuses Raja's advances and develops a soft corner for Kalamegam, but later learns that he is Sundaram and his deeds, but lies to Justice Somanathan that he is a good man. Susila also lets Sundaram escape when Raja finds out about this.\n\nVedhavalli, who is a staunch believer of justice, hates Sundaram for his conviction and arranges for Gomathi to marry Dhas, but Gomathi refuses. In turn, Gomathi pleads to Sundaram to marry Susila as Susila had helped them out a lot to prove Sundaram's innocence before gets shot by the police, mistaken for Sundaram. A trial takes place where Sundaram accepts all the charges against him. A twist in the story occurs when Somanathan produces Punniyakodi and Kanthan in court. Punniyakodi admits in court that he was cheated by Kanthan into shooting broker Govindan, where Kanthan earlier had told Punniyakodi that the revolver was unloaded. Lastly Punniyakodi admits that he is actually Sambasivam and was introduced as Punniyakodi to the police by Sundaram, who was only doing all these in order to save him. The judges sentences Kanthan for murder, further trials for Sambasivam and six months for Sundaram. At the end of the story, Sambasivam applies Kungumam to Vedhavalli at the request of Sundaram.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Sundaram / Tamilpulavar Kalamegam / (Kaliuga Kannagi, Leady Gateup)\n*[[Sharada (actress)|Saratha]] as Susila\n*[[S.
