The initial discovery comprises 1,550 specimens, representing 737 different elements, and at least 15 different individuals. Despite this exceptionally high number of specimens, their classification with other ''Homo'' remains unclear.\n\nAlong with similarities to contemporary ''[[Homo]]'', they share several characteristics with the ancestral ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and early ''Homo'' as well (mosaic anatomy), most notably a small cranial capacity of {{cvt|465\u2013610|cc}}, compared to {{cvt|1270\u20131330|cc}} in modern humans. They are estimated to have averaged {{cvt|143.6|cm|ftin|sigfig=1}} in height and {{cvt|39.7|kg}} in weight, yielding a small [[encephalization quotient]] of 4.5. Nonetheless, ''H. naledi'' brain anatomy seems to have been similar to contemporary ''Homo'', which could indicate equatable cognitive complexity. The persistence of small-brained humans for so long in the midst of bigger-brained contemporaries revises previous conceptions of [[human evolution]], and their mosaic anatomy greatly expands the known range of variation for the genus.\n\n''H. naledi'' anatomy indicates that, though they were capable of long distance travel with a humanlike stride and gait, they were more [[arboreal]] than other ''Homo'', better adapted to climbing and [[suspensory behaviour]] in trees than [[endurance running hypothesis|endurance running]]. Tooth anatomy suggests consumption of gritty foods covered in particulates such as dust or dirt. Though they have not been associated with stone tools or any indication of material culture, they appear to have been dextrous enough to produce and handle tools, and likely manufactured [[Early Stone Age|Early]] or [[Middle Stone Age|Middle]] Stone Age [[industry (archaeology)|industries]]. It has also been controversially postulated that these individuals were given funerary rites, and were carried into and placed in the chamber, though predation or natural forces could have been at play.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Discovery===\n[[File:Cross-section of the Rising Star Cave system Dinaledi Chamber.svg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|Cross section of [[Rising Star Cave]]]]\nIn October 2013, [[caving|cavers]] Rick Hunter and Steve Tucker, under the direction of South African palaeoanthropologist [[Lee Rogers Berger]], discovered the Dinaledi Chamber in [[Rising Star Cave]] in the [[Cradle of Humankind]], South Africa, containing several hominin fossils.<ref name=\"HawksJA2016\"/> The chamber lies about {{cvt|80|m}} from the entrance, and the main passage is about {{cvt|10|m}} long and {{cvt|25\u201350|cm}} at its narrowest, and is at the bottom of a {{cvt|12|m|adj=on}} vertical drop.<ref name=Dirks2015>{{Cite journal |last=Dirks |first=P.

''H. naledi'' appear to have had strong [[flexor pollicis longus muscle]]s like modern humans, with humanlike palm and finger pads, which are important in forceful gripping between the thumb and fingers. However, unlike ''Homo'', the ''H. naledi'' thumb metacarpal joint is comparably small relative to the thumb's length, and the thumb [[phalanges|phalangeal]] joint is flattened.

Such curvature is more pronounced in adults than juveniles, suggesting that adults climbed just as much or more so than juveniles, and this behaviour was commonly done.

They said it is also possible that the bodies were dropped down a chute and fell slowly due to irregularity and narrowness of the path down, or a soft mud cushion to land on. In both scenarios, the morticians would have required artificial light to navigate the cave; and the site was used repeatedly for burials as the bodies were not all deposited at the same time.<ref name=Dirks2015/>\n\nIn 2016, palaeoanthropologist Aurore Val countered that such preservation may have been due to [[mummification]] rather than careful burial, and the absence of [[long bone]] heads is reminiscent of predation, and she believes that discounting natural forces such as flooding for depositing the bodies is unjustified. Further, there is evidence of damage done by beetles, beetle larvae, and snails (which facilitate decomposition); but, the chamber does not present ideal conditions for snails, nor does it contain snail shells, which would indicate decomposition actually initiated before deposition in the chamber.<ref name=\"Val\">{{cite journal |title=Deliberate body disposal by hominins in the Dinaledi Chamber, Cradle of Humankind, South Africa? |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |year= 2016 |last=Val |first=A. |doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.02.004 |pmid=27039664 |volume=96 |pages=145\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, in 2017, Dirks, Berger, and colleagues reaffirmed that there is no evidence of water flow into the cave, and that it is more likely that these ''H. naledi'' were buried in the chamber. They also said it is possible that they were buried by contemporary ''Homo'', such as the ancestors of modern humans, rather than other ''H. naledi'', but, nonetheless, that the cultural behaviour of funerary practises is not impossible for ''H. naledi'', and burial in the chamber may have been done to remove decaying bodies from a settlement, prevent scavengers, or due to social bonding and grief.<ref name=\"BergerHawks2017\" />\n\nIn 2018, anthropologist Charles Egeland and colleagues echoed Val's sentiments, and stated that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that human species had developed a concept of the [[afterlife]] so early in time.

The initial discovery comprises 1,550 specimens, representing 737 different elements, and at least 15 different individuals. Despite this, their classification with other ''Homo'' remains unclear.\n\nThey share several characteristics with the ancestral ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and early ''[[Homo]]'', most notably a small cranial capacity of {{cvt|465\u2013610|cc}}, compared to {{cvt|1270\u20131330|cc}} in modern humans. They are estimated to have averaged {{cvt|143.6|cm|ftin|sigfig=1}} in height and {{cvt|39.7|kg}} in weight, yielding a small [[encephalization quotient]] of 4.5. Nonetheless, ''H. naledi'' brain anatomy seems to have been similar to contemporary ''Homo'', which could indicate equatable cognitive complexity. The persistence of small-brained humans for so long in the midst of bigger-brained contemporaries revises previous conceptions of [[human evolution]], and their mosaic anatomy greatly expands the range of variation for the genus.\n\n''H. naledi'' anatomy indicates that, though they were capable of long distance travel with a humanlike stride and gait, they were more [[arboreal]] than other ''Homo'', better adapted to climbing and [[suspensory behaviour]] in trees than [[endurance running hypothesis|endurance running]]. Tooth anatomy suggests consumption of gritty foods covered in particulates such as dust or dirt. Though they have not been associated with stone tools or any indication of material culture, they appear to have been dextrous enough to produce and handle tools, and likely manufactured [[Early Stone Age|Early]] or [[Middle Stone Age|Middle]] Stone Age [[industry (archaeology)|industries]].

Such industries and stone cutting techniques likely evolved independently several times among different ''Homo'' species and populations, or were transported over long distances by the inventors or apprentices and taught.<ref name=\"BergerHawks2017\" />\n\n===Funerals===\n[[File:Cartoon illustrating the geological and taphonomic context and distribution of fossils, sediments and flowstones within the Dinaledi Chamber.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Illustration of Dinaledi Chamber, [[Rising Star Cave]]]]\nIn 2015, archaeologist Paul Dirks, Berger, and colleagues concluded that the bodies had to have been deliberately carried and placed into the chamber by people because they appear to have been intact when they were first deposited in the chamber (no evidence of trauma by being dropped into the chamber nor of predation, and exceptional preservation), the chamber is inaccessible to large predators, the chamber appears to be an isolated system and has never been flooded (that is, natural forces were not at play), there is no hidden shaft by which people could have accidentally fallen in through, and there is no evidence of some catastrophe which killed all the individuals inside the chamber. They said it is also possible that the bodies were dropped down a chute and fell slowly due to irregularity and narrowness of the path down, or a soft mud cushion to land on. In both scenarios, the morticians would have required artificial light to navigate the cave; and the site was used repeatedly for burials as the bodies were not all deposited at the same time.<ref name=Dirks2015/>\n\nIn 2016, palaeoanthropologist Aurore Val countered that such preservation may have been due to [[mummification]] rather than careful burial, and the absence of [[long bone]] heads is reminiscent of predation, and she believes that discounting natural forces such as flooding for depositing the bodies is unjustified. Further, there is evidence of damage done by beetles, beetle larvae, and snails (which facilitate decomposition); but, the chamber does not present ideal conditions for snails, nor does it contain snail shells, which would indicate decomposition actually initiated before deposition in the chamber.<ref name=\"Val\">{{cite journal |title=Deliberate body disposal by hominins in the Dinaledi Chamber, Cradle of Humankind, South Africa? |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |year= 2016 |last=Val |first=A. |doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.02.004 |pmid=27039664 |volume=96 |pages=145\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, in 2017, Dirks, Berger, and colleagues reaffirmed that there is no evidence of water flow into the cave, and that it is more likely that these ''H. naledi'' were buried in the chamber. They also said it is possible that they were buried by contemporary ''Homo'', such as the ancestors of modern humans, rather than other ''H. naledi'', but, nonetheless, that the cultural behaviour of funerary practises is not impossible for ''H. naledi'', and burial in the chamber may have been done to remove decaying bodies from a settlement, prevent scavengers, or due to social bonding and grief.<ref name=\"BergerHawks2017\" />\n\nIn 2018, anthropologist Charles Egeland and colleagues echoed Val's sentiments, and stated that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that human species had developed a concept of the [[afterlife]] so early in time. They also said that the preservation of the Dinaledi individuals is similar to those of baboon carcasses which accumulate in caves (either by natural death of cave-dwelling baboons or by a leopard dragging in carcasses).<ref>{{cite journal|first=C.

{"title_page": "Referendums in New Zealand", "text_new": "{{Politics of New Zealand}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n[[Referendum]]s (or referenda) are held only occasionally by the Government of [[New Zealand]]. Referendums may be government-initiated or held in accordance with the [[Electoral Act 1993]] or the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993]. Ten [[referendum]]s have been held so far (excluding referendums on alcohol licensing, which were held triennially between 1894 and 1989). Seven were government-led, and three were indicative citizen initiatives.\n\n==Government referendums==\nThe government of New Zealand may, at any time, call for a referendum on any issue. This requires enabling legislation to determine whether the outcome will be binding on the government or merely indicative. This allows parliamentary scrutiny of the issue and wording of the question. There is no constraint on whether an issue is to be decided by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] or by the public, except for where the reserved provisions of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] are engaged. [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM310495.html Section 268] of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] protects some of the provisions of the Act from amendment except in accordance with s 268(2) which requires a majority vote in a referendum of a 75% majority of Members of Parliament.<ref>Electoral Act 1993, s 268.</ref> The protected provisions include, ''inter alia'', the term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], the voting age and the voting method. The provision itself is not protected from ordinary amendment or repeal.\n\nThis has led to the sporadic use of referendums, partly because there is no constitutional requirement, as there is in other countries like [[Australia]] or [[Switzerland]] that have codified [[constitution]]s.\n\nRecent examples are the [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag referendums]] held across 2015 and 2016, conducted by postal vote.\n\n===Constitutional referendums===\nThere is no requirement for a referendum to enact constitutional change in New Zealand. Referendums were held in 1992 and 1993 to decide the nature of [[electoral reform in New Zealand]]. Many groups advocate approval of constitutional reforms by referendums; the [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand|Republican Movement]] supports a referendum on whether [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand should become a republic]].\n\nThere are frequent calls for the use of referendums to decide other constitutional matters, rather than by regular Acts of Parliament. In 2003 the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] replaced the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] as New Zealand's highest court of appeal with a new [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]], despite calls from [[New Zealand First]], [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] for a referendum to be held on the issue. In 1950 the abolition of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by the [[First National Government of New Zealand|First National Government]] was done by Act of Parliament; with additional members of the Legislative Council (MLC) appointed to ensure approval by the upper house, the ''suicide squad''.\n\n{{See also|Constitution of New Zealand}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''Turnout''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || 69.7 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 68.1% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 27 October 1990 || 85.2 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 69.3% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 19 September 1992 || 55.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 84.7% for change, 70.5% to MMP\n|-\n| 6 November 1993 || 85.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 53.9% for MMP\n|-\n| 26 November 2011 || 73.5 || [[2011 New Zealand voting method referendum|Voting system]] || 57.8% for keeping MMP\n|}\n\n===Liquor licensing referendums===\nIn New Zealand, alcohol licensing has historically been decided by referendum. The first of these were compulsory local licensing referendums, held in 1894 and then with each main parliamentary election between 1896 and 1914. Local licensing referendums were eliminated after 1914, apart from 'local restoration polls' to legalise liquor sales in 'dry' districts. In 1910 a referendum on national prohibition of alcohol was introduced, and held in conjunction with every general election from 1911 to 1987 inclusive (except [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]] and [[1951 New Zealand general election|1951]]). An extra referendum on prohibition was held on 10 April 1919. From 17 December 1919 the additional option of ''state purchase and control'' of liquor (i.e. nationalisation) was added to the ballot. The Sale of Liquor Act 1989 abolished the national liquor referendum. Local restoration polls were still held in areas that were still 'dry', but the last three, [[Mount Eden]], [[Mount Roskill, New Zealand|Mount Roskill]] and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], all became 'wet' in 1999. There have been two referendums on [[pub]] closing times.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Three-to-one majority to retain\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Two-to-one majority for later opening\n|}\n\n===Other referendums===\nThe government may call referendums on any issues on which it wishes. These will usually be on issues on which the government is split. For the 1997 referendum on retirement savings, the decision to hold it was part of the coalition agreement between [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand First]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || 54.3 || Allow off-course [[betting]] || 68.0% in favour\n|-\n| 3 August 1949 || 63.5 || [[Compulsory Military Training in New Zealand|Compulsory military training]] || 77.9% in favour\n|-\n| 5 September 1997 || 80.3 || Compulsory [[Retirement plan|Retirement Savings]] Scheme || 91.8% against\n|-\n| 20 November \u2013 11 December 2015 || 48.2 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], first stage || 50.58% for [[File:NZ flag design Silver Fern (Black, White & Blue) by Kyle Lockwood.svg|25px|border]] [[Lockwood silver fern flag|Silver Fern (Black, White and Blue)]] after 4 counts\n|-\n| 3\u201324 March 2016 || 67.8 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], second stage || 56.6% for retaining the existing [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|}\n\n==Citizens Initiated Referenda==\n{{anchor|Citizens initiated referendums|Citizens-initiated referenda||Citizens-initiated referendums}}\nThe [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993] allows for citizens to propose a [[Initiative|referendum]]. These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months. There were [http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2017-general-election/2017-general-election-results/voter-turnout-statistics 3,298,009 voters enrolled] for the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], so at least 329,801 signatures would be required at a rate of approximately 904 signatures per day. In reality, more signatures would be required to account for variances in electoral roll numbers, duplicate signatures and signatures that cannot be matched to a registered elector.\n\nThere are procedural requirements governing this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/seek-a-referendum/|title=Seek a referendum|last=|first=|date=|website=New Zealand Parliament|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> It costs [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]500 to file a petition asking for a referendum with the Clerk of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Clerk formally determines the wording of the question, which may be quite different from the original. Once the Clerk receives the completed petition, the number of signatures is initially counted, followed by sample groups of signatures being taken and the signatories' names and addresses checked against the electoral roll. The sampling of signatures is used to estimate the number of valid signatures for the whole petition with confidence, and if the lower confidence interval is more than ten percent of the electoral roll, the petition is presented to the House of Representatives.\n\nWithin one month of the petition's presentation to the House, a date for the poll must be determined. The poll must be held within 12 months of the petition's presentation, unless 75 percent of MPs vote to delay the poll for one year. There is also a $50,000 spending limit on promoting the petition.\n\nNew Zealand, [[Italy]], and [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)#Federal popular initiative|Switzerland]] are among countries whose laws allow for citizen-initiated referendums (CIRs) nationally. Its defenders view it as a form of \"direct democracy\". However, the Citizens Initiated Referendum 1993 went against the advice of the [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] 1986. The Commission stated, speaking about referenda more broadly, \"In general, initiatives and referendums are blunt and crude devices.... [that] would blur the lines of accountability and responsibility of Governments\".<ref>Royal Commission on the Electoral System \"Towards a Better Democracy\" [1986\u20131987] IX AJHR H3 at [7.30].</ref>\n\nA total of 48 petitions have been launched since 1993 on a wide range of topics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Only five (one in 1995, two in 1999, one in 2009, one in 2013) have come to a vote. The other petitions failed to gain enough signatures to force a referendum. Achieving the target number of signatures is a requirement for forcing a vote on an initiative proposed by citizens.\n\n===Firefighters===\nThe first citizens initiated referendum was held on 2 December 1995. The question \"Should the number of professional fire-fighters employed full-time in the [[New Zealand Fire Service]] be reduced below the number employed on 1 January 1995?\" aimed to elicit a \"no\" response{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Turnout was low as the referendum was not held in conjunction with a general election. Just over 12% voted \"Yes\" and almost 88% voted \"No\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1995.electionresults.govt.nz/1995_citizens_referenda/|format=PDF|title=Return of Citizens Initiated Referendum Poll Votes|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]]}}</ref>\n\n===1999 election===\nAt the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] two referendums were put before voters. One was on whether the number of Members of Parliament should be reduced from 120 to 99. Electors overwhelmingly voted in favour of the proposal, with 81.47% voting for this proposal. However, there were no moves to amend the [[Electoral Act 1993]] in line with this result until 2006 when a bill was introduced by [[New Zealand First]] MP [[Barbara Stewart]] to reduce the size of Parliament to 100. The bill passed its first reading, 61 votes to 60 and was referred to Select Committee. The Select Committee returned recommending the bill to not be passed, citing reasons including public misconception on the MMP voting system, population growth, and international comparability.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/067094C5-47A4-43AA-AE7F-5D7C15B55D3E/36327/DBSCH_SCR_3542_3576.pdf |title= Electoral (Reduction in Number of Members of Parliament) Amendment Bill: Report of the Justice and Electoral Committee |year= 2006 |accessdate= 15 August 2012}}</ref> The bill was subsequently voted down 112 to 9 at its second reading.\n\nThe other referendum held in 1999 asked \"Should there be a reform of our Justice system placing greater emphasis on the needs of victims, providing restitution and compensation for them and imposing minimum sentences and hard labour for all serious violent offences?\". This measure passed by 91.78%. There was some debate over the phrasing of the referendum, as the question actually contains five separate questions; voters could agree with some, but not with others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/_2001/publications_2001/Massey_News/February/Feb_26/stories/referendum.html|title=Referendum Confuses Voters|year=2007|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Parental corporal punishment===\n{{main|2009 New Zealand corporal punishment referendum}}\nFollowing the submission of a petition on 22 August 2008, the Clerk of the House verified to Parliament that the threshold for a CIR had been reached.

[[ACT New Zealand]], [[Family First New Zealand]], the [[Sensible Sentencing Trust]] and [[Kiwi Party]] all advocate binding referendums.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, [[Kiwi Party]] President [[Larry Baldock]] failed to submit enough signatures for a petition that might have led to a non-binding referendum on whether or not binding citizens referenda should be introduced after being granted permission to circulate a petition calling for that innovation, so the status quo remains. Although the Kiwi Party applied for deregistration, the cause has been taken up by the [[Conservative Party of New Zealand]] and its leader, [[Colin Craig]].\n\nBy contrast, [[GayNZ.com]] has run articles strongly critical of the CIR lobby, as well as expressing concerns that CIRs could be abused to strip vulnerable minorities of their legislative protections, as has occurred frequently with referendums against [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] and similar proposals that target [[illegal immigrants]] in that country.

The provision itself is not protected from ordinary amendment or repeal.\n\nThis has led to the sporadic use of referendums, partly because there is no constitutional requirement, as there is in other countries like [[Australia]] or [[Switzerland]] that have codified [[constitution]]s.\n\nRecent examples are the [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag referendums]] held across 2015 and 2016, conducted by postal vote.\n\n===Constitutional referendums===\nThere is no requirement for a referendum to enact constitutional change in New Zealand. Referendums were held in 1992 and 1993 to decide the nature of [[electoral reform in New Zealand]]. Many groups advocate approval of constitutional reforms by referendums; the [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand|Republican Movement]] supports a referendum on whether [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand should become a republic]].\n\nThere are frequent calls for the use of referendums to decide other constitutional matters, rather than by regular Acts of Parliament. In 2003 the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] replaced the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] as New Zealand's highest court of appeal with a new [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]], despite calls from [[New Zealand First]], [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] for a referendum to be held on the issue. In 1950 the abolition of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by the [[First National Government of New Zealand|First National Government]] was done by Act of Parliament; with additional members of the Legislative Council (MLC) appointed to ensure approval by the upper house, the ''suicide squad''.\n\n{{See also|Constitution of New Zealand}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''Turnout''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || 69.7 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 68.1% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 27 October 1990 || 85.2 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 69.3% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 19 September 1992 || 55.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 84.7% for change, 70.5% to MMP\n|-\n| 6 November 1993 || 85.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 53.9% for MMP\n|-\n| 26 November 2011 || 73.5 || [[2011 New Zealand voting method referendum|Voting system]] || 57.8% for keeping MMP\n|}\n\n===Liquor licensing referendums===\nIn New Zealand, alcohol licensing has historically been decided by referendum. The first of these were compulsory local licensing referendums, held in 1894 and then with each main parliamentary election between 1896 and 1914. Local licensing referendums were eliminated after 1914, apart from 'local restoration polls' to legalise liquor sales in 'dry' districts. In 1910 a referendum on national prohibition of alcohol was introduced, and held in conjunction with every general election from 1911 to 1987 inclusive (except [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]] and [[1951 New Zealand general election|1951]]). An extra referendum on prohibition was held on 10 April 1919. From 17 December 1919 the additional option of ''state purchase and control'' of liquor (i.e. nationalisation) was added to the ballot. The Sale of Liquor Act 1989 abolished the national liquor referendum. Local restoration polls were still held in areas that were still 'dry', but the last three, [[Mount Eden]], [[Mount Roskill, New Zealand|Mount Roskill]] and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], all became 'wet' in 1999. There have been two referendums on [[pub]] closing times.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Three-to-one majority to retain\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Two-to-one majority for later opening\n|}\n\n===Other referendums===\nThe government may call referendums on any issues on which it wishes. These will usually be on issues on which the government is split. For the 1997 referendum on retirement savings, the decision to hold it was part of the coalition agreement between [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand First]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || 54.3 || Allow off-course [[betting]] || 68.0% in favour\n|-\n| 3 August 1949 || 63.5 || [[Compulsory Military Training in New Zealand|Compulsory military training]] || 77.9% in favour\n|-\n| 5 September 1997 || 80.3 || Compulsory [[Retirement plan|Retirement Savings]] Scheme || 91.8% against\n|-\n| 20 November \u2013 11 December 2015 || 48.2 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], first stage || 50.58% for [[File:NZ flag design Silver Fern (Black, White & Blue) by Kyle Lockwood.svg|25px|border]] [[Lockwood silver fern flag|Silver Fern (Black, White and Blue)]] after 4 counts\n|-\n| 3\u201324 March 2016 || 67.8 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], second stage || 56.6% for retaining the existing [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|}\n\n==Citizens Initiated Referenda==\n{{anchor|Citizens initiated referendums|Citizens-initiated referenda||Citizens-initiated referendums}}\nThe [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993] allows for citizens to propose a [[Initiative|referendum]]. These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months. There were [http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2017-general-election/2017-general-election-results/voter-turnout-statistics 3,298,009 voters enrolled] for the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], so at least 329,801 signatures would be required at a rate of approximately 904 signatures per day. In reality, more signatures would be required to account for variances in electoral roll numbers, duplicate signatures and signatures that cannot be matched to a registered elector.\n\nThere are procedural requirements governing this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/seek-a-referendum/|title=Seek a referendum|last=|first=|date=|website=New Zealand Parliament|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> It costs [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]500 to file a petition asking for a referendum with the Clerk of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Clerk formally determines the wording of the question, which may be quite different from the original. Once the Clerk receives the completed petition, the number of signatures is initially counted, followed by sample groups of signatures being taken and the signatories' names and addresses checked against the electoral roll. The sampling of signatures is used to estimate the number of valid signatures for the whole petition with confidence, and if the lower confidence interval is more than ten percent of the electoral roll, the petition is presented to the House of Representatives.\n\nWithin one month of the petition's presentation to the House, a date for the poll must be determined. The poll must be held within 12 months of the petition's presentation, unless 75 percent of MPs vote to delay the poll for one year. There is also a $50,000 spending limit on promoting the petition.\n\nNew Zealand, [[Italy]], and [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)#Federal popular initiative|Switzerland]] are among countries whose laws allow for citizen-initiated referendums (CIRs) nationally. Its defenders view it as a form of \"direct democracy\". However, the Citizens Initiated Referendum 1993 went against the advice of the [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] 1986. The Commission stated, speaking about referenda more broadly, \"In general, initiatives and referendums are blunt and crude devices.... [that] would blur the lines of accountability and responsibility of Governments\".<ref>Royal Commission on the Electoral System \"Towards a Better Democracy\" [1986\u20131987] IX AJHR H3 at [7.30].</ref>\n\nA total of 33 petitions have been launched since 1993 on a wide range of topics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Only five (one in 1995, two in 1999, one in 2009, one in 2013) have come to a vote. The other petitions failed to gain enough signatures to force a referendum. Achieving the target number of signatures is a requirement for forcing a vote on an initiative proposed by citizens.\n\n===Firefighters===\nThe first citizens initiated referendum was held on 2 December 1995. The question \"Should the number of professional fire-fighters employed full-time in the [[New Zealand Fire Service]] be reduced below the number employed on 1 January 1995?\" aimed to elicit a \"no\" response{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Turnout was low as the referendum was not held in conjunction with a general election. Just over 12% voted \"Yes\" and almost 88% voted \"No\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1995.electionresults.govt.nz/1995_citizens_referenda/|format=PDF|title=Return of Citizens Initiated Referendum Poll Votes|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]]}}</ref>\n\n===1999 election===\nAt the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] two referendums were put before voters. One was on whether the number of Members of Parliament should be reduced from 120 to 99. Electors overwhelmingly voted in favour of the proposal, with 81.47% voting for this proposal. However, there were no moves to amend the [[Electoral Act 1993]] in line with this result until 2006 when a bill was introduced by [[New Zealand First]] MP [[Barbara Stewart]] to reduce the size of Parliament to 100. The bill passed its first reading, 61 votes to 60 and was referred to Select Committee. The Select Committee returned recommending the bill to not be passed, citing reasons including public misconception on the MMP voting system, population growth, and international comparability.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/067094C5-47A4-43AA-AE7F-5D7C15B55D3E/36327/DBSCH_SCR_3542_3576.pdf |title= Electoral (Reduction in Number of Members of Parliament) Amendment Bill: Report of the Justice and Electoral Committee |year= 2006 |accessdate= 15 August 2012}}</ref> The bill was subsequently voted down 112 to 9 at its second reading.\n\nThe other referendum held in 1999 asked \"Should there be a reform of our Justice system placing greater emphasis on the needs of victims, providing restitution and compensation for them and imposing minimum sentences and hard labour for all serious violent offences?\". This measure passed by 91.78%. There was some debate over the phrasing of the referendum, as the question actually contains five separate questions; voters could agree with some, but not with others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/_2001/publications_2001/Massey_News/February/Feb_26/stories/referendum.html|title=Referendum Confuses Voters|year=2007|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Parental corporal punishment===\n{{main|2009 New Zealand corporal punishment referendum}}\nFollowing the submission of a petition on 22 August 2008, the Clerk of the House verified to Parliament that the threshold for a CIR had been reached.

[[ACT New Zealand]], [[Family First New Zealand]], the [[Sensible Sentencing Trust]] and [[Kiwi Party]] all advocate binding referendums.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, [[Kiwi Party]] President [[Larry Baldock]] failed to submit enough signatures for a petition that might have led to a non-binding referendum on whether or not binding citizens referenda should be introduced after being granted permission to circulate a petition calling for that innovation, so the status quo remains. Although the Kiwi Party applied for deregistration, the cause has been taken up by the [[Conservative Party of New Zealand]] and its leader, [[Colin Craig]].\n\nBy contrast, [[GayNZ.com]] has run articles strongly critical of the CIR lobby, as well as expressing concerns that CIRs could be abused to strip vulnerable minorities of their legislative protections, as has occurred frequently with referendums against [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] and similar proposals that target [[illegal immigrants]] in that country. In some New Zealand media outlets, the [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland]] has also been cited as one current example of anti-minoritarian abuse of the 'citizens' referendum process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/31/article_8116.php |title=The case against Citizens Initiated Referenda |publisher=Gaynz.com |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"3News_131865\">{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Swiss-ban-mosque-minarets-in-surprise-vote/tabid/417/articleID/131865/cat/268/Default.aspx |title=Swiss ban mosque minarets in surprise vote |date=30 November 2009 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Joanne Black: \"Heidi Ho\": New Zealand Listener: 12.12.09: 94</ref>\n\nEven amongst conservatives, the issue has become contentious.
