In addition to supplying [[milk]], [[meat]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], wool, their castings (dung) and [[Hide (skin)|hides]], [[animal]]s, mainly [[Cattle|bullocks]], are the major source of power for both farmers and drayers. Thus, animal husbandry plays an important role in the rural economy.

India also had 110 million [[goats]], 75 million [[water buffalo]]es, 44 million [[sheep]], and 10 million [[pig]]s. Milk production in FY 1990 was estimated to have reached 53.5 million tons, and [[Egg (food)|egg]] production had reached a level of 23.3 billion eggs. Dairy farming provided supplementary employment and an additional source of income to many small and marginal farmers. The [[National Dairy Development Board]] was established in 1965 under the auspices of Operation Flood at [[Anand, Gujarat|Anand]], in [[Gujarat]], to promote, plan, and organize dairy development through cooperatives; to provide consultations; and to set up dairy plants, which were then turned over to the cooperatives. There were more than 63,000 Anand-style dairy cooperative societies with some 7.5 million members in the early 1990s. The milk produced and sold by these farmers brought {{INRConvert|320|m|1}} a day, or more than {{INRConvert|10|t|1}} a year. The increase in milk production permitted India to end imports of powdered milk and milk-related products. In addition, 30,000 tons of powdered milk were exported annually to neighboring countries. There was about 50000 cows in India.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dahd.nic.in/|title=Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries|last=Government of India|first=|date=|website=dahd.nic.in|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:indiapoultry.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Chicken facilities in [[Haryana, India]].]]\nToday, India has the world's largest dairy herd (composed of cows and buffaloes), at over 304 million strong,<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Cite web |url=http://dahd.nic.in/dahd/WriteReadData/Annual%20Report%202010-11%20English.pdf |title=Annual Report |access-date=2015-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721060801/http://dahd.nic.in/dahd/WriteReadData/Annual%20Report%202010-11%20English.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and stands first in milk production, with 112.5 million tonnes of milk produced in 2009\u20132010.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> India is also the third-largest egg-producer in the world, producing over 180 million eggs every day or 65.7 billion eggs for the year 2011\u201312,<ref>[http://www.thehansindia.info/News/Article.asp?category=1&subCategory=8&ContentId=51650 The Hans India]</ref> and the world's sixth largest producer of poultry meat.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Mia MacDonald and Sangamithra Iyer (2010) Veg or Non Veg?

Dairy farming provided supplementary employment and an additional source of income to many small and marginal farmers. The [[National Dairy Development Board]] was established in 1965 under the auspices of Operation Flood at [[Anand, Gujarat|Anand]], in [[Gujarat]], to promote, plan, and organize dairy development through cooperatives; to provide consultations; and to set up dairy plants, which were then turned over to the cooperatives. There were more than 63,000 Anand-style dairy cooperative societies with some 7.5 million members in the early 1990s. The milk produced and sold by these farmers brought {{INRConvert|320|m|1}} a day, or more than {{INRConvert|10|t|1}} a year. The increase in milk production permitted India to end imports of powdered milk and milk-related products. In addition, 30,000 tons of powdered milk were exported annually to neighboring countries.

In the [[Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691|course of the 17th century]], this Anglo-Irish landed class replaced the [[Gaelic Aristocracy|Gaelic Irish]] and [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] aristocracies as the ruling class in Ireland.  They were also referred to as \"'''New English'''\" to distinguish them from the \"[[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]]\", who descended from the medieval [[Hiberno-Normans|Hiberno-Norman]] settlers.\n\nA larger but less socially prominent element of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Irish population were immigrant French [[Huguenot]]s and the English and Scottish [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|dissenters]] who settled in Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries in the plantation period. Many of these, especially the [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] or their descendants, emigrated to the [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonies]], particularly in the eighteenth century before the American War of Independence.\n\nUnder the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], which were in force between the 17th and 19th centuries (although enforced with varying degrees of severity), [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Recusancy|recusants]] in Great Britain and Ireland were barred from holding public office, while in Ireland they were also barred from entry to the [[Trinity College, Dublin|University of Dublin]] and from professions such as law, medicine, and the [[Irish establishment|military]]. The lands of the recusant Roman Catholic [[landed gentry]] who refused to take the prescribed oaths were largely confiscated during the [[Plantations of Ireland]]. The rights of Roman Catholics to inherit landed property were severely restricted. Those who converted to the Church of Ireland were usually able to keep or regain their lost property, as the issue was considered primarily one of allegiance. In the late 18th century, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] in Dublin won legislative independence, and the movement for the repeal of the [[Test Acts]] began.\n\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral Swift bust.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Marble bust of [[The Very Reverend|The V.

In the [[Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691|course of the 17th century]], this Anglo-Irish landed class replaced the [[Gaelic Aristocracy|Gaelic Irish]] and [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] aristocracies as the ruling class in Ireland.

For instance, author [[Jonathan Swift]] (1667\u20131745), a clergyman in the Church of Ireland, vigorously denounced the plight of ordinary [[Irish Catholics]] under the rule of the landlords. Reformist politicians such as [[Henry Grattan]] (1746\u20131820), [[Wolfe Tone]] (1763\u20131798), [[Robert Emmet]] (1778\u20131803), [[John Gray (Irish politician)|Sir John Gray]] (1815\u20131875), and [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] (1846\u20131891), were also [[Protestant Irish nationalists|Protestant nationalists]], and in large measure led and defined Irish nationalism.

The term was developed by [[Merrill Singer]] in the mid-1990s. Syndemics develop under [[health disparity]], caused by [[poverty]], stress, or [[structural violence]] and are studied by [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]] and [[Medical anthropology|medical anthropologists]] concerned with public health, [[community health]] and the effects of social conditions on health.\n\nThe syndemic approach departs from the biomedical approach to diseases to diagnostically isolate, study, and treat diseases as distinct entities separate from other diseases and [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] of social contexts.\n\n==Definition==\nA syndemic is a [[synergistic]] epidemic.

The difference between \"comorbid\" and \"syndemic\" is per Mustanski et al. (2008:40){{full citation needed|date=March 2017}} \"comorbidity research tends to focus on the [[Nosology|nosological]] issues of boundaries and overlap of diagnoses, while syndemic research focuses on communities experiencing co-occurring epidemics that additively increase negative health consequences.\" It is possible for two afflictions to be comorbid, but not syndemic i.e., the disorders are not [[epidemic]] in the studied population, or their co-occurrence is not accompanied by worsened health. Two or more diseases can be comorbid without interactions, or interaction occurs but it is beneficial, not deleterious. ''Syndemic theory'' seeks to draw attention to and provide a framework for the analysis of adverse disease interactions, including their causes and consequences for human life and well-being.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Types of disease interaction==\nDiseases regularly interact and this interaction influences disease course, expression, severity, transmission, and diffusion. Interaction among diseases may be both indirect (changes caused by one disease that facilitate another through an intermediary) and direct (diseases act in direct tandem).\n* One disease can assist the [[Transmission (medicine)|physical transmission]] of the microbe causing another disease, for example, genital-tract ulceration caused by syphilis allowing sexual transmission of HIV.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n* One disease may enhance the [[virulence]] of another, as for example, [[herpes simplex virus]] co-infection exacerbates HIV infection with progression to AIDS,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  periodontal bacteria may enhance the virulence of herpesvirus,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} HIV-infected individuals are more susceptible to [[tuberculosis]]; As of 2011, the cause was not fully understood.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Diedrich CR. |author2=Flynn J. | year = 2011 | title = HIV-1/Mycobacterium tuberculosis Coinfection Immunology: How Does HIV-1 Exacerbate Tuberculosis?| journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 1407\u201317 | doi=10.1128/iai.01126-10 | pmid=21245275 | pmc=3067569}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Cain K. |author2=Kanara N. |author3=Laserson K. |author4=Vannarith C. |author5=Sameourn K. |author6=Samnang K. |author7=Qualls M. |author8=Varma J. | year = 2007 | title = The Epidemiology of HIV-associated Tuberculosis in Rural Cambodia | url = | journal = International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease | volume = 11 | issue = 9| pages = 1008\u201313 |pmid=17705980 }}</ref><ref>Cain, Kevin, Anekthananon, Thanomsak, Burapat, Channawong, Akksilp, Somsak, Mankhatitham, Wiroj, Srinak, Chawin, Nateniyom, Sriprapa, Sattayawuthipong, Wanchai, Tasaneeyapan, Theerawit, and Varma, Jay 2009  \"Causes of Death in HIV-infected Persons Who Have Tuberculosis, Thailand\".

In coinfected cells, the retroviral DNA of the avian leukosis virus can integrate into the MDV genome, producing altered biological properties compared to those of the parental MDV. The frequency of gene reassortment among human pathogens is less clear than it is the among plant or animal species but of concern as animal diseases adapt to human hosts and as man new diseases comes into contact.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n* When one disease diminishes or eradicates another it is a counter-syndemic disease interaction.\n* The linkage also may not be clear, despite obvious syndemic interactions among diseases, as for example in [[type 2 diabetes]] mellitus and [[hepatitis C virus]] infection.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Iatrogenic==\nThe term [[iatrogenesis]] means \"brought forth by a healer\" and refers to [[adverse effect]]s on health caused by medical treatment. This is possible if medical treatment or medical research creates conditions that increase the likelihood that two or more diseases come together in a population. For example, if [[gene splicing]]  unites two pathogenic agents and the resulting novel organism infects a population. One study suggests the possibility of iatriogenic syndemics. During a randomized, double-blind clinical trial testing the efficacy of the prototype HIV vaccine called V520 there appeared to be an increased risk for HIV infection among the vaccinated participants. Notably, participants immune to the common cold virus [[adenovirus]] type 5 had a higher risk of HIV infection. The vaccine was created using a replication-defective version of Ad5 as a carrier, or delivery vector, for three synthetically produced HIV genes. On November 6, 2007, Merck & Co. announced that research had been stopped suspecting the higher rate of HIV infection among individuals in the vaccinated was because the vaccine lowered defenses against HIV.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Examples==\nVarious syndemics though not always labeled as such have been described in the literature, including the\n* SAVA syndemic (substance abuse, violence and AIDS,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Meyer |first1=Jaimie P. | last2 = Springer | first2 = Sandra A. | last3 = Altice | first3 = Frederick L. | title = Substance Abuse, Violence, and HIV in Women: A Literature Review of the Syndemic | journal = [[Journal of Women's Health]] | volume = 20 | issue = 7 | pages = 991\u20131006 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.2010.2328 |pmid=21668380 |pmc=3130513 | date = July 2011 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Feingold Abraham | year = 2009 | title = SAVA Latina: Addressing the Interplay of Substance Abuse, Violence, & AIDS Affecting Hispanic Women (Part 1) | url = | journal = Mental Health AIDS | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 4\u20138 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Illangasekare S. |author2=Burke J. |author3=Chander G. |author4=Gielen A. | year = 2013 | title = The Syndemic Effects of Intimate Partner Violence, HIV/AIDS, and Substance Abuse on Depression among Low-Income Urban Women | url = | journal = Journal of Urban Health | volume = 90 | issue = 5| pages = 934\u201347 | doi=10.1007/s11524-013-9797-8|pmid=23529665 |pmc=3795184 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Yuwen Weicho | year = 2012 | title = In Response to the Published Article \"A Syndemic Model of Substance Abuse, Intimate Partner Violence, HIV Infection, and Mental Health among Hispanics\" | url = | journal = Public Health Nursing | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 388\u201389 | doi=10.1111/j.1525-1446.2012.01028.x| pmid = 22924561 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Senn Theresa |author2=Carey Michael |author3=Vanable Peter | year = 2010 | title = The Intersection of Violence, Substance Use, Depression, and STDs: Testing of a Syndemic Pattern Among Patients Attending an Urban STD Clinic | url = | journal = Journal of the National Medical Association | volume = 102 | issue = 7| pages = 614\u201320 |doi=10.1016/S0027-9684(15)30639-8 |pmid=20690325 |pmc=2935202 }}</ref>\n* the [[hookworm]], [[malaria]] and HIV/AIDS syndemic,<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1186/2049-9957-2-26|pmid = 24237997|title = Development, coinfection, and the syndemics of pregnancy in Sub-Saharan Africa|journal = Infectious Diseases of Poverty|volume = 2|issue = 1|pages = 26|year = 2013|last1 = Singer|first1 = Merrill|pmc = 4177213}}</ref>\n* the [[Chagas disease]], [[rheumatic heart disease]] and [[congestive heart failure]] syndemic,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bocchi EA, Arias A, Verdejo H, Diez M, G\u00f3mez E, Castro P | date = Sep 2013 | title = The reality of heart failure in Latin America | url = | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 62 | issue = 11| pages = 949\u201358 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2013.06.013 | pmid = 23850910 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n* the possible [[asthma]] and [[infectious disease]] syndemic,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Atkinson T.P. | year = 2013 | title = Is Asthma an Infectious Disease?

Several potential mechanisms could be responsible. Measles virus infection causes [[lymphopenia]], a reduction in the number of [[CD4+ T lymphocytes]] circulating in the blood. The low point occurs just prior to the onset of the characteristic skin rash. Within a month of this nadir, the number of lymphocytes return to normal levels. The drop in HIV virus levels may be due to a lack of target CD4+ T cells in which they replicate, or measles virus may stimulate the production of proteins suppressing HIV replication, including the \u03b2-chemokines, [[CD8+ cell noncytotoxic anti-HIV response]], and the cytokines [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]] and IL-16. median plasma levels of [[RANTES]], a chemokine that attracts immune system components like eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes were higher in HIV-infected children with measles than in those without measles(Moss and co-workers).{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n* HIV suppression in [[tsutsugamuchi disease]] or scrub typhus, a mite-borne infection in Asia and Australia, but how this occurs is unclear.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===19th century Native American===\nContact between Native Americans and Europeans during the [[Columbian Exchange]] led to lethal syndemics within the Native American population due to diseases introduced which the Native Americans had not encountered before and had not built-up immunity to.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nAn example of a syndemic from the 19th century can be found on the reservations on which Native Americans were confined with the closing of the U.S. frontier. It is estimated that in 1860 there were well over 10 million [[bison]] living on the American [[Great Plains|Plains]]. By the early 1880s, the last of the great herds of bison upon which [[Plains Indian]] peoples like the [[Sioux]] were dependent as a food source were gone.  At the same time, after the U.S. military's defeat at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] in 1876, there was a concerted effort to beat the Sioux into total submission. Thus, in 1872, Secretary of the Interior [[Columbus Delano]] stated: \"as they become convinced that they can no longer rely upon the supply of game for their support, they will return to the more reliable source of subsistence [i.e., farming].\" As a result, they were forced to give up their struggle for an independent existence on their own lands and take up reservation life at the mercy of government authority.  Treaties that were signed with the Sioux in 1868 and 1876 stipulated that they would be provided with government annuities and provisions in payment for sections of their land and with the expectation among federal representatives that the Sioux would become farmers on individually held plots of land. The Sioux found themselves confined on a series of small reservations where they were treated as a conquered people. Moreover, the government reneged on its promises, food was insufficient and of low quality. [[Black Elk]], a noted Sioux folk healer, told his biographer: \"There was hunger among my people before I went across the big water [to Europe in 1886], because the Wasichus [whites] did not give us all the food they promised in the Black Hills treaty...  But it was worse when I came back [1889]. My people looked pitiful\u2026  We could not eat lies and there was nothing we could do.\"  Under extremely stressful conditions, with inadequate diets, and as victims of overt racism on the part of the registration agents appointed to oversee Indian reserves, the Sioux confronted infectious disease from contact with whites. knowledge about the epidemiology of the Sioux from this period is limited, [[James Mooney]], an anthropologist and representative of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] sent to investigate a possible Sioux rebellion, described the health situation on the reservation in 1896: \"In 1888 their cattle had been diminished by disease.  In 1889, their crops were a failure ...  Thus followed epidemics of measles, grippe [influenza], and whooping cough [[Pertussis]], in rapid succession and with terrible fatal results\u2026\"  Similarly, the ''Handbook of American Indians'' notes, \"The least hopeful conditions in this respect prevail among the Dakota [Sioux] and other tribes of the colder northern regions, where pulmonary tuberculosis and scrofula are very common\u2026  Other more common diseases, are various forms of, bronchitis ...pneumonia, [[pleurisy]], and measles in the young. Whooping cough is also met with.\"  Indian children were removed to white boarding schools and diagnosed with a wide range of diseases, including tuberculosis, trachoma, measles, smallpox, whooping cough, influenza, and pneumonia.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe Sioux were victims of a syndemic of interacting infectious diseases including the [[1889\u20131890 flu pandemic]], inadequate diet, and stressful and extremely disheartening life conditions, including outright brutalization with events like the massacre at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] in 1890 and the murder of their leader [[Sitting Bull]]. While the official mortality rate on the reservation was between one and two percent, the death rate was probably closer to 10 percent.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Influenza===\nThere were three influenza [[pandemics]] during the 20th century that caused widespread illness, mortality, social disruption, and significant economic losses.  These occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968. In each case, mortality rates were determined primarily by five factors: the number of people who became infected, the virulence of the virus causing the pandemic, the speed of global spread, the underlying features and vulnerabilities of the most affected populations, and the effectiveness and timeliness of the prevention and treatment measures that were implemented.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[1957 pandemic]] was caused by the Asian influenza virus (known as the H2N2 strain), a novel influenza variety to which humans had not yet developed immunities. The death toll of the 1957 pandemic is estimated to have been around two million globally, with approximately 70,000 deaths in the United States.  A little over a decade later, the comparatively mild Hong Kong influenza pandemic erupted due to the spread of a virus strain (H3N2) that genetically was related to the more deadly form seen in 1957.  The pandemic was responsible for about one million deaths around the world, almost 34,000 of which were in the United States.  In both of these pandemics, death may not have been due only to the primary viral infection, but also to secondary bacterial infections among influenza patients; in short, they were caused by a viral/bacterial syndemic (but see Chatterjee 2007).\n\nThe worst of the 20th-century influenza pandemics was the [[1918 pandemic]], where between 20-40 percent of the world's population became ill between 40\u2013100 million people died.  More people died of the so-called [[Spanish flu]] (caused by the [[H1N1]] viral strain) pandemic in the single year of 1918 than during all four-years of the [[Black Death]]. The pandemic had devastating effects as disease spread along trade and shipping routes and other corridors of human movement until it had circled the globe. In India, the mortality rate reached 50 per 1,000 population. Arriving during the closing phase of World War I, the pandemic impacted mobilized national armies. Half of U.S. soldiers who died in the \"Great War,\" for example, were victims of influenza. It is estimated that almost \u00be of a million Americans died during the pandemic. In part, the death toll during the pandemic was caused by viral pneumonia characterized by extensive bleeding in the lungs resulting in suffocation.  Many victims died within 48 hours of the appearance of the first symptom.  It was not uncommon for people who appeared to be quite healthy in the morning to have died by sunset. Among those who survived the first several days, however, many died of secondary bacterial pneumonia. It has been argued that countless numbers of those who expired quickly from the disease were co-infected with tuberculosis, which would explain the notable plummet in TB cases after 1918.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Climate change===\nAs a result of the floral changes produced by global warming, an escalation is occurring in global rates of allergies and [[asthma]]. Allergic diseases constitute the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the United States, impacting  17 percent of the population.  Asthma affects about 8 percent of the U.S. population, with rising tendency, especially in low income, ethnic minority neighborhoods in cities. In 1980 asthma affected only about three percent of the U.S. population according to the U.S. CDC.  Asthma among children has been increasing at an even faster pace than among adults, with the percentage of children with asthma going up from 3.6 percent in 1980 to 9 percent in 2005. Among ethnic minority populations, like Puerto Ricans the rate of asthma is 125 percent higher than non-Hispanic white people and 80 percent higher than non-Hispanic black people. The asthma prevalence among American Indians, Alaska Natives and black people is 25 percent higher than in white people.\n\n===Air pollution===\nIncreases in asthma rates have occurred despite improvements in air quality produced by the passage and enforcement of clean air legislation, such as the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1963 and the Clean Air Act of 1990. existing legislation and regulation have not kept pace with changing climatic conditions and their health consequences.  Compounding the problem of air quality is the fact that air-borne pollens have been found to attach themselves to diesel particles from truck or other vehicular exhaust floating in the air, resulting in heightened rates of asthma in areas where busy roads bisect densely populated areas, most notably in poorer inner-city areas.\n\nFor every elevation of 10 \u03bcg/m3 in [[particulate matter]] concentration in the air a six percent increase in cardiopulmonary deaths occurs according to research by the American Cancer Society. Exhaust from the burning of diesel fuel is a complex mixture of vapors, gases, and fine particles, including over 40 known pollutants like nitrogen oxide and known or suspected carcinogenic substances such as benzene, arsenic, and formaldehyde. Exposure to [[diesel exhaust]] irritates the eyes, nose, throat and lungs, causing coughs, headaches, light-headedness and nausea, while causing people with allergies to be more susceptible allergy triggers like dust or pollen. Many particles in disease fuel are so tiny they are able to penetrate deep into the lungs when inhaled.  Importantly, diesel fuel particles appear to have even greater immunologic effects in the presence of environmental allergens than they do alone.  \"This immunologic evidence may help explain the epidemiologic studies indicating that children living along major trucking thoroughfares are at increased risk for asthmatic and allergic symptoms and are more likely to have respiratory dysfunction.\" according to Robert Pandya and co-workers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe damaging effects of diesel fuel pollution go beyond a synergistic role in asthma development. Exposure to a combination of microscopic diesel fuel particles among people with high blood cholesterol (i.e., [[low-density lipoprotein]], LDL or \"bad cholesterol\") increases the risk for both heart attack and stroke above levels found among those exposed to only one of these health risks.  According to [[Andr\u00e9 Nel]], Chief of Nanomedicine at the [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA]], \"When you add one plus one, it normally totals two... But we found that adding diesel particles to cholesterol fats equals three. Their combination creates a dangerous synergy that wreaks cardiovascular havoc far beyond what's caused by the diesel or cholesterol alone.\"  Experimentation revealed that the two mechanisms worked in tandem to stimulate genes that promote cell inflammation, a primary risk for hardening and blockage of blood vessels ([[atherosclerosis]]) and, as narrowed arteries collect cholesterol deposits and trigger blood clots, for [[heart attacks]] and [[strokes]] as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Mathematical modelling==\nA [[mathematical model]] is a simplified representation using mathematical language to describe natural, mechanical or social system dynamics. Epidemiological modelers unite several types of information and analytic capacity, including: 1) mathematical equations and computational algorithms; 2) computer technology; 3) epidemiological knowledge about [[infectious disease dynamics]], including information about specific pathogens and disease [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]; and 4) research data on social conditions and human behavior.  [[Mathematical modelling in epidemiology]] is now being applied to syndemics.\n\nFor example, modelling to quantify the syndemic effects of malaria and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa based on research in Kisumu, Kenya researchers found that 5% of HIV infections (or 8,500 cases of HIV since 1980) in Kisumu are the result of the higher HIV infectiousness of malaria-infected HIV patients.  Additionally, their model attributed 10% of adult malaria episodes (or almost one million excess malaria infections since 1980) to the greater susceptibility of HIV infected individuals to malaria.  Their model also suggests that HIV has contributed to the wider geographic spread of malaria in Africa, a process previously thought to be the consequence primarily of global warming.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Abu-Raddad Laith |author2=Patnaik P. |author3=Kublin J | year = 2006 | title = Dual Infection with HIV and Malaria Fuels the Spread of Both Diseases in sub-Saharan Africa | url = | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5805| pages = 1603\u201306 | doi=10.1126/science.1132338 | pmid=17158329|bibcode=2006Sci...314.1603A }}</ref>  Modelling offers an enormously useful tool for anticipating future syndemics, including eco-syndemic, based on information about the spread of various diseases across the planet and the consequent co-infections and disease interactions that will result.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Herring D.

The PopMod has several intended purposes, including describing the time evolution of population health for standard demographic purposes (such as estimating healthy life expectancy in a population), and providing a standard measure of effectiveness for health interventions and cost-effectiveness analysis.  PopMod is used as one of the standard tools of the World Health Organization's ([[WHO]]) CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective) program, an initiative designed to provide national health policymakers in the WHO's 14 epidemiological sub-regions around the world with findings on a range of health intervention costs and effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Lauer Jeremy |author2=R\u00f6hrich Klaus |author3=Wirth Harald |author4=Charette Claude |author5=Gribble Steve |author6=Murray Christopher | year = 2003 | title = PopMod: a longitudinal population model with two interacting disease states | journal = Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 6 | pmc=156025 | pmid=12773215|doi=10.1186/1478-7547-1-6 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough in Merrill Singer's conceptual work on syndemics the study of disease interaction is a central issue, most empirically based research studies have not used appropriate statistical models to do so.

There is a need to identify all of the ways, directly and indirectly, that diseases can interact and have, as a result, enhanced impact on human health. Third there is a need for the development of an '''eco-syndemic''' understanding of the ways in which [[global warming]] contributes to the spread of diseases and new disease interactions.\nThere is a need for a better understanding of how public health systems and communities can best respond to and limit the health consequences of syndemics. Systems are needed to monitor the emergence of syndemics and to allow early medical and public health responses to lessen their impact. Systematic ethno-epidemiological surveillance with populations subject to multiple social stressors must be one component of such a monitoring system.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Endemic (epidemiology)|Endemic]]\n* [[List of epidemics]]\n* [[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Books===\n* Marshall, Mac 2013 ''Drinking Smoke: The Tobacco Syndemic in Oceania.''

During a randomized, double-blind clinical trial testing the efficacy of the prototype HIV vaccine called V520 there appeared to be an increased risk for HIV infection among the vaccinated participants. Notably, participants immune to the common cold virus [[adenovirus]] type 5 had a higher risk of HIV infection. The vaccine was created using a replication-defective version of Ad5 as a carrier, or delivery vector, for three synthetically produced HIV genes. On November 6, 2007, Merck & Co. announced that research had been stopped suspecting the higher rate of HIV infection among individuals in the vaccinated was because the vaccine lowered defenses against HIV.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Examples==\nVarious syndemics though not always labeled as such have been described in the literature, including the\n* SAVA syndemic (substance abuse, violence and AIDS,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Meyer |first1=Jaimie P. | last2 = Springer | first2 = Sandra A. | last3 = Altice | first3 = Frederick L. | title = Substance Abuse, Violence, and HIV in Women: A Literature Review of the Syndemic | journal = [[Journal of Women's Health]] | volume = 20 | issue = 7 | pages = 991\u20131006 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.2010.2328 |pmid=21668380 |pmc=3130513 | date = July 2011 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Feingold Abraham | year = 2009 | title = SAVA Latina: Addressing the Interplay of Substance Abuse, Violence, & AIDS Affecting Hispanic Women (Part 1) | url = | journal = Mental Health AIDS | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 4\u20138 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Illangasekare S. |author2=Burke J. |author3=Chander G. |author4=Gielen A. | year = 2013 | title = The Syndemic Effects of Intimate Partner Violence, HIV/AIDS, and Substance Abuse on Depression among Low-Income Urban Women | url = | journal = Journal of Urban Health | volume = 90 | issue = 5| pages = 934\u201347 | doi=10.1007/s11524-013-9797-8|pmid=23529665 |pmc=3795184 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Yuwen Weicho | year = 2012 | title = In Response to the Published Article \"A Syndemic Model of Substance Abuse, Intimate Partner Violence, HIV Infection, and Mental Health among Hispanics\" | url = | journal = Public Health Nursing | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 388\u201389 | doi=10.1111/j.1525-1446.2012.01028.x| pmid = 22924561 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Senn Theresa |author2=Carey Michael |author3=Vanable Peter | year = 2010 | title = The Intersection of Violence, Substance Use, Depression, and STDs: Testing of a Syndemic Pattern Among Patients Attending an Urban STD Clinic | url = | journal = Journal of the National Medical Association | volume = 102 | issue = 7| pages = 614\u201320 |doi=10.1016/S0027-9684(15)30639-8 |pmid=20690325 |pmc=2935202 }}</ref>\n* the [[hookworm]], [[malaria]] and HIV/AIDS syndemic,<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1186/2049-9957-2-26|pmid = 24237997|title = Development, coinfection, and the syndemics of pregnancy in Sub-Saharan Africa|journal = Infectious Diseases of Poverty|volume = 2|issue = 1|pages = 26|year = 2013|last1 = Singer|first1 = Merrill|pmc = 4177213}}</ref>\n* the [[Chagas disease]], [[rheumatic heart disease]] and [[congestive heart failure]] syndemic,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bocchi EA, Arias A, Verdejo H, Diez M, G\u00f3mez E, Castro P | date = Sep 2013 | title = The reality of heart failure in Latin America | url = | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 62 | issue = 11| pages = 949\u201358 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2013.06.013 | pmid = 23850910 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n* the possible [[asthma]] and [[infectious disease]] syndemic,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Atkinson T.P. | year = 2013 | title = Is Asthma an Infectious Disease?

It is estimated that in 1860 there were well over 10 million [[bison]] living on the American [[Great Plains|Plains]]. By the early 1880s, the last of the great herds of bison upon which [[Plains Indian]] peoples like the [[Sioux]] were dependent as a food source were gone.  At the same time, after the U.S. military's defeat at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] in 1876, there was a concerted effort to beat the Sioux into total submission. Thus, in 1872, Secretary of the Interior [[Columbus Delano]] stated: \"as they become convinced that they can no longer rely upon the supply of game for their support, they will return to the more reliable source of subsistence [i.e., farming].\" As a result, they were forced to give up their struggle for an independent existence on their own lands and take up reservation life at the mercy of government authority.  Treaties that were signed with the Sioux in 1868 and 1876 stipulated that they would be provided with government annuities and provisions in payment for sections of their land and with the expectation among federal representatives that the Sioux would become farmers on individually held plots of land. The Sioux found themselves confined on a series of small reservations where they were treated as a conquered people. Moreover, the government reneged on its promises, food was insufficient and of low quality. [[Black Elk]], a noted Sioux folk healer, told his biographer: \"There was hunger among my people before I went across the big water [to Europe in 1886], because the Wasichus [whites] did not give us all the food they promised in the Black Hills treaty...  But it was worse when I came back [1889]. My people looked pitiful\u2026  We could not eat lies and there was nothing we could do.\"  Under extremely stressful conditions, with inadequate diets, and as victims of overt racism on the part of the registration agents appointed to oversee Indian reserves, the Sioux confronted infectious disease from contact with whites. knowledge about the epidemiology of the Sioux from this period is limited, [[James Mooney]], an anthropologist and representative of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] sent to investigate a possible Sioux rebellion, described the health situation on the reservation in 1896: \"In 1888 their cattle had been diminished by disease.  In 1889, their crops were a failure ...  Thus followed epidemics of measles, grippe [influenza], and whooping cough [[Pertussis]], in rapid succession and with terrible fatal results\u2026\"  Similarly, the ''Handbook of American Indians'' notes, \"The least hopeful conditions in this respect prevail among the Dakota [Sioux] and other tribes of the colder northern regions, where pulmonary tuberculosis and scrofula are very common\u2026  Other more common diseases, are various forms of, bronchitis ...pneumonia, [[pleurisy]], and measles in the young. Whooping cough is also met with.\"  Indian children were removed to white boarding schools and diagnosed with a wide range of diseases, including tuberculosis, trachoma, measles, smallpox, whooping cough, influenza, and pneumonia.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe Sioux were victims of a syndemic of interacting infectious diseases including the [[1889\u20131890 flu pandemic]], inadequate diet, and stressful and extremely disheartening life conditions, including outright brutalization with events like the massacre at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] in 1890 and the murder of their leader [[Sitting Bull]]. While the official mortality rate on the reservation was between one and two percent, the death rate was probably closer to 10 percent.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Influenza===\nThere were three influenza [[pandemics]] during the 20th century that caused widespread illness, mortality, social disruption, and significant economic losses.  These occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968. In each case, mortality rates were determined primarily by five factors: the number of people who became infected, the virulence of the virus causing the pandemic, the speed of global spread, the underlying features and vulnerabilities of the most affected populations, and the effectiveness and timeliness of the prevention and treatment measures that were implemented.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[1957 pandemic]] was caused by the Asian influenza virus (known as the H2N2 strain), a novel influenza variety to which humans had not yet developed immunities. The death toll of the 1957 pandemic is estimated to have been around two million globally, with approximately 70,000 deaths in the United States.  A little over a decade later, the comparatively mild Hong Kong influenza pandemic erupted due to the spread of a virus strain (H3N2) that genetically was related to the more deadly form seen in 1957.  The pandemic was responsible for about one million deaths around the world, almost 34,000 of which were in the United States.  In both of these pandemics, death may not have been due only to the primary viral infection, but also to secondary bacterial infections among influenza patients; in short, they were caused by a viral/bacterial syndemic (but see Chatterjee 2007).\n\nThe worst of the 20th-century influenza pandemics was the [[1918 pandemic]], where between 20-40 percent of the world's population became ill between 40\u2013100 million people died.  More people died of the so-called [[Spanish flu]] (caused by the [[H1N1]] viral strain) pandemic in the single year of 1918 than during all four-years of the [[Black Death]]. The pandemic had devastating effects as disease spread along trade and shipping routes and other corridors of human movement until it had circled the globe. In India, the mortality rate reached 50 per 1,000 population. Arriving during the closing phase of World War I, the pandemic impacted mobilized national armies. Half of U.S. soldiers who died in the \"Great War,\" for example, were victims of influenza. It is estimated that almost \u00be of a million Americans died during the pandemic. In part, the death toll during the pandemic was caused by viral pneumonia characterized by extensive bleeding in the lungs resulting in suffocation.  Many victims died within 48 hours of the appearance of the first symptom.  It was not uncommon for people who appeared to be quite healthy in the morning to have died by sunset. Among those who survived the first several days, however, many died of secondary bacterial pneumonia. It has been argued that countless numbers of those who expired quickly from the disease were co-infected with tuberculosis, which would explain the notable plummet in TB cases after 1918.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Climate change===\nAs a result of the floral changes produced by global warming, an escalation is occurring in global rates of allergies and [[asthma]]. Allergic diseases constitute the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the United States, impacting  17 percent of the population.  Asthma affects about 8 percent of the U.S. population, with rising tendency, especially in low income, ethnic minority neighborhoods in cities. In 1980 asthma affected only about three percent of the U.S. population according to the U.S. CDC.  Asthma among children has been increasing at an even faster pace than among adults, with the percentage of children with asthma going up from 3.6 percent in 1980 to 9 percent in 2005. Among ethnic minority populations, like Puerto Ricans the rate of asthma is 125 percent higher than non-Hispanic white people and 80 percent higher than non-Hispanic black people. The asthma prevalence among American Indians, Alaska Natives and black people is 25 percent higher than in white people.\n\n===Air pollution===\nIncreases in asthma rates have occurred despite improvements in air quality produced by the passage and enforcement of clean air legislation, such as the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1963 and the Clean Air Act of 1990. existing legislation and regulation have not kept pace with changing climatic conditions and their health consequences.  Compounding the problem of air quality is the fact that air-borne pollens have been found to attach themselves to diesel particles from truck or other vehicular exhaust floating in the air, resulting in heightened rates of asthma in areas where busy roads bisect densely populated areas, most notably in poorer inner-city areas.\n\nFor every elevation of 10 \u03bcg/m3 in [[particulate matter]] concentration in the air a six percent increase in cardiopulmonary deaths occurs according to research by the American Cancer Society. Exhaust from the burning of diesel fuel is a complex mixture of vapors, gases, and fine particles, including over 40 known pollutants like nitrogen oxide and known or suspected carcinogenic substances such as benzene, arsenic, and formaldehyde. Exposure to [[diesel exhaust]] irritates the eyes, nose, throat and lungs, causing coughs, headaches, light-headedness and nausea, while causing people with allergies to be more susceptible allergy triggers like dust or pollen. Many particles in disease fuel are so tiny they are able to penetrate deep into the lungs when inhaled.  Importantly, diesel fuel particles appear to have even greater immunologic effects in the presence of environmental allergens than they do alone.  \"This immunologic evidence may help explain the epidemiologic studies indicating that children living along major trucking thoroughfares are at increased risk for asthmatic and allergic symptoms and are more likely to have respiratory dysfunction.\" according to Robert Pandya and co-workers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe damaging effects of diesel fuel pollution go beyond a synergistic role in asthma development. Exposure to a combination of microscopic diesel fuel particles among people with high blood cholesterol (i.e., [[low-density lipoprotein]], LDL or \"bad cholesterol\") increases the risk for both heart attack and stroke above levels found among those exposed to only one of these health risks.  According to [[Andr\u00e9 Nel]], Chief of Nanomedicine at the [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA]], \"When you add one plus one, it normally totals two... But we found that adding diesel particles to cholesterol fats equals three. Their combination creates a dangerous synergy that wreaks cardiovascular havoc far beyond what's caused by the diesel or cholesterol alone.\"  Experimentation revealed that the two mechanisms worked in tandem to stimulate genes that promote cell inflammation, a primary risk for hardening and blockage of blood vessels ([[atherosclerosis]]) and, as narrowed arteries collect cholesterol deposits and trigger blood clots, for [[heart attacks]] and [[strokes]] as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Mathematical modelling==\nA [[mathematical model]] is a simplified representation using mathematical language to describe natural, mechanical or social system dynamics. Epidemiological modelers unite several types of information and analytic capacity, including: 1) mathematical equations and computational algorithms; 2) computer technology; 3) epidemiological knowledge about [[infectious disease dynamics]], including information about specific pathogens and disease [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]; and 4) research data on social conditions and human behavior.  [[Mathematical modelling in epidemiology]] is now being applied to syndemics.\n\nFor example, modelling to quantify the syndemic effects of malaria and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa based on research in Kisumu, Kenya researchers found that 5% of HIV infections (or 8,500 cases of HIV since 1980) in Kisumu are the result of the higher HIV infectiousness of malaria-infected HIV patients.  Additionally, their model attributed 10% of adult malaria episodes (or almost one million excess malaria infections since 1980) to the greater susceptibility of HIV infected individuals to malaria.  Their model also suggests that HIV has contributed to the wider geographic spread of malaria in Africa, a process previously thought to be the consequence primarily of global warming.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Abu-Raddad Laith |author2=Patnaik P. |author3=Kublin J | year = 2006 | title = Dual Infection with HIV and Malaria Fuels the Spread of Both Diseases in sub-Saharan Africa | url = | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5805| pages = 1603\u201306 | doi=10.1126/science.1132338 | pmid=17158329|bibcode=2006Sci...314.1603A }}</ref>  Modelling offers an enormously useful tool for anticipating future syndemics, including eco-syndemic, based on information about the spread of various diseases across the planet and the consequent co-infections and disease interactions that will result.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Herring D.

Unlike other life-table population models, PopMod is designed to not assume the statistical independence of the diseases of interest.  The PopMod has several intended purposes, including describing the time evolution of population health for standard demographic purposes (such as estimating healthy life expectancy in a population), and providing a standard measure of effectiveness for health interventions and cost-effectiveness analysis.  PopMod is used as one of the standard tools of the World Health Organization's ([[WHO]]) CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective) program, an initiative designed to provide national health policymakers in the WHO's 14 epidemiological sub-regions around the world with findings on a range of health intervention costs and effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Lauer Jeremy |author2=R\u00f6hrich Klaus |author3=Wirth Harald |author4=Charette Claude |author5=Gribble Steve |author6=Murray Christopher | year = 2003 | title = PopMod: a longitudinal population model with two interacting disease states | journal = Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 6 | pmc=156025 | pmid=12773215|doi=10.1186/1478-7547-1-6 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough in Merrill Singer's conceptual work on syndemics the study of disease interaction is a central issue, most empirically based research studies have not used appropriate statistical models to do so.

There is a need to identify all of the ways, directly and indirectly, that diseases can interact and have, as a result, enhanced impact on human health. Third there is a need for the development of an '''eco-syndemic''' understanding of the ways in which [[global warming]] contributes to the spread of diseases and new disease interactions.\nThere is a need for a better understanding of how public health systems and communities can best respond to and limit the health consequences of syndemics. Systems are needed to monitor the emergence of syndemics and to allow early medical and public health responses to lessen their impact. Systematic ethno-epidemiological surveillance with populations subject to multiple social stressors must be one component of such a monitoring system.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Endemic (epidemiology)|Endemic]]\n* [[List of epidemics]]\n* [[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Books===\n* Marshall, Mac 2013 ''Drinking Smoke: The Tobacco Syndemic in Oceania.''

A major part of Tamil performing arts is its classical form of dance, the [[Bharatanatyam]], whereas the popular forms are known as [[Koothu]]. Classical Tamil music is dominated by the [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] genre, while [[gaana]] and [[dappan koothu]] are also popular genres.\n\nAlthough most Tamil people are [[Hindu]]s, many (especially those in the rural areas) practice what is considered to be [[Dravidian folk religion]], venerating a [[Village deities of Tamil Nadu|plethora of village deities]], while a sizeable number are [[Tamil Muslims|Muslims]] and [[Christians]]. A small [[Tamil Jain|Jain]] community survives from the classical period as well. [[Tamil cuisine]] is informed by varied vegetarian and non-vegetarian items usually spiced with locally available spices. The [[Ancient Tamil music|music]], the temple architecture and the stylised sculptures favoured by the Tamil people as in their [[Ancient Tamil country|ancient nation]] are still being learnt and practised.

Epigraphic evidence of an ethnicity termed as such is found in ancient Sri Lanka where a number of inscriptions have come to light datable from the 6th to the 5th century BCE mentioning ''Damela'' or ''Dameda'' persons. The well-known [[Hathigumpha inscription]] of the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] ruler [[Kharavela]] refers to a ''T(ra)mira samghata'' (Confederacy of Tamil rulers) dated to 150 BCE. It also mentions that the league of Tamil kingdoms had been in existence 113 years before then.<ref name=KI157/> In [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] in present-day [[Andhra Pradesh]] there is an inscription referring to a ''Dhamila-vaniya'' (Tamil trader) datable to the 3rd century CE.<ref name=KI157/> Another inscription of about the same time in [[Nagarjunakonda]] seems to refer to a ''Damila''. A third inscription in [[Kanheri Caves]] refers to a ''Dhamila-gharini'' (Tamil house-holder). In the [[Buddhist]] [[Jataka]] story known as ''Akiti Jataka'' there is a mention to ''Damila-rattha'' (Tamil dynasty).

He then defeated Kopperunjinga, the Kadava chieftain, and turned him into a vassal. The Pandya then turned his attention to the north and annexed Kanchi by killing the Telugu chief Vijaya Gandagopala.

The well-known [[Hathigumpha inscription]] of the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] ruler [[Kharavela]] refers to a ''T(ra)mira samghata'' (Confederacy of Tamil rulers) dated to 150 BCE. It also mentions that the league of Tamil kingdoms had been in existence 113 years before then.<ref name=KI157/> In [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] in present-day [[Andhra Pradesh]] there is an inscription referring to a ''Dhamila-vaniya'' (Tamil trader) datable to the 3rd century CE.<ref name=KI157/> Another inscription of about the same time in [[Nagarjunakonda]] seems to refer to a ''Damila''. A third inscription in [[Kanheri Caves]] refers to a ''Dhamila-gharini'' (Tamil house-holder). In the [[Buddhist]] [[Jataka]] story known as ''Akiti Jataka'' there is a mention to ''Damila-rattha'' (Tamil dynasty).
