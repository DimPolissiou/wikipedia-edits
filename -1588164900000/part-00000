Adorno criticizes Wagner's having bated his conductor Herman Levi so that he would seem to bear the responsibility for Wagner's subsequent insulting dismissal of him.

One can apply this theory to any crime including and especially sexual assault. Nils Christie, a Norwegian criminology professor, has been theorizing about the concept of the ideal victim since the 1980s. In his research he gives two examples, one of an old woman who is attacked on her way home from visiting her family and the other of a man who is attacked at a bar by someone he knew. He describes the old woman as an ideal victim because she could not avoid being in the location that she was, she did not know her attacker, and she could not fight off her attacker. The man, however, could have avoided being at a bar, knew his attacker, and should have been able to fight off his attacker, being younger and a man.<ref name=\"Christie 1986 17\u201330\">{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Nils|title=The Ideal Victim|publisher=Macmillan Press|date=1986|location=London|pages=17\u201330|language=English}}</ref>\n\nWhen applying the ideal victim theory to sexual assault victims, often judicial proceedings define an ideal victim as one who resists their attacker and exercises caution in risky situations, despite law reforms to extinguish these fallacious requirements.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gotell|first=Lise|title=Rethinking Affirmative Consent in Canadian Sexual Assault Law: Neoliberal Sexual Subjects and Risky Women|journal=Akron Law Review|volume=41|issue=4|pages=865\u2013898|publisher=Akron University Press|location=Akron|date=2008|url=https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/akronlawreview/vol41/iss4/3/}}</ref> When victims are not ideal they are at risk for being blamed for their attack because they are not considered real victims of rape.

A victim who intimately knows their attacker is also not considered an ideal victim. An example of a sexual assault victim who is not ideal is a prostitute because they lead a high risk lifestyle. The perception is that these behaviors discount the credibility of a sexual assault victim's claim or that the behaviors and associations create the mistaken assumption of consent. Some of or all of the blame of the assault is then placed on these victims, and so they are not worthy of having their case presented in court. These perceptions persist in court rulings despite a shift in laws favoring affirmative consent- meaning that the participants in a sexual activity give a verbal affirmation rather than one participant who neither answers negatively nor positively. In other words, affirmative consent is yes means yes, no means no and no verbal answer also means no.<ref name=\"Randall 2010 397\u2013434\">{{cite journal|last=Randall|first=Melanie|title= Sexual Assault Law, Credibility, and \"Ideal Victims\": Consent, Resistance, and Victim Blaming|journal=Canadian Journal of Women and the Law|volume=22|issue=2|pages=397\u2013434|date=2010|doi=10.3138/cjwl.22.2.397|ssrn=1742077}}</ref>\n\nA study focusing on the help-seeking process of underage victims of sexual violence established that the ideal victim stereotype played a pivotal part in others\u2019 attitudes towards the victim.

A recent example of Western victim blaming would be a civil trial held in 2013 where the Los Angeles School District blamed a 14-year-old girl for the sexual abuse she endured from her middle school teacher. The District's lawyer argued that the minor was responsible for the prevention of the abuse, putting the entire fault on the victim and exempting the perpetrator of any responsibility. Despite his efforts to convince the court that the victim must be blamed, the ruling stated that no minor student that has been sexually assaulted by his or her teacher is responsible for the prevention of that sexual assault.<ref>{{Cite web|title = JUDGE: School district 'wrong' to blame student for having sex with teacher EAGnews.org|url = http://eagnews.org/judge-school-district-wrong-to-blame-student-for-sex-with-teacher/|website = eagnews.org |accessdate=26 September 2016|date = 17 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Opposing views==\n[[Roy Baumeister]], a social and personality psychologist, argued that blaming the victim is not necessarily always fallacious. He argued that showing the victim's possible role in an altercation may be contrary to typical explanations of violence and cruelty, which incorporate the trope of the innocent victim. According to Baumeister, in the classic telling of \"the myth of pure evil,\" the innocent, well-meaning victims are going about their business when they are suddenly assaulted by wicked, malicious evildoers. Baumeister describes the situation as a possible distortion by both the perpetrator and the victim; the perpetrator may minimize the offense while the victim maximizes it, and so accounts of the incident shouldn't be immediately taken as objective truths.\n\nIn context, Baumeister refers to the common behavior of the aggressor seeing themselves as more of the \"victim\" than the abused, justifying a horrific act by way of their \"moral complexity\". This usually stems from an \"excessive sensitivity\" to insults, which he finds as a consistent pattern in abusive husbands. Essentially, the abuse the perpetrator administers is generally excessive, in comparison to the act/acts that they claim as to have provoked them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumeister|first=Roy|title=Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty|year=1999|publisher=Holt|isbn=978-0-8050-7165-8}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Horseshoe theory and nonpolarized views==\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2019}}\nSome scholars make the argument that some of the attitudes that are described as victim blaming and the victimologies that are said to counteract them are both extreme and similar to each other, an example of the [[horseshoe theory]]. For instance, they argue that the claim that \"women wearing provocative clothing cause rape\" is as demeaning to men as it is to women as depicting men as incapable of controlling their sexual desire is misandrist and denies men full agency, while also arguing that the generalization that women do not lie about rape (or any generalization about women not doing some things because of their gender) is misogynist by its implicit assumption that women act by simple default action modes which is incompatible with full agency. These scholars argue that it is important to impartially assess the evidence in each criminal trial individually and that any generalization based on statistics would change the situation from one where the control of evidence makes false reporting difficult to one where lack of individual control of the alleged crime makes it easier to file false reports and that statistics collected in the former situation would not be possible to apply to the latter situation. While the scholars make a distinction between actual victim blaming and [[rule by law]] that they consider to be falsely lumped with victim blaming in radical feminist rhetorics, they also advocate more protection from ad hominem questions to alleged victims about past life history and that the questions should focus on what is relevant for the specific alleged crime. They also cite examples that they consider to be cases of the horseshoe theory applied to the question of victim blaming. This includes cases in which psychologists who have testified on behalf of the prosecution in trials in which breast size have been used as a measure of female age when classifying pornographic cartoons as child pornography and been praised by feminists for it, and later the same psychologists have used the same psychological arguments when testifying on behalf of the defense in statutory rape cases and getting the defendant acquitted by claiming that the victim's breasts looked like those of an adult woman (considered by these scholars to be victim blaming based on appearance) and been praised by men's rights groups for it. It also includes the possibility that biopsychiatric models that consider sexual criminality hereditary and that are advocated by some feminists may blame victims of incest abuse for being genetically related to their abusers and thereby dissuading them from reporting abuse.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-kSUlHgB2m4C |title = Criminal Behavior: Theories, Typologies and Criminal Justice|isbn = 9781412904872|last1 = Helfgott|first1 = Jacqueline B.|date = 2008}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2019}}<ref>{{Cite book | doi=10.4324/9781315264868 | title=Restorative Justice: Ideals and Realities| year=2017| last1=Gavrielides| first1=Theo| isbn=9781315264868}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOther analysts of victim blaming discourse who neither support most of the phenomena that are described as victim blaming nor most of the measures that are marketed as countermeasures against such point at the existence of other ways of discovering and punishing crimes with victims besides the victim reporting the crime. Not only are there police patrols and possible eyewitnesses, but these analysts also argue that neighbors can overhear and report crimes that take place within the house such as [[domestic violence]]. For that reason along with the possibility of many witnesses turning up over time if the crime is ongoing long term as domestic abuse is generally said to be which would make some of the witnesses likely to be considered believable, analysts of this camp of thought argue that the main problem that prevent crimes from being successfully prosecuted is offender profiling that disbelieve the capacity and/or probability of many criminals to commit the crime, rather than disbelief or blaming of victim reports. These analysts cite international comparisons that show that the percentage of male on female cases in the statistics of successfully prosecuted domestic violence is not higher in countries that apply gender feminist theories about patriarchal structures than in countries that apply supposedly antifeminist evolutionary psychology profiling of sex differences in aggressiveness, impulse control and empathy, arguing that the criminal justice system prioritizing cases in which they believe the suspect most likely to be guilty makes evolutionary psychology at least as responsible as gender feminism for leaving domestic violence cases with female offenders undiscovered no matter if the victim is male or female.

One can apply this theory to any crime including and especially sexual assault. Nils Christie, a Norwegian criminology professor, has been theorizing about the concept of the ideal victim since the 1980s. In his research he gives two examples, one of an old woman who is attacked on her way home from visiting her family and the other of a man who is attacked at a bar by someone he knew. He describes the old woman as an ideal victim because she could not avoid being in the location that she was, she did not know her attacker, and she could not fight off her attacker. The man, however, could have avoided being at a bar, knew his attacker, and should have been able to fight off his attacker, being younger and a man.<ref name=\"Christie 1986 17\u201330\">{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Nils|title=The Ideal Victim|publisher=Macmillan Press|date=1986|location=London|pages=17\u201330|language=English}}</ref>\n\nWhen applying the ideal victim theory to sexual assault victims, often judicial proceedings define an ideal victim as one who resists their attacker and exercises caution in risky situations, despite law reforms to extinguish these fallacious requirements.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gotell|first=Lise|title=Rethinking Affirmative Consent in Canadian Sexual Assault Law: Neoliberal Sexual Subjects and Risky Women|journal=Akron Law Review|volume=41|issue=4|pages=865\u2013898|publisher=Akron University Press|location=Akron|date=2008|url=https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/akronlawreview/vol41/iss4/3/}}</ref> When victims are not ideal they are at risk for being blamed for their attack because they are not considered real victims of rape.

A victim who intimately knows their attacker is also not considered an ideal victim. An example of a sexual assault victim who is not ideal is a prostitute because they lead a high risk lifestyle. The perception is that these behaviors discount the credibility of a sexual assault victim's claim or that the behaviors and associations create the mistaken assumption of consent. Some of or all of the blame of the assault is then placed on these victims, and so they are not worthy of having their case presented in court. These perceptions persist in court rulings despite a shift in laws favoring affirmative consent- meaning that the participants in a sexual activity give a verbal affirmation rather than one participant who neither answers negatively nor positively. In other words, affirmative consent is yes means yes, no means no and no verbal answer also means no.<ref name=\"Randall 2010 397\u2013434\">{{cite journal|last=Randall|first=Melanie|title= Sexual Assault Law, Credibility, and \"Ideal Victims\": Consent, Resistance, and Victim Blaming|journal=Canadian Journal of Women and the Law|volume=22|issue=2|pages=397\u2013434|date=2010|doi=10.3138/cjwl.22.2.397|ssrn=1742077}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to an ideal victim, there must be an ideal perpetrator for a crime to be considered ideal. The ideal attacker does not know their victim and is a completely non-sympathetic figure- one who is considered sub-human, an individual lacking morals. An attacker that knows their victim is not considered an ideal attacker, nor is someone who seems morally ordinary.<ref name=\"Christie 1986 17\u201330\"/> Cases of intimate partner violence are not considered ideal because the victim knows their attacker.

Victim blaming is common around the world, especially in cultures where it is socially acceptable and advised to treat certain groups of people as lesser. For example, in Somalia victims of sexual abuse consistently endure social [[Ostracism|ostracization]] and harassment.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} One specific example is the kidnapping and rape of 14-year old Fatima: when the police arrived, both Fatima and her rapist were arrested.

A recent example of Western victim blaming would be a civil trial held in 2013 where the Los Angeles School District blamed a 14-year-old girl for the sexual abuse she endured from her middle school teacher. The District's lawyer argued that the minor was responsible for the prevention of the abuse, putting the entire fault on the victim and exempting the perpetrator of any responsibility. Despite his efforts to convince the court that the victim must be blamed, the ruling stated that no minor student that has been sexually assaulted by his or her teacher is responsible for the prevention of that sexual assault.<ref>{{Cite web|title = JUDGE: School district 'wrong' to blame student for having sex with teacher EAGnews.org|url = http://eagnews.org/judge-school-district-wrong-to-blame-student-for-sex-with-teacher/|website = eagnews.org |accessdate=26 September 2016|date = 17 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Opposing views==\n[[Roy Baumeister]], a social and personality psychologist, argued that blaming the victim is not necessarily always fallacious. He argued that showing the victim's possible role in an altercation may be contrary to typical explanations of violence and cruelty, which incorporate the trope of the innocent victim. According to Baumeister, in the classic telling of \"the myth of pure evil,\" the innocent, well-meaning victims are going about their business when they are suddenly assaulted by wicked, malicious evildoers. Baumeister describes the situation as a possible distortion by both the perpetrator and the victim; the perpetrator may minimize the offense while the victim maximizes it, and so accounts of the incident shouldn't be immediately taken as objective truths.\n\nIn context, Baumeister refers to the common behavior of the aggressor seeing themselves as more of the \"victim\" than the abused, justifying a horrific act by way of their \"moral complexity\". This usually stems from an \"excessive sensitivity\" to insults, which he finds as a consistent pattern in abusive husbands. Essentially, the abuse the perpetrator administers is generally excessive, in comparison to the act/acts that they claim as to have provoked them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumeister|first=Roy|title=Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty|year=1999|publisher=Holt|isbn=978-0-8050-7165-8}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Horseshoe theory and nonpolarized views==\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2019}}\nSome scholars make the argument that some of the attitudes that are described as victim blaming and the victimologies that are said to counteract them are both extreme and similar to each other, an example of the [[horseshoe theory]]. For instance, they argue that the claim that \"women wearing provocative clothing cause rape\" is as demeaning to men as it is to women as depicting men as incapable of controlling their sexual desire is misandrist and denies men full agency, while also arguing that the generalization that women do not lie about rape (or any generalization about women not doing some things because of their gender) is misogynist by its implicit assumption that women act by simple default action modes which is incompatible with full agency. These scholars argue that it is important to impartially assess the evidence in each criminal trial individually and that any generalization based on statistics would change the situation from one where the control of evidence makes false reporting difficult to one where lack of individual control of the alleged crime makes it easier to file false reports and that statistics collected in the former situation would not be possible to apply to the latter situation. While the scholars make a distinction between actual victim blaming and [[rule by law]] that they consider to be falsely lumped with victim blaming in radical feminist rhetorics, they also advocate more protection from ad hominem questions to alleged victims about past life history and that the questions should focus on what is relevant for the specific alleged crime. They also cite examples that they consider to be cases of the horseshoe theory applied to the question of victim blaming. This includes cases in which psychologists who have testified on behalf of the prosecution in trials in which breast size have been used as a measure of female age when classifying pornographic cartoons as child pornography and been praised by feminists for it, and later the same psychologists have used the same psychological arguments when testifying on behalf of the defense in statutory rape cases and getting the defendant acquitted by claiming that the victim's breasts looked like those of an adult woman (considered by these scholars to be victim blaming based on appearance) and been praised by men's rights groups for it. It also includes the possibility that biopsychiatric models that consider sexual criminality hereditary and that are advocated by some feminists may blame victims of incest abuse for being genetically related to their abusers and thereby dissuading them from reporting abuse.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-kSUlHgB2m4C |title = Criminal Behavior: Theories, Typologies and Criminal Justice|isbn = 9781412904872|last1 = Helfgott|first1 = Jacqueline B.|date = 2008}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2019}}<ref>{{Cite book | doi=10.4324/9781315264868 | title=Restorative Justice: Ideals and Realities| year=2017| last1=Gavrielides| first1=Theo| isbn=9781315264868}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOther analysts of victim blaming discourse who neither support most of the phenomena that are described as victim blaming nor most of the measures that are marketed as countermeasures against such point at the existence of other ways of discovering and punishing crimes with victims besides the victim reporting the crime. Not only are there police patrols and possible eyewitnesses, but these analysts also argue that neighbors can overhear and report crimes that take place within the house such as [[domestic violence]]. For that reason along with the possibility of many witnesses turning up over time if the crime is ongoing long term as domestic abuse is generally said to be which would make some of the witnesses likely to be considered believable, analysts of this camp of thought argue that the main problem that prevent crimes from being successfully prosecuted is offender profiling that disbelieve the capacity and/or probability of many criminals to commit the crime, rather than disbelief or blaming of victim reports. These analysts cite international comparisons that show that the percentage of male on female cases in the statistics of successfully prosecuted domestic violence is not higher in countries that apply gender feminist theories about patriarchal structures than in countries that apply supposedly antifeminist evolutionary psychology profiling of sex differences in aggressiveness, impulse control and empathy, arguing that the criminal justice system prioritizing cases in which they believe the suspect most likely to be guilty makes evolutionary psychology at least as responsible as gender feminism for leaving domestic violence cases with female offenders undiscovered no matter if the victim is male or female. The analysts argue that many problems that are often attributed to victim blaming are instead due to offender profiling, and suggest randomized investigations instead of psychological profiling of suspected offenders.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Patricia L. |last=Brantingham|first2= Paul J.|last2= Brantingham |chapter=Notes on the Geometry of Crime| title=Principles of Geographical Offender Profiling| year=2017| editor-last1=Canter| editor-first1=David| isbn=9781315246086|orig-year=1981;1993|doi=10.4324/9781315246086}}</ref><ref>{{Cite thesis | hdl=10829/6873 |title = A Hopeful Rubicon: The Logic within Criminal Profiling|date = 2015-05-07|type = Thesis|last=Ward|first= Dakota James}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nA myth holds that Jews went passively \"[[like sheep to the slaughter]]\" during the [[Holocaust]], which is considered by many writers, including [[Emil Fackenheim]], to be a form of victim blaming.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Middleton-Kaplan |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Henry |editor1-first=Patrick |title=Jewish Resistance Against the Nazis |date=2014 |publisher=[[Catholic University of America Press]] |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=9780813225890 |pages=8, 21 |ref=harv |chapter=The Myth of Jewish Passivity}}</ref> [[Secondary antisemitism]] is a type of [[antisemitism]] caused by non-Jewish Europeans' attempts to shift [[responsibility for the Holocaust|blame for the Holocaust]] onto the Jews, often summed up by the claim that \"The Germans will never forgive the Jews for [[Auschwitz]].\"<ref>{{cite web |first1=Benjamin|last= Weinthal |title=Non-Islamic anti-Semitism in Europe |url=https://www.jewishpolicycenter.org/2014/08/31/anti-semitism-europe/ |publisher=[[Jewish Policy Center]] |accessdate=5 December 2018 |date=31 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the issue of victim blaming has gained notoriety and become widely recognized in the media, particularly in the context of feminism, as women have often been blamed for behaving in ways that encourage harassment.\n\n===United States===\nIn a case that became infamous in 2011, an 11-year-old female rape victim who suffered repeated [[gang rape]]s in [[Cleveland, Texas]], was accused by a defense attorney of being a seductress who lured men to their doom.<ref name=\"slate1\">{{cite magazine|last=Adams |first=Sam |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/11/29/cleveland_texas_rape_case_defense_attorney_calls_pre_teen_victim_a_spider.html |title=Cleveland, Texas rape case: Defense attorney calls pre-teen victim a spider, but that's his job |magazine=Slate |date=29 November 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref>  \"Like [[The Spider and the Fly (poem)|the spider and the fly]].

After being kicked and spat on by the group, Leigh left the party. Her naked body was found in the sand dunes nearby the following morning, with severe genital damage and a crushed skull. Leigh's murder received considerable attention in the media. Initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder, media attention later concentrated more on the lack of parental supervision and the drugs and alcohol at the party, and on Leigh's sexuality. The media coverage of the murder has been cited as an example of victim blaming.<ref name=carrington>{{cite book |last=Carrington |first=Kerry |date=24 July 1998 |title=Who Killed Leigh Leigh?
