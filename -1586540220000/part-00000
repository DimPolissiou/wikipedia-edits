The crew consisted of five [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]s, one [[payload specialist]], and a civilian schoolteacher. The mission carried the designation [[STS-51-L]] and was the tenth flight for the ''Challenger'' [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter]]. \n\nThe spacecraft disintegrated over the [[Atlantic Ocean]], off the coast of [[Cape Canaveral, Florida|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], at 11:39{{nbsp}}a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (16:39 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). The disintegration of the vehicle began after a joint in its right [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] (SRB) failed at liftoff. The failure was caused by the failure of [[O-ring]] seals used in the joint that were not designed to handle the unusually cold conditions that existed at this launch. The seals' failure caused a breach in the SRB joint, allowing pressurized burning gas from within the solid rocket motor to reach the outside and impinge upon the adjacent SRB aft field joint attachment hardware and [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank]]. This led to the separation of the right-hand SRB's aft field joint attachment and the [[Structural integrity and failure|structural failure]] of the external tank. [[Aerodynamic]] forces broke up the orbiter.\n\nThe crew compartment and many other vehicle fragments were eventually recovered from the ocean floor after a lengthy search and recovery operation. The exact timing of the death of the crew is unknown; several crew members are known to have survived the initial breakup of the spacecraft. The shuttle had no escape system,{{efn|name=\"n1\"|The first two Space Shuttle orbiters, ''Enterprise'' and ''Columbia'', originally had [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Ejection seat|ejection seats]] installed in the flight deck for the pilot and co-pilot in the initial test missions.

The pilot's ejection seats were disabled after [[STS-4]] and subsequently removed by the launch of [[STS-61]] on January 12, 1986, and were never installed on the remaining four orbiters.}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Shuttle Carrying New Escape System|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=October 23, 2016|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Shuttle-Carrying-New-Escape-System/id-50c3be84147652b242204463a5b036d5|date=September 27, 1988|last1=Tolley|first1=Laura}}</ref> and the impact of the crew compartment at [[terminal velocity]] with the ocean surface was too violent to be survivable.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abramson |first=Rudy |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 8, 1988 |title=Shuttle to Have Device Enabling Crew to Escape |quote=Studies in the wake of the Challenger disaster showed that astronauts probably would not survive an ocean ditching{{nbsp}}...

The Rogers Commission found NASA's [[organizational culture]] and decision-making processes had been key contributing factors to the accident,<ref>{{cite web | author=Outer Space Universe| title=Remembering the Challenger Shuttle Explosion: A Disaster 25 Years Ago | url=http://www.outerspaceuniverse.org/remembering-challenger-shuttle-explosion-25-years.html | accessdate=January 28, 2011}}</ref> with the agency violating its own safety rules. NASA managers had known since 1977 that contractor [[Thiokol|Morton-Thiokol]]'s design of the SRBs contained a potentially catastrophic flaw in the O-rings, but they had failed to address this problem properly. NASA managers also disregarded warnings from engineers about the dangers of launching posed by the low temperatures of that morning, and failed to adequately report these technical concerns to their superiors.\n\nApproximately 17 percent of the American population witnessed the launch on live television broadcast because of the presence of high school teacher [[Christa McAuliffe]], who would have been the first [[Teacher in Space Project|teacher in space]]. Media coverage of the accident was extensive; one study reported that 85&nbsp;percent of Americans surveyed had heard the news within an hour of the accident.<ref>{{cite web|title=On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger Exploded 76 Seconds After Launch (Video) |url=http://www.viralvideobox.com/on-january-28-1986-space-shuttle-challenger-exploded-76-seconds-after-launch-video/|work=Viral Video Box|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> The ''Challenger'' disaster has been used as a case study in many discussions of engineering safety and workplace ethics.\n\n==O-ring concerns==\n[[File:STS-51-L - Space Shuttle Challenger on the Crawler-Transporter.jpg|thumb|''Challenger'' being carried atop a [[Crawler-transporter]] on the way to the launch pad]]\n\nEach of the Space Shuttle's two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) was constructed of seven sections, six of which were permanently joined in pairs at the factory. For each flight, the four resulting segments were then assembled in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC), with three field joints. The factory joints were sealed with asbestos-silica insulation applied over the joint, while each field joint was sealed with two rubber O-rings. After the destruction of ''Challenger'', the number of O-rings per field joint was increased to three.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solid Rocket Motor Joint Reliability|url=http://engineer.jpl.nasa.gov/practices/1257.pdf|publisher=NASA Engineering}}</ref> The seals of all of the SRB joints were required to contain the hot, high-pressure gases produced by the burning solid propellant inside, thus forcing them out of the nozzle at the aft end of each rocket.\n\nDuring the [[Space Shuttle design process]], a [[McDonnell Douglas]] report in September 1971 discussed the safety record of solid rockets. While a safe abort was possible after most types of failures, one was especially dangerous: a burnthrough by hot gases of the rocket's casing. The report stated that \"if burnthrough occurs adjacent to [liquid hydrogen/oxygen] tank or orbiter, timely sensing may not be feasible and abort not possible\", accurately foreshadowing the ''Challenger'' accident.<ref name=\"heppenheimer1998\">{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA publication SP-4221 | author=Heppenheimer, T.

As originally designed by Thiokol, the O-ring joints in the SRBs were supposed to close more tightly due to forces generated at ignition, but a 1977 test showed that when pressurized water was used to simulate the effects of booster combustion, the metal parts bent away from each other, opening a gap through which gases could leak. This phenomenon, known as \"joint rotation\", caused a momentary drop in air pressure. This made it possible for combustion gases to erode the O-rings. In the event of widespread erosion, a flame path could develop, causing the joint to burst\u2014which would have destroyed the booster and the shuttle.<ref name=\"Major Malfunction\">{{cite book | last=McConnell | first=Malcolm | date=1987 | title=Challenger: A Major Malfunction | location=Garden City, NY | publisher=Doubleday | isbn=978-0-385-23877-9 | url=https://archive.org/details/challengermajorm00mcco }}</ref>{{rp|118}}\n\nEngineers at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] wrote to the manager of the Solid Rocket Booster project, George Hardy, on several occasions suggesting that Thiokol's field joint design was unacceptable. For example, one engineer suggested that joint rotation would render the secondary O-ring useless, but Hardy did not forward these memos to Thiokol, and the field joints were accepted for flight in 1980.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\">{{cite web |author=Rogers Commission |title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Chapter VI: An Accident Rooted in History |date=June 6, 1986 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm }}</ref>\n\nEvidence of serious O-ring erosion was present as early as the second space shuttle mission, [[STS-2]], which was flown by ''Columbia''. Contrary to NASA regulations, the Marshall Center did not report this problem to senior management at NASA, but opted to keep the problem within their reporting channels with Thiokol. Even after the O-rings were redesignated as \"Criticality 1\" \u2014 meaning that their failure would result in the destruction of the Orbiter, no one at Marshall suggested that the shuttles be grounded until the flaw could be fixed.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" />\n\nAfter the 1984 launch of [[STS-41-D]], flown by ''Discovery'', the first occurrence of hot gas \"blow-by\" was discovered beyond the primary O-ring. In the post-flight analysis, [[Thiokol]] engineers found that the amount of blow-by was relatively small and had not impinged upon the secondary O-ring, and concluded that for future flights, the damage was an acceptable risk. However, after the ''Challenger'' disaster, [[Thiokol]] engineer Brian Russell identified this event as the first \"big red flag\" regarding O-ring safety.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian/page/143 143]\u201344|url=https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nBy 1985, with seven of nine shuttle launches that year using boosters displaying O-ring erosion or hot gas blow-by,<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian/page/153 153]|url=https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian|url-access=registration}}</ref> Marshall and Thiokol realized that they had a potentially catastrophic problem on their hands. Perhaps most concerning was the launch of [[STS-51-B]] in April 1985, flown by ''Challenger'', in which the worst O-ring damage to date was discovered in post-flight analysis. The primary O-ring of the left nozzle had been eroded so extensively that it had failed to seal, and for the first time hot gases had eroded the secondary O-ring.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian|url-access=registration}}</ref> They began the process of redesigning the joint with three inches (76&nbsp;mm) of additional steel around the tang. This tang would grip the inner face of the joint and prevent it from rotating. They did not call for a halt to shuttle flights until the joints could be redesigned, but rather treated the problem as an acceptable flight risk. For example, Lawrence Mulloy, Marshall's manager for the SRB project since 1982, issued and waived launch constraints for six consecutive flights. Thiokol even went as far as to persuade NASA to declare the O-ring problem \"closed\".<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" /> [[Donald J. Kutyna|Donald Kutyna]], a member of the [[Rogers Commission]], later likened this situation to an airline permitting one of its planes to continue to fly despite evidence that one of its wings was about to fall off.\n\n==Pre-launch conditions==\n\n===Delays===\n''Challenger'' was originally set to launch from [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida at 14:42 [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time (EST)]] on Wednesday, January 22, 1986. Delays in the previous mission, [[STS-61-C]], caused the launch date to be moved to January 23 and then to January 24. The launch was rescheduled again, to Saturday, January 25, due to [[storm|bad weather]] at the [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Transoceanic abort landing|transoceanic abort landing (TAL)]] site in [[Dakar|Dakar, Senegal]]. NASA decided to use the TAL site at [[Casablanca|Casablanca, Morocco]], but because it was not equipped for night landings, the launch had to be moved to the morning. Predictions of unacceptable weather at Kennedy Space Center on January 26 caused the launch to be rescheduled for 09:37 EST on Monday, January 27.<ref>{{cite web|title=STS-51-L mission archives|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-51L.html|publisher=NASA}}</ref>\n\nThe planned January 27 launch was initially delayed due to problems with the [[Space Shuttle orbiter#Pressurized cabin|exterior access hatch]].

The Shuttle was never certified to operate in temperatures that low. The O-rings, as well as many other critical components, had no test data to support any expectation of a successful launch in such conditions.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\"/><ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/>\n\nBy mid-1985 Thiokol engineers worried that others did not share their concerns about the low temperature effects on the boosters. Engineer Bob Ebeling in October 1985 wrote a memo\u2014titled \"Help!\" so others would read it\u2014of concerns regarding low temperatures and O-rings. After the weather forecast, NASA personnel remembered Thiokol's warnings and contacted the company. When a Thiokol manager asked Ebeling about the possibility of a launch at {{convert|18|F|||}}, he answered \"[W]e're only qualified to 40\u00b0 [{{convert|40|F|disp=or||}}]{{nbsp}}... 'what business does anyone even have thinking about 18\u00b0, we're in no-man's land.'\" After his team agreed that a launch risked disaster, Thiokol immediately called NASA recommending a postponement until temperatures rose in the afternoon. NASA manager Jud Lovingood responded that Thiokol could not make the recommendation without providing a safe temperature. The company prepared for a teleconference two hours later during which it would have to justify a no-launch recommendation.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\">{{cite web | author=Chris Bergin| title=Remembering the mistakes of Challenger | url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/01/remembering-the-mistakes-of-challenger/ | work=nasaspaceflight.com | date=January 28, 2007 | accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/>\n\nAt the teleconference on the evening of January 27, Thiokol engineers and managers discussed the weather conditions with NASA managers from Kennedy Space Center and Marshall Space Flight Center. Several engineers (most notably Ebeling and [[Roger Boisjoly]]) reiterated their concerns about the effect of low temperatures on the resilience of the rubber O-rings that sealed the joints of the SRBs, and recommended a launch postponement.<ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/> They argued that they did not have enough data to determine whether the joints would properly seal if the O-rings were colder than {{convert|12|C|order=flip}}. This was an important consideration, since the SRB O-rings had been designated as a \"Criticality 1\" component, meaning that there was no backup if both the primary and secondary O-rings failed, and their failure could destroy the Orbiter and kill its crew.\n\nThiokol management initially supported its engineers' recommendation to postpone the launch, but NASA staff opposed a delay. During the conference call, Hardy told Thiokol, \"I am appalled. I am appalled by your recommendation.\" Mulloy said, \"My God, Thiokol, when do you want me to launch\u2014next April?\"<ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/> NASA believed that Thiokol's hastily prepared presentation's quality was too poor to support such a statement on flight safety.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\"/> One argument by NASA personnel contesting Thiokol's concerns was that if the primary O-ring failed, the secondary O-ring would still seal. This was unproven, and was in any case an argument that did not apply to a \"Criticality 1\" component. As astronaut [[Sally Ride]] stated when questioning NASA managers before the Rogers Commission, it is forbidden to rely on a backup for a \"Criticality 1\" component.\n\nNASA claimed that it did not know of Thiokol's earlier concerns about the effects of the cold on the O-rings, and did not understand that [[Rockwell International]], the shuttle's prime contractor, additionally viewed the large amount of ice present on the pad as a constraint to launch.\n\nAccording to Ebeling, a second conference call was scheduled with only NASA and Thiokol management, excluding the engineers. For reasons that are unclear, Thiokol management disregarded its own engineers' warnings and now recommended that the launch proceed as scheduled;<ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/><ref name=\"rogers 5\">{{cite book| author=Rogers Commission | title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|chapter= Chapter V: The Contributing Cause of The Accident | date=June 6, 1986| chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch5.htm |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> NASA did not ask why.{{r|bergin20070128}} Ebeling told his wife that night that ''Challenger'' would blow up.<ref>{{cite web | author=Ware, Doug G. | title = Engineer who warned of 1986 Challenger disaster still racked with guilt, three decades on | date=January 28, 2016 | publisher=United Press International | url = http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/01/28/Engineer-who-warned-of-1986-Challenger-disaster-still-racked-with-guilt-three-decades-on/4891454032643/ | accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKen Iliff, a former NASA Chief Scientist who had worked on the Space Shuttle Program since its first mission (and the X-15 program before that), stated this in 2004:\n{{quote | text=Not violating flight rules was something I had been taught on the X-15 program.

Ice had accumulated all over the launch pad, raising concerns that ice could damage the shuttle upon lift-off. The Kennedy Ice Team inadvertently pointed an infrared camera at the aft field joint of the right SRB and found the temperature to be only {{convert|\u221213|C|F|order=flip}}. This was believed to be the result of supercooled air blowing on the joint from the [[Liquid oxygen|liquid oxygen (LOX)]] tank vent. It was much lower than the air temperature and far below the design specifications for the O-rings. The low reading was later determined to be erroneous, the error caused by not following the temperature probe manufacturer's instructions. Tests and adjusted calculations later confirmed that the temperature of the joint was not substantially different from the ambient temperature.\n\nThe temperature on the day of the launch was far lower than had been the case with previous launches: below freezing at {{convert|\u22122.2|to|\u22121.7|C|order=flip}}; previously, the coldest launch had been at {{convert|12|C|order=flip}}. Although the Ice Team had worked through the night removing ice, engineers at Rockwell still expressed concern. Rockwell engineers watching the pad from their headquarters in [[Downey, California]], were horrified when they saw the amount of ice. They feared that during launch, ice might be shaken loose and strike the shuttle's thermal protection tiles, possibly due to the aspiration induced by the [[jet (fluid)|jet]] of [[exhaust gas]] from the SRBs. [[Rocco Petrone]], the head of Rockwell's space transportation division, and his colleagues viewed this situation as a launch constraint, and told Rockwell's managers at the Cape that Rockwell could not support a launch. Rockwell's managers at the Cape voiced their concerns in a manner that led Houston-based mission manager Arnold Aldrich to go ahead with the launch. Aldrich decided to postpone the shuttle launch by an hour to give the Ice Team time to perform another inspection. After that last inspection, during which the ice appeared to be melting, ''Challenger'' was cleared to launch at 11:38&nbsp;am EST.<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />\n{{clear right}}\n\n==January 28 launch and failure==\n{{further|STS-51-L Mission timeline}}\n\n===Liftoff and initial ascent===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2011}}\n<!-- This entire section reads like an official NASA report which I've read.

The SSMEs were liquid-fueled and could be safely shut down (and the launch aborted if necessary) until the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s (SRBs) ignited at T=0 (which was at 11:38:00.010 EST) and the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Hold-down posts|hold-down bolts]] were released with explosives, freeing the vehicle from the pad. At lift off, the three SSMEs were at 100% of their original rated performance, and began throttling up to [[Space Shuttle main engine#Engine throttle/output|104%]] under computer control. With the first vertical motion of the vehicle, the gaseous hydrogen vent arm retracted from the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank (ET)]] but failed to latch back. Review of film shot by pad cameras showed that the arm did not re-contact the vehicle, and thus it was ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident.<ref name=\"rogers n\"/> The post-launch inspection of the pad also revealed that kick springs on four of the hold-down bolts were missing, but they were similarly ruled out as a possible cause.<ref name=\"tv team\">{{cite video | people= Photo and TV Analysis Team Report| title =Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Investigation| url =https://archive.org/details/ChallengerAccidentandInvestigation| publisher=STS-51L Data and Analysis Task Force |year = 1986 | accessdate=January 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Challenger Launch and Breakup.ogv|thumb|''Challenger'' launch and breakup]]\n\nLater review of launch film showed that at T+0.678, strong puffs of dark gray smoke were emitted from the right-hand SRB near the [[aft]] strut that attached the booster to the ET. The last smoke puff occurred at about T+2.733. The last view of smoke around the strut was at T+3.375. It was later determined that these smoke puffs were caused by the opening and closing of the aft field joint of the right-hand SRB. The booster's casing had ballooned under the stress of ignition. As a result of this ballooning, the metal parts of the casing bent away from each other, opening a gap through which hot gases\u2014above {{convert|2760|C|order=flip}}\u2014leaked. This had occurred in previous launches, but each time the primary O-ring had shifted out of its groove and formed a seal. Although the SRB was not designed to function this way, it appeared to work well enough, and Morton-Thiokol changed the design specs to accommodate this process, known as [[extrusion]].\n\nWhile extrusion was taking place, hot gases leaked past (a process called \"blow-by\"), damaging the O-rings until a seal was made. Investigations by Morton-Thiokol engineers determined that the amount of damage to the O-rings was directly related to the time it took for extrusion to occur, and that cold weather, by causing the O-rings to harden, lengthened the time of extrusion. The redesigned SRB field joint used subsequent to the ''Challenger'' accident used an additional interlocking mortise and tang with a third O-ring, mitigating blow-by.\n\nOn the morning of the disaster, the primary O-ring had become so hard due to the cold that it could not seal in time. The temperature had dropped below the [[glass transition]] temperature of the O-rings. Above the glass transition temperature, the O-rings display properties of elasticity and flexibility, while below the glass transition temperature, they become rigid and brittle. The secondary O-ring was not in its seated position due to the metal bending. There was now no barrier to the gases, and both O-rings were vaporized across 70 degrees of arc. [[Aluminium oxide|Aluminum oxides]] from the burned solid propellant sealed the damaged joint, temporarily replacing the O-ring seal before flame passed through the joint.\n\nAs the vehicle cleared the tower, the SSMEs were operating at [[Space Shuttle main engine#Thrust specifications|104% of their rated maximum thrust]], and control switched from the [[Launch Control Center]] (LCC) at Kennedy to the Mission Control Center (MCC) at [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. To prevent [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] forces from structurally overloading the orbiter, at T+28 the SSMEs began throttling down to limit the velocity of the shuttle in the dense [[troposphere|lower atmosphere]], per normal operating procedure. At T+35.379, the SSMEs throttled back further to the planned 65%. Five seconds later, at about {{convert|19000|ft}}, ''Challenger'' passed through [[Mach number|Mach 1]]. At T+51.860, the SSMEs began throttling back up to 104% as the vehicle passed beyond [[max q]], the period of maximum aerodynamic pressure on the vehicle.\n\n===Plume===\n[[File:Booster Rocket Breach - GPN-2000-001425.jpg|thumb|Plume on right SRB at T+ 58.788 seconds]]\n\nBeginning at about T+37 and for 27 seconds, the shuttle experienced a series of [[Wind shear#Impact on passenger aircraft|wind shear]] events that were stronger than on any previous flight.<ref>{{cite web| author=NASA Mission Archives| title=STS-51L | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-51L.html | accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt T+58.788, a tracking film camera captured the beginnings of a [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] near the aft attach strut on the right SRB. Unknown to those on ''Challenger'' or in Houston, hot gas had begun to leak through a growing hole in one of the right-hand SRB joints. The force of the wind shear shattered the temporary oxide seal that had taken the place of the damaged O-rings, removing the last barrier to flame passing through the joint. Had it not been for the wind shear, the fortuitous oxide seal might have held through booster burnout.\n\nWithin a second, the plume became well defined and intense. Internal pressure in the right SRB began to drop because of the rapidly enlarging hole in the failed joint, and at T+60.238 there was visual evidence of flame burning through the joint and impinging on the external tank.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nAt T+64.660, the plume suddenly changed shape, indicating that a leak had begun in the [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH2) tank, located in the aft portion of the external tank. The nozzles of the main engines pivoted under computer control to compensate for the unbalanced thrust produced by the booster burn-through. The pressure in the shuttle's external LH2 tank began to drop at T+66.764, indicating the effect of the leak.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nAt this stage the situation still seemed normal both to the crew and to flight controllers. At T+68, the [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]] [[Richard O. Covey]] informed the crew that they were \"go at throttle up\"<!-- the grammar is correct, the full phrasing used in some other shuttle missions was \"you are go at throttle up\" -->, and Commander [[Dick Scobee]] confirmed, \"Roger, go at throttle up\"; this was the last communication from ''Challenger'' on the air-to-ground loop.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\n===Vehicle breakup===\n[[File:Challenger (STS-51-L) Tracking Camera.webm|thumb|A tracking camera located north of the pad captured the SRB plume as it burned through the external tank.

At the same time, the right SRB rotated about the forward attach strut, and struck the [[Space Shuttle external tank#Intertank|intertank]] structure. The external tank at this point suffered a complete structural failure, the LH2 and LOX tanks rupturing, mixing, and igniting, creating a fireball that enveloped the whole stack.<ref name=\"kerthan\">{{cite web| author=Than, Ker| title=5 Myths of Challenger Shuttle Disaster Debunked | date=January 7, 2011| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/01/pictures/110127-challenger-disaster-space-shuttle-25th-anniversary-myths-science-nasa/| accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe breakup of the vehicle began at T+73.162 seconds and at an altitude of {{convert|48000|ft|km}}.<ref name=\"kerwin\">{{cite web|last=Kerwin | first=Joseph P. |authorlink=Joseph P.

The two SRBs, which could withstand greater aerodynamic loads, separated from the ET and continued in uncontrolled powered flight. The SRB casings were made of half-inch-thick (12.7&nbsp;mm) steel and were much stronger than the orbiter and ET; thus, both SRBs survived the breakup of the space shuttle stack, even though the right SRB was still suffering the effects of the joint burn-through that had set the destruction of ''Challenger'' in motion.<ref name=\"tv team\" />\n\nThe more robustly constructed crew cabin also survived the breakup of the launch vehicle, as it was designed to survive {{convert|20|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} while the estimated pressure it had been subjected to during orbiter breakup was only about {{convert|4\u20135|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}.

Television screens showed a cloud of smoke and water vapor (the product of hydrogen+oxygen combustion) where ''Challenger'' had been, with pieces of debris falling toward the ocean. At about T+89, flight director [[Jay Greene]] prompted his [[Flight controller#Flight Dynamics Officer .28FDO or FIDO.29 2|Flight Dynamics Officer]] (FIDO) for information. FIDO responded that \"the {{bracket|[[radar]]}} filter has discreting sources\", a further indication that ''Challenger'' had broken into multiple pieces. Moments later, the [[Ground Controller|ground controller]] reported \"negative contact (and) loss of [[Telecommunications link#Downlink|downlink]]\" of radio and telemetry data from ''Challenger''. Greene ordered his team to \"watch your data carefully\" and look for any sign that the Orbiter had escaped.\n\n[[File:Challenger Mission Control.ogv|thumb|Mission Control during the liftoff of ''Challenger'' (STS-51-L)]]\n\nAt T+110.250, the range safety officer (RSO) at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] sent radio signals that activated the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Range safety system|range safety system]]'s \"destruct\" packages on board both solid rocket boosters.

The forces involved at this stage were probably insufficient to cause major injury.\n\nAt least some of the crew were alive and at least briefly conscious after the breakup, as three of the four recovered [[Personal Egress Air Packs]] (PEAPs) on the flight deck were found to have been activated.<ref>[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/kerwin.txt Joseph P.

Mike Mullane wrote, \"These switches were protected with lever locks that required them to be pulled outward against a spring force before they could be moved to a new position.\" Later tests established that neither force of the explosion nor the impact with the ocean could have moved them, indicating that Smith made the switch changes, presumably in a futile attempt to restore electrical power to the cockpit after the crew cabin detached from the rest of the orbiter.<ref name=Mullane>{{Cite book | last = Mullane | first = Mike | authorlink = Mike Mullane | title = Riding Rockets: The Outrageous Tales of a Space Shuttle Astronaut | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year = 2006 | page = 245 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8X7ceB3QEWkC&pg=PA245 | isbn = 978-0-7432-7682-5 }}</ref>\n\nWhether the crew members remained conscious long after the breakup is unknown, and largely depends on whether the detached crew cabin maintained pressure integrity. If it did not, the time of useful consciousness at that altitude is just a few seconds; the PEAPs supplied only unpressurized air, and hence would not have helped the crew to retain consciousness. If, on the other hand, the cabin was not depressurized or only slowly depressurizing, they may have been conscious for the entire fall until impact. Recovery of the cabin found that the middeck floor had not suffered buckling or tearing, as would result from a rapid decompression, thus providing some evidence that the depressurization may not have happened suddenly.\n\nNASA routinely trained shuttle crews for splashdown events, but the cabin hit the ocean surface at roughly {{convert|207|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with an estimated deceleration at impact of well over 200 [[g-force|g]], far beyond the structural limits of the crew compartment or crew survivability levels, and far greater than almost any automobile, aircraft, or train accident. The crew would have been torn from their seats and killed instantly by the extreme impact force.<ref name=\"kerwin\"/>\n\nOn July 28, 1986, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight, former astronaut [[Richard H. Truly]], released a report on the deaths of the crew from the director of Space and Life Sciences at the [[Johnson Space Center]], [[Joseph P. Kerwin]]. A medical doctor and former astronaut, Kerwin was a veteran of the 1973 [[Skylab 2]] mission. According to the Kerwin Report:\n\n{{quote|The findings are inconclusive. The impact of the crew compartment with the ocean surface was so violent that evidence of damage occurring in the seconds which followed the disintegration was masked. Our final conclusions are:\n* the cause of death of the ''Challenger'' astronauts cannot be positively determined;\n* the forces to which the crew were exposed during Orbiter breakup were probably not sufficient to cause death or serious injury; and\n* the crew possibly, but not certainly, lost consciousness in the seconds following Orbiter breakup due to in-flight loss of crew module pressure.<ref name=\"kerwin\"/>}}\n\nSome experts believe most if not all of the crew were alive and possibly conscious during the entire descent until impact with the ocean. Astronaut and NASA lead accident investigator [[Robert F. Overmyer|Robert Overmyer]] said, \"I not only flew with Dick Scobee, we owned a plane together, and I know Scob did everything he could to save his crew. Scob fought for any and every edge to survive. He flew that ship without wings all the way down{{nbsp}}... they were alive.\"<ref name=\"Breakup\" />\n\n===Prospect of crew escape===\n{{Further2|[[Space Shuttle abort modes#Ejection escape systems|Shuttle ejection escape systems]], [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Post-Challenger abort enhancements|Post-''Challenger'' abort enhancements]]}}\n\nDuring powered flight of the space shuttle, crew escape was not possible. Launch escape systems were considered several times during shuttle development, but NASA's conclusion was that the shuttle's expected high reliability would preclude the need for one. Modified [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71 Blackbird]] [[ejection seat]]s and full [[pressure suit]]s were used for the two-man crews on the first four shuttle orbital missions, which were considered test flights, but they were removed for the \"operational\" missions that followed. The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] later declared, after the 2003 [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' re-entry disaster]], that the space shuttle system should never have been declared operational because it is experimental by nature due to the limited number of flights as compared to certified commercial aircraft. The multi-deck design of the crew cabin precluded use of such ejection seats for larger crews. Providing some sort of launch escape system had been considered, but deemed impractical due to \"limited utility, technical complexity and excessive cost in dollars, weight or schedule delays\".<ref name=\"rogers 9\" />{{efn|name=\"n1\"}}\n\nAfter the loss of ''Challenger'', the question was re-opened, and NASA considered several different options, including ejector seats, tractor rockets, and emergency egress through the bottom of the orbiter. NASA once again concluded that all of the launch escape systems considered would be impractical due to the sweeping vehicle modifications that would have been necessary and the resultant limitations on crew size. A system was designed to give the crew the option to leave the shuttle during [[gliding (flight)|gliding flight]], but this system would not have been usable in the ''Challenger'' situation.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission | title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation VII |date=June 1987 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch6.htm | accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===White House response===\n{{wikisource|Ronald Reagan Announces the Challenger Disaster}}\n[[File:Reagan Space Shuttle Challenger Speech.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=15|[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] addresses the nation after the shuttle disaster.]]\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] had been scheduled to give the [[1986 State of the Union Address]] on the evening of the ''Challenger'' disaster.

All windows in the cabin had been destroyed, with only small bits of glass still attached to the frames. Impact forces appeared to be greatest on the left side, indicating that it had struck the water in a nose-down, left-end-first position.\n\n[[File:STS-51-L Recovered Debris (Burn Marks on the SRM) - GPN-2004-00004.jpg|thumb|Recovered right solid rocket booster showing the hole caused by the plume]]\n\nInside the twisted debris of the crew cabin were the bodies of the astronauts, which after weeks of immersion in salt water and exposure to scavenging marine life were in a \"semi-liquefied state that bore little resemblance to anything living\", although according to John Devlin, the skipper of the USS ''Preserver'', they \"were not as badly mangled as you'd see in some aircraft accidents\".

Determined not to end the recovery operations without retrieving Jarvis, astronaut [[Robert Crippen]] rented a fishing boat at his own expense and went searching for the body.

The crew transfer took place on April 29, 1986, three months and one day after the accident. Seven hearses carried the crew's remains from the Life Sciences Facility on Cape Canaveral to a waiting [[Military Airlift Command|MAC]] [[C-141]] aircraft. Their caskets were each draped with an American flag and carried past an honor guard and followed by an astronaut escort. The astronaut escorts for the ''Challenger'' crew were: Dan Brandenstein, Jim Buckley, Norm Thagard, Charles Bolden, Tammy Jernigan, Dick Richards, and Loren Shriver. Once the crew's remains were aboard the jet, they were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be processed and then released to their relatives.\n\nIt had been suggested early in the investigation that the accident was caused by inadvertent detonation of the Range Safety destruct charges on the external tank, but the charges were recovered mostly intact and a quick overview of telemetry data immediately ruled out that theory.\n\nThe three shuttle main engines were found largely intact and still attached to the thrust assembly despite extensive damage from impact with the ocean, marine life, and immersion in salt water. They had considerable heat damage due to a LOX-rich shutdown caused by the drop in hydrogen fuel pressure as the external tank began to fail. The memory units from Engines{{nbsp}}1 and{{nbsp}}2 were recovered, cleaned, and their contents analyzed, which confirmed normal engine operation until LH2 starvation began starting at T+72 seconds. Loss of fuel pressure and rising combustion chamber temperatures caused the computers to shut off the engines. Since there was no evidence of abnormal SSME behavior until 72 seconds (only one second or so before the breakup of ''Challenger''\u200a), the engines were ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident.\n\nOther recovered orbiter components showed no indication of pre-breakup malfunction. Recovered parts of the TDRSS satellite also did not disclose any abnormalities other than damage caused by vehicle breakup, impact, and immersion in salt water. The solid rocket motor boost stage for the payload had not ignited either and was quickly ruled out as a cause of the accident.\n\nThe solid rocket booster debris had no signs of explosion (other than the Range Safety charges splitting the casings open), or propellant debonding/cracking. There was no question about the RSO manually destroying the SRBs following vehicle breakup, so the idea of the destruct charges accidentally detonating was ruled out. Premature separation of the SRBs from the stack or inadvertent activation of the recovery system was also considered, but telemetry data quickly disproved that idea. Nor was there any evidence of in-flight structural failure since visual and telemetry evidence showed that the SRBs remained structurally intact up to and beyond vehicle breakup. The aft field joint on the right SRB did show extensive burn damage.\n\nTelemetry proved that the right SRB, after the failure of the lower struts, had come loose and struck the external tank. The exact point where the struts broke could not be determined from film of the launch, nor were the struts or the adjacent section of the external tank recovered during salvage operations. Based on the location of the rupture in the right SRB, the P12 strut most likely failed first. The SRB's nose cone also exhibited some impact damage from this behavior (for comparison, the left SRB nose cone had no damage at all) and the intertank region had signs of impact damage as well. In addition, the orbiter's right wing had impact and burn damage from the right SRB colliding with it following vehicle breakup.\n\nMost of the initially considered failure modes were soon ruled out and by May 1, enough of the right solid rocket booster had been recovered to determine the original cause of the accident, and the major salvage operations were concluded. While some shallow-water recovery efforts continued, this was unconnected with the accident investigation; it aimed to recover debris for use in NASA's studies of the properties of materials used in spacecraft and launch vehicles.<ref name=\"rogers o\"/> The recovery operation was able to pull {{convert|15|ST}} of debris from the ocean; this means that 55% of ''Challenger'', 5% of the crew cabin and 65% of the satellite cargo are still missing.<ref name=\"FamousPictures\">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.famouspictures.org/challenger-explosion/| title = Challenger| publisher=Famous Pictures Magazine| accessdate=July 19, 2012 | last= Lucas, Dean}}</ref> Some of the missing debris continued to wash up on Florida shores for some years, such as on December 17, 1996, nearly 11 years after the incident, when two large pieces of the shuttle were found at [[Cocoa Beach, Florida|Cocoa Beach]].<ref name=\"cnn_debris\">{{Cite news| title = Shuttle Challenger debris washes up on shore| work = CNN| date = 17 December 1996| access-date = 8 January 2020| url = http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9612/17/challenger.debris/index.html| |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010413220636/https://www.cnn.com/TECH/9612/17/challenger.debris/index.html|archive-date=13 April 2001| quote = The parts -- a 6- by 15-foot rectangular section and a 4- by 8-foot section -- may be part of the rudder tail, wing, or body flap sections of the space shuttle, according to NASA spokesman Lisa Malone.}}</ref> Under {{USC|18|641}} it is against the law to be in possession of ''Challenger'' debris, and any newly discovered pieces must be turned over to NASA.<ref name=\"collectSpace\">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-070501a.html| title = Seller admits to ''Challenger'' debris fraud| publisher=collectSpace.com| accessdate=July 19, 2007 | last=collectSpace.com}}</ref>\n\nOn board ''Challenger'' was an American flag, dubbed the [[Challenger flag]], that was sponsored by [[Scouting in Colorado|Boy Scout]] Troop 514 of [[Monument, Colorado]].

The commission members were Chairman [[William P. Rogers]], Vice Chairman [[Neil Armstrong]], [[David Campion Acheson|David Acheson]], [[Eugene E. Covert|Eugene Covert]], [[Richard Feynman]], Robert Hotz, [[Donald J. Kutyna|Donald Kutyna]], [[Sally Ride]], Robert Rummel, [[Joe Sutter|Joseph Sutter]], [[Arthur B. C. Walker, Jr.|Arthur Walker]], Albert Wheelon, and [[Chuck Yeager]]. The commission worked for several months and published a report of its findings. It found that the ''Challenger'' accident was caused by a failure in the O-rings sealing a joint on the right solid rocket booster, which allowed pressurized hot gases and eventually flame to \"blow by\" the O-ring and make contact with the adjacent external tank, causing structural failure. The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a faulty design, whose performance could be too easily compromised by factors including the low ambient temperature on the day of launch. The O-rings would not work properly at ambient temperatures below {{convert|10|C|order=flip}}- and it was {{convert|2|C|order=flip}} on the morning of the launch.<ref> https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/explode.html</ref><ref>{{cite book| author=Rogers Commission | title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|chapter= Chapter IV: The Cause of the Accident | date=June 6, 1986| chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch4.htm| accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rogers Commission members arrive at Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[Rogers Commission]] arrive at [[Kennedy Space Center]].]]\n\nMore broadly, the report also considered the contributing causes of the accident. Most salient was the failure of both NASA and Morton-Thiokol to respond adequately to the danger posed by the deficient joint design. Rather than redesigning the joint, they came to define the problem as an acceptable flight risk. The report found that managers at Marshall had known about the flawed design since 1977, but never discussed the problem outside their reporting channels with Thiokol\u2014a flagrant violation of NASA regulations. Even when it became more apparent how serious the flaw was, no one at Marshall considered grounding the shuttles until a fix could be implemented. On the contrary, Marshall managers went as far as to issue and waive six launch constraints related to the O-rings.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" /> The report also strongly criticized the decision-making process that led to the launch of ''Challenger'', saying that it was seriously flawed:<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />\n\n{{bquote|failures in communication{{nbsp}}... resulted in a decision to launch 51-L based on incomplete and sometimes misleading information, a conflict between engineering data and management judgments, and a NASA management structure that permitted internal flight safety problems to bypass key Shuttle managers.<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />}}\n\n====Richard Feynman====\nOne of the commission's members was theoretical physicist [[Richard Feynman]].

Originally built for the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory|Manned Orbital Laboratory]] project cancelled in 1969, the modifications were proving problematic and expensive,<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/vafb-slc-6.htm |title=Space Launch Complex 6 [SLC-6&#93; |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=March 31, 2013}}</ref> costing over $4 billion (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|4|1986|r=1|fmt=c}}{{nbsp}}billion today). The ''Challenger'' loss motivated the Air Force to set in motion a chain of events that finally led to the May 13, 1988, decision to cancel its Vandenberg Shuttle launch plans in favor of the [[Titan IV]] uncrewed launch vehicle.\n\nIn response to the commission's recommendation, NASA initiated a total redesign of the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters, which was watched over by an independent oversight group as stipulated by the commission.<ref name=\"implementation report\"/> NASA's contract with [[Thiokol|Morton-Thiokol]], the contractor responsible for the solid rocket boosters, included a clause stating that in the event of a failure leading to \"loss of life or mission\", Thiokol would forfeit $10&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|10|1986|r=1|fmt=c}}{{nbsp}}million today) of its incentive fee and formally accept legal liability for the failure. After the ''Challenger'' accident, Thiokol agreed to \"voluntarily accept\" the monetary penalty in exchange for not being forced to accept liability.<ref name=\"No Downlink\"/>{{rp|355}}\n\nNASA also created a new Office of Safety, Reliability and Quality Assurance, headed as the commission had specified by a NASA associate administrator who reported directly to the NASA administrator. George Martin, formerly of [[Martin Marietta]], was appointed to this position.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission | title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation IV|date=June 1987 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch4.htm | accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> Former ''Challenger'' flight director [[Jay Greene]] became chief of the Safety Division of the directorate.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/GreeneJH/GreeneJH_Bio.pdf\n | title = NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project Biographical Data Sheet\n | author=J.H.

After the accident, NASA attempted to aim at a more realistic shuttle flight rate: it added another orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', to the space shuttle fleet to replace ''Challenger'', and it worked with the Department of Defense to put more satellites in orbit using [[expendable launch vehicle]]s rather than the shuttle.<ref name=\"rogerscommission\">{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission | title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation VII|date=June 1987 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch7.htm | accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> In August 1986, President Reagan also announced that the shuttle would no longer carry commercial [[satellite]] payloads.<ref name=\"rogerscommission\" /> After a 32-month hiatus, the next shuttle mission, [[STS-26]], was launched on September 29, 1988.\n\nAlthough changes were made by NASA after the ''Challenger'' accident, many commentators have argued that the changes in its management structure and organizational culture were neither deep nor long-lasting.\n\nAfter the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] in 2003, attention once again focused on the attitude of NASA management towards safety issues. The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] (CAIB) concluded that NASA had failed to learn many of the lessons of ''Challenger''. In particular, the agency had not set up a truly independent office for safety oversight; the CAIB decided that in this area, \"NASA's response to the Rogers Commission did not meet the Commission's intent\".<ref>{{cite book| author=Columbia Accident Investigation Board| title=Report of Columbia Accident Investigation Board|chapter= Volume I, Chapter 7|page= 178 |year=2003| chapter-url=http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter7.pdf|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> The CAIB believed that \"the causes of the institutional failure responsible for ''Challenger'' have not been fixed\", saying that the same \"flawed decision making process\" that had resulted in the ''Challenger'' accident was responsible for [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']]'s destruction seventeen years later.<ref>{{cite book| author=Columbia Accident Investigation Board| title=Report of Columbia Accident Investigation Board|chapter= Volume I, Chapter 8| page= 195 |year=2003| chapter-url=http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter8.pdf|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Media coverage===\nWhile the presence of [[New Hampshire]]'s [[Christa McAuliffe]], a member of the [[Teacher in Space]] program, on the ''Challenger'' crew had provoked some media interest, there was little live broadcast coverage of the launch.

Both Palmer and CBS anchor [[Dan Rather]] reacted to cameras catching live video of something descending by parachute into the area where ''Challenger'' debris was falling with confusion and speculation that a crew member may have ejected from the shuttle and survived. The shuttle had no individual ejection seats or a crew escape capsule. Mission control identified the parachute as a paramedic parachuting into the area but this was also incorrect based on internal speculation at mission control. The chute was the parachute and nose cone from one of the solid rocket boosters which had been destroyed by the [[range safety]] officer after the explosion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/challenger/timeline/#|title=Spaceflight Now - The Challenger Accident - Timeline|website=spaceflightnow.com}}</ref> Due to McAuliffe's presence on the mission, NASA arranged for many US public schools to view the launch live on [[NASA TV]].<ref name=myths>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11031097\n | title = 7 myths about the Challenger shuttle disaster\n | author=James Oberg\n |publisher=NBC News | date=January 25, 2011}}</ref> As a result, many who were schoolchildren in the US in 1986 had the opportunity to view the launch live.

He argues that if Morton-Thiokol engineers had more clearly presented the data that they had on the relationship between low temperatures and burn-through in the solid rocket booster joints, they might have succeeded in persuading NASA managers to cancel the launch. To demonstrate this, he took all of the data he claimed the engineers had presented during the briefing, and reformatted it onto a single graph of O-ring damage versus external launch temperature, showing the effects of cold on the degree of O-ring damage. Tufte then placed the proposed launch of ''Challenger'' on the graph according to its predicted temperature at launch. According to Tufte, the launch temperature of ''Challenger'' was so far below the coldest launch, with the worst damage seen to date, that even a casual observer could have determined that the risk of disaster was severe.<ref>[[Edward Tufte]]. (1997) ''Visual Explanations'', {{ISBN|978-0-9613921-2-3}}, Chapter 2.</ref>\n\nTufte has also argued that poor presentation of information may have also affected NASA decisions during the last flight of the space shuttle ''[[Columbia disaster|Columbia]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1|title= PowerPoint Does Rocket Science\u2014and Better Techniques for Technical Reports |accessdate=January 28, 2007 |author=Tufte, Edward}}</ref>\n\nBoisjoly, Wade Robison, a [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] professor, and their colleagues have vigorously repudiated Tufte's conclusions about the Morton-Thiokol engineers' role in the loss of ''Challenger''. First, they argue that the engineers didn't have the information available as Tufte claimed: \"But they did not know the temperatures even though they did try to obtain that information. Tufte has not gotten the facts right even though the information was available to him had he looked for it.\"<ref name=WadeNAE96>{{cite journal |author1=Robison, W. |author2=Boisjoly, R. |author3=Hoeker, D. |author4=Young, S. |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2002 | title = Representation and Misrepresentation: Tufte and the Morton Thiokol Engineers on the Challenger | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 59\u201381 | url=https://people.rit.edu/wlrgsh/FINRobison.pdf |accessdate=November 9, 2016|doi=10.1007/s11948-002-0033-2 }} This reference is used by the Online Ethics Center for Engineering and Research of the National Academy of Engineering of the National Academies.</ref> They further argue that Tufte \"misunderstands thoroughly the argument and evidence the engineers gave.\"<ref name=WadeNAE96/> They also criticized Tufte's diagram as \"fatally flawed by Tufte's own criteria.

The large number of children who saw the accident live or in replays the same day was well known that day, and influenced the speech President Reagan gave that evening.\n\n{{Quote|text=I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff.

The majority of children's memories of ''Challenger'' were often clear and consistent, and even things like personal placement such as who they were with or what they were doing when they heard the news were remembered well. In one U.S. study, children's memories were recorded and tested again. Children on the East Coast recalled the event more easily than children on the West Coast, due to the time difference. Children on the East Coast either saw the explosion on TV while in school, or heard people talking about it. On the other side of the country, most children were either on their way to school, or just beginning their morning classes. Researchers found that those children who saw the explosion on TV had a more emotional connection to the event, and thus had an easier time remembering it. After one year the children's memories were tested, and those on the East Coast recalled the event better than their West Coast counterparts. Regardless of where they were when it happened, the ''Challenger'' explosion was still an important event that many children easily remembered.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Connect with us!|journal= The American Journal of Psychiatry|doi=10.1176/ajp.153.5.618|pmid=8615406|volume=153|issue=5|year=1996|pages=618\u201325 | last1 = Terr | first1 = LC | last2 = Bloch | first2 = DA | last3 = Michel | first3 = BA | last4 = Shi | first4 = H | last5 = Reinhardt | first5 = JA | last6 = Metayer | first6 = S}}</ref>\n\n===Continuation of the Shuttle program===\nAfter the accident, NASA's Space Shuttle fleet was grounded for almost three years while the investigation, hearings, engineering redesign of the SRBs, and other behind-the-scenes technical and management reviews, changes, and preparations were taking place.

Its crew included [[Richard O. Covey]], who had given the last status callout to ''Challenger'' before its breakup, \"Challenger, go at throttle up\". The shuttle carried a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS-C (named TDRS-3 after deployment), which replaced TDRS-B, the satellite that was launched and lost on ''Challenger''. The \"Return to Flight\" launch of ''Discovery'' also represented a test of the redesigned boosters, a shift to a more conservative stance on safety (being the first time the crew had launched in pressure suits since STS-4, the last of the four initial Shuttle test flights), and a chance to restore national pride in the American space program, especially crewed space flight. The mission, [[STS-26]], was a success (with only two minor system failures, one of a cabin cooling system and one of a Ku-band antenna), and a regular schedule of STS flights followed, continuing without extended interruption until the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|2003 ''Columbia'' disaster]].\n\n[[Barbara Morgan]], the backup for McAuliffe who trained with her in the Teacher in Space program and was at KSC watching her launch on January 28, 1986, flew on [[STS-118]] as a Mission Specialist in August 2007.\n\n=== Other civilian passenger plans ===\nNASA had intended to send a wide range of civilian passengers into space on subsequent flights. These plans were all scrapped immediately following the ''Challenger'' disaster.\n\nNBC News's Cape Canaveral correspondent [[Jay Barbree]] was among 40 candidates in NASA's Journalist in Space Program. The first journalist was due to fly on the shuttle ''Challenger'' in September 1986.

The crew consisted of five [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]s, one [[payload specialist]], and a civilian schoolteacher. The mission carried the designation [[STS-51-L]] and was the tenth flight for the ''Challenger'' [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter]]. \n\nThe spacecraft disintegrated over the [[Atlantic Ocean]], off the coast of [[Cape Canaveral, Florida|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], at 11:39{{nbsp}}a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (16:39 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). The disintegration of the vehicle began after a joint in its right [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] (SRB) failed at liftoff. The failure was caused by the failure of [[O-ring]] seals used in the joint that were not designed to handle the unusually cold conditions that existed at this launch. The seals' failure caused a breach in the SRB joint, allowing pressurized burning gas from within the solid rocket motor to reach the outside and impinge upon the adjacent SRB aft field joint attachment hardware and [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank]]. This led to the separation of the right-hand SRB's aft field joint attachment and the [[Structural integrity and failure|structural failure]] of the external tank. [[Aerodynamic]] forces broke up the orbiter.\n\nThe crew compartment and many other vehicle fragments were eventually recovered from the ocean floor after a lengthy search and recovery operation. The exact timing of the death of the crew is unknown; several crew members are known to have survived the initial breakup of the spacecraft. The shuttle had no escape system,{{efn|name=\"n1\"|The first two Space Shuttle orbiters, ''Enterprise'' and ''Columbia'', originally had [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Ejection seat|ejection seats]] installed in the flight deck for the pilot and co-pilot in the initial test missions.

The pilot's ejection seats were disabled after [[STS-4]] and subsequently removed by the launch of [[STS-61]] on January 12, 1986, and were never installed on the remaining four orbiters.}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Shuttle Carrying New Escape System|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=October 23, 2016|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Shuttle-Carrying-New-Escape-System/id-50c3be84147652b242204463a5b036d5|date=September 27, 1988|last1=Tolley|first1=Laura}}</ref> and the impact of the crew compartment at [[terminal velocity]] with the ocean surface was too violent to be survivable.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abramson |first=Rudy |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 8, 1988 |title=Shuttle to Have Device Enabling Crew to Escape |quote=Studies in the wake of the Challenger disaster showed that astronauts probably would not survive an ocean ditching{{nbsp}}...

The Rogers Commission found NASA's [[organizational culture]] and decision-making processes had been key contributing factors to the accident,<ref>{{cite web | author=Outer Space Universe| title=Remembering the Challenger Shuttle Explosion: A Disaster 25 Years Ago | url=http://www.outerspaceuniverse.org/remembering-challenger-shuttle-explosion-25-years.html | accessdate=January 28, 2011}}</ref> with the agency violating its own safety rules. NASA managers had known since 1977 that contractor [[Thiokol|Morton-Thiokol]]'s design of the SRBs contained a potentially catastrophic flaw in the O-rings, but they had failed to address this problem properly. NASA managers also disregarded warnings from engineers about the dangers of launching posed by the low temperatures of that morning, and failed to adequately report these technical concerns to their superiors.\n\nApproximately 17 percent of the American population witnessed the launch on live television broadcast because of the presence of high school teacher [[Christa McAuliffe]], who would have been the first [[Teacher in Space Project|teacher in space]]. Media coverage of the accident was extensive; one study reported that 85&nbsp;percent of Americans surveyed had heard the news within an hour of the accident.<ref>{{cite web|title=On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger Exploded 76 Seconds After Launch (Video) |url=http://www.viralvideobox.com/on-january-28-1986-space-shuttle-challenger-exploded-76-seconds-after-launch-video/|work=Viral Video Box|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> The ''Challenger'' disaster has been used as a case study in many discussions of engineering safety and workplace ethics.\n\n==O-ring concerns==\n[[File:STS-51-L - Space Shuttle Challenger on the Crawler-Transporter.jpg|thumb|''Challenger'' being carried atop a [[Crawler-transporter]] on the way to the launch pad]]\n\nEach of the Space Shuttle's two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) was constructed of seven sections, six of which were permanently joined in pairs at the factory. For each flight, the four resulting segments were then assembled in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC), with three field joints. The factory joints were sealed with asbestos-silica insulation applied over the joint, while each field joint was sealed with two rubber O-rings. After the destruction of ''Challenger'', the number of O-rings per field joint was increased to three.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solid Rocket Motor Joint Reliability|url=http://engineer.jpl.nasa.gov/practices/1257.pdf|publisher=NASA Engineering}}</ref> The seals of all of the SRB joints were required to contain the hot, high-pressure gases produced by the burning solid propellant inside, thus forcing them out of the nozzle at the aft end of each rocket.\n\nDuring the [[Space Shuttle design process]], a [[McDonnell Douglas]] report in September 1971 discussed the safety record of solid rockets. While a safe abort was possible after most types of failures, one was especially dangerous: a burnthrough by hot gases of the rocket's casing. The report stated that \"if burnthrough occurs adjacent to [liquid hydrogen/oxygen] tank or orbiter, timely sensing may not be feasible and abort not possible\", accurately foreshadowing the ''Challenger'' accident.<ref name=\"heppenheimer1998\">{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA publication SP-4221 | author=Heppenheimer, T.

As originally designed by Thiokol, the O-ring joints in the SRBs were supposed to close more tightly due to forces generated at ignition, but a 1977 test showed that when pressurized water was used to simulate the effects of booster combustion, the metal parts bent away from each other, opening a gap through which gases could leak. This phenomenon, known as \"joint rotation\", caused a momentary drop in air pressure. This made it possible for combustion gases to erode the O-rings. In the event of widespread erosion, a flame path could develop, causing the joint to burst\u2014which would have destroyed the booster and the shuttle.<ref name=\"Major Malfunction\">{{cite book | last=McConnell | first=Malcolm | date=1987 | title=Challenger: A Major Malfunction | location=Garden City, NY | publisher=Doubleday | isbn=978-0-385-23877-9 | url=https://archive.org/details/challengermajorm00mcco }}</ref>{{rp|118}}\n\nEngineers at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] wrote to the manager of the Solid Rocket Booster project, George Hardy, on several occasions suggesting that Thiokol's field joint design was unacceptable. For example, one engineer suggested that joint rotation would render the secondary O-ring useless, but Hardy did not forward these memos to Thiokol, and the field joints were accepted for flight in 1980.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\">{{cite web |author=Rogers Commission |title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Chapter VI: An Accident Rooted in History |date=June 6, 1986 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm }}</ref>\n\nEvidence of serious O-ring erosion was present as early as the second space shuttle mission, [[STS-2]], which was flown by ''Columbia''. Contrary to NASA regulations, the Marshall Center did not report this problem to senior management at NASA, but opted to keep the problem within their reporting channels with Thiokol. Even after the O-rings were redesignated as \"Criticality 1\" \u2014 meaning that their failure would result in the destruction of the Orbiter, no one at Marshall suggested that the shuttles be grounded until the flaw could be fixed.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" />\n\nAfter the 1984 launch of [[STS-41-D]], flown by ''Discovery'', the first occurrence of hot gas \"blow-by\" was discovered beyond the primary O-ring. In the post-flight analysis, [[Thiokol]] engineers found that the amount of blow-by was relatively small and had not impinged upon the secondary O-ring, and concluded that for future flights, the damage was an acceptable risk. However, after the ''Challenger'' disaster, [[Thiokol]] engineer Brian Russell identified this event as the first \"big red flag\" regarding O-ring safety.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian/page/143 143]\u201344|url=https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nBy 1985, with seven of nine shuttle launches that year using boosters displaying O-ring erosion or hot gas blow-by,<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian/page/153 153]|url=https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian|url-access=registration}}</ref> Marshall and Thiokol realized that they had a potentially catastrophic problem on their hands. Perhaps most concerning was the launch of [[STS-51-B]] in April 1985, flown by ''Challenger'', in which the worst O-ring damage to date was discovered in post-flight analysis. The primary O-ring of the left nozzle had been eroded so extensively that it had failed to seal, and for the first time hot gases had eroded the secondary O-ring.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian|url-access=registration}}</ref> They began the process of redesigning the joint with three inches (76&nbsp;mm) of additional steel around the tang. This tang would grip the inner face of the joint and prevent it from rotating. They did not call for a halt to shuttle flights until the joints could be redesigned, but rather treated the problem as an acceptable flight risk. For example, Lawrence Mulloy, Marshall's manager for the SRB project since 1982, issued and waived launch constraints for six consecutive flights. Thiokol even went as far as to persuade NASA to declare the O-ring problem \"closed\".<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" /> [[Donald J. Kutyna|Donald Kutyna]], a member of the [[Rogers Commission]], later likened this situation to an airline permitting one of its planes to continue to fly despite evidence that one of its wings was about to fall off.\n\n==Pre-launch conditions==\n\n===Delays===\n''Challenger'' was originally set to launch from [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida at 14:42 [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time (EST)]] on Wednesday, January 22, 1986. Delays in the previous mission, [[STS-61-C]], caused the launch date to be moved to January 23 and then to January 24. The launch was rescheduled again, to Saturday, January 25, due to [[storm|bad weather]] at the [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Transoceanic abort landing|transoceanic abort landing (TAL)]] site in [[Dakar|Dakar, Senegal]]. NASA decided to use the TAL site at [[Casablanca|Casablanca, Morocco]], but because it was not equipped for night landings, the launch had to be moved to the morning. Predictions of unacceptable weather at Kennedy Space Center on January 26 caused the launch to be rescheduled for 09:37 EST on Monday, January 27.<ref>{{cite web|title=STS-51-L mission archives|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-51L.html|publisher=NASA}}</ref>\n\nThe planned January 27 launch was initially delayed due to problems with the [[Space Shuttle orbiter#Pressurized cabin|exterior access hatch]].

The Shuttle was never certified to operate in temperatures that low. The O-rings, as well as many other critical components, had no test data to support any expectation of a successful launch in such conditions.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\"/><ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/>\n\nBy mid-1985 Thiokol engineers worried that others did not share their concerns about the low temperature effects on the boosters. Engineer Bob Ebeling in October 1985 wrote a memo\u2014titled \"Help!\" so others would read it\u2014of concerns regarding low temperatures and O-rings. After the weather forecast, NASA personnel remembered Thiokol's warnings and contacted the company. When a Thiokol manager asked Ebeling about the possibility of a launch at {{convert|18|F|||}}, he answered \"[W]e're only qualified to 40\u00b0 [{{convert|40|F|disp=or||}}]{{nbsp}}... 'what business does anyone even have thinking about 18\u00b0, we're in no-man's land.'\" After his team agreed that a launch risked disaster, Thiokol immediately called NASA recommending a postponement until temperatures rose in the afternoon. NASA manager Jud Lovingood responded that Thiokol could not make the recommendation without providing a safe temperature. The company prepared for a teleconference two hours later during which it would have to justify a no-launch recommendation.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\">{{cite web | author=Chris Bergin| title=Remembering the mistakes of Challenger | url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/01/remembering-the-mistakes-of-challenger/ | work=nasaspaceflight.com | date=January 28, 2007 | accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/>\n\nAt the teleconference on the evening of January 27, Thiokol engineers and managers discussed the weather conditions with NASA managers from Kennedy Space Center and Marshall Space Flight Center. Several engineers (most notably Ebeling and [[Roger Boisjoly]]) reiterated their concerns about the effect of low temperatures on the resilience of the rubber O-rings that sealed the joints of the SRBs, and recommended a launch postponement.<ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/> They argued that they did not have enough data to determine whether the joints would properly seal if the O-rings were colder than {{convert|12|C|order=flip}}. This was an important consideration, since the SRB O-rings had been designated as a \"Criticality 1\" component, meaning that there was no backup if both the primary and secondary O-rings failed, and their failure could destroy the Orbiter and kill its crew.\n\nThiokol management initially supported its engineers' recommendation to postpone the launch, but NASA staff opposed a delay. During the conference call, Hardy told Thiokol, \"I am appalled. I am appalled by your recommendation.\" Mulloy said, \"My God, Thiokol, when do you want me to launch\u2014next April?\"<ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/> NASA believed that Thiokol's hastily prepared presentation's quality was too poor to support such a statement on flight safety.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\"/> One argument by NASA personnel contesting Thiokol's concerns was that if the primary O-ring failed, the secondary O-ring would still seal. This was unproven, and was in any case an argument that did not apply to a \"Criticality 1\" component. As astronaut [[Sally Ride]] stated when questioning NASA managers before the Rogers Commission, it is forbidden to rely on a backup for a \"Criticality 1\" component.\n\nNASA claimed that it did not know of Thiokol's earlier concerns about the effects of the cold on the O-rings, and did not understand that [[Rockwell International]], the shuttle's prime contractor, additionally viewed the large amount of ice present on the pad as a constraint to launch.\n\nAccording to Ebeling, a second conference call was scheduled with only NASA and Thiokol management, excluding the engineers. For reasons that are unclear, Thiokol management disregarded its own engineers' warnings and now recommended that the launch proceed as scheduled;<ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/><ref name=\"rogers 5\">{{cite book| author=Rogers Commission | title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|chapter= Chapter V: The Contributing Cause of The Accident | date=June 6, 1986| chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch5.htm |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> NASA did not ask why.{{r|bergin20070128}} Ebeling told his wife that night that ''Challenger'' would blow up.<ref>{{cite web | author=Ware, Doug G. | title = Engineer who warned of 1986 Challenger disaster still racked with guilt, three decades on | date=January 28, 2016 | publisher=United Press International | url = http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/01/28/Engineer-who-warned-of-1986-Challenger-disaster-still-racked-with-guilt-three-decades-on/4891454032643/ | accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKen Iliff, a former NASA Chief Scientist who had worked on the Space Shuttle Program since its first mission (and the X-15 program before that), stated this in 2004:\n{{quote | text=Not violating flight rules was something I had been taught on the X-15 program.

Ice had accumulated all over the launch pad, raising concerns that ice could damage the shuttle upon lift-off. The Kennedy Ice Team inadvertently pointed an infrared camera at the aft field joint of the right SRB and found the temperature to be only {{convert|\u221213|C|F|order=flip}}. This was believed to be the result of supercooled air blowing on the joint from the [[Liquid oxygen|liquid oxygen (LOX)]] tank vent. It was much lower than the air temperature and far below the design specifications for the O-rings. The low reading was later determined to be erroneous, the error caused by not following the temperature probe manufacturer's instructions. Tests and adjusted calculations later confirmed that the temperature of the joint was not substantially different from the ambient temperature.\n\nThe temperature on the day of the launch was far lower than had been the case with previous launches: below freezing at {{convert|\u22122.2|to|\u22121.7|C|order=flip}}; previously, the coldest launch had been at {{convert|12|C|order=flip}}. Although the Ice Team had worked through the night removing ice, engineers at Rockwell still expressed concern. Rockwell engineers watching the pad from their headquarters in [[Downey, California]], were horrified when they saw the amount of ice. They feared that during launch, ice might be shaken loose and strike the shuttle's thermal protection tiles, possibly due to the aspiration induced by the [[jet (fluid)|jet]] of [[exhaust gas]] from the SRBs. [[Rocco Petrone]], the head of Rockwell's space transportation division, and his colleagues viewed this situation as a launch constraint, and told Rockwell's managers at the Cape that Rockwell could not support a launch. Rockwell's managers at the Cape voiced their concerns in a manner that led Houston-based mission manager Arnold Aldrich to go ahead with the launch. Aldrich decided to postpone the shuttle launch by an hour to give the Ice Team time to perform another inspection. After that last inspection, during which the ice appeared to be melting, ''Challenger'' was cleared to launch at 11:38&nbsp;am EST.<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />\n{{clear right}}\n\n==January 28 launch and failure==\n{{further|STS-51-L Mission timeline}}\n\n===Liftoff and initial ascent===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2011}}\n<!-- This entire section reads like an official NASA report which I've read.

The SSMEs were liquid-fueled and could be safely shut down (and the launch aborted if necessary) until the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s (SRBs) ignited at T=0 (which was at 11:38:00.010 EST) and the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Hold-down posts|hold-down bolts]] were released with explosives, freeing the vehicle from the pad. At lift off, the three SSMEs were at 100% of their original rated performance, and began throttling up to [[Space Shuttle main engine#Engine throttle/output|104%]] under computer control. With the first vertical motion of the vehicle, the gaseous hydrogen vent arm retracted from the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank (ET)]] but failed to latch back. Review of film shot by pad cameras showed that the arm did not re-contact the vehicle, and thus it was ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident.<ref name=\"rogers n\"/> The post-launch inspection of the pad also revealed that kick springs on four of the hold-down bolts were missing, but they were similarly ruled out as a possible cause.<ref name=\"tv team\">{{cite video | people= Photo and TV Analysis Team Report| title =Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Investigation| url =https://archive.org/details/ChallengerAccidentandInvestigation| publisher=STS-51L Data and Analysis Task Force |year = 1986 | accessdate=January 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Challenger Launch and Breakup.ogv|thumb|''Challenger'' launch and breakup]]\n\nLater review of launch film showed that at T+0.678, strong puffs of dark gray smoke were emitted from the right-hand SRB near the [[aft]] strut that attached the booster to the ET. The last smoke puff occurred at about T+2.733. The last view of smoke around the strut was at T+3.375. It was later determined that these smoke puffs were caused by the opening and closing of the aft field joint of the right-hand SRB. The booster's casing had ballooned under the stress of ignition. As a result of this ballooning, the metal parts of the casing bent away from each other, opening a gap through which hot gases\u2014above {{convert|2760|C|order=flip}}\u2014leaked. This had occurred in previous launches, but each time the primary O-ring had shifted out of its groove and formed a seal. Although the SRB was not designed to function this way, it appeared to work well enough, and Morton-Thiokol changed the design specs to accommodate this process, known as [[extrusion]].\n\nWhile extrusion was taking place, hot gases leaked past (a process called \"blow-by\"), damaging the O-rings until a seal was made. Investigations by Morton-Thiokol engineers determined that the amount of damage to the O-rings was directly related to the time it took for extrusion to occur, and that cold weather, by causing the O-rings to harden, lengthened the time of extrusion. The redesigned SRB field joint used subsequent to the ''Challenger'' accident used an additional interlocking mortise and tang with a third O-ring, mitigating blow-by.\n\nOn the morning of the disaster, the primary O-ring had become so hard due to the cold that it could not seal in time. The temperature had dropped below the [[glass transition]] temperature of the O-rings. Above the glass transition temperature, the O-rings display properties of elasticity and flexibility, while below the glass transition temperature, they become rigid and brittle. The secondary O-ring was not in its seated position due to the metal bending. There was now no barrier to the gases, and both O-rings were vaporized across 70 degrees of arc. [[Aluminium oxide|Aluminum oxides]] from the burned solid propellant sealed the damaged joint, temporarily replacing the O-ring seal before flame passed through the joint.\n\nAs the vehicle cleared the tower, the SSMEs were operating at [[Space Shuttle main engine#Thrust specifications|104% of their rated maximum thrust]], and control switched from the [[Launch Control Center]] (LCC) at Kennedy to the Mission Control Center (MCC) at [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. To prevent [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] forces from structurally overloading the orbiter, at T+28 the SSMEs began throttling down to limit the velocity of the shuttle in the dense [[troposphere|lower atmosphere]], per normal operating procedure. At T+35.379, the SSMEs throttled back further to the planned 65%. Five seconds later, at about {{convert|19000|ft}}, ''Challenger'' passed through [[Mach number|Mach 1]]. At T+51.860, the SSMEs began throttling back up to 104% as the vehicle passed beyond [[max q]], the period of maximum aerodynamic pressure on the vehicle.\n\n===Plume===\n[[File:Booster Rocket Breach - GPN-2000-001425.jpg|thumb|Plume on right SRB at T+ 58.788 seconds]]\n\nBeginning at about T+37 and for 27 seconds, the shuttle experienced a series of [[Wind shear#Impact on passenger aircraft|wind shear]] events that were stronger than on any previous flight.<ref>{{cite web| author=NASA Mission Archives| title=STS-51L | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-51L.html | accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt T+58.788, a tracking film camera captured the beginnings of a [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] near the aft attach strut on the right SRB. Unknown to those on ''Challenger'' or in Houston, hot gas had begun to leak through a growing hole in one of the right-hand SRB joints. The force of the wind shear shattered the temporary oxide seal that had taken the place of the damaged O-rings, removing the last barrier to flame passing through the joint. Had it not been for the wind shear, the fortuitous oxide seal might have held through booster burnout.\n\nWithin a second, the plume became well defined and intense. Internal pressure in the right SRB began to drop because of the rapidly enlarging hole in the failed joint, and at T+60.238 there was visual evidence of flame burning through the joint and impinging on the external tank.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nAt T+64.660, the plume suddenly changed shape, indicating that a leak had begun in the [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH2) tank, located in the aft portion of the external tank. The nozzles of the main engines pivoted under computer control to compensate for the unbalanced thrust produced by the booster burn-through. The pressure in the shuttle's external LH2 tank began to drop at T+66.764, indicating the effect of the leak.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nAt this stage the situation still seemed normal both to the crew and to flight controllers. At T+68, the [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]] [[Richard O. Covey]] informed the crew that they were \"go at throttle up\"<!-- the grammar is correct, the full phrasing used in some other shuttle missions was \"you are go at throttle up\" -->, and Commander [[Dick Scobee]] confirmed, \"Roger, go at throttle up\"; this was the last communication from ''Challenger'' on the air-to-ground loop.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\n===Vehicle breakup===\n[[File:Challenger (STS-51-L) Tracking Camera.webm|thumb|A tracking camera located north of the pad captured the SRB plume as it burned through the external tank.

Later analysis of telemetry data showed a sudden lateral acceleration to the right at T+72.525, which may have been felt by the crew. The last statement captured by the crew cabin recorder came just half a second after this acceleration, when Pilot [[Michael J. Smith (astronaut)|Michael J.

At the same time, the right SRB rotated about the forward attach strut, and struck the [[Space Shuttle external tank#Intertank|intertank]] structure. The external tank at this point suffered a complete structural failure, the LH2 and LOX tanks rupturing, mixing, and igniting, creating a fireball that enveloped the whole stack.<ref name=\"kerthan\">{{cite web| author=Than, Ker| title=5 Myths of Challenger Shuttle Disaster Debunked | date=January 7, 2011| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/01/pictures/110127-challenger-disaster-space-shuttle-25th-anniversary-myths-science-nasa/| accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe breakup of the vehicle began at T+73.162 seconds and at an altitude of {{convert|48000|ft|km}}.<ref name=\"kerwin\">{{cite web|last=Kerwin | first=Joseph P. |authorlink=Joseph P.

The two SRBs, which could withstand greater aerodynamic loads, separated from the ET and continued in uncontrolled powered flight. The SRB casings were made of half-inch-thick (12.7&nbsp;mm) steel and were much stronger than the orbiter and ET; thus, both SRBs survived the breakup of the space shuttle stack, even though the right SRB was still suffering the effects of the joint burn-through that had set the destruction of ''Challenger'' in motion.<ref name=\"tv team\" />\n\nThe more robustly constructed crew cabin also survived the breakup of the launch vehicle, as it was designed to survive {{convert|20|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} while the estimated pressure it had been subjected to during orbiter breakup was only about {{convert|4\u20135|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}.

Television screens showed a cloud of smoke and water vapor (the product of hydrogen+oxygen combustion) where ''Challenger'' had been, with pieces of debris falling toward the ocean. At about T+89, flight director [[Jay Greene]] prompted his [[Flight controller#Flight Dynamics Officer .28FDO or FIDO.29 2|Flight Dynamics Officer]] (FIDO) for information. FIDO responded that \"the {{bracket|[[radar]]}} filter has discreting sources\", a further indication that ''Challenger'' had broken into multiple pieces. Moments later, the [[Ground Controller|ground controller]] reported \"negative contact (and) loss of [[Telecommunications link#Downlink|downlink]]\" of radio and telemetry data from ''Challenger''. Greene ordered his team to \"watch your data carefully\" and look for any sign that the Orbiter had escaped.\n\n[[File:Challenger Mission Control.ogv|thumb|Mission Control during the liftoff of ''Challenger'' (STS-51-L)]]\n\nAt T+110.250, the range safety officer (RSO) at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] sent radio signals that activated the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Range safety system|range safety system]]'s \"destruct\" packages on board both solid rocket boosters.

Mike Mullane wrote, \"These switches were protected with lever locks that required them to be pulled outward against a spring force before they could be moved to a new position.\" Later tests established that neither force of the explosion nor the impact with the ocean could have moved them, indicating that Smith made the switch changes, presumably in a futile attempt to restore electrical power to the cockpit after the crew cabin detached from the rest of the orbiter.<ref name=Mullane>{{Cite book | last = Mullane | first = Mike | authorlink = Mike Mullane | title = Riding Rockets: The Outrageous Tales of a Space Shuttle Astronaut | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year = 2006 | page = 245 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8X7ceB3QEWkC&pg=PA245 | isbn = 978-0-7432-7682-5 }}</ref>\n\nWhether the crew members remained conscious long after the breakup is unknown, and largely depends on whether the detached crew cabin maintained pressure integrity. If it did not, the time of useful consciousness at that altitude is just a few seconds; the PEAPs supplied only unpressurized air, and hence would not have helped the crew to retain consciousness. If, on the other hand, the cabin was not depressurized or only slowly depressurizing, they may have been conscious for the entire fall until impact. Recovery of the cabin found that the middeck floor had not suffered buckling or tearing, as would result from a rapid decompression, thus providing some evidence that the depressurization may not have happened suddenly.\n\nNASA routinely trained shuttle crews for splashdown events, but the cabin hit the ocean surface at roughly {{convert|207|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with an estimated deceleration at impact of well over 200 [[g-force|g]], far beyond the structural limits of the crew compartment or crew survivability levels, and far greater than almost any automobile, aircraft, or train accident. The crew would have been torn from their seats and killed instantly by the extreme impact force.<ref name=\"kerwin\"/>\n\nOn July 28, 1986, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight, former astronaut [[Richard H. Truly]], released a report on the deaths of the crew from the director of Space and Life Sciences at the [[Johnson Space Center]], [[Joseph P. Kerwin]]. A medical doctor and former astronaut, Kerwin was a veteran of the 1973 [[Skylab 2]] mission. According to the Kerwin Report:\n\n{{quote|The findings are inconclusive. The impact of the crew compartment with the ocean surface was so violent that evidence of damage occurring in the seconds which followed the disintegration was masked. Our final conclusions are:\n* the cause of death of the ''Challenger'' astronauts cannot be positively determined;\n* the forces to which the crew were exposed during Orbiter breakup were probably not sufficient to cause death or serious injury; and\n* the crew possibly, but not certainly, lost consciousness in the seconds following Orbiter breakup due to in-flight loss of crew module pressure.<ref name=\"kerwin\"/>}}\n\nSome experts believe most if not all of the crew were alive and possibly conscious during the entire descent until impact with the ocean. Astronaut and NASA lead accident investigator [[Robert F. Overmyer|Robert Overmyer]] said, \"I not only flew with Dick Scobee, we owned a plane together, and I know Scob did everything he could to save his crew. Scob fought for any and every edge to survive. He flew that ship without wings all the way down{{nbsp}}... they were alive.\"<ref name=\"Breakup\" />\n\n===Prospect of crew escape===\n{{Further2|[[Space Shuttle abort modes#Ejection escape systems|Shuttle ejection escape systems]], [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Post-Challenger abort enhancements|Post-''Challenger'' abort enhancements]]}}\n\nDuring powered flight of the space shuttle, crew escape was not possible. Launch escape systems were considered several times during shuttle development, but NASA's conclusion was that the shuttle's expected high reliability would preclude the need for one. Modified [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71 Blackbird]] [[ejection seat]]s and full [[pressure suit]]s were used for the two-man crews on the first four shuttle orbital missions, which were considered test flights, but they were removed for the \"operational\" missions that followed. The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] later declared, after the 2003 [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' re-entry disaster]], that the space shuttle system should never have been declared operational because it is experimental by nature due to the limited number of flights as compared to certified commercial aircraft. The multi-deck design of the crew cabin precluded use of such ejection seats for larger crews. Providing some sort of launch escape system had been considered, but deemed impractical due to \"limited utility, technical complexity and excessive cost in dollars, weight or schedule delays\".<ref name=\"rogers 9\" />{{efn|name=\"n1\"}}\n\nAfter the loss of ''Challenger'', the question was re-opened, and NASA considered several different options, including ejector seats, tractor rockets, and emergency egress through the bottom of the orbiter. NASA once again concluded that all of the launch escape systems considered would be impractical due to the sweeping vehicle modifications that would have been necessary and the resultant limitations on crew size. A system was designed to give the crew the option to leave the shuttle during [[gliding (flight)|gliding flight]], but this system would not have been usable in the ''Challenger'' situation.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission | title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation VII |date=June 1987 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch6.htm | accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===White House response===\n{{wikisource|Ronald Reagan Announces the Challenger Disaster}}\n[[File:Reagan Space Shuttle Challenger Speech.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=15|[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] addresses the nation after the shuttle disaster.]]\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] had been scheduled to give the [[1986 State of the Union Address]] on the evening of the ''Challenger'' disaster.

The largest intact section was the rear wall containing the two payload bay windows and the airlock. All windows in the cabin had been destroyed, with only small bits of glass still attached to the frames. Impact forces appeared to be greatest on the left side, indicating that it had struck the water in a nose-down, left-end-first position.\n\n[[File:STS-51-L Recovered Debris (Burn Marks on the SRM) - GPN-2004-00004.jpg|thumb|Recovered right solid rocket booster showing the hole caused by the plume]]\n\nInside the twisted debris of the crew cabin were the bodies of the astronauts, which after weeks of immersion in salt water and exposure to scavenging marine life were in a \"semi-liquefied state that bore little resemblance to anything living\", although according to John Devlin, the skipper of the USS ''Preserver'', they \"were not as badly mangled as you'd see in some aircraft accidents\".

Due to the hazardous nature of the recovery operation (the cabin was filled with large pieces of protruding jagged metal), the Navy divers protested that they would not go on with the work unless the cabin was hauled onto the ship's deck.\n\nDuring the recovery of the remains of the crew, Gregory Jarvis's body floated out of the shattered crew compartment and was lost to the diving team. A day later, it was seen floating on the ocean's surface. It sank as a team prepared to pull it from the water. Determined not to end the recovery operations without retrieving Jarvis, astronaut [[Robert Crippen]] rented a fishing boat at his own expense and went searching for the body. On April 15, near the end of the salvage operations, the Navy divers found Jarvis. His body had settled to the sea floor, {{convert|101.2|ft}} below the surface, some {{convert|0.7|nmi}} from the final resting place of the crew compartment.

The crew transfer took place on April 29, 1986, three months and one day after the accident. Seven hearses carried the crew's remains from the Life Sciences Facility on Cape Canaveral to a waiting [[Military Airlift Command|MAC]] [[C-141]] aircraft. Their caskets were each draped with an American flag and carried past an honor guard and followed by an astronaut escort. The astronaut escorts for the ''Challenger'' crew were: Dan Brandenstein, Jim Buckley, Norm Thagard, Charles Bolden, Tammy Jernigan, Dick Richards, and Loren Shriver. Once the crew's remains were aboard the jet, they were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be processed and then released to their relatives.\n\nIt had been suggested early in the investigation that the accident was caused by inadvertent detonation of the Range Safety destruct charges on the external tank, but the charges were recovered mostly intact and a quick overview of telemetry data immediately ruled out that theory.\n\nThe three shuttle main engines were found largely intact and still attached to the thrust assembly despite extensive damage from impact with the ocean, marine life, and immersion in salt water. They had considerable heat damage due to a LOX-rich shutdown caused by the drop in hydrogen fuel pressure as the external tank began to fail. The memory units from Engines{{nbsp}}1 and{{nbsp}}2 were recovered, cleaned, and their contents analyzed, which confirmed normal engine operation until LH2 starvation began starting at T+72 seconds. Loss of fuel pressure and rising combustion chamber temperatures caused the computers to shut off the engines. Since there was no evidence of abnormal SSME behavior until 72 seconds (only one second or so before the breakup of ''Challenger''\u200a), the engines were ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident.\n\nOther recovered orbiter components showed no indication of pre-breakup malfunction. Recovered parts of the TDRSS satellite also did not disclose any abnormalities other than damage caused by vehicle breakup, impact, and immersion in salt water. The solid rocket motor boost stage for the payload had not ignited either and was quickly ruled out as a cause of the accident.\n\nThe solid rocket booster debris had no signs of explosion (other than the Range Safety charges splitting the casings open), or propellant debonding/cracking. There was no question about the RSO manually destroying the SRBs following vehicle breakup, so the idea of the destruct charges accidentally detonating was ruled out. Premature separation of the SRBs from the stack or inadvertent activation of the recovery system was also considered, but telemetry data quickly disproved that idea. Nor was there any evidence of in-flight structural failure since visual and telemetry evidence showed that the SRBs remained structurally intact up to and beyond vehicle breakup. The aft field joint on the right SRB did show extensive burn damage.\n\nTelemetry proved that the right SRB, after the failure of the lower struts, had come loose and struck the external tank. The exact point where the struts broke could not be determined from film of the launch, nor were the struts or the adjacent section of the external tank recovered during salvage operations. Based on the location of the rupture in the right SRB, the P12 strut most likely failed first. The SRB's nose cone also exhibited some impact damage from this behavior (for comparison, the left SRB nose cone had no damage at all) and the intertank region had signs of impact damage as well. In addition, the orbiter's right wing had impact and burn damage from the right SRB colliding with it following vehicle breakup.\n\nMost of the initially considered failure modes were soon ruled out and by May 1, enough of the right solid rocket booster had been recovered to determine the original cause of the accident, and the major salvage operations were concluded. While some shallow-water recovery efforts continued, this was unconnected with the accident investigation; it aimed to recover debris for use in NASA's studies of the properties of materials used in spacecraft and launch vehicles.<ref name=\"rogers o\"/> The recovery operation was able to pull {{convert|15|ST}} of debris from the ocean; this means that 55% of ''Challenger'', 5% of the crew cabin and 65% of the satellite cargo are still missing.<ref name=\"FamousPictures\">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.famouspictures.org/challenger-explosion/| title = Challenger| publisher=Famous Pictures Magazine| accessdate=July 19, 2012 | last= Lucas, Dean}}</ref> Some of the missing debris continued to wash up on Florida shores for some years, such as on December 17, 1996, nearly 11 years after the incident, when two large pieces of the shuttle were found at [[Cocoa Beach, Florida|Cocoa Beach]].<ref name=\"cnn_debris\">{{Cite news| title = Shuttle Challenger debris washes up on shore| work = CNN| date = 17 December 1996| access-date = 8 January 2020| url = http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9612/17/challenger.debris/index.html| |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010413220636/https://www.cnn.com/TECH/9612/17/challenger.debris/index.html|archive-date=13 April 2001| quote = The parts -- a 6- by 15-foot rectangular section and a 4- by 8-foot section -- may be part of the rudder tail, wing, or body flap sections of the space shuttle, according to NASA spokesman Lisa Malone.}}</ref> Under {{USC|18|641}} it is against the law to be in possession of ''Challenger'' debris, and any newly discovered pieces must be turned over to NASA.<ref name=\"collectSpace\">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-070501a.html| title = Seller admits to ''Challenger'' debris fraud| publisher=collectSpace.com| accessdate=July 19, 2007 | last=collectSpace.com}}</ref>\n\nOn board ''Challenger'' was an American flag, dubbed the [[Challenger flag]], that was sponsored by [[Scouting in Colorado|Boy Scout]] Troop 514 of [[Monument, Colorado]].

Walker, Jr.|Arthur Walker]], Albert Wheelon, and [[Chuck Yeager]]. The commission worked for several months and published a report of its findings. It found that the ''Challenger'' accident was caused by a failure in the O-rings sealing a joint on the right solid rocket booster, which allowed pressurized hot gases and eventually flame to \"blow by\" the O-ring and make contact with the adjacent external tank, causing structural failure. The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a faulty design, whose performance could be too easily compromised by factors including the low ambient temperature on the day of launch. The O-rings would not work properly at ambient temperatures below {{convert|10|C|order=flip}}- and it was {{convert|2|C|order=flip}} on the morning of the launch.<ref> https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/explode.html</ref><ref>{{cite book| author=Rogers Commission | title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|chapter= Chapter IV: The Cause of the Accident | date=June 6, 1986| chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch4.htm| accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rogers Commission members arrive at Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[Rogers Commission]] arrive at [[Kennedy Space Center]].]]\n\nMore broadly, the report also considered the contributing causes of the accident. Most salient was the failure of both NASA and Morton-Thiokol to respond adequately to the danger posed by the deficient joint design. Rather than redesigning the joint, they came to define the problem as an acceptable flight risk. The report found that managers at Marshall had known about the flawed design since 1977, but never discussed the problem outside their reporting channels with Thiokol\u2014a flagrant violation of NASA regulations. Even when it became more apparent how serious the flaw was, no one at Marshall considered grounding the shuttles until a fix could be implemented. On the contrary, Marshall managers went as far as to issue and waive six launch constraints related to the O-rings.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" /> The report also strongly criticized the decision-making process that led to the launch of ''Challenger'', saying that it was seriously flawed:<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />\n\n{{bquote|failures in communication{{nbsp}}... resulted in a decision to launch 51-L based on incomplete and sometimes misleading information, a conflict between engineering data and management judgments, and a NASA management structure that permitted internal flight safety problems to bypass key Shuttle managers.<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />}}\n\n====Richard Feynman====\nOne of the commission's members was theoretical physicist [[Richard Feynman]].

Whereas NASA had held an internal inquiry into the [[Apollo 1]] fire in 1967, its actions after ''Challenger'' were more constrained by the judgment of outside bodies. The Rogers Commission offered nine recommendations on improving safety in the space shuttle program, and NASA was directed by President Reagan to report back within thirty days as to how it planned to implement those recommendations.<ref name=\"implementation report\">{{cite web| title = Report to the President: Actions to Implement the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|publisher=NASA| date=July 14, 1986| url = https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/actions.pdf }}</ref>\n\nWhen the disaster happened, the Air Force had performed extensive modifications of its [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|Space Launch Complex 6]] (SLC-6, pronounced as \"Slick Six\") at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California, for launch and landing operations of classified Shuttle launches of satellites in polar orbit, and was planning its first polar flight for October 15, 1986.

The ''Challenger'' loss motivated the Air Force to set in motion a chain of events that finally led to the May 13, 1988, decision to cancel its Vandenberg Shuttle launch plans in favor of the [[Titan IV]] uncrewed launch vehicle.\n\nIn response to the commission's recommendation, NASA initiated a total redesign of the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters, which was watched over by an independent oversight group as stipulated by the commission.<ref name=\"implementation report\"/> NASA's contract with [[Thiokol|Morton-Thiokol]], the contractor responsible for the solid rocket boosters, included a clause stating that in the event of a failure leading to \"loss of life or mission\", Thiokol would forfeit $10&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|10|1986|r=1|fmt=c}}{{nbsp}}million today) of its incentive fee and formally accept legal liability for the failure.

The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] (CAIB) concluded that NASA had failed to learn many of the lessons of ''Challenger''.

The shuttle had no individual ejection seats or a crew escape capsule.

He argues that if Morton-Thiokol engineers had more clearly presented the data that they had on the relationship between low temperatures and burn-through in the solid rocket booster joints, they might have succeeded in persuading NASA managers to cancel the launch. To demonstrate this, he took all of the data he claimed the engineers had presented during the briefing, and reformatted it onto a single graph of O-ring damage versus external launch temperature, showing the effects of cold on the degree of O-ring damage. Tufte then placed the proposed launch of ''Challenger'' on the graph according to its predicted temperature at launch. According to Tufte, the launch temperature of ''Challenger'' was so far below the coldest launch, with the worst damage seen to date, that even a casual observer could have determined that the risk of disaster was severe.<ref>[[Edward Tufte]]. (1997) ''Visual Explanations'', {{ISBN|978-0-9613921-2-3}}, Chapter 2.</ref>\n\nTufte has also argued that poor presentation of information may have also affected NASA decisions during the last flight of the space shuttle ''[[Columbia disaster|Columbia]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1|title= PowerPoint Does Rocket Science\u2014and Better Techniques for Technical Reports |accessdate=January 28, 2007 |author=Tufte, Edward}}</ref>\n\nBoisjoly, Wade Robison, a [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] professor, and their colleagues have vigorously repudiated Tufte's conclusions about the Morton-Thiokol engineers' role in the loss of ''Challenger''. First, they argue that the engineers didn't have the information available as Tufte claimed: \"But they did not know the temperatures even though they did try to obtain that information.

The large number of children who saw the accident live or in replays the same day was well known that day, and influenced the speech President Reagan gave that evening.\n\n{{Quote|text=I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff.

The majority of children's memories of ''Challenger'' were often clear and consistent, and even things like personal placement such as who they were with or what they were doing when they heard the news were remembered well. In one U.S. study, children's memories were recorded and tested again. Children on the East Coast recalled the event more easily than children on the West Coast, due to the time difference. Children on the East Coast either saw the explosion on TV while in school, or heard people talking about it. On the other side of the country, most children were either on their way to school, or just beginning their morning classes. Researchers found that those children who saw the explosion on TV had a more emotional connection to the event, and thus had an easier time remembering it. After one year the children's memories were tested, and those on the East Coast recalled the event better than their West Coast counterparts.

The shuttle carried a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS-C (named TDRS-3 after deployment), which replaced TDRS-B, the satellite that was launched and lost on ''Challenger''. The \"Return to Flight\" launch of ''Discovery'' also represented a test of the redesigned boosters, a shift to a more conservative stance on safety (being the first time the crew had launched in pressure suits since STS-4, the last of the four initial Shuttle test flights), and a chance to restore national pride in the American space program, especially crewed space flight. The mission, [[STS-26]], was a success (with only two minor system failures, one of a cabin cooling system and one of a Ku-band antenna), and a regular schedule of STS flights followed, continuing without extended interruption until the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|2003 ''Columbia'' disaster]].\n\n[[Barbara Morgan]], the backup for McAuliffe who trained with her in the Teacher in Space program and was at KSC watching her launch on January 28, 1986, flew on [[STS-118]] as a Mission Specialist in August 2007.\n\n=== Other civilian passenger plans ===\nNASA had intended to send a wide range of civilian passengers into space on subsequent flights.

It was in operation as a hotel as early as 1844. The building had been in poor repair for a number of years and was added to a list of the most endangered historic places in Texas in 2012. In 2013, the structure came under new ownership and was being restored for use as a private residence.\n\nAs of 2019, The Magnolia Hotel is a fully functioning hotel that can be rented out nightly.  Tours are also given.  It is touted as one of the most haunted hotels in Texas, and many ghost-hunting television shows have been hosted there.\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[Republic of Texas]], a two-room log cabin in [[Seguin, Texas]], sheltered travelers on the frontier as early as 1844, and became known as the Magnolia Hotel. An adjoining concrete building was erected by early 1846, and a larger, two-story frame building replaced the log cabin by 1853.\n\nThe Magnolia Hotel was included in the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (H.A.B.S.) in 1934, and contributes to the Seguin Commercial Historic District listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.\n\nThe Magnolia's [[limecrete]] section was built by [[John Park (inventor)|John Park]], a chemist and doctor who experimented with concrete after moving to Seguin in 1846. The hotel was  the first 'Park's concrete' building in town, and is surely the oldest still standing.<ref>{{citation|title=Bicentennial Minutes|publisher=Seguin Conservation Society|place=Seguin, Texas|year=1976}}</ref> Park's work, with his imitators and rivals, led to Seguin having the largest concentration of mid-19th century concrete structures in the United States.<ref>{{citation | last=Hauser | first=Vincent | date=May 1980 | title=''The Concrete Era of Seguin Texas'', p 54 and p 60 }}</ref>\n\nThe dating of the concrete hotel is established because Captain [[John Coffee Hays|Jack Hays]], \"perhaps the most famous [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]]\" according to Willie Mae Weinert's ''Authentic History of Guadalupe County'', married Susan Calvert, daughter of Jeremiah Strother Calvert, the hotel's owner, \"in the south room of the concrete portion of the hotel on April 29, 1847, Rev. John M. McCulloch presiding.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Weinert | first=Willie Mae | title=' 'An Authentic History of Guadalupe County' '| publisher=Seguin Conservation Society | year=1976}}</ref>\n\nPark's concrete building was next to a two-room cabin built of logs originally gathered by Seguin citizens to build a stockade as defense against possible Indian raids. The logs were instead sold to Texas Ranger James Campbell, and his cabin became the point of defense. The two-story frame building that now sits atop the large basement, replacing the Campbell cabin, dates from the early 1850s. It shows graceful [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] symmetry and detailing around the door, and a roof line similar to that of the concrete house known as [[Sebastopol State Historic Site|Sebastopol]] built 1854\u201356.\n\n[[Frederick Law Olmsted]] passed through Seguin in February 1854, and wrote about the town's many concrete buildings, noting, \"The hotel is large and good.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Olmsted | first=Frederick Law  | title=' 'A Journey Through Texas; Or, A Saddle-Trip On The Southwestern Frontier' ' | publisher=University of Texas | year=1978 }}</ref> That he made no mention of the hotel itself being of concrete implies that he was referring to the much larger wooden building, dating it to about 1853.\n\nJeremiah Calvert sold the property to Dr. William Read, a dentist who operated the hotel from 1850 to 1860, then Colonel Thomas Dickey Johnson and Katherine Calvert Johnston owned it until 1900. Together they encompassed the years when the Magnolia served as an overnight stop for [[stagecoach]]es making their runs from the coastal ports to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and points west. A young slave rang a bell to announce the stage's arrival, to summon guests at mealtime, and in emergencies. The stone the youngster stood on remains in place. The bell actually came from the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]], having been found in the [[San Antonio River]] in 1845 then brought to the hotel by John Twohig, and was used at the Magnolia until about 1900. A Seguin woman purchased the bell and donated it to the [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas]], then the managers of the Alamo shrine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/life/life_columnists/paula_allen/article/Old-bell-may-have-tolled-at-Alamo-4563064.php |title=Old bell may have tolled at Alamo - San Antonio Express-News |publisher=Mysanantonio.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>\n\nDuring the stagecoach years, from 1848 to about 1880, the Magnolia served as the stagecoach stop in Seguin. As such, the hotel served as a center of social life in the town, serving food, drink and hosting dances in the ballroom. Rival hotels, constructed of brick and boasting of \"fire-proof\" construction, opened in the last decade of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century displaced the Magnolia as the premier lodging in town.\n\nIn the 1930s, the property was bought by the Lannom couple, who lived downstairs and operated with small apartments upstairs for another 65 years or so.

It was in operation as a hotel as early as 1844. The building had been in poor repair for a number of years and was added to a list of the most endangered historic places in Texas in 2012. In 2013, the structure came under new ownership and was being restored for use as a private residence.\n\nAs of 2019, The Magnolia Hotel is a fully functioning hotel that can be rented out nightly.  Tours are also given.  It is touted as one of the most haunted hotels in Texas, and many ghost-hunting television shows have been hosted there.\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[Republic of Texas]], a two-room log cabin in [[Seguin, Texas]], sheltered travelers on the frontier as early as 1844, and became known as the Magnolia Hotel. An adjoining concrete building was erected by early 1846, and a larger, two-story frame building replaced the log cabin by 1853.\n\nThe Magnolia Hotel was included in the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (H.A.B.S.) in 1934, and contributes to the Seguin Commercial Historic District listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.\n\nThe Magnolia's [[limecrete]] section was built by [[John Park (inventor)|John Park]], a chemist and doctor who experimented with concrete after moving to Seguin in 1846. The hotel was  the first 'Park's concrete' building in town, and is surely the oldest still standing.<ref>{{citation|title=Bicentennial Minutes|publisher=Seguin Conservation Society|place=Seguin, Texas|year=1976}}</ref> Park's work, with his imitators and rivals, led to Seguin having the largest concentration of mid-19th century concrete structures in the United States.<ref>{{citation | last=Hauser | first=Vincent | date=May 1980 | title=''The Concrete Era of Seguin Texas'', p 54 and p 60 }}</ref>\n\nThe dating of the concrete hotel is established because Captain [[John Coffee Hays|Jack Hays]], \"perhaps the most famous [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]]\" according to Willie Mae Weinert's ''Authentic History of Guadalupe County'', married Susan Calvert, daughter of Jeremiah Strother Calvert, the hotel's owner, \"in the south room of the concrete portion of the hotel on April 29, 1847, Rev. John M. McCulloch presiding.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Weinert | first=Willie Mae | title=' 'An Authentic History of Guadalupe County' '| publisher=Seguin Conservation Society | year=1976}}</ref>\n\nPark's concrete building was next to a two-room cabin built of logs originally gathered by Seguin citizens to build a stockade as defense against possible Indian raids. The logs were instead sold to Texas Ranger James Campbell, and his cabin became the point of defense. The two-story frame building that now sits atop the large basement, replacing the Campbell cabin, dates from the early 1850s. It shows graceful [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] symmetry and detailing around the door, and a roof line similar to that of the concrete house known as [[Sebastopol State Historic Site|Sebastopol]] built 1854-56.\n\n[[Frederick Law Olmsted]] passed through Seguin in February 1854, and wrote about the town's many concrete buildings, noting, \"The hotel is large and good.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Olmsted | first=Frederick Law  | title=' 'A Journey Through Texas; Or, A Saddle-Trip On The Southwestern Frontier' ' | publisher=University of Texas | year=1978 }}</ref> That he made no mention of the hotel itself being of concrete implies that he was referring to the much larger wooden building, dating it to about 1853.\n\nJeremiah Calvert sold the property to Dr. William Read, a dentist who operated the hotel from 1850 to 1860, then Colonel Thomas Dickey Johnson and Katherine Calvert Johnston owned it until 1900. Together they encompassed the years when the Magnolia served as an overnight stop for [[stagecoach]]es making their runs from the coastal ports to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and points west. A young slave rang a bell to announce the stage's arrival, to summon guests at mealtime, and in emergencies. The stone the youngster stood on remains in place. The bell actually came from the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]], having been found in the [[San Antonio River]] in 1845 then brought to the hotel by John Twohig, and was used at the Magnolia until about 1900. A Seguin woman purchased the bell and donated it to the [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas]], then the managers of the Alamo shrine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/life/life_columnists/paula_allen/article/Old-bell-may-have-tolled-at-Alamo-4563064.php |title=Old bell may have tolled at Alamo - San Antonio Express-News |publisher=Mysanantonio.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>\n\nDuring the stagecoach years, from 1848 to about 1880, the Magnolia served as the stagecoach stop in Seguin. As such, the hotel served as a center of social life in the town, serving food, drink and hosting dances in the ballroom. Rival hotels, constructed of brick and boasting of \"fire-proof\" construction, opened in the last decade of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century displaced the Magnolia as the premier lodging in town.\n\nIn the 1930s, the property was bought by the Lannom couple, who lived downstairs and operated with small apartments upstairs for another 65 years or so. The building fell into disrepair, leading Preservation Texas to list it among the state's \"Most Endangered Historic Places\" in March 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationtexas.org/2012-texas-most-endangered-places/ |title=2012 Texas\u2019 Most Endangered Places |publisher=Preservation Texas |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref> On March 1, 2013, Jim Ghedi and Erin O Wallace-Ghedi purchased the building and have privately funded the restoration bringing it back to its original state.
