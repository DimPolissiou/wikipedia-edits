It stars [[Kriti Sanon]] and [[Sushant Singh Rajput]], with [[Jim Sarbh]], [[Rajkumar Yadav]] and [[Varun Sharma]] in supporting roles. The story is based on the concept of [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] [[star-crossed lovers]]. ''Raabta'' released on 9 June 2017 at a budget of {{INR|450 million}}. It underperformed at the box office, grossing {{INR|398 million}} worldwide, and was termed a \"disaster\" by [[Box Office India]].\n\n==Plot==\nShiv Kakkar ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]) is a young man from [[Amritsar]] who gets a lucrative opportunity to work in [[Budapest]] for a job as a banker, and lives with his friend, Radha ([[Varun Sharma]]). Shiv is shown to have been a fun-loving womanizer back home and continues this behaviour in Budapest. Saira Singh ([[Kriti Sanon]]), a young woman, is haunted by mysterious nightmares of drowning to death. She lives by herself in Budapest and works as a chocolatier. Shiv happens to stumble upon Saira's shop while on a date with a woman, but finds himself deeply attracted to Saira. Though she initially rejects his advances, she eventually succumbs and sleeps with Shiv, revealing the next day that she actually has a boyfriend and what happened with Shiv was a mistake. Unwilling to let go of their connection, Shiv interrupts Saira's date with her boyfriend Manav ([[Vikas Verma]]) and shows her that she would rather be with him than with her boyfriend. Manav breaks up with her, and Shiv and Saira start spending time together, growing close. One night, they go to a club with Radha, where they happen to meet an eccentric psychic who knows about Saira's nightmares and tells her that the events of her previous life will repeat themselves, and only she can fix them. Saira tearfully reveals to Shiv that she has a fear of water because her parents drowned after a car accident when she was two years old.\n\nWhile trying to test their love a final time, Shiv and Saira make a pact. Shiv flirts with multiple women, but Saira finds herself strongly drawn to a young businessman Zakir \"Zack\" Merchant ([[Jim Sarbh]]). Shiv reveals he has to leave for a business trip for a week and he and Saira decide to see how they feel after a week's separation. If they still feel strongly about each other, they will start considering marriage. During Shiv's absence, Saira gets to know Zakir better and confides in him about her nightmares. During one of their dinners, Zakir drugs Saira and kidnaps her.\n\nSaira wakes up and finds herself trapped in Zakir's isolated mansion on an island off the coast. She demands him to let her go, but he refuses, saying that he spent his whole life looking for her. He explains that he was madly in love with her in a previous life but his love remained unrequited. He refuses to let go of her again. When she does not believe him, he shows her a collection of uncannily accurate paintings he made of her at various ages and says she will find the explanation for her nightmares. Thinking he is crazy, she attempts to escape but ends up falling into the ocean, which triggers the memories of her previous life.\n\nThree hundred years ago, Saira was warrior princess Saiba. She had a childhood best friend Kabir ([[Jim Sarbh]]), a fellow warrior from her tribe who was in love with her. Their kingdom was threatened by the Muraakis, led by a wise, old Rajput ruler Muwwaqqil ([[Rajkummar Rao]]). Qaabir is severely wounded by the fierce warrior Jilaan ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]), who gives Qaabir an ultimatum to surrender. Saiba challenges Jilaan, and they find themselves attracted to each other. Saiba accepts defeat, surrendering the kingdom to the Muraakis and herself to Jilaan. Qaabir attempts to take Saiba back, but she reveals that she and Jilaan are in love. On their wedding night, a [[comet]] falls and Muwwaqqil realizes that this will be a fateful night. Qaabir ambushes Jilaan and Saiba, and murders Jilaan by wounding him and throws him in the ocean. Saiba jumps into the ocean to save him, but to no avail. Heartbroken on seeing Jilaan die, Saiba who is also heartbroken decides to drown too. On seeing Saiba dead, Qaabir slits his own throat, killing himself. Muwwaqqil forebodes that these events will repeat.\n\nHowever, this time, when Shiv shows up, Saira decides to fight back against Zakir. When their previous lives' events repeat, Zakir throwing Shiv into the ocean, Shiv drags Zakir down with him and Zakir dies. Saira jumps into the water and is able to save Shiv.\n\nThe film ends with Shiv humorously telling their children to not to believe Saira if she tells them any far-fetched stories about reincarnation, implying that he is still oblivious to the events of their previous lives.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sushant Singh Rajput]] as Jilaan/Shiv Kakkar\n* [[Kriti Sanon]] as Saiba/Saira Singh\n* [[Jim Sarbh]] as Kabir/Zakir \"Zak\" Merchant\n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Radha, Shiv's friend\n* [[Vikas Verma]] as Manav Mehta\n* [[Rajkummar Rao]] as Muwwaqqil\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] in a special appearance in the title track\n\n==Production ==\nThe film production began in 2015 and it was set to release in 2016.

Museum specimen]]\nBrazilian three-banded armadillos have a head-and-body length of about {{convert|22|to|27|cm|abbr=on}} and the tail is between {{convert|6|and|8|cm|abbr=on}} long. They weigh {{convert|1|-|1.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=ArmOn>Armadillo Online: ''[http://armadillo-online.org/tolypeutes.html Tolypeutes tricinctus.]'' Retrieved 14 June 2014.</ref> The armor is composed of [[ossification|ossified dermal scutes]] covered by nonoverlapping, [[keratinization|keratinized]] epidermal scales, which are connected by flexible bands of skin. This armor covers the back, sides, head, tail, ears, and outside surfaces of the legs. The underside of the body and the inner surfaces of the legs have no armored protection, and are covered instead by long, coarse hair. The [[genus]] ''Tolypeutes'', which includes both the Brazilian and southern species of three-banded armadillos, is unique in the ability to roll up in a tight, almost impenetrable ball. This is because their armor is slightly looser than that of other armadillo genera, which allows for greater freedom of movement. The loose armor also creates a layer of air between the shell and the body, which insulates the animal. This higher capacity for [[thermoregulation]] allows them to survive in climates too arid for some of the other armadillo species. When the armadillo rolls into a defensive ball, the ears are tucked into the shell and the head and tail interlock to seal the shell completely. The teeth are soft and peg-like, adapted solely for smashing the exoskeletons of insects.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Brazilian three-banded armadillo (Tolypeutes tricinctus) 2, Natural History Museum, London, Mammals Gallery.JPG|thumb|200px|left|''Tolypeutes tricinctus'' rolled into a defensive ball]]\nArmadillos are chiefly solitary, but this species will occasionally travel in small family groups of up to three members. They are largely nocturnal, but have been known to forage during the day. All the armadillos are spectacular diggers, but unlike most of the other species, three-banded armadillos do not dig in defense or to find shelter. They prefer to rest under bushes, rather than dig burrows, and their ability to roll into a ball makes defensive digging unnecessary. When they are not foraging, they move with a sort of trot, bouncing on the tips of their front toes, while their hind feet slap flatly on the ground. They mark their territories with secretions from glands on their face, feet, and rump. When threatened, they occasionally do not seal their armor completely, but wait until they are touched. They then quickly snap shut in an effort to startle the predator.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />\n\n==Reproduction==\nThe mating season lasts from October to January, during which there is a brief courtship before mating. The female carries the young for a [[gestation period]] of 120 days at the end of which single, blind offspring is born. The newborn\u2019s armor is soft, but its claws are fully developed, and it can walk and roll into a ball within hours of birth. The armor hardens by the third or fourth week, around the same time the eyes and earflaps open. The young armadillo is weaned at 10 weeks and reaches sexual maturity at 9\u201312 months.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />\n\n==Threats==\nThe defense system of the Brazilian three-banded armadillo makes it safe from the majority of predators. Adult [[Cougar|pumas]] and [[jaguar]]s are the only [[South America]]n mammals powerful enough to be a natural threat. The real danger to armadillos is the destruction of their habitats to make room for [[livestock]].<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />\n\n==2014 FIFA World Cup mascot==\nThe Caatinga Association, a Brazilian environmental NGO, launched in January 2012 a national campaign proposing the three-banded armadillo to become mascot of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Brazil.  In March 2012, the Brazilian weekly, [[Veja (magazine)|''Veja'']], reported the three-banded armadillo would be [[Fuleco|the official mascot]] for the FIFA World Cup.

This is because their armor is slightly looser than that of other armadillo genera, which allows for greater freedom of movement. The loose armor also creates a layer of air between the shell and the body, which insulates the animal. This higher capacity for [[thermoregulation]] allows them to survive in climates too arid for some of the other armadillo species. When the armadillo rolls into a defensive ball, the ears are tucked into the shell and the head and tail interlock to seal the shell completely. The teeth are soft and peg-like, adapted solely for smashing the exoskeletons of insects.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Brazilian three-banded armadillo (Tolypeutes tricinctus) 2, Natural History Museum, London, Mammals Gallery.JPG|thumb|200px|left|''Tolypeutes tricinctus'' rolled into a defensive ball]]\nArmadillos are chiefly solitary, but this species will occasionally travel in small family groups of up to three members. They are largely nocturnal, but have been known to forage during the day. All the armadillos are spectacular diggers, but unlike most of the other species, three-banded armadillos do not dig in defense or to find shelter. They prefer to rest under bushes, rather than dig burrows, and their ability to roll into a ball makes defensive digging unnecessary. When they are not foraging, they move with a sort of trot, bouncing on the tips of their front toes, while their hind feet slap flatly on the ground. They mark their territories with secretions from glands on their face, feet, and rump. When threatened, they occasionally do not seal their armor completely, but wait until they are touched. They then quickly snap shut in an effort to startle the predator.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />\n\n==Reproduction==\nThe mating season lasts from October to January, during which there is a brief courtship before mating. The female carries the young for a [[gestation period]] of 120 days at the end of which single, blind offspring is born. The newborn\u2019s armor is soft, but its claws are fully developed, and it can walk and roll into a ball within hours of birth. The armor hardens by the third or fourth week, around the same time the eyes and earflaps open. The young armadillo is weaned at 10 weeks and reaches sexual maturity at 9\u201312 months.<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />\n\n==Threats==\nThe defense system of the Brazilian three-banded armadillo makes it safe from the majority of predators. Adult [[Cougar|pumas]] and [[jaguar]]s are the only [[South America]]n mammals powerful enough to be a natural threat. The real danger to armadillos is the destruction of their habitats to make room for [[livestock]].<ref name=\"Wildlife Explorer\" />\n\n==2014 FIFA World Cup mascot==\nThe Caatinga Association, a Brazilian environmental NGO, launched in January 2012 a national campaign proposing the three-banded armadillo to become mascot of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Brazil.  In March 2012, the Brazilian weekly, [[Veja (magazine)|''Veja'']], reported the three-banded armadillo would be [[Fuleco|the official mascot]] for the FIFA World Cup. Official announcement came in September 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fifa faz registro e confirma tatu-bola como mascote da Copa de 2014|url=http://espn.estadao.com.br/noticia/280876_fifa-faz-registro-e-confirma-tatu-bola-como-mascote-da-copa-de-2014|accessdate=11 September 2012|newspaper=[[ESPN]]|date=11 September 2012|language=Portuguese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913043133/http://espn.estadao.com.br/noticia/280876_fifa-faz-registro-e-confirma-tatu-bola-como-mascote-da-copa-de-2014|archivedate=13 September 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Tolypeutes tricinctus}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline|Tolypeutes tricinctus}}\n* [http://www.natureserve.org/infonatura/ Infonatura]\n* {{MSW3 Gardner|pages=99}}\n* ''World Cup Mascot''.
