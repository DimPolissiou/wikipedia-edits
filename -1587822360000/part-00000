It was created in 1800 for [[Charles Loftus, 1st Marquess of Ely|Charles Loftus, 1st Earl of Ely]]. He was born Charles Tottenham, the son of Sir John Tottenham, 1st Baronet, who had been created a [[baronet]], of Tottenham Green in the County of Wexford, in the [[Baronetage of Ireland]] in 1780,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=12140 |date=2 December 1780 |page=3}}</ref> by Elizabeth, daughter of [[Nicholas Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus]], sister and heiress of [[Henry Loftus, 1st Earl of Ely]] (see [[Viscount Loftus]] and [[Earl of Ely]] for earlier history of the Loftus family). In 1783 he succeeded to the Loftus estates on the death of his maternal uncle the Earl of Ely and assumed the same year by Royal licence the surname of Loftus in lieu of his patronymic. In 1785 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as '''Baron Loftus''', of [[Loftus Hall]] in the [[County Wexford|County of Wexford]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=12661 |date=5 July 1785 |page=322}}</ref> It was sold by the family in 1917 and is today owned by the Quigley family.\n\nHe was further honoured when he was made '''Viscount Loftus''', of Ely, in 1789,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=13156 |date=12 December 1789 |page=773}}</ref> '''Earl of Ely''', in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], in 1794,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=13630 |date=11 March 1794 |page=215}}</ref> and '''Marquess of Ely''', of the County of Wexford, in 1800,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=15326 |date=10 January 1801 |page=40}}</ref> all in the Peerage of Ireland, becoming one of the few persons to rise to the rank of Marquess without having inherited any peerages. In 1801 he was created '''Baron Loftus''', of Long Loftus in the [[Yorkshire|County of York]], in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=15327 |date=13 January 1801 |page=55}}</ref> by which title the Marquesses of Ely sat in the [[House of Lords]] until the passage of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]]. Lord Ely also succeeded his father as second Baronet in 1786.\n\nLord Ely was succeeded by his eldest son, John, the second Marquess. He had previously represented County Wexford in both the Irish and British Parliaments. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, John, the third Marquess. He briefly represented [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodstock]] in Parliament in 1845. This line of the family failed on the early death of his son, John, the fourth Marquess, in 1889. The late Marquess was succeeded by his first cousin John Loftus, the fifth Marquess. He was the eldest son of Reverend Lord Adam Loftus, third son of the second Marquess. The fifth Marquess died childless in 1925 and was succeeded by his youngest brother, George, the sixth Marquess. The latter's only surviving son, George, the seventh Marquess, was [[High Sheriff]] of [[County Fermanagh]]. On his death in 1969 without surviving children the line of the second Marquess failed. The late Marquess was succeeded by his third cousin once removed, Charles Tottenham, who became the eighth Marquess. He was the great-grandson of [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] Charles John Tottenham, [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]], [[Justice of the Peace|JP]], eldest son of the Right Reverend [[Lord Robert Tottenham]] (who had not assumed the surname Loftus), second son of the first Marquess. The eighth Marquess lived in [[Canada]]. As of 2014 the titles are held by his eldest son, the ninth Marquess, who succeeded in 2006. As of 28 February 2014 the present Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baronetage.org/official-roll-of-the-baronets/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306051137/http://www.baronetage.org/official-roll-of-the-baronets/ |archivedate=2015-03-06 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral other members of the family may also be mentioned.

There were many different electrical telegraph systems invented, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories.  The first category consists of [[needle telegraph]]s in which a needle pointer is made to move electromagnetically with a pulse of [[electric current]] from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[dynamo]] down the telegraph line.  Early systems used multiple needles requiring multiple wires.  The first commercial system, and the most widely used needle telegraph, was the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], invented in 1837.  Early equipment sets used five needles to point to the letter being transmitted, but the cost of installing wires was more economically significant than the cost of training operators so a single-needle system with a code that had to be learned became the norm.\n\nThe second category consists of armature systems in which the pulse activates a [[telegraph sounder]] which makes a click.  The archetype of this category was the Morse system, invented by [[Samuel Morse]] in 1838, using a single wire.  At the sending station, an operator would tap on a switch called a [[telegraph key]], spelling out text messages in [[Morse code]].  Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly.  In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication with a modified code developed for German railways.  However, some countries continued to use established national systems internally for some time afterwards.\n\nIn the 1840s the electrical telegraph superseded [[optical telegraph]] systems (except in France), becoming the standard way to send urgent messages.  By the latter half of the century, most developed nations had created commercial telegraph networks with local [[telegraph office]]s in most cities and towns, allowing the public to send messages called [[telegram]]s addressed to any person in the country, for a fee.  Beginning in 1854 [[submarine telegraph cable]]s allowed for the first rapid communication between continents. Electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.<ref>{{Citation|last= Tancia |title= A History of Telegraphy |year= 2014 |url= https://www.pens.co.uk/pen2paper/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-History-of-Telegraphy.pdf }}</ref>  In the early 20th century the telegraph was slowly replaced by [[Teleprinter|teletype]] networks.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic communication topics]] -->\n\n===Early work===\n[[File:Soemmerring 1810 telegraph overview.jpg|thumb|S\u00f6mmering's electric telegraph in 1809]]\nFrom early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to [[communication]]s at a distance. All the known effects of electricity\u2014such as [[electric spark|sparks]], [[electrostatic attraction]], [[chemical change]]s, [[electric shock]]s, and later [[electromagnetism]]\u2014were applied to the problems of detecting controlled transmissions of electricity at various distances.<ref>Fahie, p.?</ref>\n\t\nIn 1753, an anonymous writer in the ''[[Scots Magazine]]'' suggested an electrostatic telegraph. Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of [[pith]] balls at the far end.<ref>E. A. Marland, ''Early Electrical Communication'', Abelard-Schuman Ltd, London 1964, no ISBN, Library of Congress 64-20875, pages 17-19;</ref> The writer has never been positively identified, but the letter was signed C.M. and posted from [[Renfrew]] leading to a Charles Marshall of Renfrew being suggested.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 203</ref> Telegraphs employing electrostatic attraction were the basis of early experiments in electrical telegraphy in Europe, but were abandoned as being impractical and were never developed into a useful communication system.<ref>{{Citation | title = Electromagnetic Telegraph - Invented by Baron Pavel Schilling | url = http://www.edubilla.com/invention/electrical-telegraph/ }}</ref>\n\nIn 1774, [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] realised an early electric telegraph. The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] and its range was only between two rooms of his home.<ref>Prevost, 1805, pp. 176-178</ref>\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], allowing for a [[continuous current]] of [[electricity]] for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an [[electrostatic generator|electrostatic machine]], which with [[Leyden jar]]s were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity.\n\t \t\nAnother very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].{{sfn|Jones|1999}} Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each letter of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message.{{sfn|Jones|1999}} This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return).\n\t \t\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle. In the same year [[Johann Schweigger]] invented the [[galvanometer]], with a coil of wire around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current.<ref>M. (10 December 2014). Schweigger Multiplier \u2013 1820. Retrieved 7 February 2018, from https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/history-of-electricity-magnetism/museum/schweigger-multiplier</ref> In 1821, [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] suggested that telegraphy could be achieved by placing small magnets under the ends of a set of wires, one pair of wires for each letter of the alphabet. He was apparently unaware of Schweigger's invention at the time, which would have made his system much more sensitive. In 1825, [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] tried Amp\u00e8re's idea but only got it to work over {{convert|200|ft|m}} and declared it impractical. In 1830 [[William Ritchie (physicist)|William Ritchie]] improved on Amp\u00e8re's design by placing the magnetic needles inside a coil of wire connected to each pair of conductors. He successfully demonstrated it, showing the feasibility of the electromagnetic telegraph, but only within a lecture hall.<ref>Fahie, pp. 302\u2013306</ref>\n\t \t\nIn 1825, [[William Sturgeon]] invented the [[electromagnet]], with a single winding of uninsulated wire on a piece of varnished [[iron]], which increased the magnetic force produced by electric current. [[Joseph Henry]] improved it in 1828 by placing several windings of insulated wire around the bar, creating a much more powerful electromagnet which could operate a telegraph through the high resistance of long telegraph wires.<ref>{{cite book|title= Technology and Society| author=R.

The receiving instrument consisted of six [[galvanometer]]s with magnetic needles, suspended from [[silk]] [[Yarn|threads]]. Both stations of Schilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the [[galvanometer]]s, one served for the return current and one for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions of black and white flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus by reducing the number of connecting wires from eight to two.\n\t \t\nOn 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]]. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] and the naval base at [[Kronstadt]]. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=54}} Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the [[binary coding|binary]] system of signal transmission.\n\t\nIn 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], together with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] installed a {{convert|1200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the [[Schweigger multiplier|Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator]] with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the [[galvanometer]]. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.\n\n[[File:Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G.png|thumb|left|Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G]]At first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals and finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code which was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss' laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Germany.\n\nGauss was convinced that this communication would be a help to his kingdom's towns. Later in the same year, instead of a [[Voltaic pile]], Gauss used an [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university did not have the funds to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. [[Carl August Steinheil]] in [[Munich]] was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835\u20131836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.  Steinheil built a telegraph along the [[Nuremberg - F\u00fcrth railway line]] in 1838, the first [[earth-return telegraph]] put into service.\n\nBy 1837, [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] had co-developed a [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|telegraph system]] which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. In May 1837 they patented their system. The patent recommended five needles, which coded twenty of the alphabet's 26 letters.\n\n[[File:Wallace Study-Telegraph.jpg|thumb|Morse key and sounder]]\n[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837. Morse's assistant [[Alfred Vail]] developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet.{{sfn|Calvert|2008}} Morse and Vail developed the [[Morse code]] signalling [[alphabet]].

System, used mostly on private wires. This consisted of a \"communicator\" at the sending end and an \"indicator\" at the receiving end. The communicator consisted of a circular dial with a pointer and the 26 letters of the alphabet (and four punctuation marks) around its circumference. Against each letter was a key that could be pressed. A transmission would begin with the pointers on the dials at both ends set to the start position. The transmitting operator would then press down the key corresponding to the letter to be transmitted. In the base of the communicator was a [[magneto]] actuated by a handle on the front. This would be turned to apply an alternating voltage to the line. Each half cycle of the current would move the pointers at both ends on by one position. When the pointer reached the position of the depressed key, it would stop and the magneto would be disconnected from the line. The communicator's pointer was geared to the magneto mechanism. The indicator's pointer was moved by a polarised electromagnet whose [[Armature (electrical)|armature]] was coupled to it through an [[escapement]]. Thus the alternating line voltage moved the indicator's pointer on to the position of the depressed key on the communicator. Pressing another key would then release the pointer and the previous key, and re-connect the magneto to the line. These machines were very robust and simple to operate, and they stayed in use in Britain until well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |last= Freebody |first= J.

With different codes, additional operators were required to translate and retransmit the message.  In 1865, a conference in Paris adopted Gerke's code as the International Morse code and was henceforth the international standard.  The US, however, continued to use [[American Morse code]] internally for some time, hence international messages required retransmission in both directions.<ref>Andrew L.

They had an extensive [[optical telegraph]] system built during the [[Napoleonic era]].  There was also serious concern that an electrical telegraph could be quickly put out of action by enemy saboteurs, something that was much more difficult to do with optical telegraphs which had no exposed hardware between stations.  The [[Foy-Breguet telegraph]] was eventually adopted.  This was a two-needle system using two signal wires, but displayed in a uniquely different way to other needle telegraphs.  The needles made symbols similar to the Chappe optical system symbols, making it more familiar to the telegraph operators.  The optical system was decommissioned starting in 1846, but not completed until 1855.  In that year the Foy-Breguet system was replaced with the Morse system.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\n===Expansion===\nAs well as the rapid expansion of the use of the telegraphs along the railways, they soon spread into the field of mass communication with the instruments being installed in [[post office]]s.

Proce Wellcome V0025510.jpg|thumb|left|Wheatstone automated telegraph network equipment]]\nA continuing goal in telegraphy was to reduce the cost per message by reducing hand-work, or increasing the sending rate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} There were many experiments with moving pointers, and various electrical encodings. However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of [[telegraphese]].\n\nThe first system that didn't require skilled technicians to operate, was Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 16 and a half words per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications, Mercer University Press, 1992. 69.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period, starting with the New York\u2013Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a \"sounder\", an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks. The message was then written out in long-hand.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications. Mercer University Press, 1992. 67</ref>\n\n[[Royal Earl House]] developed and patented a letter-printing telegraph system in 1846 which employed an alphabetic keyboard for the transmitter and automatically printed the letters on paper at the receiver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/14/letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-4464/|title=Royal Earl House Printing-Telegraph Patent #4464, 1846|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> and followed this up with a steam-powered version in 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/15/steam-powered-letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-9505/|title=Royal Earl House Steam-Powered Printing-Telegraph Patent #9505, 1852|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> Advocates of printing telegraphy said it would eliminate Morse operators' errors.

The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n====Teleprinters====\n{{main|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|right|A Creed Model 7 teleprinter in 1930]]\n[[File:Teletype-IMG 7289.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Teletype Model 33]] ASR (Automatic Send and Receive)]]\nAn early successful [[teleprinter]] was invented by [[Frederick G. Creed]]. In [[Glasgow]] he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.\n\nWith the invention of the [[teletypewriter]], telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]].\n\nIn the 1930s teleprinters were produced by [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] in the US, [[Creed & Company|Creed]] in Britain and [[Siemens]] in Germany.\n\nBy 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters. These resulting system was called \"Telex\" (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style [[pulse dialling]] for [[circuit switching]], and then sent data by [[ITA2]]. This \"type A\" Telex routing functionally automated message routing.\n\nThe first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as a network used to communicate within the government.\n\nAt the rate of 45.45 (\u00b10.5%) [[baud]] \u2014 considered speedy at the time \u2014 up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using ''[[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]]'', making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.\n\nAutomatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by [[CPR Telegraphs]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 and in 1958, [[Western Union]] started to build a Telex network in the United States.<ref>Phillip R. Easterlin, \"Telex in New York\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45</ref>\n\n====The harmonic telegraph====\n{{main|Invention of the telephone}}\n{{see also|Acoustic telegraphy}}\nThe most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation \u2013 the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. Early devices included the [[duplex (telegraph)|duplex]] and the [[Quadruplex telegraph|quadruplex]] which allowed, respectively, one or two telegraph transmissions in each direction.  However, an even greater number of channels was desired on the busiest lines.  In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Elisha Gray]], and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].\n\nOne approach was to have resonators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal.  This was the harmonic telegraph, a form of [[Multiplexing#Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division multiplexing]]. These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of resonators.\n\nWith a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the [[invention of the telephone]]. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry 25,000 telephone signals simultaneously down a single fiber.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.explainthatstuff.com/fiberoptics.html |title = How does fiber optics work?}}</ref>)\n\n===Oceanic telegraph cables===\n[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|right|thumb|333px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]\n{{Main|Transatlantic telegraph cable||Submarine communications cable}}\nSoon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of [[submarine communications cable]]s was first proposed.

[[Michael Faraday]] and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]]. Gutta-percha was used as insulation on a wire laid across the [[Rhine]] between [[Cologne-Deutz|Deutz]] and [[Cologne]].<ref>Bright, Charles (1898).

In 1854, the government in London created a military Telegraph Detachment for the Army commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Engineers]]. It was to comprise twenty-five men from the Royal Corps of Sappers & Miners trained by the Electric Telegraph Company to construct and work the first field electric telegraph.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |title = Distant Writing A History of Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838 and 1868: 16.

When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours. The daily news reports energised public opinion, which brought down the government and led to Lord Palmerston becoming prime minister.{{sfn|Figes|2010|pp=304\u201311}}\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] the telegraph proved its value as a tactical, operational, and strategic communication medium and an important contributor to Union victory.<ref>{{Citation |last= Hochfelder |first= David |title= Essential Civil WAR Curriculum: The Telegraph |publisher= Virginia Center for Civil War Studies at Virginia Tech |year= 2019 |url= https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-telegraph.html }}</ref> By contrast the Confederacy failed to make effective use of the South's much smaller telegraph network. Prior to the War the telegraph systems were primarily used in the commercial sector. Government buildings were not inter-connected with telegraph lines, but relied on runners to carry messages back and forth.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} Before the war the Government saw no need to connect lines within city limits, however, they did see the use in connections between cities. Washington D.C. being the hub of government, it had the most connections, but there were only a few lines running north and south out of the city.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} It wasn't until the Civil War that the government saw the true potential of the telegraph system. Soon after the shelling of [[Fort Sumter]], the South cut telegraph lines running into D.C., which put the city in a state of panic because they feared an immediate Southern invasion.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}}\n\nWithin 6 months of the start of the war, the [[U.S. Military Telegraph Corps]] (USMT) had laid approximately 300 miles of line. By war's end they had laid approximately 15,000 miles of line, 8,000 for military and 5,000 for commercial use, and had handled approximately 6.5 million messages. The telegraph was not only important for communication within the armed forces, but also in the civilian sector, helping political leaders to maintain control over their districts.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nEven before the war, the [[American Telegraph Company]] censored suspect messages informally to block aid to the secession movement. During the war, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]], and later [[Edwin Stanton]], wanted control over the telegraph lines to maintain the flow of information. Early in the war, one of Stanton's first acts as Secretary of War was to move telegraph lines from ending at [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] headquarters to terminating at the War Department. Stanton himself said \"[telegraphy] is my right arm\". Telegraphy assisted Northern victories, including the [[Battle of Antietam]] (1862), the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (1863), and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] (1865).{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nThe telegraph system still had its flaws. The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between Generals and their operators. One source of irritation was that USMT operators did not have to follow military authority. Usually they performed without hesitation, but they were not required to, so [[Albert J. Myer|Albert Myer]] created a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in February 1863. As the new head of the Signal Corps, Myer tried to get all telegraph and flag signaling under his command, and therefore subject to military discipline. After creating the Signal Corps, Myer pushed to further develop new telegraph systems. While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp's new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT's system.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\n===First World War===\nDuring [[World War I]], Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.{{sfn|Kennedy|1971}} The British government censored telegraph cable companies in an effort to root out espionage and restrict financial transactions with Central Powers nations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hills|first=Jill|date=June 2006|title=What's New?

The Germans developed a highly complex teleprinter attachment (German: ''Schl\u00fcssel-Zusatz'') that was used for enciphering telegrams between German High Command ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]) and the army groups in the field. These contained situation reports, battle plans, and discussions of strategy and tactics.

Western Union was the leading telegraph provider for America and was seen as the best competition for the [[Bell Telephone Company|National Bell Telephone Company]]. Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union's decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union's upper management's failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system. Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nWhile the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time. Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphy as the long-range communication of choice. However, due to the underestimates of telegraph's future{{explain|date=October 2019}} and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}} [[AT&T]] acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action.

There were many different electrical telegraph systems invented, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories.  The first category consists of [[needle telegraph]]s in which a needle pointer is made to move electromagnetically with a pulse of [[electric current]] from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[dynamo]] down the telegraph line.  Early systems used multiple needles requiring multiple wires.  The first commercial system, and the most widely used needle telegraph, was the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], invented in 1837.  Early equipment sets used five needles to point to the letter being transmitted, but the cost of installing wires was more economically significant than the cost of training operators so a single-needle system with a code that had to be learned became the norm.\n\nThe second category consists of armature systems in which the pulse activates a [[telegraph sounder]] which makes a click.  The archetype of this category was the Morse system, invented by [[Samuel Morse]] in 1838, using a single wire.  At the sending station, an operator would tap on a switch called a [[telegraph key]], spelling out text messages in [[Morse code]].  Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly.  In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication with a modified code developed for German railways.  However, some countries continued to use established national systems internally for some time afterwards.\n\nIn the 1840s the electrical telegraph superseded [[optical telegraph]] systems (except in France), becoming the standard way to send urgent messages.  By the latter half of the century, most developed nations had created commercial telegraph networks with local [[telegraph office]]s in most cities and towns, allowing the public to send messages called [[telegram]]s addressed to any person in the country, for a fee.  Beginning in 1854 [[submarine telegraph cable]]s allowed for the first rapid communication between continents. Electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.<ref>{{Citation|last= Tancia |title= A History of Telegraphy |year= 2014 |url= https://www.pens.co.uk/pen2paper/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-History-of-Telegraphy.pdf }}</ref>  In the early 20th century the telegraph was slowly replaced by [[Teleprinter|teletype]] networks.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic communication topics]] -->\n\n===Early work===\n[[File:Soemmerring 1810 telegraph overview.jpg|thumb|S\u00f6mmering's electric telegraph in 1809]]\nFrom early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to [[communication]]s at a distance. All the known effects of electricity\u2014such as [[electric spark|sparks]], [[electrostatic attraction]], [[chemical change]]s, [[electric shock]]s, and later [[electromagnetism]]\u2014were applied to the problems of detecting controlled transmissions of electricity at various distances.<ref>Fahie, p.?</ref>\n\t\nIn 1753, an anonymous writer in the ''[[Scots Magazine]]'' suggested an electrostatic telegraph. Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of [[pith]] balls at the far end.<ref>E.

The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] and its range was only between two rooms of his home.<ref>Prevost, 1805, pp. 176-178</ref>\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], allowing for a [[continuous current]] of [[electricity]] for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an [[electrostatic generator|electrostatic machine]], which with [[Leyden jar]]s were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity.\n\t \t\nAnother very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].{{sfn|Jones|1999}} Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each letter of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message.{{sfn|Jones|1999}} This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return).\n\t \t\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle. In the same year [[Johann Schweigger]] invented the [[galvanometer]], with a coil of wire around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current.<ref>M.

He was apparently unaware of Schweigger's invention at the time, which would have made his system much more sensitive. In 1825, [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] tried Amp\u00e8re's idea but only got it to work over {{convert|200|ft|m}} and declared it impractical. In 1830 [[William Ritchie (physicist)|William Ritchie]] improved on Amp\u00e8re's design by placing the magnetic needles inside a coil of wire connected to each pair of conductors. He successfully demonstrated it, showing the feasibility of the electromagnetic telegraph, but only within a lecture hall.<ref>Fahie, pp. 302\u2013306</ref>\n\t \t\nIn 1825, [[William Sturgeon]] invented the [[electromagnet]], with a single winding of uninsulated wire on a piece of varnished [[iron]], which increased the magnetic force produced by electric current. [[Joseph Henry]] improved it in 1828 by placing several windings of insulated wire around the bar, creating a much more powerful electromagnet which could operate a telegraph through the high resistance of long telegraph wires.<ref>{{cite book|title= Technology and Society| author=R.

The receiving instrument consisted of six [[galvanometer]]s with magnetic needles, suspended from [[silk]] [[Yarn|threads]]. Both stations of Schilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the [[galvanometer]]s, one served for the return current and one for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions of black and white flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus by reducing the number of connecting wires from eight to two.\n\t \t\nOn 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]]. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] and the naval base at [[Kronstadt]]. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=54}} Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the [[binary coding|binary]] system of signal transmission.\n\t\nIn 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], together with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] installed a {{convert|1200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the [[Schweigger multiplier|Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator]] with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the [[galvanometer]]. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.\n\n[[File:Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G.png|thumb|left|Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G]]At first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals and finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code which was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss' laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Germany.\n\nGauss was convinced that this communication would be a help to his kingdom's towns. Later in the same year, instead of a [[Voltaic pile]], Gauss used an [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university did not have the funds to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. [[Carl August Steinheil]] in [[Munich]] was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835\u20131836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.  Steinheil built a telegraph along the [[Nuremberg - F\u00fcrth railway line]] in 1838, the first [[earth-return telegraph]] put into service.\n\nBy 1837, [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] had co-developed a [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|telegraph system]] which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. In May 1837 they patented their system. The patent recommended five needles, which coded twenty of the alphabet's 26 letters.\n\n[[File:Wallace Study-Telegraph.jpg|thumb|Morse key and sounder]]\n[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837. Morse's assistant [[Alfred Vail]] developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet.{{sfn|Calvert|2008}} Morse and Vail developed the [[Morse code]] signalling [[alphabet]].

System, used mostly on private wires. This consisted of a \"communicator\" at the sending end and an \"indicator\" at the receiving end. The communicator consisted of a circular dial with a pointer and the 26 letters of the alphabet (and four punctuation marks) around its circumference. Against each letter was a key that could be pressed. A transmission would begin with the pointers on the dials at both ends set to the start position. The transmitting operator would then press down the key corresponding to the letter to be transmitted. In the base of the communicator was a [[magneto]] actuated by a handle on the front. This would be turned to apply an alternating voltage to the line. Each half cycle of the current would move the pointers at both ends on by one position. When the pointer reached the position of the depressed key, it would stop and the magneto would be disconnected from the line. The communicator's pointer was geared to the magneto mechanism. The indicator's pointer was moved by a polarised electromagnet whose [[Armature (electrical)|armature]] was coupled to it through an [[escapement]]. Thus the alternating line voltage moved the indicator's pointer on to the position of the depressed key on the communicator. Pressing another key would then release the pointer and the previous key, and re-connect the magneto to the line. These machines were very robust and simple to operate, and they stayed in use in Britain until well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |last= Freebody |first= J.

They had an extensive [[optical telegraph]] system built during the [[Napoleonic era]].  There was also serious concern that an electrical telegraph could be quickly put out of action by enemy saboteurs, something that was much more difficult to do with optical telegraphs which had no exposed hardware between stations.  The [[Foy-Breguet telegraph]] was eventually adopted.  This was a two-needle system using two signal wires, but displayed in a uniquely different way to other needle telegraphs.  The needles made symbols similar to the Chappe optical system symbols, making it more familiar to the telegraph operators.  The optical system was decommissioned starting in 1846, but not completed until 1855.  In that year the Foy-Breguet system was replaced with the Morse system.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\n===Expansion===\nAs well as the rapid expansion of the use of the telegraphs along the railways, they soon spread into the field of mass communication with the instruments being installed in [[post office]]s.

However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of [[telegraphese]].\n\nThe first system that didn't require skilled technicians to operate, was Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 16 and a half words per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications, Mercer University Press, 1992. 69.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period, starting with the New York\u2013Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a \"sounder\", an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks.

The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n====Teleprinters====\n{{main|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|right|A Creed Model 7 teleprinter in 1930]]\n[[File:Teletype-IMG 7289.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Teletype Model 33]] ASR (Automatic Send and Receive)]]\nAn early successful [[teleprinter]] was invented by [[Frederick G. Creed]]. In [[Glasgow]] he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.\n\nWith the invention of the [[teletypewriter]], telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]].\n\nIn the 1930s teleprinters were produced by [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] in the US, [[Creed & Company|Creed]] in Britain and [[Siemens]] in Germany.\n\nBy 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters. These resulting system was called \"Telex\" (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style [[pulse dialling]] for [[circuit switching]], and then sent data by [[ITA2]]. This \"type A\" Telex routing functionally automated message routing.\n\nThe first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as a network used to communicate within the government.\n\nAt the rate of 45.45 (\u00b10.5%) [[baud]] \u2014 considered speedy at the time \u2014 up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using ''[[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]]'', making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.\n\nAutomatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by [[CPR Telegraphs]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 and in 1958, [[Western Union]] started to build a Telex network in the United States.<ref>Phillip R. Easterlin, \"Telex in New York\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45</ref>\n\n====The harmonic telegraph====\n{{main|Invention of the telephone}}\n{{see also|Acoustic telegraphy}}\nThe most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation \u2013 the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. Early devices included the [[duplex (telegraph)|duplex]] and the [[Quadruplex telegraph|quadruplex]] which allowed, respectively, one or two telegraph transmissions in each direction.  However, an even greater number of channels was desired on the busiest lines.  In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Elisha Gray]], and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].\n\nOne approach was to have resonators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal.  This was the harmonic telegraph, a form of [[Multiplexing#Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division multiplexing]]. These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of resonators.\n\nWith a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the [[invention of the telephone]]. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry 25,000 telephone signals simultaneously down a single fiber.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.explainthatstuff.com/fiberoptics.html |title = How does fiber optics work?}}</ref>)\n\n===Oceanic telegraph cables===\n[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|right|thumb|333px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]\n{{Main|Transatlantic telegraph cable||Submarine communications cable}}\nSoon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of [[submarine communications cable]]s was first proposed. One of the primary technical challenges was to sufficiently insulate the submarine cable to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon [[William Montgomerie]]<ref name=Haigh26>{{cite book|last=Haigh|first=K R|title=Cable Ships and Submarine Cables|year=1968|publisher=Adlard Coles Ltd|location=London|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> introduced [[gutta-percha]], the adhesive juice of the ''[[Palaquium gutta]]'' tree, to Europe. [[Michael Faraday]] and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]]. Gutta-percha was used as insulation on a wire laid across the [[Rhine]] between [[Cologne-Deutz|Deutz]] and [[Cologne]].<ref>Bright, Charles (1898).

In 1854, the government in London created a military Telegraph Detachment for the Army commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Engineers]]. It was to comprise twenty-five men from the Royal Corps of Sappers & Miners trained by the Electric Telegraph Company to construct and work the first field electric telegraph.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |title = Distant Writing A History of Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838 and 1868: 16.

When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours.

Prior to the War the telegraph systems were primarily used in the commercial sector. Government buildings were not inter-connected with telegraph lines, but relied on runners to carry messages back and forth.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} Before the war the Government saw no need to connect lines within city limits, however, they did see the use in connections between cities. Washington D.C. being the hub of government, it had the most connections, but there were only a few lines running north and south out of the city.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} It wasn't until the Civil War that the government saw the true potential of the telegraph system. Soon after the shelling of [[Fort Sumter]], the South cut telegraph lines running into D.C., which put the city in a state of panic because they feared an immediate Southern invasion.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}}\n\nWithin 6 months of the start of the war, the [[U.S. Military Telegraph Corps]] (USMT) had laid approximately 300 miles of line. By war's end they had laid approximately 15,000 miles of line, 8,000 for military and 5,000 for commercial use, and had handled approximately 6.5 million messages. The telegraph was not only important for communication within the armed forces, but also in the civilian sector, helping political leaders to maintain control over their districts.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nEven before the war, the [[American Telegraph Company]] censored suspect messages informally to block aid to the secession movement. During the war, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]], and later [[Edwin Stanton]], wanted control over the telegraph lines to maintain the flow of information. Early in the war, one of Stanton's first acts as Secretary of War was to move telegraph lines from ending at [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] headquarters to terminating at the War Department. Stanton himself said \"[telegraphy] is my right arm\". Telegraphy assisted Northern victories, including the [[Battle of Antietam]] (1862), the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (1863), and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] (1865).{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nThe telegraph system still had its flaws. The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between Generals and their operators. One source of irritation was that USMT operators did not have to follow military authority. Usually they performed without hesitation, but they were not required to, so [[Albert J. Myer|Albert Myer]] created a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in February 1863. As the new head of the Signal Corps, Myer tried to get all telegraph and flag signaling under his command, and therefore subject to military discipline. After creating the Signal Corps, Myer pushed to further develop new telegraph systems. While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp's new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT's system.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\n===First World War===\nDuring [[World War I]], Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.{{sfn|Kennedy|1971}} The British government censored telegraph cable companies in an effort to root out espionage and restrict financial transactions with Central Powers nations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hills|first=Jill|date=June 2006|title=What's New?

Western Union was the leading telegraph provider for America and was seen as the best competition for the [[Bell Telephone Company|National Bell Telephone Company]]. Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union's decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union's upper management's failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system. Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nWhile the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time. Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphy as the long-range communication of choice. However, due to the underestimates of telegraph's future{{explain|date=October 2019}} and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}} [[AT&T]] acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action.

Coatis have a long brown tail with rings on it which are anywhere from starkly defined like a [[Procyon (genus)|raccoon]]'s to very faint. Like raccoons and unlike [[ring-tailed cat]]s and [[cacomistle]]s, the rings go completely around the tail. Coatis often hold the tail erect; it is used as such to keep troops of coatis together in tall vegetation. The tip of the tail can be moved slightly on its own, as is the case with cats, but it is not prehensile as is that of the [[kinkajou]], another procyonid.\n\nCoatis have [[bear]]- and raccoon-like paws, and walk [[plantigrade]] (on the soles of the feet, as do humans), like raccoons and bears. Coatis have nonretractable claws. Coatis also are, in common with raccoons and other procyonids (and others in the order Carnivora and rare cases amongst other mammals), double-jointed and their ankles can rotate beyond 180\u00b0; they are therefore able to descend trees head first. Other animals living in forests have acquired some or all of these properties through [[convergent evolution]], including members of the [[mongoose]], [[Viverridae|civet]], [[Mustelidae|weasel]], [[Felidae|cat]], and [[Ursidae|bear]] families. Some of these animals walk on the toes of the front paws and soles of the back paws.\n\nThe coati snout is long and somewhat pig-like (see [[Suidae]]) \u2013 part of the reason for its nickname 'the hog-nosed raccoon'. It is also extremely flexible \u2013 it can be rotated up to 60\u00b0 in any direction. They use their noses to push objects and rub parts of their body. The facial markings include white markings around the eyes and on the ears and snout.\n\nCoatis have strong limbs to climb and dig and have a reputation for [[Animal cognition|intelligence]], like their fellow [[Procyonidae|procyonid]], the raccoon. They prefer to sleep or rest in elevated places and niches, like the [[rainforest]] [[canopy (biology)|canopy]], in crudely built sleeping nests. Coatis are active day and night.\n\n==Habitat and range==\nOverall, coatis are widespread, occupying habitats ranging from hot and [[arid]] areas to [[humid]] [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian rainforests]] or even cold [[Andes|Andean]] [[mountain]] slopes, including [[grassland]]s and bushy areas. Their geographical range extends from the [[Southwestern United States|southwestern U.S.]] (southern [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]]) through northern [[Uruguay]].<ref name=\"Beisiegel2001\">{{cite journal|last1=Beisiegel|first1=B.

They also eat small [[vertebrate]] prey, such as [[lizard]]s, [[rodent]]s, small [[bird]]s, birds' [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], and crocodile eggs. The snout, with an acute [[sense of smell]], assists the paws in a hog-like manner to unearth [[invertebrate]]s.\n\n==Behavior==\n[[Image:Coati in \"la venta\" M\u00e9xico.JPG|thumbnail|Coati showing its canines]]\nLittle is known about the behavior of the mountain coatis,<ref name=split/> and the following is almost entirely about the coatis of the genus ''Nasua''. Unlike most members of the raccoon family ([[Procyonidae]]), coatis are primarily [[diurnality|diurnal]]. [[Nasua]] coati females and young males up to two years of age are gregarious and travel through their territories in noisy, loosely organized bands made up of four to 25 individuals, foraging with their offspring on the ground or in the forest canopy. Males over two years become [[Lone wolf (trait)|solitary]] due to behavioural disposition and collective aggression from the females and will join the female groups only during the [[breeding season]].\n\nWhen provoked, or for defense, coatis can be fierce fighters; their strong jaws, sharp [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]], and fast scratching paws, along with a tough hide sturdily attached to the underlying muscles, make it very difficult for potential predators (e.g., dogs or [[jaguar]]s) to seize the smaller mammal.\n\nCoatis communicate their intentions or moods with chirping, snorting, or grunting sounds. Different chirping sounds are used to express joy during social grooming, appeasement after fights, or to convey irritation or anger. Snorting while digging, along with an erect tail, states territorial or food claims during foraging. Coatis additionally use special postures or moves to convey simple messages; for example, hiding the nose between the front paws as a sign for submission; lowering the head, baring teeth, and jumping at an enemy signal an aggressive disposition. Individuals recognize other coatis by their looks, voices, and smells, the individual smell is intensified by special [[musk]]-glands on their necks and bellies.\n\nCoatis from [[Panama]] are known to rub their own fur and that of other troop members with [[resin]] from ''[[Trattinnickia aspera]]'' ([[Burseraceae]]) trees, but its purpose is unclear. Some proposed possibilities are it serves as an [[insect repellent]], a [[fungicide]], or as a form of scent-marking.<ref name=costa>{{cite book|title=The Natural History of Costa Rican Mammals|author=Wainwright, M.|year=2002|page=226|isbn=978-0-9705678-1-9|publisher=Zona Tropical|location=Miami, FL}}</ref>\n\n==Reproduction==\nCoati breeding season mainly corresponds with the start of the rainy season to coincide with maximum availability of food, especially fruits: between January and March in some areas, and between October and February in others. During the breeding season, an adult male is accepted into the band of females and juveniles near the beginning of the breeding season, leading to a [[Polygyny|polygynous]] mating system.\n\nThe pregnant females separate from the group, build a nest on a tree or in a rocky niche and, after a gestation period of about 11 weeks, give birth to [[litter (animal)|litters]] of three to seven kits. About six weeks after birth, the females and their young will rejoin the band. Females become sexually mature at two years of age, while males will acquire sexual maturity at three years of age.\n\n==Natural predators==\nCoati predators include [[jaguarundi]]s, [[anacondas]], [[maned wolves]], [[boa constrictor]]s, [[fox]]es, [[dog]]s, [[tayra]]s, [[ocelot]]s, and [[jaguar]]s. Large raptors, such as [[ornate hawk-eagle]]s, [[black-and-chestnut eagle]]s, and [[harpy eagle]]s, also are known to hunt them.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060516160718/http://itech.pjc.edu/sctag/coati/Southern%20Coati.htm Southern Coatimundi]. itech.pjc.edu</ref> [[White-headed capuchin]] monkeys hunt their pups.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Perry S. |author2=Rose L. |year=1994|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/41610/1/10329_2006_Article_BF02381950.pdf |title=Begging and transfer of coati meat by white-faced capuchin monkeys, ''Cebus capucinus''|journal=Primates|volume=35|issue=4|pages=409\u2013415|doi=10.1007/bf02381950|hdl=2027.42/41610 }}</ref>\n\n==Status==\nCoatis face unregulated hunting and the serious threat of environmental destruction in Central and South America. The absence of scientifically sound population studies of ''Nasua'' or ''Nasuella'' in the wild is probably leading to a severe underestimation of the ecological problems and decline in numbers affecting the species.\n\n==In captivity==\nCoatis are one of five groups of [[Procyonidae|procyonids]] commonly kept as pets in various parts of North, Central and South America, the others being the [[Procyon (genus)|raccoons]] ([[Raccoon|common]] and [[Crab-eating raccoon|crab-eating]]), the [[kinkajou]], the ring-tailed cat and cacomistle.

Coatis have a long brown tail with rings on it which are anywhere from starkly defined like a [[Procyon (genus)|raccoon]]'s to very faint. Like raccoons and unlike [[ring-tailed cat]]s and [[cacomistle]]s, the rings go completely around the tail. Coatis often hold the tail erect; it is used as such to keep troops of coatis together in tall vegetation. The tip of the tail can be moved slightly on its own, as is the case with cats, but it is not prehensile as is that of the [[kinkajou]], another procyonid.\n\nCoatis have [[bear]]- and raccoon-like paws, and walk [[plantigrade]] (on the soles of the feet, as do humans), like raccoons and bears. Coatis have nonretractable claws. Coatis also are, in common with raccoons and other procyonids (and others in the order Carnivora and rare cases amongst other mammals), double-jointed and their ankles can rotate beyond 180\u00b0; they are therefore able to descend trees head first. Other animals living in forests have acquired some or all of these properties through [[convergent evolution]], including members of the [[mongoose]], [[Viverridae|civet]], [[Mustelidae|weasel]], [[Felidae|cat]], and [[Ursidae|bear]] families. Some of these animals walk on the toes of the front paws and soles of the back paws.\n\nThe coati snout is long and somewhat pig-like (see [[Suidae]]) \u2013 part of the reason for its nickname 'the hog-nosed raccoon'. It is also extremely flexible \u2013 it can be rotated up to 60\u00b0 in any direction. They use their noses to push objects and rub parts of their body. The facial markings include white markings around the eyes and on the ears and snout.\n\nCoatis have strong limbs to climb and dig and have a reputation for [[Animal cognition|intelligence]], like their fellow [[Procyonidae|procyonid]], the raccoon. They prefer to sleep or rest in elevated places and niches, like the [[rainforest]] [[canopy (biology)|canopy]], in crudely built sleeping nests. Coatis are active day and night.\n\n==Habitat and range==\nOverall, coatis are widespread, occupying habitats ranging from hot and [[arid]] areas to [[humid]] [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian rainforests]] or even cold [[Andes|Andean]] [[mountain]] slopes, including [[grassland]]s and bushy areas. Their geographical range extends from the [[Southwestern United States|southwestern U.S.]] (southern [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]]) through northern [[Uruguay]].<ref name=\"Beisiegel2001\">{{cite journal|last1=Beisiegel|first1=B.

They also eat small [[vertebrate]] prey, such as [[lizard]]s, [[rodent]]s, small [[bird]]s, birds' [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], and crocodile eggs. The snout, with an acute [[sense of smell]], assists the paws in a hog-like manner to unearth [[invertebrate]]s.\n\n==Behavior==\n[[Image:Coati in \"la venta\" M\u00e9xico.JPG|thumbnail|Coati showing its canines]]\nLittle is known about the behavior of the mountain coatis,<ref name=split/> and the following is almost entirely about the coatis of the genus ''Nasua''. Unlike most members of the raccoon family ([[Procyonidae]]), coatis are primarily [[diurnality|diurnal]]. [[Nasua]] coati females and young males up to two years of age are gregarious and travel through their territories in noisy, loosely organized bands made up of four to 25 individuals, foraging with their offspring on the ground or in the forest canopy. Males over two years become [[Lone wolf (trait)|solitary]] due to behavioural disposition and collective aggression from the females and will join the female groups only during the [[breeding season]].\n\nWhen provoked, or for defense, coatis can be fierce fighters; their strong jaws, sharp [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]], and fast scratching paws, along with a tough hide sturdily attached to the underlying muscles, make it very difficult for potential predators (e.g., dogs or [[jaguar]]s) to seize the smaller mammal.\n\nCoatis communicate their intentions or moods with chirping, snorting, or grunting sounds. Different chirping sounds are used to express joy during social grooming, appeasement after fights, or to convey irritation or anger. Snorting while digging, along with an erect tail, states territorial or food claims during foraging. Coatis additionally use special postures or moves to convey simple messages; for example, hiding the nose between the front paws as a sign for submission; lowering the head, baring teeth, and jumping at an enemy signal an aggressive disposition. Individuals recognize other coatis by their looks, voices, and smells, the individual smell is intensified by special [[musk]]-glands on their necks and bellies.\n\nCoatis from [[Panama]] are known to rub their own fur and that of other troop members with [[resin]] from ''[[Trattinnickia aspera]]'' ([[Burseraceae]]) trees, but its purpose is unclear. Some proposed possibilities are it serves as an [[insect repellent]], a [[fungicide]], or as a form of scent-marking.<ref name=costa>{{cite book|title=The Natural History of Costa Rican Mammals|author=Wainwright, M.|year=2002|page=226|isbn=978-0-9705678-1-9|publisher=Zona Tropical|location=Miami, FL}}</ref>\n\n==Reproduction==\nCoati breeding season mainly corresponds with the start of the rainy season to coincide with maximum availability of food, especially fruits: between January and March in some areas, and between October and February in others. During the breeding season, an adult male is accepted into the band of females and juveniles near the beginning of the breeding season, leading to a [[Polygyny|polygynous]] mating system.\n\nThe pregnant females separate from the group, build a nest on a tree or in a rocky niche and, after a gestation period of about 11 weeks, give birth to [[litter (animal)|litters]] of three to seven kits. About six weeks after birth, the females and their young will rejoin the band. Females become sexually mature at two years of age, while males will acquire sexual maturity at three years of age.\n\n==Natural predators==\nCoati predators include [[jaguarundi]]s, [[anacondas]], [[maned wolves]], [[boa constrictor]]s, [[fox]]es, [[dog]]s, [[tayra]]s, [[ocelot]]s, and [[jaguar]]s. Large raptors, such as [[ornate hawk-eagle]]s, [[black-and-chestnut eagle]]s, and [[harpy eagle]]s, also are known to hunt them.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060516160718/http://itech.pjc.edu/sctag/coati/Southern%20Coati.htm Southern Coatimundi]. itech.pjc.edu</ref> [[White-headed capuchin]] monkeys hunt their pups.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Perry S. |author2=Rose L. |year=1994|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/41610/1/10329_2006_Article_BF02381950.pdf |title=Begging and transfer of coati meat by white-faced capuchin monkeys, ''Cebus capucinus''|journal=Primates|volume=35|issue=4|pages=409\u2013415|doi=10.1007/bf02381950|hdl=2027.42/41610 }}</ref>\n\n==Status==\nCoatis face unregulated hunting and the serious threat of environmental destruction in Central and South America.
