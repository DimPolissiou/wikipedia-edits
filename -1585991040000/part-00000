Defending the gold medal won by the [[2008 United States men's Olympic basketball team|2008 team]] in the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|previous Olympic Games]], the Americans qualified for the 2012 Games after winning the [[2010 United States men's FIBA World Championship team|2010 FIBA World Championship]]. The Olympic team lost some players to injuries who might have made the team, and appeared to be short on big men. Their roster featured five players returning from the 2008 Olympic team and five others from the 2010 World Championship. Coming off a victory in the 2011-2012 [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) finals, [[LeBron James]] became the leader of the Olympic team.\n\nThe USA went undefeated but appeared vulnerable in five exhibition games. They finished the tournament with a perfect 8\u20130 record, defeating opponents by an average of 32 [[point (basketball)|point]]s while trailing in the fourth quarter only once. The Americans often played with a [[small lineup]] that emphasized speed, quickness, and outside shooting. The team set an Olympic single-game record with 156 points scored against [[Nigeria national basketball team|Nigeria]] in the preliminary round. In a rematch of the 2008 finals, Team USA again defeated [[Spain national basketball team|Spain]] to capture the gold.\n\n==Roster==\n[[File:Bryant on the ball.jpg|thumb|right|The 2012 team practicing in Washington, D.C.]]\nThe 2012 team consisted of returning [[2008 United States men's Olympic basketball team|2008 Olympic gold medal winners]] small forwards [[LeBron James]] and [[Carmelo Anthony]], point guards [[Chris Paul]] and [[Deron Williams]], and shooting guard [[Kobe Bryant]]. It also featured [[2010 United States men's FIBA World Championship team|2010 World Championship]] winners small forwards [[Hayden Stutts]] and [[Andre Iguodala]], power forward [[Kevin Love]], center [[Tyson Chandler]], and point guard [[Russell Westbrook]].

They finished the tournament with a perfect 8\u20130 record, defeating opponents by an average of 32 [[point (basketball)|point]]s while trailing in the fourth quarter only once. The Americans often played with a [[small lineup]] that emphasized speed, quickness, and outside shooting.

As a child she performed at various concerts, singing mainly [[Country music|country and western]] pop and music from the shows. She received her first classical training in 1955, from Sister Mary Magdalen at [[Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia]], north of Hamilton. Sister Febronie continued with her voice training and Sister Liguori gave her piano tuition. As her potential blossomed, Major began travelling weekly to [[Ponsonby, New Zealand|Ponsonby]] in [[Auckland]], where she received further tuition from [[Sister Mary Leo|Dame Sister Mary Leo]] at St Mary's College Music School.  Sister Mary Leo was internationally recognised as one of the great music teachers, and she later taught another famous New Zealand soprano, Dame [[Kiri Te Kanawa]].\n\n==International recognition==\n\nMajor later moved to England for further study at the London Opera Centre under the guidance of teacher [[Ruth Packer]]. Her successes include winning the 1963 [[Mobil Song Quest|New Zealand Mobil Song Quest]] beating Te Kanawa who placed second (Te Kanawa later won the 1965 contest). She also won the Australian [[Melbourne Sun-Aria]] in 1965, and the London-based [[Kathleen Ferrier Award]] in 1966. Major later performed in international concerts including a [[BBC]] concert broadcast in London, an outdoor concert at the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in Egypt with the [[Cairo Opera House|Cairo Symphony Orchestra]], and a charity concert for [[Vera Lynn]] in London.

Both artists co-wrote the song with [[Scott Storch]], Robert Waller and [[Jay-Z|Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter]]; the former also co-produced the song. Containing a lyrical interpolation of \"No Fear\" by [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Originoo Gunn Clappaz|O.G.C]], \"Baby Boy\" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with Caribbean and Asian influences; its lyrics detail a woman's fantasies.\n\n[[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]] released \"Baby Boy\" as the second single from ''Dangerously in Love'' on August 3, 2003. \"Baby Boy\" topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for nine consecutive weeks and was Beyonc\u00e9's longest-running solo number-one single until 2007, when it was surpassed by \"[[Irreplaceable]]\". It reached the top ten in many countries and was certified platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It also reached the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n \nThe song's [[music video]] was directed by [[Jake Nava]] and mostly shows Beyonc\u00e9 dancing in various locations. \"Baby Boy\" has remained a staple of Beyonc\u00e9's concert [[set list]]s. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2004.

With regard to the musical hook, the expert witness stated in his report: \"When the aural comparisons of the two songs are presented in the key of [[C minor]] (for easy comparison) and presented back-to-back, in A\u2013B\u2013A\u2013B fashion, even the least musically inclined listener should immediately determine that the two songs are strikingly similar; I daresay that many listeners may even perceive them as being the same song! And again, transposing a song for this purpose does not alter any fundamental qualities or characteristics of the song but merely assists the ability of those unfamiliar with the technicalities of music in making a comparison.\" The district court judge nonetheless ruled that she, herself, couldn't hear the similarities between the two songs and dismissed the case, denying the motion for the songs or case to be heard by a jury.<ref name=\"Case\"/> On appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] affirmed the district court's ruling, but ruled with different reasoning. It held that there was no infringement based on Beyonc\u00e9's claim that Armour's demo tape was received shortly after the writing of Beyonc\u00e9's song had been substantially completed.

Both artists co-wrote the song with [[Scott Storch]], Robert Waller and [[Jay-Z|Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter]]; the former also co-produced the song. Containing a lyrical interpolation of \"No Fear\" by [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Originoo Gunn Clappaz|O.G.C]], \"Baby Boy\" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[dancehall]] song with Caribbean and Asian influences; its lyrics detail a woman's fantasies.\n\n[[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]] released \"Baby Boy\" as the second single from ''Dangerously in Love'' on August 3, 2003. \"Baby Boy\" topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for nine consecutive weeks and was Beyonc\u00e9's longest-running solo number-one single until 2007, when it was surpassed by \"[[Irreplaceable]]\". It reached the top ten in many countries and was certified platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It also reached the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n \nThe song's [[music video]] was directed by [[Jake Nava]] and mostly shows Beyonc\u00e9 dancing in various locations. \"Baby Boy\" has remained a staple of Beyonc\u00e9's concert [[set list]]s. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2004. In 2005, American [[singer-songwriter]] Jennifer Armour filed a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit claiming that the song had used the primary musical [[hook (music)|hook]] from her song \"Got a Little Bit of Love for You\".

With regard to the musical hook, the expert witness stated in his report: \"When the aural comparisons of the two songs are presented in the key of [[C minor]] (for easy comparison) and presented back-to-back, in A\u2013B\u2013A\u2013B fashion, even the least musically inclined listener should immediately determine that the two songs are strikingly similar; I daresay that many listeners may even perceive them as being the same song! And again, transposing a song for this purpose does not alter any fundamental qualities or characteristics of the song but merely assists the ability of those unfamiliar with the technicalities of music in making a comparison.\" The district court judge nonetheless ruled that she, herself, couldn't hear the similarities between the two songs and dismissed the case, denying the motion for the songs or case to be heard by a jury.<ref name=\"Case\"/> On appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] affirmed the district court's ruling, but ruled with different reasoning.

Born in [[Cardiff]], Bellamy began his career with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], where he made his professional debut in 1996. He went on to play for [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[Premier League]], becoming the record signing for the former. He was relegated in his single season with Coventry before achieving two top-four finishes during his four years with Newcastle. Bellamy fell out with manager [[Graeme Souness]] in 2005 and spent the latter part of the [[2004\u201305 in Scottish football|2004\u201305 season]] on loan at [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], where he won the [[Scottish Cup]].\n\nBellamy returned to the Premier League later that year, playing one season at both [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], where he was named the club's player of the year, and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. In 2007 he signed for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] but injury disrupted his time there and in 2009 he joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. For the [[2010-11 in English football|2010\u201311 season]], Bellamy dropped a division to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] to represent his boyhood club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on a season-long loan. He helped Cardiff reach the playoffs before they were defeated in the semi-finals. Bellamy returned to Liverpool the following season before rejoining Cardiff City permanently in 2012. He later led them to the Premier League; it was the first time in fifty years that Cardiff had played in the top tier of English football. He played one more season with the club in the Premier League, setting a new record by scoring for his seventh different club in the division, before retiring from playing in 2014.\n\nHaving represented Wales at several youth levels, in 1998 at the age of 18, Bellamy made his senior debut for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] against [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]]. Over the next fifteen years, Bellamy gained 78 caps for his country and scored 19 goals. He was the Wales captain from 2007 to 2011, when he stepped down from the role due to injuries. Bellamy retired from international football following the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign. He was also a member of the [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain Olympic team]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]] in London, appearing five times and scoring once.\n\nA controversial character, Bellamy was involved in numerous high-profile incidents during his career and was described by [[Bobby Robson]] as \"the gobbiest footballer I've ever met\". Outside football, he has been a patron of several charities and started his own organisation, The Craig Bellamy Foundation, in Sierra Leone to provide schooling and football coaching to disadvantaged children.\n\n==Early life==\nCraig Douglas Bellamy was born on 19 July 1979 at the [[University Hospital of Wales]] in [[Cardiff]],<ref name=\"gf4650\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=46\u201350}}</ref> the second of three boys born to Douglas and Angela Bellamy. At the time of his birth, the family lived on Swindon Street near the [[Splott]] district of the city. The area was considered a traditional working-class environment and had been experiencing an economic downturn following the closure of the East Moor steelworks the previous year. Bellamy's mother worked as a cleaner and his father worked at the nearby Allied Steel and Wire site that overlooked the family home,<ref name=\"gf1718\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=17\u201318}}</ref> where he remained until the plant's closure in 2002.<ref name=\"walker\"/> With both his parents working full-time, Bellamy spent most of his school holidays at his paternal grandmother Mary's home in [[Adamsdown]].<ref name=\"gf3435\"/> He suffers from [[asthma]]; as a child he made frequent visits to hospital to manage the condition.<ref name=\"uhw\">{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/bellamys-high-praise-special-hospital-1905029 |title=Bellamy\u2019s high praise for \u2018special\u2019 hospital |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530141603/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/bellamys-high-praise-special-hospital-1905029 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the age of five, Bellamy and his family moved to the eastern suburb [[Trowbridge, Cardiff|Trowbridge]], which is part of a council estate built in the 1960s.<ref name=\"gf1718\"/>\n\nBellamy's father was a keen football fan who supported [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and Bellamy's first experience of professional football was watching a [[Football League Fourth Division]] match between Cardiff and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] during the [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388 season]], which the home side won 4\u20130. His father played amateur football for local Cardiff-based sides; Bellamy described him as a \"sluggish right-back\".<ref name=\"gf190193\"/> Bellamy's interest in the sport grew rapidly; he regularly attended Cardiff matches at the club's home ground [[Ninian Park]] and played in ABC Park near his home with his older brother Paul and his friends. Bellamy credits playing against older children as making him \"into a better player very quickly\".<ref name=\"gf1920\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> He first attended Baden Powell Primary School before switching to Trowbridge Juniors where he joined the school football team at the age of seven.<ref name=\"walker\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/09/newsstory.sport |title=Hungry Bellamy sets sights on discovering dreamland |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Walker |first=Michael |date=8 October 2004 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530141605/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/09/newsstory.sport |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite being younger than most of the other players, he was selected to play and featured in his first match against Gladstone Primary School. Local team Pentwyn Dynamos took an interest in Bellamy but were put off by his small size; his father instead offered to form a team if Bellamy could find enough players. Soon after, the under-10s side of local team Caer Castell FC, which included Bellamy&nbsp;\u2013&#32;who scored all four goals in the club's first fixture&nbsp;\u2013&#32;was formed. He was later picked to represent both Cardiff Schools and a Cardiff and District side in national competition.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=21\u201322}}</ref> He went on to attend [[Rumney High School]].<ref name=\"gf2425\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=24\u201325}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rumneyhighschool.cardiff.sch.uk/ |title=Craig Bellamy |publisher=Rumney High School |accessdate=1 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203234029/http://www.rumneyhighschool.cardiff.sch.uk/ |archivedate=3 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 12, Bellamy was friends with a group of mostly older boys and began to regularly drink alcohol and skipped school for up to two weeks at a time.<ref name=\"gf2425\"/><ref name=\"gf2630\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=26\u201330}}</ref> He saw several of his friends using [[cannabis]] and [[Glue sniffing|sniffing glue]] but Bellamy never used the substances himself. He later admitted to acting as a lookout while his friends broke into vehicles to steal car stereos to sell for drug money. He described himself as \"a kid who knew he was going to be a footballer and thought he knew it all\".<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> By age 14, Bellamy was barely attending school and was smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol everyday.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> In 1993, he met his future wife Claire after being introduced by his brother Paul; Bellamy credits the relationship as a key factor in moving him away from his early troubles.<ref name=\"gf3435\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=34\u201335}}</ref>\n\n== Club career ==\n\n=== Bristol Rovers and Norwich City ===\nBellamy had attended youth sessions organised by Cardiff City in [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] for a year after being encouraged by his father.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-vow-learn-bellamy-blunder-2490946 |title=City vow to learn from Bellamy blunder |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=19 February 2003 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530193157/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-vow-learn-bellamy-blunder-2490946 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The club, however, took little interest in him as a youngster and, at nine-years-old, he joined [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] after being spotted by former professional [[Stan Montgomery]], who was working for the club. Although an hour's drive from his family home, Bellamy found the opportunity of better coaching and his own playing kit irresistible. He spent two years at the club before being invited by [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] to a trial match in Somerset. He impressed Norwich and the club asked Bellamy to  travel with the side to compete in the [[Dana Cup]], an international youth football tournament held in [[Hj\u00f8rring]], Denmark. His performances led to a permanent place with the Canary Rangers, Norwich's youth development side.<ref name=\"gf2425\"/> Prior to signing with the club, several other teams took an interest in Bellamy; [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] offered his parents \u00a310,000 if he signed for them. Norwich responded by guaranteeing him a two-year [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] contract when he was old enough to sign.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/>\n\nAt the age of 15, Bellamy moved away from Cardiff to start his youth apprenticeship with Norwich, being placed with a local family along with another apprentice.<ref name=\"gf3640\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=36\u201340}}</ref> Bellamy had previously travelled to Norwich by train on Saturday afternoons, played a youth match on Sunday morning before returning to Cardiff.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> His first year away from home proved troublesome and he describes it as \"the hardest year of my life\", regularly crying himself to sleep at night after suffering from homesickness.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Each apprentice was assigned to a senior player for whom they performed basic tasks such as cleaning boots or making tea. Bellamy was paired with [[John Polston]] but found the experienced defender difficult to work with and believed Polston tried to \"humiliate\" him.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Bellamy's homesickness was lessened after he became friends with another apprentice from Cardiff, [[Tom Ramasut]], but problems with his discipline became commonplace. On one occasion, Bellamy received a final warning from staff after he broke the arm of a trialist goalkeeper during a fight on the training ground; Bellamy later said Norwich showed him leniency when disciplining him in fear of losing a player regarded as having a bright future.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Bellamy reached a turning point in his career when his girlfriend Claire became pregnant while he was a youth player. He has credited the conception of his first child as a catalyst for his career that saw him become more determined to become a professional footballer, stating, \"I have had the career I have had because of that moment when Claire phoned me up to tell me she was pregnant\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=44}}</ref> At the end the first year of his YTS deal, Bellamy was the only player coach [[Mike Phelan]] promoted to the club's reserve side.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=42}}</ref>\n\nBellamy signed his first professional contract with Norwich, earning \u00a3250 a week, with the option to renegotiate after 10 first-team appearances.<ref name=\"gf4650\"/> He made his professional debut for Norwich on 15 March 1997 under manager [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]], as an injury-time substitute in a 2\u20130 defeat to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. Remarking on the rushed nature of his appearance, he said, \"It all felt very last minute. I was wearing a kit about three sizes too big for me, I touched the ball twice, we lost 2\u20130 and it was over.\"<ref name=\"gf4650\"/> Two further appearances from the bench in fixtures against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] followed before the end of the season.<ref name=ssn9697/> Bellamy made his first career start in the opening month of the following season in the first round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] on 12 August 1997, and started in the league for the first time on 20 September against Manchester City.<ref name=ssn9798/> During the early stages of the campaign, Bellamy played his 10th match for the first team, leading to new contract negotiations. Despite an attempt by [[Premier League]] side Crystal Palace to sign him for a fee of \u00a32 million, he chose to extend his deal with Norwich.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=53}}</ref> On 1 November, Bellamy scored his first senior goal, the opener in a 2\u20132 home draw with [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]. He received his first career [[Penalty_card#Red_card|red card]] on 7 February 1998 in the 23rd minute against Manchester City, but finished his first full season with 13 goals from 38 appearances, while playing mostly as a central midfielder.<ref name=ssn9798/>\n\nAs a young player, Bellamy was unafraid to voice his opinion to more senior members of the squad. His approach annoyed some teammates who sought retribution during training sessions; Bellamy later commented, \"one or two of them would try to clean me out with flying tackles. They wanted to bring me down a peg or two.\"<ref name=\"gf5657\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> One training session left him \"nearly in tears\" after [[Kevin Scott (footballer)|Kevin Scott]] repeatedly singled him out. Bellamy won support from his midfield partner, the experienced [[Peter Grant (footballer, born 1965)|Peter Grant]] who struck up a friendship with Bellamy.<ref name=\"gf5657\"/> [[Bruce Rioch]] was appointed Norwich manager in 1998 and instantly moved Bellamy from central midfield to attack. The decision reaped rewards immediately; Bellamy scored seven goals in his first eight league appearances of the campaign, including his first career [[hat-trick]] on 22 August 1998 in a 4\u20132 home win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]],<ref name=ssn9899/> and he was rewarded with a new five-year contract.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=60}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, Bellamy injured his left knee following a high challenge by [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] defender [[Kevin Muscat]] that ruled him out for two months and left him with a puncture wound in his kneecap caused by one of Muscat's studs.<ref name=\"gf7678\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=76\u201378}}</ref> The tackle caused so much consternation that his Norwich teammate [[Iwan Roberts]] later admitted taking revenge on Muscat by stamping on his back when the pair met in a match two years later.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/roberts-could-face-ban-1-65334 |title=Roberts could face ban |newspaper=East Anglia Daily Times |date=29 June 2004 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530200318/https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/roberts-could-face-ban-1-65334 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bellamy continued to experience soreness in the knee after his return for the remainder of the season. In a pre-season friendly against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] prior to the following season, Bellamy ruptured his cruciate ligaments in an innocuous challenge with an opposition defender and was ruled out for between six and eight months.<ref name=\"gf7678\"/> He made his return to the first team against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on 22 April 2000 and finished the season by scoring goals in consecutive matches against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].<ref name=\"gf8388\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=83\u201385}}</ref> Interest in Bellamy grew during the summer; Norwich rejected an offer of \u00a33.5 million by [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] while [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] showed interest but held back from making a bid because they were waiting to sell [[Duncan Ferguson]] to finance the transfer.<ref name=\"gf8388\"/>\n\n===Coventry City===\nAs Newcastle stalled over a bid, [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] offered a club-record \u00a36 million to sign Bellamy, which Norwich accepted. Bellamy was reluctant to join the club, preferring a move to Newcastle; he met with Coventry manager [[Gordon Strachan]] to discuss the transfer. Bellamy did not employ an agent at the time so asked his financial advisor to attend the meeting. His advisor had recently met former footballer [[John Fashanu]] and telephoned him for advice, and Fashanu arrived at the meeting unannounced. The pressure of the situation led Bellamy to agree to the move but he regretted his decision, commenting, \"They were persuasive. I felt undermined by the mess with Fashanu. I wanted to save face with Strachan. I felt stressed. My chest was tight because I\u2019m asthmatic. I was struggling to breathe properly because I was so tense. I was in a state. So I did what everybody had told me not to do. I told Strachan I\u2019d sign.\"<ref name=\"gf8388\"/>\n\nBellamy became Coventry's record signing, joining on 16 August 2000 as a replacement for [[Robbie Keane]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Canary Bellamy To Turn Sky Blue|url=http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/2000/08/000816-bellamy-offer.htm|date=16 August 2000|website=cwn.org.uk|access-date=11 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012013948/http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/2000/08/000816-bellamy-offer.htm|archive-date=12 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> He made his Premier League debut on the opening day of the [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301 season]] in a 3\u20131 defeat to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and converted a penalty in the following game, a 2\u20131 victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].<ref name=\"gf92\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=92}}</ref> He endured a poor start to his career with Coventry, however, scoring only three league goals\u2014two of which were penalties\u2014by the start of December as the club found itself in the relegation zone. On 10 December 2000, he scored the winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] to gain his side three crucial points and Bellamy's form improved further after the arrival of his Wales strike-partner [[John Hartson]]. Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season after the team finished 19th in the Premier League, ending 34 consecutive years in the top tier of English football. Bellamy ended his only season at Coventry with eight goals from 39 appearances.

Born in [[Cardiff]], Bellamy began his career with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], where he made his professional debut in 1996. He went on to play for [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[Premier League]], becoming the record signing for the former. He was relegated in his single season with Coventry before achieving two top-four finishes during his four years with Newcastle. Bellamy fell out with manager [[Graeme Souness]] in 2005 and spent the latter part of the [[2004\u201305 in Scottish football|2004\u201305 season]] on loan at [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], where he won the [[Scottish Cup]].\n\nBellamy returned to the Premier League later that year, playing one season at both [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], where he was named the club's player of the year, and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. In 2007 he signed for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] but injury disrupted his time there and in 2009 he joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. For the [[2010-11 in English football|2010\u201311 season]], Bellamy dropped a division to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] to represent his boyhood club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on a season-long loan. He helped Cardiff reach the playoffs before they were defeated in the semi-finals. Bellamy returned to Liverpool the following season before rejoining Cardiff City permanently in 2012. He later led them to the Premier League; it was the first time in fifty years that Cardiff had played in the top tier of English football. He played one more season with the club in the Premier League, setting a new record by scoring for his seventh different club in the division, before retiring from playing in 2014.\n\nHaving represented Wales at several youth levels, in 1998 at the age of 18, Bellamy made his senior debut for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] against [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]]. Over the next fifteen years, Bellamy gained 78 caps for his country and scored 19 goals. He was the Wales captain from 2007 to 2011, when he stepped down from the role due to injuries. Bellamy retired from international football following the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign. He was also a member of the [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain Olympic team]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]] in London, appearing five times and scoring once.\n\nA controversial character, Bellamy was involved in numerous high-profile incidents during his career and was described by [[Bobby Robson]] as \"the gobbiest footballer I've ever met\". Outside football, he has been a patron of several charities and started his own organisation, The Craig Bellamy Foundation, in Sierra Leone to provide schooling and football coaching to disadvantaged children.\n\n==Early life==\nCraig Douglas Bellamy was born on 19 July 1979 at the [[University Hospital of Wales]] in [[Cardiff]],<ref name=\"gf4650\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=46\u201350}}</ref> the second of three boys born to Douglas and Angela Bellamy. At the time of his birth, the family lived on Swindon Street near the [[Splott]] district of the city. The area was considered a traditional working-class environment and had been experiencing an economic downturn following the closure of the East Moor steelworks the previous year. Bellamy's mother worked as a cleaner and his father worked at the nearby Allied Steel and Wire site that overlooked the family home,<ref name=\"gf1718\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=17\u201318}}</ref> where he remained until the plant's closure in 2002.<ref name=\"walker\"/> With both his parents working full-time, Bellamy spent most of his school holidays at his paternal grandmother Mary's home in [[Adamsdown]].<ref name=\"gf3435\"/> He suffers from [[asthma]]; as a child he made frequent visits to hospital to manage the condition.<ref name=\"uhw\">{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/bellamys-high-praise-special-hospital-1905029 |title=Bellamy\u2019s high praise for \u2018special\u2019 hospital |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530141603/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/bellamys-high-praise-special-hospital-1905029 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the age of five, Bellamy and his family moved to the eastern suburb [[Trowbridge, Cardiff|Trowbridge]], which is part of a council estate built in the 1960s.<ref name=\"gf1718\"/>\n\nBellamy's father was a keen football fan who supported [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and Bellamy's first experience of professional football was watching a [[Football League Fourth Division]] match between Cardiff and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] during the [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388 season]], which the home side won 4\u20130. His father played amateur football for local Cardiff-based sides; Bellamy described him as a \"sluggish right-back\".<ref name=\"gf190193\"/> Bellamy's interest in the sport grew rapidly; he regularly attended Cardiff matches at the club's home ground [[Ninian Park]] and played in ABC Park near his home with his older brother Paul and his friends. Bellamy credits playing against older children as making him \"into a better player very quickly\".<ref name=\"gf1920\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> He first attended Baden Powell Primary School before switching to Trowbridge Juniors where he joined the school football team at the age of seven.<ref name=\"walker\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/09/newsstory.sport |title=Hungry Bellamy sets sights on discovering dreamland |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Walker |first=Michael |date=8 October 2004 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530141605/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/09/newsstory.sport |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite being younger than most of the other players, he was selected to play and featured in his first match against Gladstone Primary School. Local team Pentwyn Dynamos took an interest in Bellamy but were put off by his small size; his father instead offered to form a team if Bellamy could find enough players. Soon after, the under-10s side of local team Caer Castell FC, which included Bellamy&nbsp;\u2013&#32;who scored all four goals in the club's first fixture&nbsp;\u2013&#32;was formed. He was later picked to represent both Cardiff Schools and a Cardiff and District side in national competition.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=21\u201322}}</ref> He went on to attend [[Rumney High School]].<ref name=\"gf2425\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=24\u201325}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rumneyhighschool.cardiff.sch.uk/ |title=Craig Bellamy |publisher=Rumney High School |accessdate=1 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203234029/http://www.rumneyhighschool.cardiff.sch.uk/ |archivedate=3 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 12, Bellamy was friends with a group of mostly older boys and began to regularly drink alcohol and skipped school for up to two weeks at a time.<ref name=\"gf2425\"/><ref name=\"gf2630\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=26\u201330}}</ref> He saw several of his friends using [[cannabis]] and [[Glue sniffing|sniffing glue]] but Bellamy never used the substances himself. He later admitted to acting as a lookout while his friends broke into vehicles to steal car stereos to sell for drug money. He described himself as \"a kid who knew he was going to be a footballer and thought he knew it all\".<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> By age 14, Bellamy was barely attending school and was smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol everyday.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> In 1993, he met his future wife Claire after being introduced by his brother Paul; Bellamy credits the relationship as a key factor in moving him away from his early troubles.<ref name=\"gf3435\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=34\u201335}}</ref>\n\n== Club career ==\n\n=== Bristol Rovers and Norwich City ===\nBellamy had attended youth sessions organised by Cardiff City in [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] for a year after being encouraged by his father.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-vow-learn-bellamy-blunder-2490946 |title=City vow to learn from Bellamy blunder |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=19 February 2003 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530193157/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-vow-learn-bellamy-blunder-2490946 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The club, however, took little interest in him as a youngster and, at nine-years-old, he joined [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] after being spotted by former professional [[Stan Montgomery]], who was working for the club. Although an hour's drive from his family home, Bellamy found the opportunity of better coaching and his own playing kit irresistible. He spent two years at the club before being invited by [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] to a trial match in Somerset. He impressed Norwich and the club asked Bellamy to  travel with the side to compete in the [[Dana Cup]], an international youth football tournament held in [[Hj\u00f8rring]], Denmark. His performances led to a permanent place with the Canary Rangers, Norwich's youth development side.<ref name=\"gf2425\"/> Prior to signing with the club, several other teams took an interest in Bellamy; [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] offered his parents \u00a310,000 if he signed for them. Norwich responded by guaranteeing him a two-year [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] contract when he was old enough to sign.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/>\n\nAt the age of 15, Bellamy moved away from Cardiff to start his youth apprenticeship with Norwich, being placed with a local family along with another apprentice.<ref name=\"gf3640\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=36\u201340}}</ref> Bellamy had previously travelled to Norwich by train on Saturday afternoons, played a youth match on Sunday morning before returning to Cardiff.<ref name=\"gf2630\"/> His first year away from home proved troublesome and he describes it as \"the hardest year of my life\", regularly crying himself to sleep at night after suffering from homesickness.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Each apprentice was assigned to a senior player for whom they performed basic tasks such as cleaning boots or making tea. Bellamy was paired with [[John Polston]] but found the experienced defender difficult to work with and believed Polston tried to \"humiliate\" him.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Bellamy's homesickness was lessened after he became friends with another apprentice from Cardiff, [[Tom Ramasut]], but problems with his discipline became commonplace. On one occasion, Bellamy received a final warning from staff after he broke the arm of a trialist goalkeeper during a fight on the training ground; Bellamy later said Norwich showed him leniency when disciplining him in fear of losing a player regarded as having a bright future.<ref name=\"gf3640\"/> Bellamy reached a turning point in his career when his girlfriend Claire became pregnant while he was a youth player. He has credited the conception of his first child as a catalyst for his career that saw him become more determined to become a professional footballer, stating, \"I have had the career I have had because of that moment when Claire phoned me up to tell me she was pregnant\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=44}}</ref> At the end the first year of his YTS deal, Bellamy was the only player coach [[Mike Phelan]] promoted to the club's reserve side.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=42}}</ref>\n\nBellamy signed his first professional contract with Norwich, earning \u00a3250 a week, with the option to renegotiate after 10 first-team appearances.<ref name=\"gf4650\"/> He made his professional debut for Norwich on 15 March 1997 under manager [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]], as an injury-time substitute in a 2\u20130 defeat to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. Remarking on the rushed nature of his appearance, he said, \"It all felt very last minute. I was wearing a kit about three sizes too big for me, I touched the ball twice, we lost 2\u20130 and it was over.\"<ref name=\"gf4650\"/> Two further appearances from the bench in fixtures against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] followed before the end of the season.<ref name=ssn9697/> Bellamy made his first career start in the opening month of the following season in the first round of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] on 12 August 1997, and started in the league for the first time on 20 September against Manchester City.<ref name=ssn9798/> During the early stages of the campaign, Bellamy played his 10th match for the first team, leading to new contract negotiations. Despite an attempt by [[Premier League]] side Crystal Palace to sign him for a fee of \u00a32 million, he chose to extend his deal with Norwich.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=53}}</ref> On 1 November, Bellamy scored his first senior goal, the opener in a 2\u20132 home draw with [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]. He received his first career [[Penalty_card#Red_card|red card]] on 7 February 1998 in the 23rd minute against Manchester City, but finished his first full season with 13 goals from 38 appearances, while playing mostly as a central midfielder.<ref name=ssn9798/>\n\nAs a young player, Bellamy was unafraid to voice his opinion to more senior members of the squad. His approach annoyed some teammates who sought retribution during training sessions; Bellamy later commented, \"one or two of them would try to clean me out with flying tackles. They wanted to bring me down a peg or two.\"<ref name=\"gf5657\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> One training session left him \"nearly in tears\" after [[Kevin Scott (footballer)|Kevin Scott]] repeatedly singled him out. Bellamy won support from his midfield partner, the experienced [[Peter Grant (footballer, born 1965)|Peter Grant]] who struck up a friendship with Bellamy.<ref name=\"gf5657\"/> [[Bruce Rioch]] was appointed Norwich manager in 1998 and instantly moved Bellamy from central midfield to attack. The decision reaped rewards immediately; Bellamy scored seven goals in his first eight league appearances of the campaign, including his first career [[hat-trick]] on 22 August 1998 in a 4\u20132 home win over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]],<ref name=ssn9899/> and he was rewarded with a new five-year contract.<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=60}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, Bellamy injured his left knee following a high challenge by [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] defender [[Kevin Muscat]] that ruled him out for two months and left him with a puncture wound in his kneecap caused by one of Muscat's studs.<ref name=\"gf7678\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=76\u201378}}</ref> The tackle caused so much consternation that his Norwich teammate [[Iwan Roberts]] later admitted taking revenge on Muscat by stamping on his back when the pair met in a match two years later.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/roberts-could-face-ban-1-65334 |title=Roberts could face ban |newspaper=East Anglia Daily Times |date=29 June 2004 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530200318/https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/roberts-could-face-ban-1-65334 |archive-date=30 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bellamy continued to experience soreness in the knee after his return for the remainder of the season. In a pre-season friendly against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] prior to the following season, Bellamy ruptured his cruciate ligaments in an innocuous challenge with an opposition defender and was ruled out for between six and eight months.<ref name=\"gf7678\"/> He made his return to the first team against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on 22 April 2000 and finished the season by scoring goals in consecutive matches against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].<ref name=\"gf8388\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|pp=83\u201385}}</ref> Interest in Bellamy grew during the summer; Norwich rejected an offer of \u00a33.5 million by [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] while [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] showed interest but held back from making a bid because they were waiting to sell [[Duncan Ferguson]] to finance the transfer.<ref name=\"gf8388\"/>\n\n===Coventry City===\nAs Newcastle stalled over a bid, [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] offered a club-record \u00a36 million to sign Bellamy, which Norwich accepted. Bellamy was reluctant to join the club, preferring a move to Newcastle; he met with Coventry manager [[Gordon Strachan]] to discuss the transfer. Bellamy did not employ an agent at the time so asked his financial advisor to attend the meeting. His advisor had recently met former footballer [[John Fashanu]] and telephoned him for advice, and Fashanu arrived at the meeting unannounced. The pressure of the situation led Bellamy to agree to the move but he regretted his decision, commenting, \"They were persuasive. I felt undermined by the mess with Fashanu. I wanted to save face with Strachan. I felt stressed. My chest was tight because I\u2019m asthmatic. I was struggling to breathe properly because I was so tense. I was in a state. So I did what everybody had told me not to do. I told Strachan I\u2019d sign.\"<ref name=\"gf8388\"/>\n\nBellamy became Coventry's record signing, joining on 16 August 2000 as a replacement for [[Robbie Keane]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Canary Bellamy To Turn Sky Blue|url=http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/2000/08/000816-bellamy-offer.htm|date=16 August 2000|website=cwn.org.uk|access-date=11 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012013948/http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/2000/08/000816-bellamy-offer.htm|archive-date=12 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> He made his Premier League debut on the opening day of the [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u201301 season]] in a 3\u20131 defeat to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and converted a penalty in the following game, a 2\u20131 victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].<ref name=\"gf92\">{{harvnb|Bellamy|2013|p=92}}</ref> He endured a poor start to his career with Coventry, however, scoring only three league goals\u2014two of which were penalties\u2014by the start of December as the club found itself in the relegation zone. On 10 December 2000, he scored the winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] to gain his side three crucial points and Bellamy's form improved further after the arrival of his Wales strike-partner [[John Hartson]]. Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season after the team finished 19th in the Premier League, ending 34 consecutive years in the top tier of English football. Bellamy ended his only season at Coventry with eight goals from 39 appearances.

Completion rate can not reflect the overall view of every student because different students have diverse purposes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Hew|first=Khe Foon|date=May 2016|title=Promoting engagement in online courses: What strategies can we learn from three highly rated MOOCS|url=|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=47|issue=2|pages=320\u2013341|doi=10.1111/bjet.12235}}</ref> For example, Khe&nbsp;Foon&nbsp;Hew (2016)<ref name=\":5\" /> indicates that some students take part in the MOOCs just for interest or finding extrinsic value of course. They drop the course if the course can not satisfy their purpose. However, completion rate is objective enough to reflect engagement of students.\n\nMuch research has investigated why students drop out of MOOC courses or what factors could contribute to them dropping out. For example, Ros\u00e9 et al. (2014)<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Ros\u00e9|first=Carolyn Penstein|last2=Carlson|first2=Ryan|last3=Yang|first3=Diyi|last4=Wen|first4=Miaomiao|last5=Resnick|first5=Lauren|last6=Goldman|first6=Pam|last7=Sherer|first7=Jennifer|date=1 January 2014|title=Social Factors That Contribute to Attrition in MOOCs|journal=Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference|series=L@S '14|location=New York|publisher=ACM|pages=197\u2013198|doi=10.1145/2556325.2567879|isbn=978-1450326698}}</ref> investigate how three social factors make predictions on student attrition, for students who participated in the course discussion forum. The authors found that students who serve as authorities in the community seem to be more committed to the community and thus less inclined to drop out the course. In addition, students who actively participated in the course since the first week were 35% less likely to drop out of the course, compared with the average population. Lastly, the analysis of the patterns of attrition in a sub community showed that attrition was related to the engagement of the particular students with one another. One interpretation of this finding according to Ros\u00e9 et al. (2014)<ref name=\":1\" /> is that while participating in MOOCs, students create virtual cohorts who progress and engage with the material in similar ways. Thus, if students start dropping out, then that might cause other students to drop out as they might perceive the environment as less supportive or engaging without their peers.\n\nOther studies focus on exploring how motivation and self-regulated learning could be related to MOOC dropout and attrition. Carson (2002)<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Hendricks|first=Carson, Elaine|title=Self-directed learning and academic achievement in secondary online students|date=1 January 2012|publisher=University of Tennessee at Chattanooga|url=http://scholar.utc.edu/theses/11/|language=en}}</ref> investigated characteristics of self-directed learning in students of grades 8\u201312 who took online courses through a statewide online program. Two of the hypothesis that the study explored were whether there exist underlying distinct classes (categories) of self-regulated learners and if the membership in these classes was associated with measures such significantly different online course completion, online final grade, or GPA. The results show that there exist different latent classes of self-regulated learning within the population of online students, designated as high, moderate, and low self-directed learning. In addition, the results support the hypothesis that there is an association between the self-directed learning class the student belongs to with the significantly different course completion rate or course achievement (course achievement was measured by the completion of the online courses, the final online course grade and the cumulative GPA). In other words, course completion and self-directed learning in students were found to be significantly related.\n\nOne online survey published a \"top ten\" list of reasons for dropping out of a MOOC.<ref name=\"Open culture 1\">{{cite web|title=MOOC Interrupted: Top 10 Reasons Our Readers Didn't Finish a Massive Open Online Course|url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/04/10_reasons_you_didnt_complete_a_mooc.html|work=Open Culture|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> The list involved reasons such as the course required too much time, or was too difficult or too basic. Reasons related to poor course design included \"lecture fatigue\" from courses that were just lecture videos, lack of a proper introduction to course technology and format, clunky technology and abuse on discussion boards. Hidden costs were cited, including required readings from expensive textbooks written by the instructor that also significantly limited students' access to learning material.<ref name=\"in AIS Electronic Library AISeL\" /> Other non-completers were \"just shopping around\" when they registered, or were participating for knowledge rather than a credential. Other reasons for the poor completion rates include the workload, length and difficulty of a course.<ref name=\"in AIS Electronic Library AISeL\" /> In addition, some participants participate peripherally (\"lurk\"). For example, one of the first MOOCs in 2008 had 2200 registered members, of whom 150 actively interacted at various times.<ref>Mackness, Jenny, Mak, Sui Fai John, and Williams, Roy [http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/organisations/netlc/past/nlc2010/abstracts/PDFs/Mackness.pdf \"The Ideals and Reality of Participating in a MOOC\"], Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Networked Learning 2010</ref>\n\nBesides those factors cause the low completion rate in MOOCs, the inequality on receiving knowledge affected by different characters of individual also has huge influence on the consequence of completion rate. Actually, MOOC is not as fair as we expected. Russian researchers Semenova, T.V. and Rudakova, L.M (2016), indicate that MOOC is designed to decrease the unequal access to getting knowledge, but that doesn't mean every individual can enjoy the same equality in course completion rate. From their research, there are three main factors cause the inequality, which are degree of education, experience of MOOCs and gender. The survey shows that 18% high-education students complete the course while only 3% low-education students complete. To be more visualized, 84\u201388% students who have completed the course are high-educational. What's more, among students who have completed the course, 65\u201380% students have at least one experience of using online learning platform comparing to 6\u201331% students who have no experience . Gender also influence the completion rate, in general, 6%\u20137% more men than women complete the course because women are supposed to do household in many countries, which distract women's attention in learning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Semenova|first=T.V.|last2=Rudakova|first2=L.M.|date=May 2016|title=Barriers to Taking Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).|url=|journal=Russian Education & Society|volume=58|issue=3|pages=228\u2013245|doi=10.1080/10609393.2016.1242992}}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of MOOCs is an open question as completion rates are substantially less than traditional online education courses.<ref name=\"Yousef\" /><ref name=\"Khaled M 2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Alraimi|first1=Khaled M.|last2=Zo|first2=Hangjung|last3=Ciganek|first3=Andrew P.|title=Understanding the MOOCs continuance: The role of openness and reputation|journal=Computers & Education|date=January 2015|volume=80|pages=28\u201338|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.006}}</ref> Alraimi et al.

The San Jose State University philosophy faculty wrote in an open letter to Harvard University professor and MOOC teacher [[Michael Sandel]]:\n\n{{Quote|Should one-size-fits-all vendor-designed blended courses become the norm, we fear two classes of universities will be created: one, well-funded colleges and universities in which privileged students get their own real professor; the other, financially stressed private and public universities in which students watch a bunch of video-taped lectures.<ref name=\"Dear Sandel\">{{cite news|title=San Jose State to Michael Sandel: Keep your MOOC off our campus|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2013/05/san_jose_state.html|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=3 May 2013}}</ref> }}\n\n[[Cary Nelson]], former president of the [[American Association of University Professors]] claimed that MOOCs are not a reliable means of supplying credentials, stating that \"It\u2019s fine to put lectures online, but this plan only degrades degree programs if it plans to substitute for them.\" Sandra Schroeder, chair of the Higher Education Program and Policy Council for the [[American Federation of Teachers]] expressed concern that \"These students are not likely to succeed without the structure of a strong and sequenced academic program.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Basu |first=Kaustuv |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/05/23/faculty-groups-consider-how-respond-moocs |title=Faculty groups consider how to respond to MOOCs |website=Inside Higher Ed |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nWith a 60% majority, the [[Amherst College]] faculty rejected the opportunity to work with edX based on a perceived incompatibility with their seminar-style classes and personalized feedback. Some were concerned about issues such as the \"information dispensing\" teaching model of lectures followed by exams, the use of multiple-choice exams and peer-grading.

Even though the number of learners who enroll in the courses tends to be in the thousands range, only a very small portion of the enrolled learners complete the course. According to the visualizations and analysis conducted by Katy Jordan (2015),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html|title=MOOC completion rates|website=www.katyjordan.com|access-date=28 April 2017}}</ref> the investigated MOOCs have a typical enrollment of 25,000, even though enrollment has reached a value up to ~230,000.

Completion rate can not reflect the overall view of every student because different students have diverse purposes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Hew|first=Khe Foon|date=May 2016|title=Promoting engagement in online courses: What strategies can we learn from three highly rated MOOCS|url=|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=47|issue=2|pages=320\u2013341|doi=10.1111/bjet.12235}}</ref> For example, Khe&nbsp;Foon&nbsp;Hew (2016)<ref name=\":5\" /> indicates that some students take part in the MOOCs just for interest or finding extrinsic value of course. They drop the course if the course can not satisfy their purpose. However, completion rate is objective enough to reflect engagement of students.\n\nMuch research has investigated why students drop out of MOOC courses or what factors could contribute to them dropping out. For example, Ros\u00e9 et al. (2014)<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Ros\u00e9|first=Carolyn Penstein|last2=Carlson|first2=Ryan|last3=Yang|first3=Diyi|last4=Wen|first4=Miaomiao|last5=Resnick|first5=Lauren|last6=Goldman|first6=Pam|last7=Sherer|first7=Jennifer|date=1 January 2014|title=Social Factors That Contribute to Attrition in MOOCs|journal=Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference|series=L@S '14|location=New York|publisher=ACM|pages=197\u2013198|doi=10.1145/2556325.2567879|isbn=978-1450326698}}</ref> investigate how three social factors make predictions on student attrition, for students who participated in the course discussion forum. The authors found that students who serve as authorities in the community seem to be more committed to the community and thus less inclined to drop out the course. In addition, students who actively participated in the course since the first week were 35% less likely to drop out of the course, compared with the average population. Lastly, the analysis of the patterns of attrition in a sub community showed that attrition was related to the engagement of the particular students with one another. One interpretation of this finding according to Ros\u00e9 et al. (2014)<ref name=\":1\" /> is that while participating in MOOCs, students create virtual cohorts who progress and engage with the material in similar ways. Thus, if students start dropping out, then that might cause other students to drop out as they might perceive the environment as less supportive or engaging without their peers.\n\nOther studies focus on exploring how motivation and self-regulated learning could be related to MOOC dropout and attrition. Carson (2002)<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Hendricks|first=Carson, Elaine|title=Self-directed learning and academic achievement in secondary online students|date=1 January 2012|publisher=University of Tennessee at Chattanooga|url=http://scholar.utc.edu/theses/11/|language=en}}</ref> investigated characteristics of self-directed learning in students of grades 8\u201312 who took online courses through a statewide online program. Two of the hypothesis that the study explored were whether there exist underlying distinct classes (categories) of self-regulated learners and if the membership in these classes was associated with measures such significantly different online course completion, online final grade, or GPA. The results show that there exist different latent classes of self-regulated learning within the population of online students, designated as high, moderate, and low self-directed learning. In addition, the results support the hypothesis that there is an association between the self-directed learning class the student belongs to with the significantly different course completion rate or course achievement (course achievement was measured by the completion of the online courses, the final online course grade and the cumulative GPA). In other words, course completion and self-directed learning in students were found to be significantly related.\n\nOne online survey published a \"top ten\" list of reasons for dropping out of a MOOC.<ref name=\"Open culture 1\">{{cite web|title=MOOC Interrupted: Top 10 Reasons Our Readers Didn't Finish a Massive Open Online Course|url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/04/10_reasons_you_didnt_complete_a_mooc.html|work=Open Culture|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> The list involved reasons such as the course required too much time, or was too difficult or too basic. Reasons related to poor course design included \"lecture fatigue\" from courses that were just lecture videos, lack of a proper introduction to course technology and format, clunky technology and abuse on discussion boards. Hidden costs were cited, including required readings from expensive textbooks written by the instructor that also significantly limited students' access to learning material.<ref name=\"in AIS Electronic Library AISeL\" /> Other non-completers were \"just shopping around\" when they registered, or were participating for knowledge rather than a credential. Other reasons for the poor completion rates include the workload, length and difficulty of a course.<ref name=\"in AIS Electronic Library AISeL\" /> In addition, some participants participate peripherally (\"lurk\"). For example, one of the first MOOCs in 2008 had 2200 registered members, of whom 150 actively interacted at various times.<ref>Mackness, Jenny, Mak, Sui Fai John, and Williams, Roy [http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/organisations/netlc/past/nlc2010/abstracts/PDFs/Mackness.pdf \"The Ideals and Reality of Participating in a MOOC\"], Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Networked Learning 2010</ref>\n\nBesides those factors cause the low completion rate in MOOCs, the inequality on receiving knowledge affected by different characters of individual also has huge influence on the consequence of completion rate. Actually, MOOC is not as fair as we expected. Russian researchers Semenova, T.V. and Rudakova, L.M (2016), indicate that MOOC is designed to decrease the unequal access to getting knowledge, but that doesn't mean every individual can enjoy the same equality in course completion rate. From their research, there are three main factors cause the inequality, which are degree of education, experience of MOOCs and gender. The survey shows that 18% high-education students complete the course while only 3% low-education students complete. To be more visualized, 84\u201388% students who have completed the course are high-educational. What's more, among students who have completed the course, 65\u201380% students have at least one experience of using online learning platform comparing to 6\u201331% students who have no experience . Gender also influence the completion rate, in general, 6%\u20137% more men than women complete the course because women are supposed to do household in many countries, which distract women's attention in learning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Semenova|first=T.V.|last2=Rudakova|first2=L.M.|date=May 2016|title=Barriers to Taking Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).|url=|journal=Russian Education & Society|volume=58|issue=3|pages=228\u2013245|doi=10.1080/10609393.2016.1242992}}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of MOOCs is an open question as completion rates are substantially less than traditional online education courses.<ref name=\"Yousef\" /><ref name=\"Khaled M 2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Alraimi|first1=Khaled M.|last2=Zo|first2=Hangjung|last3=Ciganek|first3=Andrew P.|title=Understanding the MOOCs continuance: The role of openness and reputation|journal=Computers & Education|date=January 2015|volume=80|pages=28\u201338|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.006}}</ref> Alraimi et al.

The San Jose State University philosophy faculty wrote in an open letter to Harvard University professor and MOOC teacher [[Michael Sandel]]:\n\n{{Quote|Should one-size-fits-all vendor-designed blended courses become the norm, we fear two classes of universities will be created: one, well-funded colleges and universities in which privileged students get their own real professor; the other, financially stressed private and public universities in which students watch a bunch of video-taped lectures.<ref name=\"Dear Sandel\">{{cite news|title=San Jose State to Michael Sandel: Keep your MOOC off our campus|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2013/05/san_jose_state.html|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=3 May 2013}}</ref> }}\n\n[[Cary Nelson]], former president of the [[American Association of University Professors]] claimed that MOOCs are not a reliable means of supplying credentials, stating that \"It\u2019s fine to put lectures online, but this plan only degrades degree programs if it plans to substitute for them.\" Sandra Schroeder, chair of the Higher Education Program and Policy Council for the [[American Federation of Teachers]] expressed concern that \"These students are not likely to succeed without the structure of a strong and sequenced academic program.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Basu |first=Kaustuv |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/05/23/faculty-groups-consider-how-respond-moocs |title=Faculty groups consider how to respond to MOOCs |website=Inside Higher Ed |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nWith a 60% majority, the [[Amherst College]] faculty rejected the opportunity to work with edX based on a perceived incompatibility with their seminar-style classes and personalized feedback. Some were concerned about issues such as the \"information dispensing\" teaching model of lectures followed by exams, the use of multiple-choice exams and peer-grading. The [[Duke University]] faculty took a similar stance in the spring of 2013.

In ''MOOCs: A University Qualification in 24 Hours?''

A. Knopf (1947), p. 148</ref> Kandinsky learned from a variety of sources while in Moscow.  He studied many fields while in school, including law and economics.  Later in life, he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child. His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew. In 1889, he was part of an ethnographic research group which travelled to the [[Vologda]] region north of Moscow. In ''Looks on the Past'', he relates that the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colours that upon entering them, he felt that he was moving into a painting. This experience, and his study of the region's folk art (particularly the use of bright colours on a dark background), was reflected in much of his early work.  A few years later he first likened painting to composing music in the manner for which he would become noted, writing, \"Colour is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is the hand which plays, touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul\".<ref name=\"Sadler2004\">{{cite book|last=Kandinsky|first=Wassily|others=translated by Michael T. H.

That same year, before leaving Moscow, he saw an exhibit of paintings by [[Claude Monet|Monet]]. He was particularly taken with the impressionistic style of ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]''; this, to him, had a powerful sense of colour almost independent of the objects themselves. Later, he would write about this experience:\n\n{{quote|That it was a haystack the catalogue informed me. I could not recognise it. This non-recognition was painful to me. I considered that the painter had no right to paint indistinctly. I dully felt that the object of the painting was missing.

Hall & Co.|page=363}}</ref> |Wassily Kandinsky}}\n\nKandinsky was similarly influenced during this period by [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' which, he felt, pushed the limits of music and melody beyond standard lyricism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ruckblick|last=Kandinsky|first=Wassily|publisher=Woldemar Klein Verlag|year=1955|isbn=|location=Baden-Baden|pages=12}}</ref> He was also spiritually influenced by [[Madame Blavatsky]] (1831\u20131891), the best-known exponent of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]. Theosophical theory postulates that creation is a geometrical progression, beginning with a single point. The creative aspect of the form is expressed by a descending series of circles, triangles and squares. Kandinsky's book ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'' (1910) and ''Point and Line to Plane'' (1926) echoed this theosophical tenet. Illustrations by John Varley in ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms]]'' (1901) influenced him visually.<ref>[[Sixten Ringbom]], The sounding cosmos; a study in the spiritualism of Kandinsky and the genesis of abstract painting, (Abo [Finland]: Abo Akademi, 1970), pgs 89 & 148a.</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Artistic metamorphosis (1896\u20131911)}}Metamorphosis ===\nIn the summer of 1902, Kandinsky invited [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]] to join him at his summer painting classes just south of Munich in the Alps. She accepted, and their relationship became more personal than professional.\nArt school, usually considered difficult, was easy for Kandinsky. It was during this time that he began to emerge as an art theorist as well as a painter. The number of his existing paintings increased in the beginning of the 20th century; much remains of the landscapes and towns he painted, using broad swaths of colour and recognisable forms. For the most part, however, Kandinsky's paintings did not feature any human figures; an exception is ''Sunday, Old Russia'' (1904), in which Kandinsky recreates a highly colourful (and fanciful) view of peasants and nobles in front of the walls of a town. ''Riding Couple'' (1907) depicts a man on horseback, holding a woman with tenderness and care as they ride past a Russian town with luminous walls across a blue river. The horse is muted while the leaves in the trees, the town, and the reflections in the river glisten with spots of colour and brightness. This work demonstrates the influence of [[pointillism]] in the way the depth of field is collapsed into a flat, luminescent surface. [[Fauvism]] is also apparent in these early works.  Colours are used to express Kandinsky's experience of subject matter, not to describe objective nature.\n\nPerhaps the most important of his paintings from the first decade of the 1900s was ''The Blue Rider'' (1903), which shows a small cloaked figure on a speeding horse rushing through a rocky meadow. The rider's cloak is medium blue, which casts a darker-blue shadow. In the foreground are more amorphous blue shadows, the counterparts of the fall trees in the background. The blue rider in the painting is prominent (but not clearly defined), and the horse has an unnatural gait (which Kandinsky must have known). Some art historians believe {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} that a second figure (perhaps a child) is being held by the rider, although this may be another shadow from the solitary rider. This intentional disjunction, allowing viewers to participate in the creation of the artwork, became an increasingly conscious technique used by Kandinsky in subsequent years; it culminated in the abstract works of the 1911\u20131914 period. In ''The Blue Rider'', Kandinsky shows the rider more as a series of colours than in specific detail. This painting is not exceptional in that regard when compared with contemporary painters, but it shows the direction Kandinsky would take only a few years later.\n\nFrom 1906 to 1908 Kandinsky spent a great deal of time travelling across Europe (he was an associate of the [[Blue Rose (art group)|Blue Rose]] symbolist group of Moscow), until he settled in the small [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]]. In 1908 he bought a copy of ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms]]'' by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]]. In 1909 he joined the Theosophical Society. ''The Blue Mountain'' (1908\u20131909) was painted at this time, demonstrating his trend toward abstraction. A mountain of blue is flanked by two broad trees, one yellow and one red. A procession, with three riders and several others, crosses at the bottom. The faces, clothing, and saddles of the riders are each a single color, and neither they nor the walking figures display any real detail. The flat planes and the contours also are indicative of Fauvist influence. The broad use of color in ''The Blue Mountain'' illustrates Kandinsky's inclination toward an art in which color is presented independently of form, and which each color is given equal attention. The composition is more planar; the painting is divided into four sections: the sky, the red tree, the yellow tree and the blue mountain with the three riders.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1898 - Odessa Port.jpg|''Odessa Port'', 1898, [[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow \nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1901 - Akhtyrka.jpg|''Akhtyrka'', 1901, [[Lenbachhaus]], Kunstarealm, Munich\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1906 - Rotterdam sun.jpg|''Rotterdam Sun'', 1906\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1908, Murnau, Dorfstrasse.jpg|''Murnau, Dorfstrasse (Street in Murnau, A Village Street)'', 1908, {{interlanguage link|Werner Merzbacher|de}} Collection\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1908 - Houses in Munich.jpg|''Houses in Munich'', 1908\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1909 - Murnau train et ch\u00e2teau.jpg|''Murnau, train & castle'', 1909\n</gallery>\n\n=== Blue Rider Period (1911\u20131914) ===\n{{See also|Der Blaue Reiter}}\n[[File:Wassily Kandinsky, 1910, Landscape with Factory Chimney, oil on canvas, 66.2 x 82 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.jpg|thumb|Wassily Kandinsky, 1910, ''Landscape with Factory Chimney'', oil on canvas, 66.2 x 82 cm, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]]]\nKandinsky's paintings from this period are large, expressive coloured masses evaluated independently from forms and lines; these serve no longer to delimit them, but overlap freely to form paintings of extraordinary force. Music was important to the birth of abstract art, since music is abstract by nature\u2014it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul. Kandinsky sometimes used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings \"improvisations\" and described more elaborate works as \"compositions.\"\n\nIn addition to painting, Kandinsky was an art theorist; his influence on the history of [[Western art]] stems perhaps more from his theoretical works than from his paintings. He helped found the [[Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung M\u00fcnchen]] (Munich New Artists' Association), becoming its president in 1909. However, the group could not integrate the radical approach of Kandinsky (and others) with conventional artistic concepts and the group dissolved in late 1911. Kandinsky then formed a new group, the Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]) with like-minded artists such as [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Albert Bloch]], and [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]]. The group released an almanac (''The Blue Rider Almanac'') and held two exhibits. More of each were planned, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 ended these plans and sent Kandinsky back to Russia via [[Switzerland]] and [[Sweden]].\n\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1912 - Improvisation 27, Garden of Love II.jpg|thumb|Wassily Kandinsky, ''Improvisation 27 (Garden of Love II)'', 1912, oil on canvas, 120.3 x 140.3 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. Exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]].]]\nHis writing in ''The Blue Rider Almanac'' and the treatise \"On the Spiritual In Art\" (which was released in 1910) were both a defence and promotion of abstract art and an affirmation that all forms of art were equally capable of reaching a level of spirituality. He believed that colour could be used in a painting as something autonomous, apart from the visual description of an object or other form.\n\nThese ideas had an almost-immediate international impact, particularly in the English-speaking world.<ref>See Michael Paraskos, \"English Expressionism,\" MRes Thesis, University of Leeds, Leeds 1997, p103f</ref> As early as 1912, ''On the Spiritual In Art'' was reviewed by [[Michael Sadleir]] in the London-based ''Art News.''<ref>Michael Sadleir, Review of Uber da Geistige an der Kunst by Wassily Kandinsky, in \"The Art News,\" 9 March 1912, p.45</ref> Interest in Kandinsky grew apace when Sadleir published an English translation of ''On the Spiritual In Art'' in 1914. Extracts from the book were published that year in [[Percy Wyndham Lewis]]'s periodical ''[[BLAST (magazine)|Blast]],'' and [[Alfred Orage]]'s weekly cultural newspaper ''[[The New Age]]''. Kandinsky had received some notice earlier in Britain, however; in 1910, he participated in the Allied Artists' Exhibition (organised by [[Frank Rutter]]) at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. This resulted in his work being singled out for praise in a review of that show by the artist [[Spencer Frederick Gore]] in ''The Art News''.<ref>Spencer Frederick Gore, \"The Allied Artists' Exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall (London)\", in \"The Art News,\" 4 August 1910, p.254</ref>\n\nSadleir's interest in Kandinsky also led to Kandinsky's first works entering a British art collection; Sadleir's father, [[Michael Sadler (educationist)|Michael Sadler]], acquired several wood-prints and the abstract painting ''Fragment for Composition VII'' in 1913 following a visit by father and son to meet Kandinsky in Munich that year. These works were displayed in [[Leeds]], either in the University or the premises of the [[Leeds Arts Club]], between 1913 and 1923.<ref>Tom Steele, \"Alfred Orage and the Leeds Arts Club 1893\u20131923\" (Mitcham, Orage Press, 2009) 218f</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1910 - The Cow.jpg|''The Cow'', 1910, [[Lenbachhaus]], Munich\nFile:Kandinsky Study for Improvisation V MIA 67342.jpg|''Study for Improvisation V '', 1910\nFile:Wassily Kandinsky, 1911, Reiter (Lyrishes), oil on canvas, 94 x 130 cm, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen.jpg|''The Rider'', 1911\nFile:Vassilly Kandinsky, 1912 - Landscape With Two Poplars.jpg|''Landscape With Two Poplars'' 1912\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Color Study, Squares with Concentric Circles.jpg|''Squares with Concentric Circles'', 1913\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6.jpg|''Composition 6'', 1913\nFile:W.

He painted little during this period, but devoted his time to artistic teaching, with a program based on form and colour analysis; he also helped organize the [[Institute of Artistic Culture]] in [[Moscow]] of which he was the first director. His spiritual, expressionistic view of art was ultimately rejected by the radical members of the Institute as too individualistic and bourgeois. In 1921, Kandinsky was invited to go to Germany to attend the [[Bauhaus]] of [[Weimar]] by its founder, architect [[Walter Gropius]].\n\n===Back in Germany and the Bauhaus (1922\u20131933) ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1923 - On White II.jpg|thumb|''On White II'', 1923]]\nIn May 1922 he attended the [[International Congress of Progressive Artists]] and signed the \"Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists\".<ref name=\"Review\">{{cite web |last1=van Doesburg |first1=Theo |title=De Stijl, \u201cA Short Review of the Proceedings [of the Congress of International Progressive Artists], Followed by the Statements Made by the Artists\u2019 Groups\u201d (1922) |url=https://modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/de-stijl-%E2%80%9Ca-short-review-of-the-proceedings-of-the-congress-of-international-progressive-artists-followed-by-the-statements-made-by-the-artists%E2%80%99-groups%E2%80%9D-1922/ |website=modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com |publisher=Ross Lawrence Wolfe |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKandinsky taught the basic design class for beginners and the course on advanced theory at the [[Bauhaus]]; he also conducted painting classes and a workshop in which he augmented his colour theory with new elements of form psychology. The development of his works on forms study, particularly on points and line forms, led to the publication of his second theoretical book (''Point and Line to Plane'') in 1926. His examinations of the effects of forces on straight lines, leading to the contrasting tones of curved and angled lines, coincided with the research of Gestalt psychologists, whose work was also discussed at the Bauhaus.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Kandinsky|last = D\u00fcchting|first = Hajo|publisher = Taschen|year = 2013|isbn = 978-3-8365-3146-7|location = |pages = 68}}</ref> Geometrical elements took on increasing importance in both his teaching and painting\u2014particularly the circle, half-circle, the angle, straight lines and curves. This period was intensely productive. This freedom is characterised in his works by the treatment of planes rich in colours and gradations\u2014as in ''Yellow \u2013 red \u2013 blue'' (1925), where Kandinsky illustrates his distance from the [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] and [[suprematism]] movements influential at the time.\n\nThe two-metre-wide ''Yellow \u2013 red \u2013 blue'' (1925)  of several main forms: a vertical yellow rectangle, an inclined red cross and a large dark blue circle; a multitude of straight (or sinuous) black lines, circular arcs, monochromatic circles and scattered, coloured checker-boards contribute to its delicate complexity. This simple visual identification of forms and the main coloured masses present on the canvas is only a first approach to the inner reality of the work, whose appreciation necessitates deeper observation\u2014not only of forms and colours involved in the painting but their relationship, their absolute and relative positions on the canvas and their harmony.\n\nKandinsky was one of [[Die Blaue Vier]] (Blue Four), formed in 1923 with [[Paul Klee]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], which lectured and exhibited in the United States in 1924. Due to right-wing hostility, the Bauhaus left Weimar and settled in [[Dessau]] in 1925. Following a Nazi smear campaign the Bauhaus left Dessau in 1932 for [[Berlin]], until its dissolution in July 1933. Kandinsky then left Germany, settling in [[Paris]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1922 - Kleine Welten I.jpg|''Small worlds I'', 1922\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1923 - Circles in a Circle.jpg|''Circles in a Circle'', 1923\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1926 - Several Circles, Gugg 0910 25.jpg|''Several Circles'', 1926\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1927 - Molle rudesse.jpg|''Soft Hard'', 1927\nFile:Wassily Kandinsky - Inner Alliance - 1929.jpg|''Inner Aliance'', 1929\n</gallery>\n\n=== Great Synthesis (1934\u20131944) ===\n\nLiving in an apartment in Paris, Kandinsky created his work in a living-room studio. [[Biomorphism|Biomorphic]] forms with supple, non-geometric outlines appear in his paintings\u2014forms which suggest microscopic organisms but express the artist's inner life. Kandinsky used original colour compositions, evoking Slavic popular art. He also occasionally mixed sand with paint to give a granular, rustic texture to his paintings.\n\nThis period corresponds to a synthesis of Kandinsky's previous work in which he used all elements, enriching them. In 1936 and 1939 he painted his final two major compositions, the type of elaborate canvases he had not produced for many years. ''Composition IX'' has highly contrasted, powerful diagonals whose central form gives the impression of an embryo in the womb. Small squares of colours and coloured bands stand out against the black background of ''Composition X'' as star fragments (or [[Solar filament|filaments]]), while enigmatic [[hieroglyph]]s with pastel tones cover a large maroon mass which seems to float in the upper-left corner of the canvas. In Kandinsky's work some characteristics are obvious, while certain touches are more discreet and veiled; they reveal themselves only progressively to those who deepen their connection with his work.<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 38-45 (The disclosure of pictoriality)</ref> He intended his forms (which he subtly harmonised and placed) to resonate with the observer's soul.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1935 - Brown with supplement.jpg|''Brown with supplement'', 1935\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1936 - Composition IX.jpg|''Composition IX'', 1936\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1939 - Composition 10.jpg|''Composition X'', 1939\n</gallery>\n\n== Kandinsky's conception of art ==\n{{Main|List of paintings by Wassily Kandinsky}}\n=== The artist as prophet ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 7.jpg|thumb|''Composition&nbsp;VII'', [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. According to Kandinsky, this is the most complex piece he ever painted (1913)|alt=Large, colourful abstract painting]]\nWriting that \"music is the ultimate teacher,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/quotes.php|title=Wassily Kandinsky \u2013 Quotes|website=www.wassilykandinsky.net|access-date=2016-09-17}}</ref> Kandinsky embarked upon the first seven of his ten ''Compositions''. The first three survive only in black-and-white photographs taken by fellow artist and friend [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]]. While studies, sketches, and improvisations exist (particularly of ''Composition II''), a Nazi raid on the [[Bauhaus]] in the 1930s resulted in the confiscation of Kandinsky's first three ''Compositions.'' They were displayed in the State-sponsored exhibit \"[[Degenerate Art]]\", and then destroyed (along with works by [[Paul Klee]], [[Franz Marc]] and other modern artists).\n\nFascinated by [[Christian eschatology]] and the perception of a coming New Age,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rabinovich|first1=Yakov|title=Kandinsky:   Master of the Mystic Arts|url=http://www.invisiblebooks.com/Kandinsky.htm}}</ref> a common theme among Kandinsky's first seven ''Compositions'' is the [[apocalypse]] (the end of the world as we know it). Writing of the \"artist as prophet\" in his book, ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'', Kandinsky created paintings in the years immediately preceding World War I showing a coming cataclysm which would alter individual and social reality. Having a devout belief in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bauhaus Group: Six Masters of Modernism|url=https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/winter11/columbia_forum|website=Columbia College Today}}</ref> Kandinsky drew upon the biblical stories of [[Noah's Ark]], [[Jonah]] and the whale, Christ's [[resurrection]], the [[four horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in the [[book of Revelation]], Russian folktales and the common mythological experiences of death and rebirth. Never attempting to picture any one of these stories as a narrative, he used their veiled imagery as symbols of the archetypes of death\u2013rebirth and destruction\u2013creation he felt were imminent in the pre-[[World War I]] world.\n\nAs he stated in ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'' (see below), Kandinsky felt that an authentic artist creating art from \"an internal necessity\" inhabits the tip of an upward-moving pyramid. This progressing pyramid is penetrating and proceeding into the future. What was odd or inconceivable yesterday is commonplace today; what is ''avant garde'' today (and understood only by the few) is common knowledge tomorrow. The modern artist\u2013prophet stands alone at the apex of the pyramid, making new discoveries and ushering in tomorrow's reality. Kandinsky was aware of recent scientific developments and the advances of modern artists who had contributed to radically new ways of seeing and experiencing the world.\n\n''Composition IV'' and later paintings are primarily concerned with evoking a spiritual resonance in viewer and artist. As in his painting of the apocalypse by water (''Composition VI''), Kandinsky puts the viewer in the situation of experiencing these epic myths by translating them into contemporary terms (with a sense of desperation, flurry, urgency, and confusion). This spiritual communion of viewer-painting-artist/prophet may be described within the limits of words and images.\n\n=== Artistic and spiritual theorist ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6.jpg|thumb|''Composition VI'' (1913)|alt=Rectangular, multicoloured abstract painting]]\nAs the ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]] Almanac'' essays and theorising with composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind ([[synesthesia]]). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorised that (for example), yellow is the colour of middle [[C (musical note)|C]] on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. In 1871 the young Kandinsky learned to play the piano and cello.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}</ref><ref>Susan B. Hirschfeld, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Hilla von Rebay Foundation, ''Watercolours by Kandinsky at the Guggenheim Museum: a selection from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Hilla von Rebay Foundation'', 1991</ref>\n\nKandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships\u2014claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul. These theories are explained in ''Point and Line to Plane'' (see below).\n\nKandinsky's legendary stage design for a performance of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s \"[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]\" illustrates his synaesthetic concept of a universal correspondence of forms, colors and musical sounds.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bauhaus|last=Fiedler|first=Jeannine|publisher=h.f.ullmann publishing GmbH|year=2013|isbn=978-3-8480-0275-7|location=Germany|pages=262|via=}}</ref> In 1928 in the theater of Dessau, Wassily Kandinsky realized the stage production of \"Pictures at an Exhibition\". In 2015 the original designs of the stage elements were animated with modern video technology and synchronized with the music according to the preparatory notes of Kandinsky and the director's script of Felix Klee.\n\nDuring the studies Kandinsky made in preparation for ''Composition IV,'' he became exhausted while working on a painting and went for a walk. While he was out, Gabriele M\u00fcnter tidied his studio and inadvertently turned his canvas on its side. Upon returning and seeing the canvas (but not yet recognizing it) Kandinsky fell to his knees and wept, saying it was the most beautiful painting he had ever seen. He had been liberated from attachment to an object. As when he first viewed Monet's ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'', the experience would change his life.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn another episode with M\u00fcnter during the Bavarian [[abstract expressionist]] years, Kandinsky was working on his ''Composition VI''. From nearly six months of study and preparation, he had intended the work to evoke a flood, baptism, destruction, and rebirth simultaneously. After outlining the work on a mural-sized wood panel, he became blocked and could not go on. M\u00fcnter told him that he was trapped in his intellect and not reaching the true subject of the picture. She suggested he simply repeat the word ''uberflut'' (\"deluge\" or \"flood\") and focus on its sound rather than its meaning. Repeating this word like a mantra, Kandinsky painted and completed the monumental work in a three-day span.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Theoretical writings on art ==\nKandinsky's analyses on forms and colours result not from simple, arbitrary idea-associations but from the painter's inner experience. He spent years creating [[Abstract art|abstract]], sensorially rich paintings, working with form and colour, tirelessly observing his own paintings and those of other artists, noting their effects on his sense of colour.<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 5-11</ref> This subjective experience is something that anyone can do\u2014not scientific, objective observations but inner, subjective ones, what French philosopher [[Michel Henry]] calls  \"absolute subjectivity\" or the \"absolute [[phenomenological life]]\".<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 27</ref>\n\n=== ''Concerning the spiritual in art'' ===\n\nPublished in Munich in 1911, Kandinsky's text, ''\u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst'', defines three types of painting; ''impressions'', ''improvisations'' and ''compositions''. While impressions are based on an external reality that serves as a starting point, improvisations and compositions depict images emergent from the unconscious, though ''composition'' is developed from a more formal point of view.<ref name=\"Pompidou\">{{cite web|url=http://mediation.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-kandinsky-mono/ENS-kandinsky-monographie.html|title=Vassily Kandinsky|website=mediation.centrepompidou.fr}}</ref> Kandinsky compares the [[spirituality|spiritual]] life of humanity to a [[pyramid]]\u2014the artist has a mission to lead others to the pinnacle with his work. The point of the pyramid is those few, great artists. It is a spiritual pyramid, advancing and ascending slowly even if it sometimes appears immobile. During decadent periods, the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] sinks to the bottom of the pyramid; humanity searches only for external success, ignoring spiritual forces.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', \u00e9d. Deno\u00ebl, 1989, p. 61-75</ref>\n\nColours on the painter's palette evoke a double effect: a purely physical effect on the eye which is charmed by the beauty of colours, similar to the joyful impression when we eat a delicacy. This effect can be much deeper, however, causing a vibration of the soul or an \"inner resonance\"\u2014a spiritual effect in which the colour touches the soul itself.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', \u00e9d. Deno\u00ebl, 1989, pp. 105\u2013107</ref>\n\n\"Inner necessity\" is, for Kandinsky, the principle of art and the foundation of forms and the harmony of colours. He defines it as the principle of efficient contact of the form with the human soul.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', \u00e9d. Deno\u00ebl, 1989, p. 112 et 118</ref> Every [[shape|form]] is the delimitation of a surface by another one; it possesses an inner content, the effect it produces on one who looks at it attentively.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', \u00e9d.

He called the physical support and the material surface on which the artist draws or paints the ''basic plane'', or BP.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 143</ref> He did not analyze them objectively, but from the point of view of their inner effect on the observer.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', \u00e9d. Deno\u00ebl, 1989, p. 45 : \"Les id\u00e9es que je d\u00e9veloppe ici sont le r\u00e9sultat d'observations et d'exp\u00e9riences int\u00e9rieures\" c'est-\u00e0-dire purement subjectives. Cela vaut \u00e9galement pour ''Point et ligne sur plan'' qui en est \"le d\u00e9veloppement organique\" (avant-propos de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition, \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 9).</ref>\n\nA point is a small bit of colour put by the artist on the canvas. It is neither a geometric point nor a mathematical abstraction; it is extension, form and colour. This form can be a square, a triangle, a circle, a star or something more complex. The point is the most concise form but, according to its placement on the basic plane, it will take a different tonality. It can be isolated or resonate with other points or lines.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 25-63</ref>\n\nA line is the product of a force which has been applied in a given direction: the force exerted on the pencil or paintbrush by the artist. The produced linear forms may be of several types: a ''straight'' line, which results from a unique force applied in a single direction; an ''angular'' line, resulting from the alternation of two forces in different directions, or a ''curved'' (or ''wave-like'') line, produced by the effect of two forces acting simultaneously. A ''plane'' may be obtained by condensation (from a line rotated around one of its ends).<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 67-71</ref>\nThe subjective effect produced by a line depends on its orientation: a ''horizontal'' line corresponds with the ground on which man rests and moves; it possesses a dark and cold affective tonality similar to black or blue. A ''vertical'' line corresponds with height, and offers no support; it possesses a luminous, warm tonality close to white and yellow. A ''diagonal'' possesses a more-or-less warm (or cold) tonality, according to its inclination toward the horizontal or the vertical.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 69-70</ref>\n\nA force which deploys itself, without obstacle, as the one which produces a straight line corresponds with ''lyricism''; several forces which confront (or annoy) each other form a ''drama''.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, pp. 80\u201382</ref> The ''angle'' formed by the angular line also has an inner sonority which is warm and close to yellow for an acute angle (a triangle), cold and similar to blue for an obtuse angle (a circle), and similar to red for a right angle (a square).<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 89</ref>\n\nThe basic plane is, in general, rectangular or square. therefore, it is composed of horizontal and vertical lines which delimit it and define it as an autonomous entity which supports the painting, communicating its affective tonality. This tonality is determined by the relative importance of horizontal and vertical lines: the horizontals giving a calm, cold tonality to the basic plane while the verticals impart a calm, warm tonality.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 143-145</ref> The artist intuits the inner effect of the canvas format and dimensions, which he chooses according to the tonality he wants to give to his work. Kandinsky considered the basic plane a living being, which the artist \"fertilises\" and feels \"breathing\".<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 145-146</ref>\n\nEach part of the basic plane possesses an affective colouration; this influences the tonality of the pictorial elements which will be drawn on it, and contributes to the richness of the composition resulting from their juxtaposition on the canvas. The ''above'' of the basic plane corresponds with looseness and to lightness, while the ''below'' evokes condensation and heaviness. The painter's job is to listen and know these effects to produce paintings which are not just the effect of a random process, but the fruit of authentic work and the result of an effort towards inner beauty.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 146-151</ref>\n\nThis book contains many photographic examples and drawing from Kandinsky's works which offer the demonstration of its theoretical observations, and which allow the reader to reproduce in him the inner obviousness provided that he takes the time to look at those pictures with care, that he let them acting on its own sensibility and that he let vibrating the sensible and spiritual strings of his soul.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d.

A. Knopf (1947), p. 148</ref> Kandinsky learned from a variety of sources while in Moscow.  He studied many fields while in school, including law and economics.  Later in life, he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child. His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew. In 1889, he was part of an ethnographic research group which travelled to the [[Vologda]] region north of Moscow. In ''Looks on the Past'', he relates that the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colours that upon entering them, he felt that he was moving into a painting. This experience, and his study of the region's folk art (particularly the use of bright colours on a dark background), was reflected in much of his early work.  A few years later he first likened painting to composing music in the manner for which he would become noted, writing, \"Colour is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is the hand which plays, touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul\".<ref name=\"Sadler2004\">{{cite book|last=Kandinsky|first=Wassily|others=translated by Michael T. H.

That same year, before leaving Moscow, he saw an exhibit of paintings by [[Claude Monet|Monet]]. He was particularly taken with the impressionistic style of ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]''; this, to him, had a powerful sense of colour almost independent of the objects themselves. Later, he would write about this experience:\n\n{{quote|That it was a haystack the catalogue informed me. I could not recognise it. This non-recognition was painful to me. I considered that the painter had no right to paint indistinctly. I dully felt that the object of the painting was missing. And I noticed with surprise and confusion that the picture not only gripped me, but impressed itself ineradicably on my memory. Painting took on a fairy-tale power and splendour.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lindsay|first=Kenneth C.|title=Kandinsky: Complete Writings on Art|year=1982|publisher=G.K. Hall & Co.|page=363}}</ref> |Wassily Kandinsky}}\n\nKandinsky was similarly influenced during this period by [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' which, he felt, pushed the limits of music and melody beyond standard lyricism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ruckblick|last=Kandinsky|first=Wassily|publisher=Woldemar Klein Verlag|year=1955|isbn=|location=Baden-Baden|pages=12}}</ref> He was also spiritually influenced by [[Madame Blavatsky]] (1831\u20131891), the best-known exponent of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]. Theosophical theory postulates that creation is a geometrical progression, beginning with a single point. The creative aspect of the form is expressed by a descending series of circles, triangles and squares. Kandinsky's book ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'' (1910) and ''Point and Line to Plane'' (1926) echoed this theosophical tenet. Illustrations by John Varley in ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms]]'' (1901) influenced him visually.<ref>[[Sixten Ringbom]], The sounding cosmos; a study in the spiritualism of Kandinsky and the genesis of abstract painting, (Abo [Finland]: Abo Akademi, 1970), pgs 89 & 148a.</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Artistic metamorphosis (1896\u20131911)}}Metamorphosis ===\nIn the summer of 1902, Kandinsky invited [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]] to join him at his summer painting classes just south of Munich in the Alps. She accepted, and their relationship became more personal than professional.\nArt school, usually considered difficult, was easy for Kandinsky. It was during this time that he began to emerge as an art theorist as well as a painter. The number of his existing paintings increased in the beginning of the 20th century; much remains of the landscapes and towns he painted, using broad swaths of colour and recognisable forms. For the most part, however, Kandinsky's paintings did not feature any human figures; an exception is ''Sunday, Old Russia'' (1904), in which Kandinsky recreates a highly colourful (and fanciful) view of peasants and nobles in front of the walls of a town. ''Riding Couple'' (1907) depicts a man on horseback, holding a woman with tenderness and care as they ride past a Russian town with luminous walls across a blue river. The horse is muted while the leaves in the trees, the town, and the reflections in the river glisten with spots of colour and brightness. This work demonstrates the influence of [[pointillism]] in the way the depth of field is collapsed into a flat, luminescent surface. [[Fauvism]] is also apparent in these early works.  Colours are used to express Kandinsky's experience of subject matter, not to describe objective nature.\n\nPerhaps the most important of his paintings from the first decade of the 1900s was ''The Blue Rider'' (1903), which shows a small cloaked figure on a speeding horse rushing through a rocky meadow. The rider's cloak is medium blue, which casts a darker-blue shadow. In the foreground are more amorphous blue shadows, the counterparts of the fall trees in the background. The blue rider in the painting is prominent (but not clearly defined), and the horse has an unnatural gait (which Kandinsky must have known). Some art historians believe {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} that a second figure (perhaps a child) is being held by the rider, although this may be another shadow from the solitary rider. This intentional disjunction, allowing viewers to participate in the creation of the artwork, became an increasingly conscious technique used by Kandinsky in subsequent years; it culminated in the abstract works of the 1911\u20131914 period. In ''The Blue Rider'', Kandinsky shows the rider more as a series of colours than in specific detail. This painting is not exceptional in that regard when compared with contemporary painters, but it shows the direction Kandinsky would take only a few years later.\n\nFrom 1906 to 1908 Kandinsky spent a great deal of time travelling across Europe (he was an associate of the [[Blue Rose (art group)|Blue Rose]] symbolist group of Moscow), until he settled in the small [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]]. In 1908 he bought a copy of ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms]]'' by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]]. In 1909 he joined the Theosophical Society. ''The Blue Mountain'' (1908\u20131909) was painted at this time, demonstrating his trend toward abstraction. A mountain of blue is flanked by two broad trees, one yellow and one red. A procession, with three riders and several others, crosses at the bottom. The faces, clothing, and saddles of the riders are each a single color, and neither they nor the walking figures display any real detail. The flat planes and the contours also are indicative of Fauvist influence. The broad use of color in ''The Blue Mountain'' illustrates Kandinsky's inclination toward an art in which color is presented independently of form, and which each color is given equal attention. The composition is more planar; the painting is divided into four sections: the sky, the red tree, the yellow tree and the blue mountain with the three riders.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1898 - Odessa Port.jpg|''Odessa Port'', 1898, [[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow \nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1901 - Akhtyrka.jpg|''Akhtyrka'', 1901, [[Lenbachhaus]], Kunstarealm, Munich\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1906 - Rotterdam sun.jpg|''Rotterdam Sun'', 1906\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1908, Murnau, Dorfstrasse.jpg|''Murnau, Dorfstrasse (Street in Murnau, A Village Street)'', 1908, {{interlanguage link|Werner Merzbacher|de}} Collection\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1908 - Houses in Munich.jpg|''Houses in Munich'', 1908\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1909 - Murnau train et ch\u00e2teau.jpg|''Murnau, train & castle'', 1909\n</gallery>\n\n=== Blue Rider Period (1911\u20131914) ===\n{{See also|Der Blaue Reiter}}\n[[File:Wassily Kandinsky, 1910, Landscape with Factory Chimney, oil on canvas, 66.2 x 82 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.jpg|thumb|Wassily Kandinsky, 1910, ''Landscape with Factory Chimney'', oil on canvas, 66.2 x 82 cm, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]]]\nKandinsky's paintings from this period are large, expressive coloured masses evaluated independently from forms and lines; these serve no longer to delimit them, but overlap freely to form paintings of extraordinary force. Music was important to the birth of abstract art, since music is abstract by nature\u2014it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul. Kandinsky sometimes used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings \"improvisations\" and described more elaborate works as \"compositions.\"\n\nIn addition to painting, Kandinsky was an art theorist; his influence on the history of [[Western art]] stems perhaps more from his theoretical works than from his paintings. He helped found the [[Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung M\u00fcnchen]] (Munich New Artists' Association), becoming its president in 1909. However, the group could not integrate the radical approach of Kandinsky (and others) with conventional artistic concepts and the group dissolved in late 1911. Kandinsky then formed a new group, the Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]) with like-minded artists such as [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Albert Bloch]], and [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]]. The group released an almanac (''The Blue Rider Almanac'') and held two exhibits. More of each were planned, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 ended these plans and sent Kandinsky back to Russia via [[Switzerland]] and [[Sweden]].\n\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1912 - Improvisation 27, Garden of Love II.jpg|thumb|Wassily Kandinsky, ''Improvisation 27 (Garden of Love II)'', 1912, oil on canvas, 120.3 x 140.3 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. Exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]].]]\nHis writing in ''The Blue Rider Almanac'' and the treatise \"On the Spiritual In Art\" (which was released in 1910) were both a defence and promotion of abstract art and an affirmation that all forms of art were equally capable of reaching a level of spirituality. He believed that colour could be used in a painting as something autonomous, apart from the visual description of an object or other form.\n\nThese ideas had an almost-immediate international impact, particularly in the English-speaking world.<ref>See Michael Paraskos, \"English Expressionism,\" MRes Thesis, University of Leeds, Leeds 1997, p103f</ref> As early as 1912, ''On the Spiritual In Art'' was reviewed by [[Michael Sadleir]] in the London-based ''Art News.''<ref>Michael Sadleir, Review of Uber da Geistige an der Kunst by Wassily Kandinsky, in \"The Art News,\" 9 March 1912, p.45</ref> Interest in Kandinsky grew apace when Sadleir published an English translation of ''On the Spiritual In Art'' in 1914. Extracts from the book were published that year in [[Percy Wyndham Lewis]]'s periodical ''[[BLAST (magazine)|Blast]],'' and [[Alfred Orage]]'s weekly cultural newspaper ''[[The New Age]]''. Kandinsky had received some notice earlier in Britain, however; in 1910, he participated in the Allied Artists' Exhibition (organised by [[Frank Rutter]]) at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. This resulted in his work being singled out for praise in a review of that show by the artist [[Spencer Frederick Gore]] in ''The Art News''.<ref>Spencer Frederick Gore, \"The Allied Artists' Exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall (London)\", in \"The Art News,\" 4 August 1910, p.254</ref>\n\nSadleir's interest in Kandinsky also led to Kandinsky's first works entering a British art collection; Sadleir's father, [[Michael Sadler (educationist)|Michael Sadler]], acquired several wood-prints and the abstract painting ''Fragment for Composition VII'' in 1913 following a visit by father and son to meet Kandinsky in Munich that year. These works were displayed in [[Leeds]], either in the University or the premises of the [[Leeds Arts Club]], between 1913 and 1923.<ref>Tom Steele, \"Alfred Orage and the Leeds Arts Club 1893\u20131923\" (Mitcham, Orage Press, 2009) 218f</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1910 - The Cow.jpg|''The Cow'', 1910, [[Lenbachhaus]], Munich\nFile:Kandinsky Study for Improvisation V MIA 67342.jpg|''Study for Improvisation V '', 1910\nFile:Wassily Kandinsky, 1911, Reiter (Lyrishes), oil on canvas, 94 x 130 cm, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen.jpg|''The Rider'', 1911\nFile:Vassilly Kandinsky, 1912 - Landscape With Two Poplars.jpg|''Landscape With Two Poplars'' 1912\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Color Study, Squares with Concentric Circles.jpg|''Squares with Concentric Circles'', 1913\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6.jpg|''Composition 6'', 1913\nFile:W.

He painted little during this period, but devoted his time to artistic teaching, with a program based on form and colour analysis; he also helped organize the [[Institute of Artistic Culture]] in [[Moscow]] of which he was the first director. His spiritual, expressionistic view of art was ultimately rejected by the radical members of the Institute as too individualistic and bourgeois. In 1921, Kandinsky was invited to go to Germany to attend the [[Bauhaus]] of [[Weimar]] by its founder, architect [[Walter Gropius]].\n\n===Back in Germany and the Bauhaus (1922\u20131933) ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1923 - On White II.jpg|thumb|''On White II'', 1923]]\nIn May 1922 he attended the [[International Congress of Progressive Artists]] and signed the \"Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists\".<ref name=\"Review\">{{cite web |last1=van Doesburg |first1=Theo |title=De Stijl, \u201cA Short Review of the Proceedings [of the Congress of International Progressive Artists], Followed by the Statements Made by the Artists\u2019 Groups\u201d (1922) |url=https://modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/de-stijl-%E2%80%9Ca-short-review-of-the-proceedings-of-the-congress-of-international-progressive-artists-followed-by-the-statements-made-by-the-artists%E2%80%99-groups%E2%80%9D-1922/ |website=modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com |publisher=Ross Lawrence Wolfe |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKandinsky taught the basic design class for beginners and the course on advanced theory at the [[Bauhaus]]; he also conducted painting classes and a workshop in which he augmented his colour theory with new elements of form psychology. The development of his works on forms study, particularly on points and line forms, led to the publication of his second theoretical book (''Point and Line to Plane'') in 1926. His examinations of the effects of forces on straight lines, leading to the contrasting tones of curved and angled lines, coincided with the research of Gestalt psychologists, whose work was also discussed at the Bauhaus.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Kandinsky|last = D\u00fcchting|first = Hajo|publisher = Taschen|year = 2013|isbn = 978-3-8365-3146-7|location = |pages = 68}}</ref> Geometrical elements took on increasing importance in both his teaching and painting\u2014particularly the circle, half-circle, the angle, straight lines and curves. This period was intensely productive. This freedom is characterised in his works by the treatment of planes rich in colours and gradations\u2014as in ''Yellow \u2013 red \u2013 blue'' (1925), where Kandinsky illustrates his distance from the [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] and [[suprematism]] movements influential at the time.\n\nThe two-metre-wide ''Yellow \u2013 red \u2013 blue'' (1925)  of several main forms: a vertical yellow rectangle, an inclined red cross and a large dark blue circle; a multitude of straight (or sinuous) black lines, circular arcs, monochromatic circles and scattered, coloured checker-boards contribute to its delicate complexity. This simple visual identification of forms and the main coloured masses present on the canvas is only a first approach to the inner reality of the work, whose appreciation necessitates deeper observation\u2014not only of forms and colours involved in the painting but their relationship, their absolute and relative positions on the canvas and their harmony.\n\nKandinsky was one of [[Die Blaue Vier]] (Blue Four), formed in 1923 with [[Paul Klee]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], which lectured and exhibited in the United States in 1924. Due to right-wing hostility, the Bauhaus left Weimar and settled in [[Dessau]] in 1925. Following a Nazi smear campaign the Bauhaus left Dessau in 1932 for [[Berlin]], until its dissolution in July 1933. Kandinsky then left Germany, settling in [[Paris]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1922 - Kleine Welten I.jpg|''Small worlds I'', 1922\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1923 - Circles in a Circle.jpg|''Circles in a Circle'', 1923\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1926 - Several Circles, Gugg 0910 25.jpg|''Several Circles'', 1926\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1927 - Molle rudesse.jpg|''Soft Hard'', 1927\nFile:Wassily Kandinsky - Inner Alliance - 1929.jpg|''Inner Aliance'', 1929\n</gallery>\n\n=== Great Synthesis (1934\u20131944) ===\n\nLiving in an apartment in Paris, Kandinsky created his work in a living-room studio. [[Biomorphism|Biomorphic]] forms with supple, non-geometric outlines appear in his paintings\u2014forms which suggest microscopic organisms but express the artist's inner life. Kandinsky used original colour compositions, evoking Slavic popular art. He also occasionally mixed sand with paint to give a granular, rustic texture to his paintings.\n\nThis period corresponds to a synthesis of Kandinsky's previous work in which he used all elements, enriching them. In 1936 and 1939 he painted his final two major compositions, the type of elaborate canvases he had not produced for many years. ''Composition IX'' has highly contrasted, powerful diagonals whose central form gives the impression of an embryo in the womb. Small squares of colours and coloured bands stand out against the black background of ''Composition X'' as star fragments (or [[Solar filament|filaments]]), while enigmatic [[hieroglyph]]s with pastel tones cover a large maroon mass which seems to float in the upper-left corner of the canvas. In Kandinsky's work some characteristics are obvious, while certain touches are more discreet and veiled; they reveal themselves only progressively to those who deepen their connection with his work.<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 38-45 (The disclosure of pictoriality)</ref> He intended his forms (which he subtly harmonised and placed) to resonate with the observer's soul.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1935 - Brown with supplement.jpg|''Brown with supplement'', 1935\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1936 - Composition IX.jpg|''Composition IX'', 1936\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1939 - Composition 10.jpg|''Composition X'', 1939\n</gallery>\n\n== Kandinsky's conception of art ==\n{{Main|List of paintings by Wassily Kandinsky}}\n=== The artist as prophet ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 7.jpg|thumb|''Composition&nbsp;VII'', [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. According to Kandinsky, this is the most complex piece he ever painted (1913)|alt=Large, colourful abstract painting]]\nWriting that \"music is the ultimate teacher,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/quotes.php|title=Wassily Kandinsky \u2013 Quotes|website=www.wassilykandinsky.net|access-date=2016-09-17}}</ref> Kandinsky embarked upon the first seven of his ten ''Compositions''. The first three survive only in black-and-white photographs taken by fellow artist and friend [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]]. While studies, sketches, and improvisations exist (particularly of ''Composition II''), a Nazi raid on the [[Bauhaus]] in the 1930s resulted in the confiscation of Kandinsky's first three ''Compositions.'' They were displayed in the State-sponsored exhibit \"[[Degenerate Art]]\", and then destroyed (along with works by [[Paul Klee]], [[Franz Marc]] and other modern artists).\n\nFascinated by [[Christian eschatology]] and the perception of a coming New Age,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rabinovich|first1=Yakov|title=Kandinsky:   Master of the Mystic Arts|url=http://www.invisiblebooks.com/Kandinsky.htm}}</ref> a common theme among Kandinsky's first seven ''Compositions'' is the [[apocalypse]] (the end of the world as we know it). Writing of the \"artist as prophet\" in his book, ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'', Kandinsky created paintings in the years immediately preceding World War I showing a coming cataclysm which would alter individual and social reality. Having a devout belief in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bauhaus Group: Six Masters of Modernism|url=https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/winter11/columbia_forum|website=Columbia College Today}}</ref> Kandinsky drew upon the biblical stories of [[Noah's Ark]], [[Jonah]] and the whale, Christ's [[resurrection]], the [[four horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in the [[book of Revelation]], Russian folktales and the common mythological experiences of death and rebirth. Never attempting to picture any one of these stories as a narrative, he used their veiled imagery as symbols of the archetypes of death\u2013rebirth and destruction\u2013creation he felt were imminent in the pre-[[World War I]] world.\n\nAs he stated in ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'' (see below), Kandinsky felt that an authentic artist creating art from \"an internal necessity\" inhabits the tip of an upward-moving pyramid. This progressing pyramid is penetrating and proceeding into the future. What was odd or inconceivable yesterday is commonplace today; what is ''avant garde'' today (and understood only by the few) is common knowledge tomorrow. The modern artist\u2013prophet stands alone at the apex of the pyramid, making new discoveries and ushering in tomorrow's reality. Kandinsky was aware of recent scientific developments and the advances of modern artists who had contributed to radically new ways of seeing and experiencing the world.\n\n''Composition IV'' and later paintings are primarily concerned with evoking a spiritual resonance in viewer and artist. As in his painting of the apocalypse by water (''Composition VI''), Kandinsky puts the viewer in the situation of experiencing these epic myths by translating them into contemporary terms (with a sense of desperation, flurry, urgency, and confusion). This spiritual communion of viewer-painting-artist/prophet may be described within the limits of words and images.\n\n=== Artistic and spiritual theorist ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6.jpg|thumb|''Composition VI'' (1913)|alt=Rectangular, multicoloured abstract painting]]\nAs the ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]] Almanac'' essays and theorising with composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind ([[synesthesia]]). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorised that (for example), yellow is the colour of middle [[C (musical note)|C]] on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. In 1871 the young Kandinsky learned to play the piano and cello.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}</ref><ref>Susan B. Hirschfeld, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Hilla von Rebay Foundation, ''Watercolours by Kandinsky at the Guggenheim Museum: a selection from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Hilla von Rebay Foundation'', 1991</ref>\n\nKandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships\u2014claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul. These theories are explained in ''Point and Line to Plane'' (see below).\n\nKandinsky's legendary stage design for a performance of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s \"[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]\" illustrates his synaesthetic concept of a universal correspondence of forms, colors and musical sounds.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bauhaus|last=Fiedler|first=Jeannine|publisher=h.f.ullmann publishing GmbH|year=2013|isbn=978-3-8480-0275-7|location=Germany|pages=262|via=}}</ref> In 1928 in the theater of Dessau, Wassily Kandinsky realized the stage production of \"Pictures at an Exhibition\". In 2015 the original designs of the stage elements were animated with modern video technology and synchronized with the music according to the preparatory notes of Kandinsky and the director's script of Felix Klee.\n\nDuring the studies Kandinsky made in preparation for ''Composition IV,'' he became exhausted while working on a painting and went for a walk. While he was out, Gabriele M\u00fcnter tidied his studio and inadvertently turned his canvas on its side. Upon returning and seeing the canvas (but not yet recognizing it) Kandinsky fell to his knees and wept, saying it was the most beautiful painting he had ever seen. He had been liberated from attachment to an object. As when he first viewed Monet's ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'', the experience would change his life.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn another episode with M\u00fcnter during the Bavarian [[abstract expressionist]] years, Kandinsky was working on his ''Composition VI''. From nearly six months of study and preparation, he had intended the work to evoke a flood, baptism, destruction, and rebirth simultaneously. After outlining the work on a mural-sized wood panel, he became blocked and could not go on. M\u00fcnter told him that he was trapped in his intellect and not reaching the true subject of the picture. She suggested he simply repeat the word ''uberflut'' (\"deluge\" or \"flood\") and focus on its sound rather than its meaning. Repeating this word like a mantra, Kandinsky painted and completed the monumental work in a three-day span.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Theoretical writings on art ==\nKandinsky's analyses on forms and colours result not from simple, arbitrary idea-associations but from the painter's inner experience. He spent years creating [[Abstract art|abstract]], sensorially rich paintings, working with form and colour, tirelessly observing his own paintings and those of other artists, noting their effects on his sense of colour.<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 5-11</ref> This subjective experience is something that anyone can do\u2014not scientific, objective observations but inner, subjective ones, what French philosopher [[Michel Henry]] calls  \"absolute subjectivity\" or the \"absolute [[phenomenological life]]\".<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 27</ref>\n\n=== ''Concerning the spiritual in art'' ===\n\nPublished in Munich in 1911, Kandinsky's text, ''\u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst'', defines three types of painting; ''impressions'', ''improvisations'' and ''compositions''. While impressions are based on an external reality that serves as a starting point, improvisations and compositions depict images emergent from the unconscious, though ''composition'' is developed from a more formal point of view.<ref name=\"Pompidou\">{{cite web|url=http://mediation.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-kandinsky-mono/ENS-kandinsky-monographie.html|title=Vassily Kandinsky|website=mediation.centrepompidou.fr}}</ref> Kandinsky compares the [[spirituality|spiritual]] life of humanity to a [[pyramid]]\u2014the artist has a mission to lead others to the pinnacle with his work.

Deno\u00ebl, 1989, p. 61-75</ref>\n\nColours on the painter's palette evoke a double effect: a purely physical effect on the eye which is charmed by the beauty of colours, similar to the joyful impression when we eat a delicacy.

Deno\u00ebl, 1989, p. 45 : \"Les id\u00e9es que je d\u00e9veloppe ici sont le r\u00e9sultat d'observations et d'exp\u00e9riences int\u00e9rieures\" c'est-\u00e0-dire purement subjectives. Cela vaut \u00e9galement pour ''Point et ligne sur plan'' qui en est \"le d\u00e9veloppement organique\" (avant-propos de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition, \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 9).</ref>\n\nA point is a small bit of colour put by the artist on the canvas. It is neither a geometric point nor a mathematical abstraction; it is extension, form and colour. This form can be a square, a triangle, a circle, a star or something more complex. The point is the most concise form but, according to its placement on the basic plane, it will take a different tonality. It can be isolated or resonate with other points or lines.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 25-63</ref>\n\nA line is the product of a force which has been applied in a given direction: the force exerted on the pencil or paintbrush by the artist. The produced linear forms may be of several types: a ''straight'' line, which results from a unique force applied in a single direction; an ''angular'' line, resulting from the alternation of two forces in different directions, or a ''curved'' (or ''wave-like'') line, produced by the effect of two forces acting simultaneously. A ''plane'' may be obtained by condensation (from a line rotated around one of its ends).<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 67-71</ref>\nThe subjective effect produced by a line depends on its orientation: a ''horizontal'' line corresponds with the ground on which man rests and moves; it possesses a dark and cold affective tonality similar to black or blue. A ''vertical'' line corresponds with height, and offers no support; it possesses a luminous, warm tonality close to white and yellow. A ''diagonal'' possesses a more-or-less warm (or cold) tonality, according to its inclination toward the horizontal or the vertical.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 69-70</ref>\n\nA force which deploys itself, without obstacle, as the one which produces a straight line corresponds with ''lyricism''; several forces which confront (or annoy) each other form a ''drama''.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, pp. 80\u201382</ref> The ''angle'' formed by the angular line also has an inner sonority which is warm and close to yellow for an acute angle (a triangle), cold and similar to blue for an obtuse angle (a circle), and similar to red for a right angle (a square).<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 89</ref>\n\nThe basic plane is, in general, rectangular or square. therefore, it is composed of horizontal and vertical lines which delimit it and define it as an autonomous entity which supports the painting, communicating its affective tonality. This tonality is determined by the relative importance of horizontal and vertical lines: the horizontals giving a calm, cold tonality to the basic plane while the verticals impart a calm, warm tonality.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 143-145</ref> The artist intuits the inner effect of the canvas format and dimensions, which he chooses according to the tonality he wants to give to his work. Kandinsky considered the basic plane a living being, which the artist \"fertilises\" and feels \"breathing\".<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 145-146</ref>\n\nEach part of the basic plane possesses an affective colouration; this influences the tonality of the pictorial elements which will be drawn on it, and contributes to the richness of the composition resulting from their juxtaposition on the canvas. The ''above'' of the basic plane corresponds with looseness and to lightness, while the ''below'' evokes condensation and heaviness. The painter's job is to listen and know these effects to produce paintings which are not just the effect of a random process, but the fruit of authentic work and the result of an effort towards inner beauty.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 146-151</ref>\n\nThis book contains many photographic examples and drawing from Kandinsky's works which offer the demonstration of its theoretical observations, and which allow the reader to reproduce in him the inner obviousness provided that he takes the time to look at those pictures with care, that he let them acting on its own sensibility and that he let vibrating the sensible and spiritual strings of his soul.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, Appendice, p. 185-235</ref>\n\n== Miscellaneous information ==\n\n=== Art market ===\nIn 2012, [[Christie's]] auctioned Kandinsky's ''Studie f\u00fcr Improvisation 8 (Study for Improvisation 8)'', a 1909 view of a man wielding a broadsword in a rainbow-hued village, for $23 million.
