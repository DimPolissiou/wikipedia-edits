Saint-Andr\u00e9 also eliminated holidays, industrializing the coastal city into a system split into day and night shifts enforced by strict military rule. Royalist officers were imprisoned, discipline restored, and a new regime of training introduced across the navy. The officer corps and civilian administration of the navy were brought up to strength. Lighthouses were built at Penmarch and Groix, and new ships of the line were built. These changes sought to turn Brest into an absolute collectivist city, where all was at service to the Republic.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/frenchrevolutio04aulagoog|title=The revolutionary government, 1793-1797|last=Aulard|first=Fran\u00e7ois-Alphonse|date=1910-01-01|publisher=C.

This phase is associated with high rates of wind-blown mineral dust, found in marine cores that come from the north tropical Atlantic.\n\n{{Main|African humid period}}\nAround 12,500 BC, the amount of dust in the cores in the [[B\u00f8lling Oscillation|B\u00f8lling]]/[[Aller\u00f8d Oscillation|Aller\u00f8d]] phase suddenly plummets and shows a period of much wetter conditions in the Sahara, indicating a [[Dansgaard-Oeschger event|Dansgaard-Oeschger]] (DO) event (a sudden warming followed by a slower cooling of the climate). The moister Saharan conditions had begun about 12,500 BC, with the extension of the ITCZ northward in the northern hemisphere summer, bringing moist wet conditions and a savanna climate to the Sahara, which (apart from a short dry spell associated with the [[Younger Dryas]]) peaked during the [[Holocene thermal maximum]] climatic phase at 4000 BC when mid-latitude temperatures seem to have been between 2 and 3 degrees warmer than in the recent past.  Analysis of [[Nile River]] deposited sediments in the delta also shows this period had a higher proportion of sediments coming from the [[Blue Nile]], suggesting higher rainfall also in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]].

Their first match was on 16 June 1957 against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Bogot\u00e1, a 1\u20131 draw. Colombia lost their next matches, leaving them at the bottom of the group.\n\n[[File:1447 soccer 30.png|thumb|left|Stamp commemorating the match played against Uruguay in the 1962 World Cup.]]\nColombia qualified for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], its first-ever [[FIFA World Cup]] by eliminating [[Peru national football team|Peru]] 2\u20131 on aggregate. At the 1962 World Cup, Colombia was drawn into a tough group containing [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]; both had achieved notable results comparing to Colombia. Colombia lost its first match, 2\u20131 against Uruguay. [[Luis Cubilla]] and Jorge Sas\u00eda scored for Uruguay at the 56th and 75th minute respectively, while [[Francisco Zuluaga]] scored a 19th-minute penalty goal for Colombia to give the Colombians their first-ever World Cup goal and a shock lead. In the second match, they earned a 4\u20134 draw with the USSR, champions of the [[1960 European Nations' Cup]]. In this game, Colombia scored four goals against Soviet goalkeeper [[Lev Yashin]], widely considered the best goalkeeper in football history. Also in that game, [[Marcos Coll]] scored the only [[olympic goal]] in World Cup history so far. Unfortunately, the Colombian campaign in 1962 ended with a 5\u20130 defeat against Yugoslavia, who finished in fourth place in the tournament. After the 1962 World Cup, Colombia didn't qualify for over 28 years before they returned in the 1990 edition.\n\n===1990s: The Golden Era===\n[[File:Selecci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol de Colombia, Italia 90.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Colombia at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]]]\nAt [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]], Colombia was once again drawn with the Yugoslavs, alongside [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] and powerhouse [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. Colombia defeated 2\u20130 to the United Arab Emirates to make its the first-ever win in the World Cup, then lost to Yugoslavia 1\u20130, but earned their place in the Round of 16 after a respectable 1\u20131 draw with West Germany, who would later win the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. Colombia would be eliminated in their next match against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] with a [[Cameroon v Colombia (1990 FIFA World Cup)|2\u20131 defeat in extra time]], marked the rise of the new Colombian generation known as Colombian first Golden Generation.\n\nFor the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], Colombia finished top of their qualifying group without having lost a match, which included a historic 5\u20130 win over Argentina in [[Buenos Aires]]. Expectations of the team were high, some even naming them as favorites to win the tournament. Colombia was assigned to the Group A with the hosts [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. During the tournament, [[Colombian conflict|internal conflict within Colombia]] proved to be detrimental and harmful for the Colombian squad as the team was distracted from their main goal. Colombia only earned one win over Switzerland and suffered two losses, which would eliminate them in the first phase. The first match against Romania ended with a 3\u20131 defeat that resulted in cartels' threats to relatives of Colombian players. During the match against the United States, an unwanted incident occurred, when [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]] scored an own goal, leading to Colombia's elimination. Escobar was later murdered following the own goal in Colombia. This traumatic incident would lead to the demise of Colombia's first Golden Generation.\n\nColombia ended their qualification for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] in third place with 28 points, two points below first-place Argentina with 30 points. Colombia was assigned to the Group G alongside [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], [[England national football team|England]] and once again, Romania.

Former skipper Valderrama started calling the games a ''\u201cclassic\u201d'' and stated ''\u201cVenezuela kill themselves ''[do their best]'' playing against us.\u201d'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marca.com/2013/03/26/futbol/futbol_internacional/colombia/1364253932.html|title=Valderrama: \"Venezuela se mata jugando contra nosotros\"\"|publisher=Marca |date= |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2020, Colombia has not been able to win in Venezuelan soil since 1996. During Jose Pekerman\u2019s coaching for the [[2014 World Cup qualification]], considered the rebirth of Colombian football, Venezuela still managed to win their game at home, which was one of only three defeats the Argentinean suffered. Venezuela also won the group stage game against Colombia in the [[2015 Copa America]] which were their only 3 points, Colombia still managed to advance to the knockout stage while Venezuela ended last. However, the matches are still not as popular as the rival matches against Argentina.\n\nThe historical Colombian 5\u20130 victory in 1993, beating host Argentina in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] qualifiers, was the very first time Argentina lost in its home stadium [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]] during a qualifying match for a World Cup. Argentina comes as a previous twice World Cup champion. It caused a huge upset and start of a respective rivalry. Unlike other rivalries full of hostility, the Colombian\u2013Argentine rivalry is more based on \"respect\" than a \"hated\" relationship always attracting great interest between both nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deportes.terra.com/futbol/futbol-colombiano/colombia-argentina-rivalidad-llena-de-historia-y-anecdotas,040ba079b8c42310VgnVCM3000009af154d0RCRD.html |title=Colombia-Argentina: rivalidad llena de Historia y an\u00e9cdotas \u2013 Terra USA |publisher=Deportes.terra.com |date= |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref> After the wane of the Valderrama\u2019s generation, the rivalry became one-sided again and since then only Colombians kept considering a classic while Argentineans consider it many steps below their historic rivalries against Brazil, England and Uruguay.\n\nColombia also has another small rivalry against Peru, which both fought in the [[Leticia Incident|Leticia War]] to control the Amazon region. Peru is often seen as the buildup of Colombia's football successes, as Colombia had eliminated Peru at the 1962 World Cup qualification to secure its maiden appearance. Matches between two teams also draw a great level of intensity, though not as hostile as with Colombia's rivalry to Brazil.\n\nColombia has a more hostile rivalry against Brazil due to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] encounter, where Brazil defeated Colombia 2\u20131 overshadowed by [[Neymar]]'s injury and referee's favoritism towards Brazil against Colombia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2014/07/06/neymars-injury-and-brazils-brutality-against-colombia-at-world-cup-an-alternate-view/|title=Neymar's Injury And Brazil's Brutality Against Colombia At World Cup - An Alternate View|first=Bobby|last=McMahon|website=Forbes}}</ref>; This would later cause matches between the two national teams to be more intense, aggressive and to a certain extent, played with great hostility with numerous violent incidents, especially during the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/jun/17/copa-america-2015-brazil-v-colombia-live|title=Copa Am\u00e9rica 2015: Brazil 0-1 Colombia \u2013 as it happened|first=Bryan Armen|last=Graham|date=18 June 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>; The rivalry would soon improve in a less hostile manner after the [[2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals]] after [[Atl\u00e9tico Nacional]] asked to award the trophy for [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Chapecoense de Futebol]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/11/29/atletico-nacional-asks-chapecoense-awarded-copa-sudamericana/|title=Atletico Nacional ask for Chapecoense to be declared Copa Sudamericana champions after plane crash|first=Callum|last=Davis|date=30 November 2016|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>; Nonetheless, it remains a competitive rivalry between the two.\n\n==Team image==\n{{see also|History of the Colombia national football team#Kits|label 1=Colombia national football team kit history}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff; width:60%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 style=\"with:100%; text-align:center;\"| Colombia current kit <small>(2017\u20132019)</small>\n|-\n!

Their first match was on 16 June 1957 against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Bogot\u00e1, a 1\u20131 draw.

At the 1962 World Cup, Colombia was drawn into a tough group containing [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]; both had achieved notable results comparing to Colombia. Colombia lost its first match, 2\u20131 against Uruguay. [[Luis Cubilla]] and Jorge Sas\u00eda scored for Uruguay at the 56th and 75th minute respectively, while [[Francisco Zuluaga]] scored a 19th-minute penalty goal for Colombia to give the Colombians their first-ever World Cup goal and a shock lead. In the second match, they earned a 4\u20134 draw with the USSR, champions of the [[1960 European Nations' Cup]]. In this game, Colombia scored four goals against Soviet goalkeeper [[Lev Yashin]], widely considered the best goalkeeper in football history. Also in that game, [[Marcos Coll]] scored the only [[olympic goal]] in World Cup history so far. Unfortunately, the Colombian campaign in 1962 ended with a 5\u20130 defeat against Yugoslavia, who finished in fourth place in the tournament. After the 1962 World Cup, Colombia didn't qualify for over 28 years before they returned in the 1990 edition.\n\n===1990s: The Golden Era===\n[[File:Selecci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol de Colombia, Italia 90.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Colombia at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]]]\nAt [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]], Colombia was once again drawn with the Yugoslavs, alongside [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] and powerhouse [[Germany national football team|West Germany]].

Expectations of the team were high, some even naming them as favorites to win the tournament. Colombia was assigned to the Group A with the hosts [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. During the tournament, [[Colombian conflict|internal conflict within Colombia]] proved to be detrimental and harmful for the Colombian squad as the team was distracted from their main goal. Colombia only earned one win over Switzerland and suffered two losses, which would eliminate them in the first phase. The first match against Romania ended with a 3\u20131 defeat that resulted in cartels' threats to relatives of Colombian players. During the match against the United States, an unwanted incident occurred, when [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]] scored an own goal, leading to Colombia's elimination. Escobar was later murdered following the own goal in Colombia. This traumatic incident would lead to the demise of Colombia's first Golden Generation.\n\nColombia ended their qualification for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] in third place with 28 points, two points below first-place Argentina with 30 points. Colombia was assigned to the Group G alongside [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], [[England national football team|England]] and once again, Romania. Romania, like the 1994 edition, obtained a 1\u20130 victory in the first match. Colombia's second match was a 1\u20130 win against Tunisia, with a goal from [[Leider Preciado]].

Colombia then fell to hosts [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 2\u20131 in the quarter-final round in controversy, where media and figures such as [[Diego Maradona]] criticized FIFA and [[Carlos Velasco Carballo]] for \"favoring\" Brazil and being biased in disallowing a goal from [[Mario Yepes]] and allowing too many fouls by the Brazilians to occur without any yellow cards being shown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/27463709 |title=World Cup 2014: Brazil v Colombia \u2013 BBC Sport |website=Bbc.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2014/07/05/en/football/national_teams/1404560207.html |title=Maradona: \"FIFA and ref gave Brazil licence to kick\" \u2013 MARCA.com (English version) |website=MARCA.com |date= |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/05/brazil-colombia-world-cup-referee |title=Brazil v Colombia referee: I am not allowed to discuss decisions  |publisher=The Guardian |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Simon Rice |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/worldcup/neymar-out-revealed--fifa-selected-lenient-referees-for-quarterfinals-9586697.html |title=Neymar out: REVEALED \u2013 Fifa selected lenient referees for quarter-finals |publisher=The Independent |date=5 July 2014 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Burrows |first=Ben |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2014/world-cup-2014-james-rodriguez-3816818 |title=World Cup 2014: James Rodriguez slams referee Carlos Velasco Carballo as Colombia bow out to Brazil |website=Mirror.co.uk |date=5 July 2014 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lopez |first=Amy |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/maradona-angry-at-officials-in-brazil-colombia-game-171038640.html |title=Maradona angry at officials in Brazil-Colombia game |website=Sports.yahoo.com |date=5 July 2014 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nDespite the elimination, the national team was greeted by tens of thousands of Colombians in Bogot\u00e1, welcoming them back as heroes and restoring pride to the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=7/news=thousands-welcome-home-cafeteros-2400922.html#fblg |title=Thousands welcome home Cafeteros |publisher=FIFA |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007120054/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y%3D2014/m%3D7/news%3Dthousands-welcome-home-cafeteros-2400922.html#fblg |archivedate=7 October 2015  }}</ref> Colombia would then receive the [[FIFA World Cup Fair Play Trophy|FIFA Fair Play Trophy]] and have [[James Rodr\u00edguez]] and [[Juan Cuadrado]] end as the World Cup's leading goal scorer and assist leader, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=7/news=messi-heralded-as-brazil-2014-s-best-2404615.html |title=Messi, Neuer heralded as Brazil 2014\u2019s best |publisher=FIFA |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/statistics/players/goal-scored.html |title=2018 FIFA World Cup Russia\u2122 |publisher=FIFA |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n====2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica====\nColombia had a disappointing [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], having won only a single game during the group stage match against Brazil, with their only goal of the tournament.

However, because of the lack of interest for football in Venezuela, the rivalry was historically very one-sided for Colombia and thus considered irrelevant. This state of affairs started to change from the 1990s, when football slowly began replacing [[baseball]] as Venezuela\u2019s main sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/deportes-2/copa-america-2019/2019/06/28/edgardo-broner-en-venezuela-hoy-la-vinotinto-es-mas-que-el-beisbol/|title=Edgardo Broner: \"En Venezuela, hoy la Vinotinto es m\u00e1s que el b\u00e9isbol\"|publisher=Infobae |date= |accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Coach Luis Garcia was sacked for only managing a draw on an away game in [[San Cristobal]] which ended 2-2 and a victory was taken for granted. This was just a sign of things to come. Four years later for the qualification for the 2006 World Cup, Venezuela stunned the continent by defeating Colombia in Barranquilla 0-1. The game showed the new direction of the rivalry: While Colombia remains ahead on all rankings and competitions, Venezuela always outperform themselves when meeting each other. Former skipper Valderrama started calling the games a ''\u201cclassic\u201d'' and stated ''\u201cVenezuela kill themselves ''[do their best]'' playing against us.\u201d'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marca.com/2013/03/26/futbol/futbol_internacional/colombia/1364253932.html|title=Valderrama: \"Venezuela se mata jugando contra nosotros\"\"|publisher=Marca |date= |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2020, Colombia has not been able to win in Venezuelan soil since 1996. During Jose Pekerman\u2019s coaching for the [[2014 World Cup qualification]], considered the rebirth of Colombian football, Venezuela still managed to win their game at home, which was one of only three defeats the Argentinean suffered. Venezuela also won the group stage game against Colombia in the [[2015 Copa America]] which were their only 3 points, Colombia still managed to advance to the knockout stage while Venezuela ended last. However, the matches are still not as popular as the rival matches against Argentina.\n\nThe historical Colombian 5\u20130 victory in 1993, beating host Argentina in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] qualifiers, was the very first time Argentina lost in its home stadium [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]] during a qualifying match for a World Cup. Argentina comes as a previous twice World Cup champion. It caused a huge upset and start of a respective rivalry. Unlike other rivalries full of hostility, the Colombian\u2013Argentine rivalry is more based on \"respect\" than a \"hated\" relationship always attracting great interest between both nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deportes.terra.com/futbol/futbol-colombiano/colombia-argentina-rivalidad-llena-de-historia-y-anecdotas,040ba079b8c42310VgnVCM3000009af154d0RCRD.html |title=Colombia-Argentina: rivalidad llena de Historia y an\u00e9cdotas \u2013 Terra USA |publisher=Deportes.terra.com |date= |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref> After the wane of the Valderrama\u2019s generation, the rivalry became one-sided again and since then only Colombians kept considering a classic while Argentineans consider it many steps below their historic rivalries against Brazil, England and Uruguay.\n\nColombia also has another small rivalry against Peru, which both fought in the [[Leticia Incident|Leticia War]] to control the Amazon region. Peru is often seen as the buildup of Colombia's football successes, as Colombia had eliminated Peru at the 1962 World Cup qualification to secure its maiden appearance. Matches between two teams also draw a great level of intensity, though not as hostile as with Colombia's rivalry to Brazil.\n\nColombia has a more hostile rivalry against Brazil due to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] encounter, where Brazil defeated Colombia 2\u20131 overshadowed by [[Neymar]]'s injury and referee's favoritism towards Brazil against Colombia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2014/07/06/neymars-injury-and-brazils-brutality-against-colombia-at-world-cup-an-alternate-view/|title=Neymar's Injury And Brazil's Brutality Against Colombia At World Cup - An Alternate View|first=Bobby|last=McMahon|website=Forbes}}</ref>; This would later cause matches between the two national teams to be more intense, aggressive and to a certain extent, played with great hostility with numerous violent incidents, especially during the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/jun/17/copa-america-2015-brazil-v-colombia-live|title=Copa Am\u00e9rica 2015: Brazil 0-1 Colombia \u2013 as it happened|first=Bryan Armen|last=Graham|date=18 June 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>; The rivalry would soon improve in a less hostile manner after the [[2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals]] after [[Atl\u00e9tico Nacional]] asked to award the trophy for [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Chapecoense de Futebol]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/11/29/atletico-nacional-asks-chapecoense-awarded-copa-sudamericana/|title=Atletico Nacional ask for Chapecoense to be declared Copa Sudamericana champions after plane crash|first=Callum|last=Davis|date=30 November 2016|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>; Nonetheless, it remains a competitive rivalry between the two.\n\n==Team image==\n{{see also|History of the Colombia national football team#Kits|label 1=Colombia national football team kit history}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff; width:60%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 style=\"with:100%; text-align:center;\"| Colombia current kit <small>(2017\u20132019)</small>\n|-\n!

While shooting these films, they became romantically involved. The two of them were paired in seven films together: ''[[Vidya (film)|Vidya]]'' (1948), ''[[Jeet (1949 film)|Jeet]]'' (1949), ''[[Shair (1949 film)|Shair]]'' (1949), ''[[Afsar (1950 film)|Afsar]]'' (1950), ''[[Nili (1950 film)|Nili]]'' (1950), ''Do Sitare'' (1951) and ''[[Sanam (1951 film)|Sanam]]'' (1951), all of which were successful at the box office. In these films, Suraiya was always first-biller in the credits, indicating that she was a bigger star than Anand. She fell in love with him during the shooting of the song ''Kinare Kinare Chale Jayen Ge'' from the film ''[[Vidya (film)|Vidya]]''\u2014 while shooting the scene, the boat they were in capsized, and Anand saved Suraiya from drowning. Initially, Suraiya's family used to welcome Dev Anand at home, but when her maternal grandmother found out that the two were in love, and even planned an actual marriage on the set of ''Jeet'', she started monitoring them. The two shared love letters and messages through their co-actors, like Durga Khote and Kamini Kaushal, who went out of their way to engineer secret rendezvous. During the shooting of the film ''Afsar'' (1950), Anand finally proposed to Suraiya and gave her a diamond ring worth Rs 3,000. Her maternal grandmother opposed the relationship as they were Muslim and Anand was Hindu, and so, Suraiya remained unmarried.<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/slide-show-1-excerpts-from-dev-anands-/20111208.htm How the Dev Anand-Suraiya love affair ended] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810173300/http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/slide-show-1-excerpts-from-dev-anands-/20111208.htm |date=10 August 2018 }}.

Anand began looking for an opportunity to play the main male lead in a film where his acting skills could be demonstrated, so as to dispel scepticism about his acting abilities.\n\nDev Anand often spoke about Suraiya and his love affair with her, in various interviews he gave to film magazines, such as ''Star Dust'' (June 1972 issue), ''Star & Style'' (Feb 1987 issue) and TV to Karan Thapar for BBC (2002), while both were alive, and after Suraiya's death in interviews given on TV to Simi Garewal (''Rendezvouz with Simi Garewal'') and others on TV and for news magazines.\n\n===Break and the 1950s===\nAnand was offered his first big break by [[Ashok Kumar]]. He spotted Anand hanging around in the studios and picked him as the hero for the [[Bombay Talkies]] production ''[[Ziddi (1948 film)|Ziddi]]'' (1948), co-starring [[Kamini Kaushal]], which became an instant success. After ''Ziddi''{{'}}s success, Anand decided that he would start producing films. It was in the film ''Ziddi'', where the first ever Kishore-Lata duet, \"Yeh Kaun Aaya Karke Yeh Sola Singhar\",  was recorded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.realbollywood.com/dev-anand-movies-songs/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923112313/http://www.realbollywood.com/2011/08/lata-dev-anand-recall-kishore-birth-anniversary.html|url-status=dead |title=Dev Anand [Biography] Movies, Songs, Age, Height, Wife, Wiki & More|date=1 May 2019|archivedate=23 September 2013|accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref> This duet was an instant hit, and from here on both playback singers' associations with Dev Anand began. This continued for the next four decades. His association with Kishore Kumar started when the former sang the first solo of his playback singing career&nbsp;\u2013 \"Marne Ki Duayen\"&nbsp;\u2013 picturised on Dev Anand in the movie ''Ziddi''. Dev had forged a very strong bond of friendship with [[Kishore Kumar]] during the making of the film. In 1949, he launched his own company ''[[Navketan Films]]'' (named after his elder brother Chetan's son Ketan and which means \"New Banner\"), which, as of 2011, has produced 35 films.\n\nDev chose [[Guru Dutt]] as director for the crime thriller, ''[[Baazi (1951 film)|Baazi]]'' (1951). The film, starring Dev Anand, Geeta Bali and Kalpana Kartik was a trendsetter, regarded as the forerunner of the spate of urban crime films that followed in Bollywood in the 1950s. The film ''Baazi'' saw the debut of [[Kalpana Kartik]] (aka Mona Singha) as the lead female actress and [[Guru Dutt]] as a director. The collaboration was a success at the box office and the duo of Dev Anand and Kalpana Kartik were offered many films to star in together. They signed all the film offers and subsequently the movies ''[[Aandhiyan (1952 film)|Aandhiyan]]'' (1952), ''[[Taxi Driver (1954 film)|Taxi Driver]]'' (1954), ''[[House No. 44]]'' (1955) and ''[[Nau Do Gyarah]]'' (1957) went on to become big hits too. During the making of the film ''Taxi Driver'', the couple fell in love and Dev proposed marriage to his heroine Kalpana. In 1954, ''Taxi Driver'' was declared a hit and the two decided to marry in a quiet ceremony. The couple had a son, [[Suneil Anand]] in 1956 and later a daughter, Devina, was born.

The second time they met was in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, he visited him on the set of ''Roman Holiday''. \"I was returning from the Venice film fest.

While shooting these films, they became romantically involved. The two of them were paired in seven films together: ''[[Vidya (film)|Vidya]]'' (1948), ''[[Jeet (1949 film)|Jeet]]'' (1949), ''[[Shair (1949 film)|Shair]]'' (1949), ''[[Afsar (1950 film)|Afsar]]'' (1950), ''[[Nili (1950 film)|Nili]]'' (1950), ''Do Sitare'' (1951) and ''[[Sanam (1951 film)|Sanam]]'' (1951), all of which were successful at the box office. In these films, Suraiya was always first-biller in the credits, indicating that she was a bigger star than Anand.

Initially, Suraiya's family used to welcome Dev Anand at home, but when her maternal grandmother found out that the two were in love, and even planned an actual marriage on the set of ''Jeet'', she started monitoring them. The two shared love letters and messages through their co-actors, like Durga Khote and Kamini Kaushal, who went out of their way to engineer secret rendezvous. During the shooting of the film ''Afsar'' (1950), Anand finally proposed to Suraiya and gave her a diamond ring worth Rs 3,000. Her maternal grandmother opposed the relationship as they were Muslim and Anand was Hindu, and so, Suraiya remained unmarried.<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/slide-show-1-excerpts-from-dev-anands-/20111208.htm How the Dev Anand-Suraiya love affair ended] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810173300/http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/slide-show-1-excerpts-from-dev-anands-/20111208.htm |date=10 August 2018 }}.

Anand began looking for an opportunity to play the main male lead in a film where his acting skills could be demonstrated, so as to dispel scepticism about his acting abilities.\n\nDev Anand often spoke about Suraiya and his love affair with her, in various interviews he gave to film magazines, such as ''Star Dust'' (June 1972 issue), ''Star & Style'' (Feb 1987 issue) and TV to Karan Thapar for BBC (2002), while both were alive, and after Suraiya's death in interviews given on TV to Simi Garewal (''Rendezvouz with Simi Garewal'') and others on TV and for news magazines.\n\n===Break and the 1950s===\nAnand was offered his first big break by [[Ashok Kumar]]. He spotted Anand hanging around in the studios and picked him as the hero for the [[Bombay Talkies]] production ''[[Ziddi (1948 film)|Ziddi]]'' (1948), co-starring [[Kamini Kaushal]], which became an instant success. After ''Ziddi''{{'}}s success, Anand decided that he would start producing films. It was in the film ''Ziddi'', where the first ever Kishore-Lata duet, \"Yeh Kaun Aaya Karke Yeh Sola Singhar\",  was recorded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.realbollywood.com/dev-anand-movies-songs/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923112313/http://www.realbollywood.com/2011/08/lata-dev-anand-recall-kishore-birth-anniversary.html|url-status=dead |title=Dev Anand [Biography] Movies, Songs, Age, Height, Wife, Wiki & More|date=1 May 2019|archivedate=23 September 2013|accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref> This duet was an instant hit, and from here on both playback singers' associations with Dev Anand began. This continued for the next four decades. His association with Kishore Kumar started when the former sang the first solo of his playback singing career&nbsp;\u2013 \"Marne Ki Duayen\"&nbsp;\u2013 picturised on Dev Anand in the movie ''Ziddi''. Dev had forged a very strong bond of friendship with [[Kishore Kumar]] during the making of the film. In 1949, he launched his own company ''[[Navketan Films]]'' (named after his elder brother Chetan's son Ketan and which means \"New Banner\"), which, as of 2011, has produced 35 films.\n\nDev chose [[Guru Dutt]] as director for the crime thriller, ''[[Baazi (1951 film)|Baazi]]'' (1951). The film, starring Dev Anand, Geeta Bali and Kalpana Kartik was a trendsetter, regarded as the forerunner of the spate of urban crime films that followed in Bollywood in the 1950s. The film ''Baazi'' saw the debut of [[Kalpana Kartik]] (aka Mona Singha) as the lead female actress and [[Guru Dutt]] as a director. The collaboration was a success at the box office and the duo of Dev Anand and Kalpana Kartik were offered many films to star in together. They signed all the film offers and subsequently the movies ''[[Aandhiyan (1952 film)|Aandhiyan]]'' (1952), ''[[Taxi Driver (1954 film)|Taxi Driver]]'' (1954), ''[[House No. 44]]'' (1955) and ''[[Nau Do Gyarah]]'' (1957) went on to become big hits too. During the making of the film ''Taxi Driver'', the couple fell in love and Dev proposed marriage to his heroine Kalpana. In 1954, ''Taxi Driver'' was declared a hit and the two decided to marry in a quiet ceremony. The couple had a son, [[Suneil Anand]] in 1956 and later a daughter, Devina, was born. After her marriage, Kalpana decided not to pursue her acting career further. ''[[Nau Do Gyarah]]'' was the couple's last movie together.\n\nA rapid-fire style of dialogue delivery and a penchant for nodding while speaking became Dev's style in films such as ''[[House No. 44]]'' (1955), ''[[Pocket Maar (1956 film)|Pocket Maar]]'' (1956), ''[[Munimji]]'' (1955), ''[[Funtoosh]]'' (1956), ''[[C.I.D.

''[[Guide]]'', directed by younger brother Vijay Anand, was an acclaimed movie. Dev played Raju, a voluble guide, who supports Rosy (Waheeda) in her bid for freedom.  He is not above thoughtlessly exploiting her for personal gains. Combining style with substance, he gave an affecting performance as a man grappling with his emotions in his passage through love, shame and salvation.\n\nHe reunited with Vijay Anand for the movie ''[[Jewel Thief]]'', based on the thriller genre which featured [[Vyjayanthimala]], [[Tanuja]], [[Anju Mahendru]], [[Faryal]] and [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] and was very successful.

The film was directed by Dev's brother, Vijay and was also successful. In 1971 he paired again with Zaheeda in ''[[Gambler (film)|Gambler]]'' which went on to become a success.\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Raj Kapoor]] started playing roles of fathers in films such as ''[[Kal Aaj Aur Kal]]'' in 1971 and ''[[Dharam Karam]]'' in 1974 and had put on a lot of weight and films with [[Dilip Kumar]] as lead hero like ''[[Dastaan (1972 film)|Dastaan]]'' and ''[[Bairaag]]'' were failures at the box office.

He led a group of film personalities who stood up against the [[The Emergency (India)|Internal Emergency]] imposed by the then [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Indira Gandhi]]. He actively campaigned against her with his supporters in Indian parliamentary elections in 1977. He also formed a party called the \"'''National Party of India'''\", which he later disbanded.\n\n===Later career and Evergreen Hero Image===\nThe 1978 hit ''[[Des Pardes (1978 film)|Des Pardes]]'', directed by Dev Anand was the debut movie of actress [[Tina Munim]] and this film's success gave him the tag of the Evergreen Hero. Dev Anand was offered the lead role in ''[[Man Pasand]]'' by director Basu Chatterjee. Dev Anand's successful run at the box office continued in the 1980s with ''[[Man Pasand]]'', ''[[Lootmaar]]'' (both opposite Tina Munim) and ''[[Swami Dada]]'' (1982), all being critically acclaimed and box office hits.\n\nThough Dev Anand's demand as the lead hero had not decreased even in the 1980s, he decided that it was the right time to introduce his son [[Suneil Anand]] in films as the hero. He launched his son in the ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]''-inspired ''[[Anand Aur Anand]]'' (1984), which was produced and directed by Dev Anand himself and had music by [[R.D. Burman]]. He expected the film to do well, but the film was a box office disaster and [[Suneil Anand]] decided not to act in films any more.\n\nBut films with Dev Anand as the lead hero in ''[[Hum Naujawan]]'' (1985) and ''[[Lashkar (film)|Lashkar]]'' (1989) continued to be box office successes and were appreciated by critics.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-05/news-interviews/30477058_1_dev-anand-navketan-hum-dono | work=The Times of India | title=Dev Anand: Not just a star, he created stars too | date=5 December 2011 | access-date=30 June 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927113322/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-05/news-interviews/30477058_1_dev-anand-navketan-hum-dono | archive-date=27 September 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Awwal Number]]'' (1990), where Dev Anand co-starred with [[Aditya Pancholi]] and [[Aamir Khan]] became an average grosser in the year 1990.

''Lashkar'' was his last hit film in the lead role in 1989, with him neither being producer nor director of the film.\n\nHe directed Pyar Ka Tarana in 1993, without casting himself in any role.

His films  ''[[Sau Crore]]'' (1991) and ''[[Censor (film)|Censor]]'' (2000) were critically acclaimed.\n\nHis performance and direction in the 1991 film [[Sau Crore]]  was appreciated as it was a movie ahead of its time dealing with real life murder of badminton star Syed Modi and the arrest being made of the wife and her ex lover.[[Sau Crore]] remains the last commercial hit film of Dev Anand.

The second time they met was in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, he visited him on the set of ''Roman Holiday''. \"I was returning from the Venice film fest.

Though Anand says jealousy was natural for anyone in love, he didn't mind that he was not invited. \"I didn't quite feel anything. It wasn't as if they were going to fall in love or make love. Even if they would have, it wouldn't have mattered. I was mature enough. Moreover, he wasn't my rival. I too was a big star by then,\" says Anand.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Critical appraisal===\n[[File:Dev Anand still14.jpg|thumb|Anand at the MAMI Festival]]\nDev Anand has directed 19 films and produced 35 films.
