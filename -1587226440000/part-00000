The [[IBM System/370]] could be considered the first simple 128-bit computer, as it used 128-bit [[floating-point]] registers. Most modern CPUs feature [[Single instruction, multiple data|single-instruction multiple-data]] (SIMD) instruction sets ([[Streaming SIMD Extensions]], [[AltiVec]] etc.) where 128-bit vector registers are used to store several smaller numbers, such as four 32-bit floating-point numbers. A single instruction can then operate on all these values in parallel. However, these processors do not operate on individual numbers that are 128 binary digits in length; only their [[Processor register|registers]] have the size of 128&nbsp;bits.\n\nThe DEC [[VAX]] supported operations on 128-bit integer ('O' or octaword) and 128-bit floating-point ('H-float' or HFLOAT) datatypes. Support for such operations was an upgrade option rather than being a standard feature. Since the VAX's registers were 32&nbsp;bits wide, a 128-bit operation used four consecutive registers or four longwords in memory.\n\nThe [[ICL 2900 Series]] provided a 128-bit accumulator, and its instruction set included 128-bit floating-point and [[packed decimal]] arithmetic.\n\nIn the same way that compilers emulate e.g. 64-bit integer arithmetic on architectures with register sizes less than 64 bits, some compilers also support 128-bit integer arithmetic. For example, the [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC C compiler]] 4.6 and later has a 128-bit integer type <code>__int128</code> for some architectures.<ref>{{cite web|title=GCC 4.6 Release Series - Changes, New Features, and Fixes|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.6/changes.html|access-date=25 July 2016}}</ref> GCC and compatible compilers signal the presence of 128-bit arithmetic when the macro <tt>__SIZEOF_INT128__</tt> is defined.<ref>{{cite web | title = 128-bit integer - nonsensical documentation? | author = Marc Glisse | date = August 26, 2015 | publisher = GCC-Help |url = https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2015-08/msg00185.html | access-date = January 23, 2020 }}</ref> For the [[C programming language]], 128-bit support is optional, e.g. via the <code>int128_t</code> type, or it can be implemented by a compiler-specific extension.\n\nA 128-bit register can store 2<sup>128</sup> (over 3.40 \u00d7 10<sup>38</sup>) different values.
