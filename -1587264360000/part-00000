Its present campus, located at 4445 [[Old Court Road]], includes an elementary school building, middle and high school building, two gymnasiums, a dormitory, a computer lab, and two study halls which double as prayer sanctuaries. They have recently completed a twenty-two million dollar campus expansion which included an Early Childhood Center, and a new high school building (which will include a gym, class rooms and [[Beis Medrash|beis medrash]]).<ref>http://talmudicalacademy.org/campus-expansion/expanding_horizons/</ref>\n\n==History==\nT.A. was founded in 1917 Baltimore Parochial Hebrew School by Rav Avraham Nachman Schwartz \u05d6\u05e6\"\u05dc.<ref>http://personal.stevens.edu/~llevine/abraham_n_schwartz.pdf</ref>\nThe first enrolled student was Rabbi Dr. Zalman Naftali Skaist \u05d6\u05e6\"\u05dc,(born in 1911) himself to become a noted pioneer in [[American Jews|American]] [[American Jews|Jewish]] education. Talmudical Academy was located on Cottage Avenue until a fire caused by one of the custodians destroyed the building.<ref>http://jewishtimes.com/58704/58704/news/</ref> The [[Yeshiva]] then moved to its present location on Old Court.\n\n==Staff and curriculum==\n\nFormer Rebbeim of note include:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wherewhatwhen.com/read_articles.asp?id=338 |title=Recollections and Reflections |publisher=Wherewhatwhen.com |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109050538/http://www.wherewhatwhen.com/read_articles.asp?id=338 |archivedate=November 9, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n*Rabbi Bobrofsky [[\u05d6\u05e6\"\u05dc]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wherewhatwhen.com/read_articles.asp?id=607 |title=A Conversation with Dr. Ronald and Mrs. Ruth Friedman |publisher=Wherewhatwhen.com |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021161540/http://www.wherewhatwhen.com/read_articles.asp?id=607 |archivedate=October 21, 2009 }}</ref> the principal student of Harav Hagoan R' [[Baruch Ber Leibowitz]] Zt\"l, who gave the highest [[shiur]] in the High School for many years.\n*Rabbi [[Boruch Milikowsky]] [[\u05d6\u05e6\"\u05dc]], who learned in the famed [[Mir yeshiva (Belarus)|Mir Yeshiva]] in Mir/Shanghai in his younger years and served as the [[mashgiach]] for many years.

The High School curriculum includes Algebra (1&2), Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Environmental Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, World History, American History, English, and Jewish History (1&2). [[Advanced Placement]] courses that TA has offered in the past include Physics, American History, European History, and English Literature. Seniors may optionally take college courses for English 101 and Psychology 101 provided by [[Baltimore City Community College|Baltimore City Community Community College (BCCC)]]\n\n====Religious====\nTalmud study begins in 5th grade at an introductory level. Talmudic study in earnest begins in 8th grade with its division into Bekius and Iyyun. Tractates that are studied with the Bekius method include [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)]], [[Sotah]], [[Ta'anit (Talmud)]], [[Megillah (Talmud)]] and others. Shorter Tractates are usually chosen. Unlike many other [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]]-Style Yeshivas, TA does not have a set cycle of Tractates that it studies, rather every year the new Tractate is selected in a Faculty meeting. [[Mishna]] is studied until 5th grade. The learning of [[Tanach]] is encouraged by most Rabbis on the Faculty, though it is not a primary subject. Most set aside time in the morning for the study of [[Halacha]]. This is generally, however, a mere formality.\n\n==Beis Medrash==\nUntil 1998, a Bais Medrash-level [[shiur]] was given by Rabbi [[Yosef Rottenberg]]. When he became too ill to continue giving the shiur, the Bais Medrash was discontinued. At the end of 2004, HaRav [[Yisrael Asia]] was brought in to lead the Beis Medrash, which he did for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 school years. During the 2005/06 year, Rav [[Avrohom Notis]] also gave shiur to the Beis Medrash. In 2006\u201307, the Bais Medrash was resurrected yet again by Rabbi [[Bentzion Mellman]] and Rabbi [[Dovid Hoffman]]. Rabbi Mellman acted as [[Rosh Beis Medrash]] and Instructor of Iyyun (a slower, more in-depth Talmudic analysis) and Rabbi Hoffman as the \"Sho'el u-Maishiv\" (study-hall mentor) and Instructor of B'kius (a faster, less in-depth method of Talmudic study).

The High School curriculum includes Algebra (1&2), Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Environmental Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, World History, American History, English, and Jewish History (1&2). [[Advanced Placement]] courses that TA has offered in the past include Physics, American History, European History, and English Literature. Seniors may optionally take college courses for English 101 and Psychology 101 provided by [[Baltimore City Community College|Baltimore City Community Community College (BCCC)]]\n\n====Religious====\nTalmud study begins in 5th grade at an introductory level. Talmudic study in earnest begins in 8th grade with its division into Bekius and Iyyun. Tractates that are studied with the Bekius method include [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)]], [[Sotah]], [[Ta'anit (Talmud)]], [[Megillah (Talmud)]] and others. Shorter Tractates are usually chosen. Unlike many other [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]]-Style Yeshivas, TA does not have a set cycle of Tractates that it studies, rather every year the new Tractate is selected in a Faculty meeting. [[Mishna]] is studied until 5th grade. The learning of [[Tanach]] is encouraged by most Rabbis on the Faculty, though it is not a primary subject. Most set aside time in the morning for the study of [[Halacha]]. This is generally, however, a mere formality.\n\n==Beis Medrash==\nUntil 1998, a Bais Medrash-level [[shiur]] was given by Rabbi [[Yosef Rottenberg]]. When he became too ill to continue giving the shiur, the Bais Medrash was discontinued. At the end of 2004, HaRav [[Yisrael Asia]] was brought in to lead the Beis Medrash, which he did for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 school years. During the 2005/06 year, Rav [[Avrohom Notis]] also gave shiur to the Beis Medrash. In 2006\u201307, the Bais Medrash was resurrected yet again by Rabbi [[Bentzion Mellman]] and Rabbi [[Dovid Hoffman]]. Rabbi Mellman acted as [[Rosh Beis Medrash]] and Instructor of Iyyun (a slower, more in-depth Talmudic analysis) and Rabbi Hoffman as the \"Sho'el u-Maishiv\" (study-hall mentor) and Instructor of B'kius (a faster, less in-depth method of Talmudic study). The inaugural Class consisted of seven members; however three more students joined the Program in the middle of the year. The program continued through the 2008\u201309 year, but has been discontinued for the time being.\n\n==Extra-curricular activities==\nT.A. used to have a varsity basketball team.

After experiencing a period of [[Conversion to Christianity|Christian conversion]] Newton eventually renounced his trade and became a prominent supporter of [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionism]], living to see the UK's abolition of the African slave trade in 1807, just before his death.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Newton was born in [[Wapping]], London, in 1725, the son of John Newton Sr., a [[skipper (boating)|shipmaster]] in the [[Mediterranean]] service, and Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Scatliff). Elizabeth was the only daughter of Simon Scatliff, an instrument maker from London (the marriage register records her maiden name as Seatcliffe). Elizabeth was brought up as a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]].{{sfn| Aitken |2007|loc=Sources and Biographical Notes}} She died of [[tuberculosis]] (then called consumption) in July 1732, about two weeks before John's seventh birthday.{{sfn|Aitken|2007| pp = 29\u201330}} Newton spent two years at boarding school before going to live in [[Aveley]] in [[Essex]], the home of his father's new wife.{{sfn |Lewis|1976|p= 51}}\n\nAt age eleven he first went to sea with his father. Newton sailed six voyages before his father retired in 1742. At that time, Newton's father made plans for him to work at a [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]] in Jamaica. Instead, Newton signed on with a merchant ship sailing to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].\n\n===Impressment into naval service===\nIn 1743, while going to visit friends, Newton was captured and [[Impressment|pressed]] into the naval service by the [[Royal Navy]]. He became a [[midshipman]] aboard [[HMS Harwich (1743)|HMS ''Harwich'']]. At one point Newton tried to desert and was punished in front of a crew of 350. Stripped to the waist and tied to the grating, he received a [[flogging]] of eight dozen lashes and was reduced to the rank of a common [[Seaman (rank)|seaman]].{{sfn |Dunn|1994|p= 7}}\n\nFollowing that disgrace and humiliation, Newton initially contemplated murdering the captain and committing suicide by throwing himself overboard.{{sfn|Dunn|1994 | p =8}}  He recovered, both physically and mentally. Later, while ''Harwich'' was en route to India, he transferred to ''Pegasus'', a [[slave ship]] bound for [[West Africa]]. The ship carried goods to Africa and traded them for slaves to be shipped to the colonies in the Caribbean and North America.\n\n===Enslavement and rescue===\nNewton did not get along with the crew of ''Pegasus''. In 1745{{sfn|Bennett|1894}} they left him in West Africa with Amos Clowe, a slave dealer. Clowe took Newton to the coast and gave him to his wife, Princess Peye of the [[Sherbro people]]. She abused and mistreated Newton just as much as she did her other slaves. Newton later recounted this period as the time he was \"once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in West Africa.\"<ref>Memorial epitaph, St Mary Woolnoth Church, Lombard Street, London.</ref>\n\nEarly in 1748 he was rescued by a sea captain who had been asked by Newton's father to search for him, and returned to England on the merchant ship ''Greyhound'', which was carrying [[beeswax]] and dyer's wood, now referred to as [[camwood]].{{sfn|Tackett|2017}}\n\n==Spiritual conversion==\nDuring his 1748 voyage to England after his rescue, Newton had a spiritual conversion. The ship encountered a severe storm off the coast of [[Donegal (town)|Donegal]], Ireland and almost sank.\n\nHe began to read the [[Bible]] and other religious literature. By the time he reached Britain, he had accepted the doctrines of [[evangelical Christianity]]. The date was 10 March 1748,{{sfn|Morgan|p=79}} an anniversary he marked for the rest of his life. From that point on, he avoided profanity, gambling and drinking. Although he continued to work in the slave trade, he had gained sympathy for the slaves during his time in Africa. He later said that his true conversion did not happen until some time later: \"I cannot consider myself to have been a believer in the full sense of the word, until a considerable time afterwards.\"{{sfn|Newton|2003|p=84}}\n\n== Slave trading ==\nNewton returned in 1748 to [[Liverpool]], a major port for the [[Triangle Trade]]. Partly due to the influence of his father's friend Joseph Manesty, he obtained a position as [[first mate]] aboard the slave ship ''Brownlow,'' bound for the [[West Indies]] via the coast of Guinea.\n\nNewton continued to work in the slave trade. After his return to England in 1750, he made three voyages as captain of the slave ships ''Duke of Argyle'' (1750) and ''African'' (1752\u201353 and 1753\u201354). After suffering a severe stroke in 1754, he gave up seafaring and slave-trading activities, but continued to invest in Manesty's slaving operations.{{sfn|Hochschild|2005 | p = 77}}\n\nIn 1780 Newton moved to the City of London as rector of [[St Mary Woolnoth|St Mary Woolnoth Church]], where he contributed to the work of the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade|Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]], formed in 1787. During this time he wrote ''Thoughts Upon the African Slave Trade''. In it he states; \"So much light has been thrown upon the subject, by many able pens; and so many respectable persons have already engaged to use their utmost influence, for the suppression of a traffic, which contradicts the feelings of humanity; that it is hoped, this stain of our National character will soon be wiped out.\" <ref name=\"Newton1788\">{{cite book |last1=Newton |first1=John |title=Thoughts Upon the African Slave Trade |date=1788 |publisher=Rector of St. Mary Woolnoth for J.

In his spare time, he studied Greek, [[Hebrew]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]], preparing for serious religious study. He became well known as an evangelical lay minister. In 1757, he applied to be [[ordination|ordained]] as a priest in the [[Church of England]], but it was more than seven years before he was eventually accepted.\n\nDuring this period, he also applied to the [[Methodist]]s, [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] and [[Presbyterians]]. He mailed applications directly to the [[Bishop of Chester|Bishops of Chester]] and [[Bishop of Lincoln|Lincoln]] and the Archbishops of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]].\n\nEventually, in 1764, he was introduced by [[Thomas Haweis]] to [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]], who was influential in recommending Newton to [[William Markham (bishop)|William Markham]], Bishop of Chester. Haweis suggested Newton for the living of [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. On 29 April 1764 Newton received deacon's orders, and finally was ordained as a priest on 17 June.\n\nAs curate of Olney, Newton was partly sponsored by [[John Thornton (philanthropist)|John Thornton]], a wealthy merchant and evangelical philanthropist. He supplemented Newton's stipend of \u00a360 a year with \u00a3200 a year \"for hospitality and to help the poor\". Newton soon became well known for his pastoral care, as much as for his beliefs. His friendship with [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] and evangelical clergy led to his being respected by Anglicans and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]] alike. He spent sixteen years at Olney. His preaching was so popular that the congregation added a gallery to the church to accommodate the many persons who flocked to hear him.\n\nSome five years later, in 1772, [[Thomas Scott (commentator)|Thomas Scott]] took up the curacy of the neighbouring parishes of [[Stoke Goldington]] and [[Weston Underwood, Milton Keynes|Weston Underwood]]. Newton was instrumental in converting Scott from a cynical \u2018career priest\u2019 to a true believer, a conversion which Scott related in his spiritual autobiography ''The Force Of Truth'' (1779). Later Scott became a biblical commentator and co-founder of the [[Church Missionary Society]].\n\nIn 1779 Newton was invited by John Thornton to become Rector of [[St Mary Woolnoth]], [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]], London, where he officiated until his death. The church had been built by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] in 1727 in the fashionable [[Baroque style]]. Newton was one of only two evangelical Anglican priests in the capital, and he soon found himself gaining in popularity amongst the growing evangelical party. He was a strong supporter of evangelicalism in the Church of England. He remained a friend of Dissenters (such as Methodists and Baptists) as well as Anglicans.\n\nYoung churchmen and people struggling with faith sought his advice, including such well-known social figures as the writer and philanthropist [[Hannah More]], and the young [[William Wilberforce]], a Member of Parliament who had recently suffered a crisis of conscience and religious conversion while contemplating leaving politics. The younger man consulted with Newton, who encouraged Wilberforce to stay in Parliament and \"serve God where he was\".{{sfn|Pollock|1977|p=38}}{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=383}}\n\nIn 1792, Newton was presented with the degree of [[Doctor of Divinity]] by the [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]] (now Princeton University).\n\n==Abolitionist==\n[[File:Newton j.jpg|thumb|Newton in 1807]]\nIn 1788, 34 years after he had retired from the slave trade, Newton broke a long silence on the subject with the publication of a forceful pamphlet ''Thoughts Upon the Slave Trade'', in which he described the horrific conditions of the slave ships during the [[Middle Passage]]. He apologised for \"a confession, which&nbsp;... comes too late&nbsp;... It will always be a subject of humiliating reflection to me, that I was once an active instrument in a business at which my heart now shudders.\"  He had copies sent to every MP, and the pamphlet sold so well that it swiftly required reprinting.{{sfn|Hochschild|2005|pp=130\u2013132}}\n\nNewton became an ally of [[William Wilberforce]], leader of the Parliamentary campaign to abolish the African slave trade. He lived to see the British passage of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which enacted this event.\n\n\nNewton came to believe that during the first five of his nine years as a slave trader he had not been a Christian in the full sense of the term. In 1763 he wrote: \"I was greatly deficient in many respects&nbsp;... I cannot consider myself to have been a believer in the full sense of the word, until a considerable time afterwards.\"{{sfn|Newton|2003|p=84}}\n\n==Writer and hymnist==\n[[File:Olney vicarage.jpg|thumb|250 px|left|The vicarage in [[Olney, Buckinghamshire]] where Newton wrote the hymn that would become \"[[Amazing Grace]]\".]]\nIn 1767 [[William Cowper]], the poet, moved to Olney. He worshipped in Newton's church, and collaborated with the priest on a volume of hymns; it was published as ''[[Olney Hymns]]'' in 1779. This work had a great influence on English hymnology. The volume included Newton's well-known hymns: \"[[Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken]],\" \"How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds!,\"<ref>[http://lutherantacoma.com/hymns/364.mp3 How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds] (mp3 with organ only) and [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/etext/hymnals/tlh/sound.txt How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds] (text)</ref> \"Let Us Love, and Sing, and Wonder,\" \"Come, My Soul, Thy Suit Prepare,\"<ref>[http://lutherantacoma.com/hymns/459.mp3 Come, My Soul, Thy Suit Prepare] (mp3 with organ only) and [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/etext/hymnals/tlh/suit.txt Come, My Soul, Thy Suit Prepare] (text)</ref> \"Approach, My Soul, the Mercy-seat\",<ref>[http://lutherantacoma.com/hymns/456.mp3 Approach, My Soul, the Mercy-seat] (mp3 with organ only) and [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/etext/hymnals/tlh/mercy_seat.txt Approach, My Soul, the Mercy-seat] (text)</ref> and \"Faith's Review and Expectation,\" which has come to be known by its opening phrase, \"[[Amazing Grace]]\".\n\n[[File:JohnNewtonStMaryWoolnoth.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial plaque to Newton and his wife at [[St Mary Woolnoth]] in the [[City of London]]]]\nMany of Newton's (as well as Cowper's) hymns are preserved in the ''[[Sacred Harp]],'' a hymnal used in the American South during the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Hymns were scored according to the tonal scale for [[shape note singing]]. Easily learnt and incorporating singers into four-part harmony, shape note music was widely used by evangelical preachers to reach new congregants.\n\nIn 1776 Newton contributed a preface to an annotated version of [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''.{{sfn|Newton|2018}}\n\nNewton also contributed to the [[Cheap Repository Tracts]]. He wrote an autobiography entitled\n''An Authentic Narrative of Some Remarkable And Interesting Particulars in the Life of ------ Communicated, in a Series of Letters, to the Reverend T. Haweiss,'' which he published anonymously. It was later described as \"written in an easy style, distinguished by great natural shrewdness, and sanctified by the Lord God and prayer\".{{sfn|Thomson|1884|loc=preface}}\n\n==Final years==\nNewton's wife Mary Catlett died in 1790, after which he published ''Letters to a Wife'' (1793), in which he expressed his grief.{{sfn|Newton|1793}}  Plagued by ill health and failing eyesight, Newton died on 21 December 1807 in London.

The film portrays Newton as a penitent haunted by the ghosts of 20,000 slaves.\n* The Nigerian film ''[[The Amazing Grace]]'' (2006), the creation of Nigerian director/writer/producer Jeta Amata, provides an African perspective on the slave trade. Nigerian actors [[Joke Silva]], Mbong Odungide, and [[Fred Amata]] (brother of the director) portray Africans who are captured and taken away from their homeland by slave traders. Newton is played by [[Nick Moran]].\n* The 2014 film ''[[Freedom (2014 film)|Freedom]]'' tells the story of an American slave (Samuel Woodward, played by [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]]) escaping to freedom via the [[Underground Railroad]]. A parallel earlier story depicts John Newton (played by Bernhard Forcher) as the captain of a slave ship bound for America carrying Samuel's grandfather. Newton's conversion is explored as well.\n\n===Stage productions===\n*''African Snow'' (2007), a play by Murray Watts, takes place in the mind of John Newton. It was first produced at the [[York Theatre Royal]] as a co-production with [[Riding Lights Theatre Company]], transferring to the [[Trafalgar Studios]] in London's West End and a National Tour.

In 1745 he became a slave of Princess Peye, a black princess of the [[Sherbro people]] and then, years after, he became the captain of [[slave ship]]s. He later became ordained as an evangelical Anglican cleric, serving [[Olney, Buckinghamshire]] for two decades, and also wrote hymns, including \"[[Amazing Grace]]\" and \"[[Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken]]\".\n\nNewton started his career at sea at a young age, and worked on slave ships in the [[slave trade]] for several years. After experiencing a period of [[Conversion to Christianity|Christian conversion]] Newton eventually renounced his trade and became a prominent supporter of [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionism]], living to see the UK's abolition of the African slave trade in 1807, just before his death.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Newton was born in [[Wapping]], London, in 1725, the son of John Newton Sr., a [[skipper (boating)|shipmaster]] in the [[Mediterranean]] service, and Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Scatliff). Elizabeth was the only daughter of Simon Scatliff, an instrument maker from London (the marriage register records her maiden name as Seatcliffe). Elizabeth was brought up as a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]].{{sfn| Aitken |2007|loc=Sources and Biographical Notes}} She died of [[tuberculosis]] (then called consumption) in July 1732, about two weeks before John's seventh birthday.{{sfn|Aitken|2007| pp = 29\u201330}} Newton spent two years at boarding school before going to live in [[Aveley]] in [[Essex]], the home of his father's new wife.{{sfn |Lewis|1976|p= 51}}\n\nAt age eleven he first went to sea with his father. Newton sailed six voyages before his father retired in 1742. At that time, Newton's father made plans for him to work at a [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]] in Jamaica. Instead, Newton signed on with a merchant ship sailing to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].\n\n===Impressment into naval service===\nIn 1743, while going to visit friends, Newton was captured and [[Impressment|pressed]] into the naval service by the [[Royal Navy]]. He became a [[midshipman]] aboard [[HMS Harwich (1743)|HMS ''Harwich'']]. At one point Newton tried to desert and was punished in front of the crew of 350. Stripped to the waist and tied to the grating, he received a [[flogging]] of eight dozen lashes and was reduced to the rank of a common [[Seaman (rank)|seaman]].{{sfn |Dunn|1994|p= 7}}\n\nFollowing that disgrace and humiliation, Newton initially contemplated murdering the captain and committing suicide by throwing himself overboard.{{sfn|Dunn|1994 | p =8}}  He recovered, both physically and mentally. Later, while ''Harwich'' was en route to India, he transferred to ''Pegasus'', a [[slave ship]] bound for [[West Africa]]. The ship carried goods to Africa and traded them for slaves to be shipped to the colonies in the Caribbean and North America.\n\n===Enslavement and rescue===\nNewton did not get along with the crew of ''Pegasus''. In 1745{{sfn|Bennett|1894}} they left him in West Africa with Amos Clowe, a slave dealer. Clowe took Newton to the coast and gave him to his wife, Princess Peye of the [[Sherbro people]]. She abused and mistreated Newton just as much as she did her other slaves. Newton later recounted this period as the time he was \"once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in West Africa.\"<ref>Memorial epitaph, St Mary Woolnoth Church, Lombard Street, London.</ref>\n\nEarly in 1748 he was rescued by a sea captain who had been asked by Newton's father to search for him, and returned to England on the merchant ship ''Greyhound'', which was carrying [[beeswax]] and dyer's wood, now referred to as [[camwood]].{{sfn|Tackett|2017}}\n\n==Spiritual conversion==\nDuring his 1748 voyage to England after his rescue, Newton had a spiritual conversion. The ship encountered a severe storm off the coast of [[Donegal (town)|Donegal]], Ireland and almost sank.\n\nHe began to read the [[Bible]] and other religious literature. By the time he reached Britain, he had accepted the doctrines of [[evangelical Christianity]]. The date was 10 March 1748,{{sfn|Morgan|p=79}} an anniversary he marked for the rest of his life. From that point on, he avoided profanity, gambling and drinking. Although he continued to work in the slave trade, he had gained sympathy for the slaves during his time in Africa. He later said that his true conversion did not happen until some time later: \"I cannot consider myself to have been a believer in the full sense of the word, until a considerable time afterwards.\"{{sfn|Newton|2003|p=84}}\n\n== Slave trading ==\nNewton returned in 1748 to [[Liverpool]], a major port for the [[Triangle Trade]]. Partly due to the influence of his father's friend Joseph Manesty, he obtained a position as [[first mate]] aboard the slave ship ''Brownlow,'' bound for the [[West Indies]] via the coast of Guinea.\n\nIt was when returning to England aboard the ship ''Greyhound'' in 1748, [he] awoke to find the ship caught in a violent storm and about to sink. He prayed for God's mercy, the storm died down. After four more weeks at sea the ''Greyhound'' made it to port in Lough Swilly, Ireland. This experience marked the beginning of his conversion to Christianity.<ref>{{cite web |title=John Newton (1725 \u2013 1807) |url=https://www.cowperandnewtonmuseum.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/thoughtsuponafri00newt.pdf |website=Cowper and Newton Museum |publisher=Cowper and Newton Museum |accessdate=24 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nNewton continued to work in the slave trade. After his return to England in 1750, he made three voyages as captain of the slave ships ''Duke of Argyle'' (1750) and ''African'' (1752\u201353 and 1753\u201354). After suffering a severe stroke in 1754, he gave up seafaring and slave-trading activities, but continued to invest in Manesty's slaving operations.{{sfn|Hochschild|2005 | p = 77}}\n\nIn 1780 Newton moved to the City of London as rector of [[St Mary Woolnoth|St Mary Woolnoth Church]], where he contributed to the work of the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade|Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]], formed in 1787. During this time he wrote ''Thoughts Upon the African Slave Trade''. In it he states; \"So much light has been thrown upon the subject, by many able pens; and so many respectable persons have already engaged to use their utmost influence, for the suppression of a traffic, which contradicts the feelings of humanity; that it is hoped, this stain of our National character will soon be wiped out.\" <ref name=\"Newton1788\">{{cite book |last1=Newton |first1=John |title=Thoughts Upon the African Slave Trade |date=1788 |publisher=Rector of St. Mary Woolnoth for J.

In his spare time, he studied Greek, [[Hebrew]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]], preparing for serious religious study. He became well known as an evangelical lay minister. In 1757, he applied to be [[ordination|ordained]] as a priest in the [[Church of England]], but it was more than seven years before he was eventually accepted.\n\nDuring this period, he also applied to the [[Methodist]]s, [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] and [[Presbyterians]]. He mailed applications directly to the [[Bishop of Chester|Bishops of Chester]] and [[Bishop of Lincoln|Lincoln]] and the Archbishops of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]].\n\nEventually, in 1764, he was introduced by [[Thomas Haweis]] to [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]], who was influential in recommending Newton to [[William Markham (bishop)|William Markham]], Bishop of Chester. Haweis suggested Newton for the living of [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. On 29 April 1764 Newton received deacon's orders, and finally was ordained as a priest on 17 June.\n\nAs curate of Olney, Newton was partly sponsored by [[John Thornton (philanthropist)|John Thornton]], a wealthy merchant and evangelical philanthropist. He supplemented Newton's stipend of \u00a360 a year with \u00a3200 a year \"for hospitality and to help the poor\". Newton soon became well known for his pastoral care, as much as for his beliefs. His friendship with [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] and evangelical clergy led to his being respected by Anglicans and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]] alike. He spent sixteen years at Olney. His preaching was so popular that the congregation added a gallery to the church to accommodate the many persons who flocked to hear him.\n\nSome five years later, in 1772, [[Thomas Scott (commentator)|Thomas Scott]] took up the curacy of the neighbouring parishes of [[Stoke Goldington]] and [[Weston Underwood, Milton Keynes|Weston Underwood]]. Newton was instrumental in converting Scott from a cynical \u2018career priest\u2019 to a true believer, a conversion which Scott related in his spiritual autobiography ''The Force Of Truth'' (1779). Later Scott became a biblical commentator and co-founder of the [[Church Missionary Society]].\n\nIn 1779 Newton was invited by John Thornton to become Rector of [[St Mary Woolnoth]], [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]], London, where he officiated until his death. The church had been built by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] in 1727 in the fashionable [[Baroque style]]. Newton was one of only two evangelical Anglican priests in the capital, and he soon found himself gaining in popularity amongst the growing evangelical party. He was a strong supporter of evangelicalism in the Church of England. He remained a friend of Dissenters (such as Methodists and Baptists) as well as Anglicans.\n\nYoung churchmen and people struggling with faith sought his advice, including such well-known social figures as the writer and philanthropist [[Hannah More]], and the young [[William Wilberforce]], a Member of Parliament who had recently suffered a crisis of conscience and religious conversion while contemplating leaving politics. The younger man consulted with Newton, who encouraged Wilberforce to stay in Parliament and \"serve God where he was\".{{sfn|Pollock|1977|p=38}}{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=383}}\n\nIn 1792, Newton was presented with the degree of [[Doctor of Divinity]] by the [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]] (now Princeton University).\n\n==Abolitionist==\n[[File:Newton j.jpg|thumb|Newton in 1807]]\nIn 1788, 34 years after he had retired from the slave trade, Newton broke a long silence on the subject with the publication of a forceful pamphlet ''Thoughts Upon the Slave Trade'', in which he described the horrific conditions of the slave ships during the [[Middle Passage]]. He apologised for \"a confession, which&nbsp;... comes too late&nbsp;... It will always be a subject of humiliating reflection to me, that I was once an active instrument in a business at which my heart now shudders.\"  He had copies sent to every MP, and the pamphlet sold so well that it swiftly required reprinting.{{sfn|Hochschild|2005|pp=130\u2013132}}\n\nNewton became an ally of [[William Wilberforce]], leader of the Parliamentary campaign to abolish the African slave trade. He lived to see the British passage of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which enacted this event.\n\n\nNewton came to believe that during the first five of his nine years as a slave trader he had not been a Christian in the full sense of the term. In 1763 he wrote: \"I was greatly deficient in many respects&nbsp;... I cannot consider myself to have been a believer in the full sense of the word, until a considerable time afterwards.\"{{sfn|Newton|2003|p=84}}\n\n==Writer and hymnist==\n[[File:Olney vicarage.jpg|thumb|250 px|left|The vicarage in [[Olney, Buckinghamshire]] where Newton wrote the hymn that would become \"[[Amazing Grace]]\".]]\nIn 1767 [[William Cowper]], the poet, moved to Olney. He worshipped in Newton's church, and collaborated with the priest on a volume of hymns; it was published as ''[[Olney Hymns]]'' in 1779. This work had a great influence on English hymnology. The volume included Newton's well-known hymns: \"[[Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken]],\" \"How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds!,\"<ref>[http://lutherantacoma.com/hymns/364.mp3 How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds] (mp3 with organ only) and [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/etext/hymnals/tlh/sound.txt How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds] (text)</ref> \"Let Us Love, and Sing, and Wonder,\" \"Come, My Soul, Thy Suit Prepare,\"<ref>[http://lutherantacoma.com/hymns/459.mp3 Come, My Soul, Thy Suit Prepare] (mp3 with organ only) and [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/etext/hymnals/tlh/suit.txt Come, My Soul, Thy Suit Prepare] (text)</ref> \"Approach, My Soul, the Mercy-seat\",<ref>[http://lutherantacoma.com/hymns/456.mp3 Approach, My Soul, the Mercy-seat] (mp3 with organ only) and [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/etext/hymnals/tlh/mercy_seat.txt Approach, My Soul, the Mercy-seat] (text)</ref> and \"Faith's Review and Expectation,\" which has come to be known by its opening phrase, \"[[Amazing Grace]]\".\n\n[[File:JohnNewtonStMaryWoolnoth.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial plaque to Newton and his wife at [[St Mary Woolnoth]] in the [[City of London]]]]\nMany of Newton's (as well as Cowper's) hymns are preserved in the ''[[Sacred Harp]],'' a hymnal used in the American South during the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Hymns were scored according to the tonal scale for [[shape note singing]]. Easily learnt and incorporating singers into four-part harmony, shape note music was widely used by evangelical preachers to reach new congregants.\n\nIn 1776 Newton contributed a preface to an annotated version of [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''.{{sfn|Newton|2018}}\n\nNewton also contributed to the [[Cheap Repository Tracts]]. He wrote an autobiography entitled\n''An Authentic Narrative of Some Remarkable And Interesting Particulars in the Life of ------ Communicated, in a Series of Letters, to the Reverend T. Haweiss,'' which he published anonymously. It was later described as \"written in an easy style, distinguished by great natural shrewdness, and sanctified by the Lord God and prayer\".{{sfn|Thomson|1884|loc=preface}}\n\n==Final years==\nNewton's wife Mary Catlett died in 1790, after which he published ''Letters to a Wife'' (1793), in which he expressed his grief.{{sfn|Newton|1793}}  Plagued by ill health and failing eyesight, Newton died on 21 December 1807 in London. He was buried beside his wife in St. Mary Woolnoth in London.

The film portrays Newton as a penitent haunted by the ghosts of 20,000 slaves.\n* The Nigerian film ''[[The Amazing Grace]]'' (2006), the creation of Nigerian director/writer/producer Jeta Amata, provides an African perspective on the slave trade. Nigerian actors [[Joke Silva]], Mbong Odungide, and [[Fred Amata]] (brother of the director) portray Africans who are captured and taken away from their homeland by slave traders. Newton is played by [[Nick Moran]].\n* The 2014 film ''[[Freedom (2014 film)|Freedom]]'' tells the story of an American slave (Samuel Woodward, played by [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]]) escaping to freedom via the [[Underground Railroad]]. A parallel earlier story depicts John Newton (played by Bernhard Forcher) as the captain of a slave ship bound for America carrying Samuel's grandfather. Newton's conversion is explored as well.\n\n===Stage productions===\n*''African Snow'' (2007), a play by Murray Watts, takes place in the mind of John Newton. It was first produced at the [[York Theatre Royal]] as a co-production with [[Riding Lights Theatre Company]], transferring to the [[Trafalgar Studios]] in London's West End and a National Tour. Newton was played by [[Roger Alborough]] and [[Olaudah Equiano]] by Israel Oyelumade.{{sfn|Hickling|2007}}\n*The musical [[Amazing Grace (musical)|''Amazing Grace'']] is a dramatisation of Newton's life.
