Most of the toys are a variety of foam-based weaponry, with other Nerf products including balls for sports like [[American football]], basketball and baseball. The most notable of the toys are the dart guns (referred to by Hasbro as \"blasters\") that shoot ammunition made from Nerf foam. Since many such items were released during the 1970s, Nerf products often feature bright neon colors and soft textures similar to the flagship Nerf ball. The slogan, which has been frequently used since advertising in the 1990s, is ''\"It's Nerf or Nothin'!\"''.

They cannot be fired from any previous Nerf line or off-brand compatible blasters, nor can any other lines' darts be fired from Ultra blasters.

The blaster is painted in a white, black and orange color scheme with a distinctive raised gold \"ULTRA\" label on the right side (the raised logo is repeated on the left side, but in white, rather than gold). The second blaster was the Ultra ''Two'', which is a 6-round capacity flywheel system revolver, which loads from the back of the blaster, as there is no open place in front.

Since many such items were released during the 1970s, Nerf products often feature bright neon colors and soft textures similar to the flagship Nerf ball.

The official plot explains that, after Earth was hit by a deadly asteroid, life and civilization begins anew, and survivors must fend off raiders and new monstrous creatures.

In Phantom Corps, the series has its own Nerf blasters, but also sports white reshells of some of the original red and blue blasters, which are altered slightly but are still recognizable as the originals.

This construction allows for fins to be molded into the rear of the darts.  Size-wise, Ultra darts are between N-Strike Elite darts and Mega darts in diameter, but shorter than both in length.  They cannot be fired from any previous Nerf line or off-brand compatible blasters, nor can any other lines' darts be fired from Ultra blasters. This design was created in response to the growing number of third-party darts, including exact knockoffs from China, available for N-Strike Elite blasters at a much lower cost than Nerf-brand darts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |title=Parents, Beware: Nerf\u2019s Newest Blasters Won\u2019t Fire Knockoff Darts |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2019-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003131215/https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |archive-date=2019-10-03 |url-status=live }}https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003131215/https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |date=2019-10-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe first blaster in the Ultra line was the Nerf Ultra ''One'', a drum-fed (25-dart capacity), flywheel design with integral (non-detachable) stock and fixed barrel with no N-Strike barrel attachments. It is compatible with rail-mounted Nerf attachments via two tactical rails on top.  The blaster is painted in a white, black and orange color scheme with a distinctive raised gold \"ULTRA\" label on the right side (the raised logo is repeated on the left side, but in white, rather than gold). The second blaster was the Ultra ''Two'', which is a 6-round capacity flywheel system revolver, which loads from the back of the blaster, as there is no open place in front. Like the One, the Two comes in the same white, black and orange color scheme, and the \"ULTRA'\" label on the side. It is also the first electronic revolver-style blaster since the 2012 N-Strike Elite Stockade.\n\n===Nerf N-Force===\nThe N-Force line consisted of foam swords and melee weapons.

Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released on the orders of Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], who referred to Corbett as \"the patriot\" upon dismissing him. He was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.\n\nKnown for his devout religious beliefs and eccentric behavior, Corbett drifted around the United States before disappearing around 1888. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] in September 1894, but that remains impossible to substantiate.\n\n==Early life and education==\nCorbett was born in [[London]] and immigrated with his family to [[New York City]] in 1840. The Corbetts moved frequently before eventually settling in [[Troy, New York]]. As a young man, Corbett began apprenticing as a [[milliner]] (also called a \"hatter\"), a profession that he would hold intermittently throughout his life. As a milliner, Corbett was regularly exposed to the fumes of [[mercury(II) nitrate]], then used in the treatment of [[fur]] to produce [[felt]] used on hats. Excessive exposure to the compound can lead to  [[hallucination]]s, [[psychosis]] and twitching (known as the \"hatter's shakes\").<ref name=\"jameson128\">{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|pp=128}}</ref> Historians have theorized that the mental issues Corbett exhibited before and after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] were caused by this exposure.<ref name = \"walker159\">{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|p=159}}</ref>\n\n===Family and religion===\nAfter working as a milliner in Troy, Corbett returned to New York City.<ref name=\"johnson45\">{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=45}}</ref> He later married, but his wife and child died in childbirth. Following their deaths, he moved to [[Boston]]. Corbett became despondent over the loss of his wife and began drinking heavily. He was unable to hold a job and eventually became homeless.<ref name=\"jameson128\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|p=160}}</ref> After a night of heavy drinking, he was confronted by a street preacher whose message persuaded him to join the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]. Corbett immediately stopped drinking and became devoutly religious. After being [[baptized]], he subsequently changed his name to Boston, the name of the city where he was converted.<ref name=\"Harper's Weekly, May 13, 1865\">Harper's Weekly, May&nbsp;13, 1865</ref> He regularly attended meetings at the Fulton and Bromfield Street churches where his enthusiastic behavior earned him the nickname \"The Glory to God man\".<ref name=\"johnson45\"/> In an attempt to imitate [[Jesus]], Corbett began to wear his hair very long (he was forced to cut it upon enlisting in the [[Union Army]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Kauffman|2004|p=310}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=46}}</ref>\n\nIn 1857, Corbett began working at a hat manufacturer's shop on [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington Street]] in downtown Boston. He was reported to be a proficient milliner, but was known to proselytize frequently and stop work to pray and sing for co-workers who used profanity in his presence. He also began working as a [[street preacher]] and would sermonize and distribute religious literature in [[North Square (Boston, Massachusetts)|North Square]].<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> Corbett soon earned a reputation around Boston for being a \"local eccentric\" and religious fanatic.<ref name=\"jameson128\"/><ref name=\"walker159\"/> On July&nbsp;16, 1858, Corbett was propositioned by two [[prostitution|prostitutes]] while walking home from a church meeting. He was deeply disturbed by the encounter.

Conger thought it a bad idea. Then at least turn me on my side, the assassin pleaded. They did, but Conger saw that the move did not relieve Booth\u2019s suffering. Baker noticed it, too: \"He seemed to suffer extreme pain whenever he was moved...and would several times repeat, \u2018Kill me.\u2019\"<ref>Swanson, p. 139.</ref> At sunrise, Booth remained in agonising pain. His pulse weakening as his breathing became more laboured and irregular. In agony, unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered as he gazed at them, \"Useless ... Useless.\" These were his last words. A few minutes later, Booth began gasping for air as his throat continued to swell, then there was a shiver and a gurgle and his body shuddered, before Booth died from asphyxia - he literally choked to death. He died two hours after Corbett shot him.\n\n[[File:boston corbett.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Boston Corbett]]\n[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Colonel]] [[Everton Conger]] initially thought Booth had shot himself. After realizing Booth had been shot by someone else, Conger and Lt. Doherty asked which officer had shot Booth. Corbett stepped forward and admitted he was the shooter.<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|p=135}}</ref> When asked why he had violated orders, Corbett replied, \"[[Divine providence|Providence]] directed me\".<ref name=\"Swanson340\">{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=340}}</ref> \n\n====Court-martial====\nHe was immediately arrested and was accompanied by Lt. Doherty to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to be court martialed. When questioned by Edwin Stanton about Booth's capture and shooting, both Doherty and Corbett agreed that Corbett had in fact disobeyed orders not to shoot. However, Corbett maintained that he believed Booth had intended to shoot his way out of the barn and that he acted in self-defense. He told Stanton, \"...Booth would have killed me if I had not shot first. I think I did right.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=227}}</ref> Corbett maintained that he didn't intend to kill Booth, but merely wanted to inflict a disabling wound, but either his aim slipped or Booth moved at the moment Corbett pulled the trigger.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=104}}</ref> Stanton paused and then stated, \"The rebel is dead. The patriot lives; he has spared the country expense, continued excitement and trouble. Discharge the patriot.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\"/> Upon leaving the War Department, Corbett was greeted by a cheering crowd. As he made his way to [[Mathew Brady]]'s studio to have his official portrait taken, the crowd followed him asking for autographs and requesting that he tell them about shooting Booth. Corbett told the crowd:\n\n{{quote|I aimed at his body. I did not want to kill him....I think he stooped to pick up something just as I fired. That may probably account for his receiving the ball in the head. [W]hen the assassin lay at my feet, a wounded man, and I saw the [[bullet]] had taken effect about an inch back of the ear, and I remembered that Mr. Lincoln was wounded about the same part of the head, I said: \"What a God we have...God avenged Abraham Lincoln.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|pp=227\u2013228}}</ref>}}\n\n====Contradictions====\nEyewitnesses to Booth's shooting contradicted Corbett's version of events and expressed doubts that Corbett was responsible for shooting Booth. Officers who were near Corbett at the time claimed that they never saw him fire his gun (Corbett's gun was never inspected and was eventually lost). They claimed that Corbett came forward only after Lt. Colonel Conger asked who had shot Booth. Richard Garrett, the owner of the farm on which Booth was found, and his 12-year-old son Robert also contradicted Corbett's testimony that he acted in self-defense. Both maintained that Booth had never reached for his gun.<ref>{{harvnb|Nottingham|1997|p=148}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was some criticism of Corbett's actions, he was largely considered a hero by the public and press. One newspaper editor declared that Corbett would, \"live as one of the World's great avengers.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=228}}</ref> For his part in Booth's capture, Corbett received a portion of the $100,000 reward money, amounting to $1,653.84 ({{Inflation|US|1653.84|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"goodrich291\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=291}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=358}}</ref> His annual salary as a U.S. sergeant was $204 ({{Inflation|US|204|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).

When the hatting business in Boston slowed, Corbett moved to [[Danbury, Connecticut]], to continue his work and also \"preached in the country round about.\" By 1870, he had relocated once again to [[Camden, New Jersey]], where he was known as a \"Methodist lay preacher\". Corbett's inability to hold a job was attributed to his fanatical behavior; he was routinely fired after continuing his habit of stopping work to pray for his co-workers.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19670103&id=BqpVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=J-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7151,566580|title=The Strange Fate Of Boston Corbett|last=Frazier|first=Robert B.|date=January 3, 1967|work=Eugene Register-Guard|page=5|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref> In an effort to earn money, Corbett capitalized on his role as \"Lincoln's Avenger\".<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\"/> He gave lectures about the shooting of Booth accompanied by illustrated [[lantern slide]]s at Sunday schools, women's groups and tent meetings. Corbett was never asked back due to his increasingly erratic behavior and incoherent speeches.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\"/>\n\nR.B. Hoover, a man who later befriended Corbett, recalled that Corbett believed \"men who were high in authority at Washington at the time of the assassination\" were hounding him. Corbett said the men were angry because he had deprived them of prosecuting and executing John Wilkes Booth themselves. He also believed the same men had gotten him fired from various jobs.<ref name=\"sparks\">{{harvnb|Sparks|Everett|Lowell|Lodge|1889|p=382}}</ref> Corbett's paranoia was furthered by [[hate mail]] he received for killing Booth. He became fearful that \"Booth's Avengers\" or organizations like the \"Secret Order\" were planning to seek revenge upon him and took to carrying a pistol with him at all times. As his paranoia increased, Corbett began brandishing his pistol at friends or strangers he deemed suspicious.<ref name=\"goodrich291\"/>\n\nWhile attending the Soldiers' Reunion of the Blue and Gray in [[Caldwell, Ohio]], in 1875, Corbett got into an argument with several men over the death of John Wilkes Booth. The men questioned if Booth had really been killed at all which enraged Corbett. He then drew his pistol on the men but was removed from the reunion before he could fire it.<ref name=\"sparks\"/> In 1878, Corbett moved to [[Concordia, Kansas]], where he acquired a plot of land through [[Homestead principle|homesteading]] upon which he constructed a [[Dugout (shelter)|dugout]] home. He continued working as a preacher and attended [[revival meeting]]s frequently.<ref name=\"johnson51\">{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=51}}</ref>\n\n==Presumed fate==\nDue to his fame as \"Lincoln's Avenger\", Corbett was appointed assistant doorkeeper of the [[Kansas House of Representatives]] in [[Topeka]] in January 1887. On February 15, he became convinced that \nofficers of the House were discriminating against him. He jumped to his feet, brandished a revolver and began chasing the officers out of the building. No one was hurt and Corbett was arrested. The following day, a judge declared Corbett insane and sent him to the [[Topeka State Hospital|Topeka Asylum for the Insane]]. On May 26, 1888, he escaped from the asylum on horseback.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Dale|date=September 2005|title=The Mad Hatter|journal=American Cowboy|volume=12|issue=3|page=82|issn=1079-3690|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-oCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> He then rode to [[Neodesha, Kansas]], where he briefly stayed with Richard Thatcher, a man he had met while they were [[prisoners of war]].

A few years after Corbett was last seen in Neodesha, Kansas, a [[patent medicine]] salesman in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] filed an application using Corbett's name to receive pension benefits. After an investigation proved that the man was not Boston Corbett, he was sent to prison. In September 1905, a man arrested in [[Dallas]] also claimed to be Corbett. He too was proven to be an imposter and was sent to prison for perjury, and then to the [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|Government Hospital for the Insane]].<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|pp=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Memorials===\nIn 1958, Boy Scout Troop 31, of [[Concordia, Kansas]], built a roadside monument to Corbett located on Key Road.

Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released on the orders of Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], who referred to Corbett as \"the patriot\" upon dismissing him. He was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.\n\nKnown for his devout religious beliefs and eccentric behavior, Corbett drifted around the United States before disappearing around 1888. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] in September 1894, but that remains impossible to substantiate.\n\n==Early life and education==\nCorbett was born in [[London]] and immigrated with his family to [[New York City]] in 1840. The Corbetts moved frequently before eventually settling in [[Troy, New York]]. As a young man, Corbett began apprenticing as a [[milliner]] (also called a \"hatter\"), a profession that he would hold intermittently throughout his life. As a milliner, Corbett was regularly exposed to the fumes of [[mercury(II) nitrate]], then used in the treatment of [[fur]] to produce [[felt]] used on hats.

He carried a Bible with him at all times and read passages aloud from it regularly, held unauthorized prayer meetings and argued with his superior officers.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|pp=160\u2013161}}</ref> Corbett also condemned officers and superiors for what he perceived as violations of [[Religious texts|God's word]]. In one instance, he verbally reprimanded [[Daniel Butterfield|Colonel Daniel Butterfield]] for using profanity and taking the Lord's name in vain. He was sent to the [[guardhouse]] for several days but refused to apologize for his insubordination.<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\">{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|p=161}}</ref> Due to his continued disruptive behavior and refusal to take orders, Corbett was [[court-martial]]ed and sentenced to be shot. His sentence was eventually reduced and he was discharged in August 1863.<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|p=129}}</ref>\n\nCorbett re-enlisted later that month as a private in Company L, [[16th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry|16th New York Cavalry Regiment]]. On June&nbsp;24, 1864, he was captured by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Colonel [[John S. Mosby]]'s men in [[Culpeper, Virginia]] and held prisoner at [[Andersonville prison]] for five months. Corbett was released in an [[Prisoner exchange|exchange]] in November 1864 and was admitted to the Army hospital in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] where he was treated for [[scurvy]], [[malnutrition]] and exposure.<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\"/> On his return to his company, he was promoted to [[Sergeant (United States)|Sergeant]]. Corbett later testified for the prosecution in the trial of the commandant of Andersonville, Captain [[Henry Wirz]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chamlee|Chamlee|1989|p=289}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chipman|1891|p=40}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Wilkes Booth wanted poster new.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wanted poster]] for [[John Wilkes Booth]], [[John Surratt]], and [[David Herold]] (1865)]]\n\n===Pursuit of John Wilkes Booth===\nOn April 24, 1865, [[16th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry|Corbett's regiment]] was sent to apprehend [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], whom Booth [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|fatally shot]] on April 14, 1865. On April 26, the regiment surrounded Booth and one of his accomplices, [[David Herold]], in a tobacco barn on the [[Virginia]] farm of Richard Garrett. Herold surrendered, but Booth refused and cried out, \"I will not be taken alive!\". The barn was set on fire in an attempt to force him out into the open, but Booth remained inside.<ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|pp=324\u2013335}}</ref> Corbett was positioned near a large crack in the barn wall. \n\n===Shooting Booth===\nIn an 1878 interview, Corbett claimed that he saw Booth aim his [[carbine]], prompting him to shoot Booth with his [[Colt revolver]] despite [[Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]'s orders that Booth be captured alive. The bullet struck Booth in the back of the head behind his left ear, passed though his neck, and out into the barn.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/assassination/ |title=American Experience &#124; The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln |publisher=PBS |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=103}}</ref> A low scream of pain like that produced by a sudden throttling came from the assassin, and he pitched headlong to the floor.<ref>{{cite book|title=Terry Alford, Fortune\u2019s Fool: The Life of John Wilkes Booth}}</ref> Corbett and the other soliders would note a sense of poetic, or cosmic, justice in that Lincoln and Booth were each shot around the same spot of the head.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|pp=227\u2013228}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Death of John Wilkes Booth, 1865|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/booth.htm|publisher=Eyewitness to History/Ibis Communications|accessdate=August 16, 2012|quote=the bullet struck Booth in the back of the head, about an inch below the spot where his shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln.}}</ref> And the damage to Booth was no less severe than that to Lincoln: the bullet had pierced three [[vertebrae]] and partially severed his [[spinal cord]], [[paralysis|paralyzing]] him.<ref name=\"Goodrich, p. 211\">Goodrich, p. 211.</ref><ref name=Smith210>Smith, pp. 210\u2013213.</ref> Their conditions were different as well, as [[Mary C.

The bullet wound prevented him from swallowing any of the liquid. In a weak voice, Booth asked for water and Conger and Baker gave it to him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=104}}</ref> He asked them to roll him over and turn him facedown. Conger thought it a bad idea. Then at least turn me on my side, the assassin pleaded. They did, but Conger saw that the move did not relieve Booth\u2019s suffering. Baker noticed it, too: \"He seemed to suffer extreme pain whenever he was moved...and would several times repeat, \u2018Kill me.\u2019\"<ref>Swanson, p. 139.</ref> At sunrise, Booth remained in agonising pain. His pulse weakening as his breathing became more laboured and irregular. In agony, unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered as he gazed at them, \"Useless ... Useless.\" These were his last words. A few minutes later, Booth began gasping for air as his throat continued to swell, then there was a shiver and a gurgle and his body shuddered, before Booth died from asphyxia - he literally choked to death. He died two hours after Corbett shot him.\n\n[[File:boston corbett.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Boston Corbett]]\n[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Colonel]] [[Everton Conger]] initially thought Booth had shot himself. After realizing Booth had been shot by someone else, Conger and Lt. Doherty asked which officer had shot Booth. Corbett stepped forward and admitted he was the shooter.<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|p=135}}</ref> When asked why he had violated orders, Corbett replied, \"[[Divine providence|Providence]] directed me\".<ref name=\"Swanson340\">{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=340}}</ref> \n\n====Court marshal====\nHe was immediately arrested and was accompanied by Lt. Doherty to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to be court martialed. When questioned by Edwin Stanton about Booth's capture and shooting, both Doherty and Corbett agreed that Corbett had in fact disobeyed orders not to shoot. However, Corbett maintained that he believed Booth had intended to shoot his way out of the barn and that he acted in self-defense. He told Stanton, \"...Booth would have killed me if I had not shot first. I think I did right.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=227}}</ref> Corbett maintained that he didn't intend to kill Booth, but merely wanted to inflict a disabling wound, but either his aim slipped or Booth moved at the moment Corbett pulled the trigger.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=104}}</ref> Stanton paused and then stated, \"The rebel is dead. The patriot lives; he has spared the country expense, continued excitement and trouble. Discharge the patriot.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\"/> Upon leaving the War Department, Corbett was greeted by a cheering crowd. As he made his way to [[Mathew Brady]]'s studio to have his official portrait taken, the crowd followed him asking for autographs and requesting that he tell them about shooting Booth. Corbett told the crowd:\n\n{{quote|I aimed at his body. I did not want to kill him....I think he stooped to pick up something just as I fired. That may probably account for his receiving the ball in the head. [W]hen the assassin lay at my feet, a wounded man, and I saw the [[bullet]] had taken effect about an inch back of the ear, and I remembered that Mr. Lincoln was wounded about the same part of the head, I said: \"What a God we have...God avenged Abraham Lincoln.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|pp=227\u2013228}}</ref>}}\n\n====Contradictions====\nEyewitnesses to Booth's shooting contradicted Corbett's version of events and expressed doubts that Corbett was responsible for shooting Booth. Officers who were near Corbett at the time claimed that they never saw him fire his gun (Corbett's gun was never inspected and was eventually lost). They claimed that Corbett came forward only after Lt. Colonel Conger asked who had shot Booth. Richard Garrett, the owner of the farm on which Booth was found, and his 12-year-old son Robert also contradicted Corbett's testimony that he acted in self-defense. Both maintained that Booth had never reached for his gun.<ref>{{harvnb|Nottingham|1997|p=148}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was some criticism of Corbett's actions, he was largely considered a hero by the public and press. One newspaper editor declared that Corbett would, \"live as one of the World's great avengers.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=228}}</ref> For his part in Booth's capture, Corbett received a portion of the $100,000 reward money, amounting to $1,653.84 ({{Inflation|US|1653.84|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"goodrich291\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=291}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=358}}</ref> His annual salary as a U.S. sergeant was $204 ({{Inflation|US|204|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). Corbett received offers to purchase the gun he used to shoot Booth. He refused stating, \"That is not mine-it belongs to the Government, and I would not sell it for any price.\"<ref name=\"basler\">{{harvnb|Basler|1965|pp=57\u201358}}</ref>  Corbett also declined an offer for one of Booth's pistols as he did not want a reminder of shooting Booth.<ref name=\"basler\"/>\n\n==Post-war life==\nAfter his discharge from the army in August 1865, Corbett went back to work as a hatter in Boston and frequently attended the Bromfield Street Church. When the hatting business in Boston slowed, Corbett moved to [[Danbury, Connecticut]], to continue his work and also \"preached in the country round about.\" By 1870, he had relocated once again to [[Camden, New Jersey]], where he was known as a \"Methodist lay preacher\". Corbett's inability to hold a job was attributed to his fanatical behavior; he was routinely fired after continuing his habit of stopping work to pray for his co-workers.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19670103&id=BqpVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=J-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7151,566580|title=The Strange Fate Of Boston Corbett|last=Frazier|first=Robert B.|date=January 3, 1967|work=Eugene Register-Guard|page=5|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref> In an effort to earn money, Corbett capitalized on his role as \"Lincoln's Avenger\".<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\"/> He gave lectures about the shooting of Booth accompanied by illustrated [[lantern slide]]s at Sunday schools, women's groups and tent meetings. Corbett was never asked back due to his increasingly erratic behavior and incoherent speeches.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\"/>\n\nR.B. Hoover, a man who later befriended Corbett, recalled that Corbett believed \"men who were high in authority at Washington at the time of the assassination\" were hounding him. Corbett said the men were angry because he had deprived them of prosecuting and executing John Wilkes Booth themselves. He also believed the same men had gotten him fired from various jobs.<ref name=\"sparks\">{{harvnb|Sparks|Everett|Lowell|Lodge|1889|p=382}}</ref> Corbett's paranoia was furthered by [[hate mail]] he received for killing Booth. He became fearful that \"Booth's Avengers\" or organizations like the \"Secret Order\" were planning to seek revenge upon him and took to carrying a pistol with him at all times. As his paranoia increased, Corbett began brandishing his pistol at friends or strangers he deemed suspicious.<ref name=\"goodrich291\"/>\n\nWhile attending the Soldiers' Reunion of the Blue and Gray in [[Caldwell, Ohio]], in 1875, Corbett got into an argument with several men over the death of John Wilkes Booth. The men questioned if Booth had really been killed at all which enraged Corbett. He then drew his pistol on the men but was removed from the reunion before he could fire it.<ref name=\"sparks\"/> In 1878, Corbett moved to [[Concordia, Kansas]], where he acquired a plot of land through [[Homestead principle|homesteading]] upon which he constructed a [[Dugout (shelter)|dugout]] home. He continued working as a preacher and attended [[revival meeting]]s frequently.<ref name=\"johnson51\">{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=51}}</ref>\n\n==Presumed fate==\nDue to his fame as \"Lincoln's Avenger\", Corbett was appointed assistant doorkeeper of the [[Kansas House of Representatives]] in [[Topeka]] in January 1887. On February 15, he became convinced that \nofficers of the House were discriminating against him. He jumped to his feet, brandished a revolver and began chasing the officers out of the building. No one was hurt and Corbett was arrested. The following day, a judge declared Corbett insane and sent him to the [[Topeka State Hospital|Topeka Asylum for the Insane]]. On May 26, 1888, he escaped from the asylum on horseback.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Dale|date=September 2005|title=The Mad Hatter|journal=American Cowboy|volume=12|issue=3|page=82|issn=1079-3690|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-oCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> He then rode to [[Neodesha, Kansas]], where he briefly stayed with Richard Thatcher, a man he had met while they were [[prisoners of war]]. When Corbett left, he told Thatcher he was going to Mexico.<ref name=\"johnson51\"/>\n\nRather than going to Mexico, Corbett is believed to have settled in a cabin he built in the forests near [[Hinckley, Minnesota|Hinckley]], in [[Pine County, Minnesota|Pine County]] in eastern [[Minnesota]]. He is believed to have died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] on September&nbsp;1, 1894.

A few years after Corbett was last seen in Neodesha, Kansas, a [[patent medicine]] salesman in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] filed an application using Corbett's name to receive pension benefits. After an investigation proved that the man was not Boston Corbett, he was sent to prison. In September 1905, a man arrested in [[Dallas]] also claimed to be Corbett. He too was proven to be an imposter and was sent to prison for perjury, and then to the [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|Government Hospital for the Insane]].<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|pp=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Memorials===\nIn 1958, Boy Scout Troop 31, of [[Concordia, Kansas]], built a roadside monument to Corbett located on Key Road.

[[Steve Harwell]] was recording his vocals in a large room normally used for orchestras on movie soundtracks at [[Skywalker Sound]].

For this, the opening line: \"Get your motor runnin', California Interstate 1\" was repeated in the song's second verse, replacing: \"Quit your bitchin', bite your tongue, save it for a rainy day, son\" to make it appropriate for the game. It is also featured in the soundtracks of the films ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'' and ''[[The Sweetest Thing]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- This is a licensed stream for the album, which is allowed under Wikipedia polices -->\n*[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpbEBCQfpmYEkWVF4eefyR-GOh4U_eBHz ''Smash Mouth''] at [[YouTube]] (streamed copy where licensed)\n*[http://www.smashmouth.com The Official Smash Mouth site]\n\n{{Smash Mouth}}\n\n[[Category:Smash Mouth albums]]\n[[Category:2001 albums]]\n[[Category:Interscope Records albums]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2017}}{{Infobox album\n| name       = Smash Mouth\n| type       = Studio\n| artist     = [[Smash Mouth]]\n| cover      = SmashMouthAlbum.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 27, 2001\n| recorded   = December 1999-2001\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Pop rock]], [[pop punk]]\n| length     = 42:11\n| label      = [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]\n| producer   = [[Eric Valentine]]\n| prev_title = [[Astro Lounge]]\n| prev_year  = 1999\n| next_title = [[Get the Picture?

It was released in the fall of 2001 along with the single \"[[Pacific Coast Party]]\".\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = \n| headline        = \n| extra_column    = \n| total_length    = 42:11\n\n| all_writing     = \n| all_lyrics      = \n| all_music       =\n\n| title1          = Holiday in My Head \n| note1           = \n| writer1         = [[Greg Camp]]\n| lyrics1         = \n| music1          = \n| extra1          = \n| length1         = 2:40\n\n| title2          = Your Man\n| note2           = \n| writer2         = Camp\n| lyrics2         = \n| music2          =\n| extra2          = \n| length2         = 3:36\n\n| title3          = Pacific Coast Party\n| note3           = \n| writer3         = Camp, [[Paul De Lisle]]\n| lyrics3         = \n| music3          = \n| extra3          = \n| length3         = 2:58\n\n| title4          = She Turns Me On\n| note4           = \n| writer4         = [[Blag Dahlia|Paul Cafaro]], [[Eric Valentine]]\n| lyrics4         = \n| music4          = \n| extra4          = \n| length4         = 3:12\n\n| title5          = Sister Psychic\n| note5           = \n| writer5         = Camp\n| lyrics5         = \n| music5          = \n| extra5          = \n| length5         = 3:16\n\n| title6          = Out of Sight\n| note6           = \n| writer6         = Camp\n| lyrics6         = \n| music6          = \n| extra6          = \n| length6         = 2:56\n\n| title7          = Force Field\n| note7           = \n| writer7         = Camp\n| lyrics7         = \n| music7          = \n| extra7          = \n| length7         = 3:49\n\n| title8          = Shoes 'n' Hats\n| note8           = \n| writer8         = Camp\n| lyrics8         = \n| music8          = \n| extra8          = \n| length8         = 2:48\n\n| title9          = Hold You High\n| note9           = \n| writer9         = Camp\n| lyrics9         = \n| music9          = \n| extra9          = \n| length9         = 3:01\n\n| title10         = The In Set\n| note10          = \n| writer10        = Camp\n| lyrics10        = \n| music10         = \n| extra10         = \n| length10        = 3:41\n\n| title11         = Disenchanted\n| note11          = \n| writer11        = Camp\n| lyrics11        = \n| music11         = \n| extra11         = \n| length11        = 4:16\n\n| title12         = Keep It Down\n| note12          = \n| writer12        = Camp\n| lyrics12        = \n| music12         = \n| extra12         = \n| length12        = 5:31\n\n| title13         = [[I'm a Believer#Smash Mouth version|I'm a Believer]]\n| note13          = \n| writer13        = [[Neil Diamond]]\n| lyrics13        = \n| music13         = \n| extra13         = \n| length13        = 3:07\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = Japanese edition bonus tracks<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/SmashMouth-Smash-Mouth-Japan-CD-3BONUS-16Tracks-OBI-/350892008203|title=SmashMouth Smash Mouth Japan CD 3BONUS 16Tracks OBI -

[[Steve Harwell]] was recording his vocals in a large room normally used for orchestras on movie soundtracks at [[Skywalker Sound]]. When he was finished with a take, he accidentally knocked over a vintage [[Georg Neumann]] tube microphone. He tries to convince producers and engineers that everything is fine and it could be fixed with duct tape, but the microphone was not harmed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Usage in media==\n* \"Holiday in My Head\" was featured on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Clockstoppers]]'' and the trailer for the 2005 DreamWorks Animation movie ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]''. It was also included on the album \"Nolee Mix\", which was released to promote the [[My Scene]] dolls. \n* \"[[I'm a Believer]]\", a cover of the classic by [[the Monkees]], was featured in the 2001 film ''[[Shrek]]''.\n* \"Pacific Coast Party\" was featured in the video game ''[[Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure]]''. For this, the opening line: \"Get your motor runnin', California Interstate 1\" was repeated in the song's second verse, replacing: \"Quit your bitchin', bite your tongue, save it for a rainy day, son\" to make it appropriate for the game. It is also featured in the soundtracks of the films ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'' and ''[[The Sweetest Thing]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- This is a licensed stream for the album, which is allowed under Wikipedia polices -->\n*[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpbEBCQfpmYEkWVF4eefyR-GOh4U_eBHz ''Smash Mouth''] at [[YouTube]] (streamed copy where licensed)\n*[http://www.smashmouth.com The Official Smash Mouth site]\n\n{{Smash Mouth}}\n\n[[Category:Smash Mouth albums]]\n[[Category:2001 albums]]\n[[Category:Interscope Records albums]]\n", "name_user": "Koavf", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixeddashesusing ascript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smash_Mouth_(album)"}
