This endeavour was the initial impetus for what would later become the New Brunswick College of Craft and Design.\n\nWith a break during World War II, the program re-emerged with a location at Hut #43 at Exhibition Court in Fredericton and in 1946 Dr. Ivan Crowell was hired from McGill University. Crowell would have a major impact on our province\u2019s development of a craft industry. Dr. Crowell established a Handicraft Training Center at Exhibition Court in Fredericton (fully equipped to teach wood turning, weaving on floor and table looms, rug hooking, braiding and weaving, leather work and cutting and polishing gem stones) and in 1950 a summer school at Fundy National Park called the New Brunswick School of Arts and Crafts.\n\nSince then, the College has been located at the Palmer MacLellan Building on Argyle Street in the late 1960\u2019s, the Huts at the Old Army Barracks at St. Anne\u2019s Point on Woodstock Road in 1970 under the leadership of Allan Crimmins and finally in 1980 the permanent location, then known as the Old Liquor Commission Warehouse on Queen Street under the direction of George Fry. On May 30, 2010, as part of the Provincial government\u2019s action plan for post-secondary education, the College separated from the community college system, remaining under the umbrella of the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour.

In that same athletic year, VMI also joined the conference for all sports, but left to re-join the [[Southern Conference]] in 2014.

Originally a non-football conference, the Big South began sponsoring football in 2002. Its [[college football|football]] teams are part of the [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS). The Big South, founded in 1983, is firmly rooted in the South Atlantic region of the United States, with full member institutions located in [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Virginia]]. Associate members are located in [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Big South Conference History|author=Big South Conference|publisher=Big South Sports|date=2007-08-01 |url=http://www.bigsouthsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4800&KEY=&ATCLID=130896}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nCharter members included Armstrong State (later [[Armstrong Atlantic State University]] and now merged into [[Georgia Southern University]] as its [[Georgia Southern University\u2013Armstrong Campus|Armstrong Campus]]) (1983\u20131987), Augusta (later [[Augusta State University]] and now merged into [[Augusta University]]) (1983\u20131990), [[Campbell University]] (1983\u20131994; 2011\u2013present), Baptist College (now [[Charleston Southern University]]) (1983\u2013present), [[Coastal Carolina University]] (1983\u20132016), [[Radford University]] (1983\u2013present) and [[Winthrop University]] (1983\u2013present).\n\nThe expansion of membership occurred during the 1980s and '90s.

In that same athletic year, VMI also joined the conference for all sports, but left to re-join the [[Southern Conference]] in 2014.

''VCs of the First World War: Gallipoli'', p. 117</ref> One of only two bars (second award) to the Victoria Cross awarded during the war was earned the following day by Captain [[Noel Godfrey Chavasse]] of the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. Chavasse subsequently died of wounds sustained during this second VC action. The other bar to the VC was earnt by [[Arthur Martin-Leake]] during the period 29 October to 8 November 1914 near [[Zonnebeke]], Belgium, when, according to his award citation, Martin-Leake showed most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty in rescuing, while exposed to constant fire, a large number of the wounded who were lying close to the enemy's trenches. Martin-Leake was the first of only three men to be awarded a bar to his VC.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAlthough traditionally the reason Jacka was not awarded a bar to his VC has been ascribed to British [[snobbery]] towards a \"rough [[Colony|colonial]]\", this view has been challenged. [[Gordon Corrigan]], in ''Blood Mud and Poppycock'', points out that  it was Jacka's Australian superiors who chose not to recommend him for the award, and he argues that this may have been due to the fact that the Germans easily infiltrated Jacka's platoon position in broad daylight without being challenged.

''VCs of the First World War: Gallipoli'', p. 117</ref> One of only two bars (second award) to the Victoria Cross awarded during the war was earned the following day by Captain [[Noel Godfrey Chavasse]] of the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. Chavasse subsequently died of wounds sustained during this second VC action. The other bar to the VC was earnt by [[Arthur Martin-Leake]] during the period 29 October to 8 November 1914 near [[Zonnebeke]], Belgium, when, according to his award citation, Martin-Leake showed most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty in rescuing, while exposed to constant fire, a large number of the wounded who were lying close to the enemy's trenches. Martin-Leake was the first of only three men to be awarded a bar to his VC.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAlthough traditionally the reason Jacka was not awarded a bar to his VC has been ascribed to British [[snobbery]] towards a \"rough [[Colony|colonial]]\", this view has been challenged. [[Gordon Corrigan]], in ''Blood Mud and Poppycock'', points out that  it was Jacka's Australian superiors who chose not to recommend him for the award, and he argues that this may have been due to the fact that the Germans easily infiltrated Jacka's platoon position in broad daylight without being challenged. The sentries were most likely asleep or absent and Jacka should have ensured that they were not; as such it may have been perceived that while Jacka should be commended for his robust action in responding to the situation, he also bore a responsibility for allowing it to happen in the first place.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAfter the incident, Jacka was evacuated to England, where he was promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 18 August 1916, but was falsely reported dead on 8 September.

The U.S. Forest service recognizes it as the most abundant native tree in eastern North America.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nix|first=Steve|title=Ten Most Common Trees in the United States|url=http://forestry.about.com/b/2012/07/21/ten-most-common-trees-in-the-united-states.htm|publisher=About.com Forestry|accessdate=8 October 2016}}</ref> The red maple ranges from southeastern [[Manitoba]] around the [[Lake of the Woods]] on the border with [[Ontario]] and [[Minnesota]], east to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], south to [[Florida]], and southwest to eastern [[Texas]]. Many of its features, especially its leaves, are quite variable in form. At maturity, it often attains a height of around {{convert|30|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Its flowers, petioles, twigs and seeds are all red to varying degrees. Among these features, however, it is best known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in autumn.\n\nOver most of its range, red maple is adaptable to a very wide range of site conditions, perhaps more so than any other tree in eastern North America. It can be found growing in [[swamp]]s, on poor dry [[soil]]s, and almost anywhere in between. It grows well from [[sea level]] to about {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Due to its attractive fall foliage and pleasing form, it is often used as a shade tree for landscapes. It is used commercially on a small scale for [[maple syrup]] production as well as for its medium to high quality lumber. It is also the [[List of U.S. state and territory trees|state tree]] of Rhode Island. The red maple can be considered weedy or even invasive in young, highly disturbed forests, especially frequently logged forests. Red maple is considered by many{{who|date=October 2019}} a pest, and many{{who|date=October 2019}} believe that it is taking over forests and displacing other native trees,{{According to whom|date=October 2019}} such as [[Acer saccharum|sugar maple]], but this is only true in young forests where human disturbance is common. In a mature or old growth northern hardwood forest, red maple only has a sparse presence, while shade tolerant trees such as sugar maples, [[Beech|beeches]], and [[Tsuga canadensis|hemlocks]] thrive. By removing red maple from a young forest recovering from disturbance, the natural cycle of forest regeneration is altered, changing the diversity of the forest for centuries to come.<ref name=\"Native Tree Society\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nativetreesociety.org/ |title=Native Tree Society |accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>{{failed verification |reason=This is the main page of the website, not the page that actually contains information on Acer rubrum. |date=August 2018}}<ref>{{cite news | title=Eastern Forests Change Color As Red Maples Proliferate | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/27/science/eastern-forests-change-color-as-red-maples-proliferate.html | newspaper=New York Times | access-date=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Redmaplefoliage.jpg|thumb|Typical fall foliage in red maple country.]]\nThough ''A. rubrum'' is usually easy to identify, it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics.

The trunk diameter often ranges from {{convert|46|to|88|cm|in|abbr=on}}; depending on the growing conditions, however, open grown trees can attain diameters of up to {{Convert|153|cm|in}}. The trunk will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees, while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown. Trees on poorer sites often become malformed and scraggly.<ref name=\"VT\">{{cite web | last =Seiler | first =John R. | author2 =Jensen, Edward C. | author3 =Peterson, John A. | title =Acer rubrum Fact Sheet | work =Virginia Tech Dendrology Tree Fact Sheets | publisher =Virginia Tech | date = | url =http://dendro.cnre.vt.edu/dendrology/syllabus/factsheet.cfm?ID=1 | accessdate =23 May 2019}}</ref> Generally the crown is irregularly ovoid with ascending whip-like curved shoots.

As with all North American maple trees, they are [[deciduous]] and arranged oppositely on the twig. They are typically {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and wide with 3-5 [[palmate lobe]]s with a serrated margin. The [[sinus (botany)|sinuses]] are typically narrow, but the leaves can exhibit considerable variation.<ref name=\"VT\" /> When five lobes are present, the three at the terminal end are larger than the other two near the base. In contrast, the leaves of the related [[silver maple]], ''A. saccharinum'', are much more deeply lobed, more sharply toothed and characteristically have 5 lobes. The upper side of ''A. rubrum'''s leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either [[glaucous]] or hairy. The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long. The leaves can turn a characteristic brilliant red in autumn, but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals. Soil acidity can influence the color of the foliage and trees with female flowers are more likely to produce orange coloration while male trees produce red. The fall colors of red maple are most spectacular in the northern part of its range where climates are cooler.\n\n[[File:2013-05-10 13 40 17 Immature foliage of Red Maple in Brendan T Byrne State Forest, New Jersey.jpg|upright|thumb|Immature foliage]]\nThe [[twig]]s of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small [[lenticel]]s. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The [[bud]]s are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color, generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint.

After they reach maturity, the seeds are dispersed for a 1 to 2 week period from April through July.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n''A. rubrum'' is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern [[North America]]. It can be found from the south of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and southern [[Quebec]] to the south west of Ontario, extreme southeastern [[Manitoba]] and northern [[Minnesota]]; south to [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], eastern [[Oklahoma]], and eastern [[Texas]] in its western range; and east to [[Florida]]. It has the largest continuous range along the North American [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] of any tree that occurs in Florida. In total it ranges {{convert|2600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> The species is native to all regions of the United States east of the [[95th meridian west|95th meridian]]. The tree's range ends where the {{convert|-40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} mean minimum [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] begins, namely in southeastern [[Canada]]. ''A. rubrum'' is not present in the Prairie Peninsula of the northern [[Midwest]], the [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|coastal prairie]] in southern [[Louisiana]] and southeastern Texas and the swamp prairie of the [[Florida Everglades]].<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> Red maple's western range stops with the Great Plains where conditions become too dry for it. The absence of red maple from the Prairie Peninsula is most likely due to the tree's poor tolerance of wildfires. Red maple is most abundant in the Northeastern US, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and northeastern Wisconsin and is rare in the extreme west of its range and in the Southeastern US.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\nIn several other locations, the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats. An example is the [[Bluegrass region]] of Kentucky, where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains, but is present along streams.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Campbell| first=J| title=The Land of Cane and Clover| page=25| publisher=University of Kentucky| year=1985| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the [[Grain Belt]], despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area. In the Northeastern US, red maple can be a climax forest species in certain locations, but will eventually give way to sugar maple.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n''A. rubrum'' does very well in a wide range of soil types, with varying textures, moisture, [[pH]], and elevation, probably more so than any other forest tree in North America. ''A. rubrum''<nowiki/>'s high pH tolerance means that it can grow in a variety of places, and it is widespread along the eastern United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=18(2), 177\u2013184.|first=Jared|last2=McCarthy|first2=Brian|year=2011|title=Diminished Soil Quality in an Old-Growth, Mixed Mesophytic Forest Following Chronic Acid Deposition Diminished Soil Quality in an Old-growth, Mixed Mesophytic Forest Following Chronic Acid Deposition|url=|journal=Northeast Naturalist|volume=18 |issue=2|pages=177\u2013184|via=}}</ref> It grows on glaciated as well as unglaciated soils derived from the following rocks: [[granite]], [[gneiss]], [[schist]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]], [[slate]], [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[quartzite]], and [[limestone]]. [[Chlorosis]] can occur on very [[alkaline]] soils, though otherwise its pH tolerance is quite high. Moist mineral soil is best for germination of seeds.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\nRed maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes, from dry ridges and sunny, southwest-facing slopes to [[peat bog]]s and [[swamp]]s. While many types of tree prefer a south- or north-facing aspect, the red maple does not appear to have a preference.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> Its ideal conditions are in moderately well-drained, moist sites at low or intermediate elevations. However, it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges, as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes. Furthermore, it is common in swampy areas, along the banks of slow moving streams, as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions. In northern [[Michigan]] and [[New England]], the tree is found on the tops of ridges, sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils, as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps. In the far south of its range, it is almost exclusively associated with swamps.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> Additionally, red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller, J.H., & Miller, K.V. (1999). ''Forest plants of the southeast and their wildlife uses''. Champaign, IL: Kings Time Printing.</ref>\n\nRed maple is far more abundant today than when Europeans first arrived in North America. It only contributed minimally to old growth upland forests, and would only form same-species stands in [[riparian zone]]s.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> The density of the tree in many of these areas has increased 6- to 7-fold, and this trend seems to be continuing, all of which is due to human factors, mainly continued heavy logging and a recent trend of young, shrubby forests recovering from past human disturbances. Also, the decline of American elm and American chestnut due to introduced diseases has contributed to its spread. Red maple dominates such sites, but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature. This species is in fact a vital part of forest regeneration in the same way that [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]] is.<ref name=\"Native Tree Society\" />\n\nBecause it can grow on a variety of substrates, has a high pH tolerance, and grows in both shade and sun, ''A. rubrum'' is a prolific seed producer and highly adaptable, often dominating disturbed sites. While many believe that it is replacing historically dominant tree species in the eastern United States such as [[sugar maple]]s, [[beech]]es, [[oak]]s, [[Tsuga|hemlocks]] and [[pine]]s, red maple will only dominate young forests prone to natural or human disturbance. In areas disturbed by humans where the species thrives, it can reduce diversity, but in a mature forest it is not a dominant species; it only has a sparse presence and adds to the diversity and ecological structure of a forest.<ref name=\"Native Tree Society\" /> Extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate. Finally, disease epidemics have greatly reduced the population of elms and chestnuts in the forests of the US. While mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil, more marginal areas are increasingly being dominated by red maple.<ref name=\"Paradox\">{{cite journal\n  | last =Abrams\n  | first =Marc D\n  | authorlink =\n  | title =The Red Maple Paradox\n  | journal =BioScience\n  | volume =48\n  | issue =5\n  | pages =335\u2013364\n  | publisher =\n  | date = May 1998\n  | doi =10.2307/1313374\n  | jstor=1313374| doi-access =free\n  }}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nRed maple's maximum lifespan is 150 years, but most live less than 100 years. The tree's thin bark is easily damaged from ice and storms, animals, and when used in landscaping, being struck by flying debris from lawn mowers, allowing fungi to penetrate and cause heart rot.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />Its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce [[root]]s to suit its site from a young age. In wet locations, red maple seedlings produce short [[taproot]]s with long, well-developed lateral roots; while on dry sites, they develop long taproots with significantly shorter laterals. The roots are primarily horizontal, however, forming in the upper {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} of the ground. Mature trees have woody roots up to {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. They are very tolerant of flooding, with one study showing that 60 days of flooding caused no leaf damage. At the same time, they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second growth flush when conditions later improve, even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n[[File:Maplekeys.jpg|left|thumb|Samaras from a specimen in [[Milford, New Hampshire]]]]\n''A. rubrum'' is one of the first plants to flower in spring. A crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year. A single tree between {{convert|5|and|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter can produce between 12,000 and 91,000 seeds in a season. A tree {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> Red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples.<ref name=\"Miller\" /> Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application.\n\nThe seeds are [[epigeal germination|epigeal]] and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released, assuming a small amount of light, moisture, and sufficient temperatures are present. If the seeds are densely shaded, then germination commonly does not occur until the next spring. Most seedlings do not survive in closed [[canopy (biology)|forest canopy]] situations. However, one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy. Though they eventually die if no light reaches them, they serve as a reservoir, waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above.\n\nTrees growing in a Zone 9 or 10 area such as Florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north, for instance to Canada, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples. Due to their wide range, genetically the trees have adapted to the climatic differences.\n\n[[File:2016-03-02 17 22 36 Female Red Maple blossoms along McLearen Road (Virginia State Secondary Route 668) in Oak Hill, Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|Female flowers with red stamens protruding]]\nRed maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease, cutting, or fire. One study found that 6 years after [[clearcutting]] a {{convert|3.4|ha|acre|abbr=off}} Oak-Hickory forest containing no red maples, the plot contained more than 2,200 red maple seedlings per hectare (900 per acre) taller than {{convert|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> One of its associates, the [[black cherry]] (''Prunus serotina''), contains benzoic acid, which has been shown to be a potential [[allelopathic]] inhibitor of red maple growth. Red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation. In one study, stem elongation was one-half completed in 1 week, after which growth slowed and was 90% completed within only 54 days. In good light and moisture conditions, the seedlings can grow {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in their first year and up to {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} each year for the next few years, making it a fast grower.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n[[File:Rubrum buds.jpg|thumb|Flowerbuds in spring before blooming]]\nThe red maple is used as a food source by several forms of wildlife. [[Elk]] and [[white-tailed deer]] in particular use the current season's growth of red maple as an important source of winter food. Several [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food, including larvae of the rosy maple moth (''[[Dryocampa rubicunda]]''); see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples]].\n\nDue to ''A. rubrum'''s very wide range, there is significant variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As a result of such variation, there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban [[cultivar]]s that require resistance from [[verticillium wilt]], air pollution, and drought.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n[[File:Autumn Blaze Maple in Toronto.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.72|''Acer \u00d7 freemanii'' 'Jeffersred' in Toronto]]\nRed maple frequently hybridizes with [[silver maple]]; the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]], known as Freeman's maple, ''[[Acer \u00d7 freemanii]]'', is intermediate between the parents.\n\n=== Allergenic potential ===\n[[File:2015-04-12 16 31 55 Male Red Maple flowers on Bayberry Road in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Male flowers]]\nThe allergenic potential of red maples varies widely based on the cultivar.\n\nThe following cultivars are completely [[male]] and are highly allergenic, with an [[OPALS (Ogren Plant Allergy Scale)|OPALS]] allergy scale rating of 8 or higher:<ref name=Ogren>{{cite book|last1=Ogren|first1=Thomas|title=The Allergy-Fighting Garden|date=2015|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-1-60774-491-7|pages=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\n* 'Autumn Flame' ('Flame')\n* 'Autumn Spire'\n* 'Columnare' ('Pyramidale')\n* 'Firedance' ('Landsburg')\n* 'Karpick'\n* 'Northwood'\n* 'October Brilliance'\n* 'Sun Valley'\n* 'Tiliford'\n\nThe following cultivars have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 3 or lower; they are completely [[female]] trees, and have low potential for causing allergies:<ref name=\"Ogren\" />\n\n* 'Autumn Glory'\n* 'Bowhall'\n* 'Davey Red'\n* 'Doric'\n* 'Embers'\n* 'Festival'\n* 'October Glory'\n* 'Red Skin'\n* 'Red Sunset' ('Franksred')\n\n=== Toxicity ===\nThe leaves of red maple, especially when dead or wilted, are extremely [[List of plants poisonous to equines|toxic to horses]]. The toxin is unknown, but believed to be an [[oxidant]] because it damages [[red blood cell]]s, causing acute [[hemolysis|oxidative hemolysis]] that inhibits the transport of [[oxygen]]. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads to the production of [[methemoglobin]], which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700&nbsp;grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, [[jaundice]], dark brown urine, [[horse colic|colic]], [[laminitis]], coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of [[methylene blue]] or mineral oil and [[activated carbon]] in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as [[blood transfusion]]s, fluid support, [[diuretic]]s, and anti-oxidants such as [[Vitamin C]].

In this context, the term \"soft\" is more comparative, than descriptive; i.e., \"soft maple\", while softer than its harder cousin, sugar maple (''A. saccharum''), is still a fairly hard wood, being comparable to black cherry (''Prunus serotina'') in this regard. Like ''A. saccharum'', the wood of red maple is close-grained, but its texture is softer, less dense, and has not as desirable an appearance, particularly under a clear finish. However, the wood from ''Acer rubrum'' while being typically less expensive than hard maple, also has greater dimensional stability than that of ''A. saccharum'', and also machines and stains easier. Thus, high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple, particularly when it comes to making stain/paint-grade furniture. Red maple lumber also contains a greater percentage of \"curly\" (aka \"flame\"/\"fiddleback\") figure, which is prized by musical instrument/custom furniture makers, as well as the veneer industry. As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.\n\nRed maple is also used for the production of [[maple syrup]], though the hard maples ''[[Acer saccharum]]'' (sugar maple) and ''[[Acer nigrum]]'' (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, as well as those of the ''[[Acer saccharinum]]'' (silver maple), ''[[Acer negundo]]'' (boxelder), and ''[[Acer platanoides]]'' (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\nNative Americans used red maple bark as a wash for inflamed eyes and cataracts, and as a remedy for hives and muscular aches. They also would brew tea from the inner bark to treat coughs and diarrhea. Pioneers made cinnamon-brown and black dyes from a bark extract, and iron sulphate could be added to the tannin from red maple bark in order to make ink.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/pg_acru.pdf|title=Plant Guide: Red Maple, Acer rubrum L.|last=Nesom|first=Guy|date=May 24, 2006|website=United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service}}</ref>\n\nRed maple is a medium quality firewood,<ref>{{cite web|title=Heating With Wood: Species Characteristics and Volumes|author=Michael Kuhns and Tom Schmidt|date=n.d.|publisher=UtahState University Cooperative Extension|url=http://extension.usu.edu/forestry/HomeTown/General_HeatingWithWood.htm}}</ref> possessing less heat energy, nominally {{convert|18.7|e6Btu/cord|GJ/m3|lk=on|abbr=off|order=flip}} , \nthan other hardwoods such as ash: {{convert|24|e6Btu/cord|GJ/m3|abbr=in|order=flip}}, oak: {{convert|24|e6Btu/cord|GJ/m3|abbr=in|order=flip}}, or birch: {{convert|21|e6Btu/cord|GJ/m3|abbr=in|order=flip}}.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of plants poisonous to equines]]\n* [[List of foods made from maple]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikispecies}}\n{{Commons category|Acer rubrum}}\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACRU NRCS: United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile and map: ''Acer rubrum'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060523011021/http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/acru.htm ''Acer rubrum'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n* [http://www.portraitoftheearth.com/trees/redsilvermaple.html Portrait of the Earth, Winter ID photos]\n\n{{taxonbar|from=Q161364}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|rubrum]]\n[[Category:Hardwood forest plants]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Symbols of Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Plants used in bonsai]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n", "text_old": "{{Good article}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| name = Red maple\n| image = 2014-10-30 11 09 40 Red Maple during autumn on Lower Ferry Road in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG\n| status = G5\n| status_system = TNC\n| status_ref = <ref name=natureserve>{{Cite web | last =NatureServe | title = ''Acer rubrum'' | work = NatureServe Explorer: An online encyclopedia of life, Version 6.1. | date = | location = Arlington, Virginia | year =2006 | url = http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Acer+rubrum+ | postscript =<!--None-->  }}</ref>\n| status2 = LC\n| status2_system = IUCN3.1\n| status2_ref = <ref name=IUCN>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/103451747/0|title=''Acer rubrum'' |year=2019 |accessdate=16 June 2019|ref=harv}}</ref>\n| genus = Acer\n| parent = Acer sect.

Many of its features, especially its leaves, are quite variable in form. At maturity, it often attains a height of around {{convert|30|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Its flowers, petioles, twigs and seeds are all red to varying degrees. Among these features, however, it is best known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in autumn.\n\nOver most of its range, red maple is adaptable to a very wide range of site conditions, perhaps more so than any other tree in eastern North America. It can be found growing in [[swamp]]s, on poor dry [[soil]]s, and almost anywhere in between. It grows well from [[sea level]] to about {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Due to its attractive fall foliage and pleasing form, it is often used as a shade tree for landscapes. It is used commercially on a small scale for [[maple syrup]] production as well as for its medium to high quality lumber. It is also the [[List of U.S. state and territory trees|state tree]] of Rhode Island. The red maple can be considered weedy or even invasive in young, highly disturbed forests, especially frequently logged forests.  Red maple is considered by many{{who|date=October 2019}} a pest, and many{{who|date=October 2019}} believe that it is taking over forests and displacing other native trees,{{According to whom|date=October 2019}} such as [[Acer saccharum|sugar maple]], but this is only true in young forests where human disturbance is common. In a mature or old growth northern hardwood forest, red maple only has a sparse presence, while shade tolerant trees such as sugar maples, [[Beech|beeches]], and [[Tsuga canadensis|hemlocks]] thrive.  By removing red maple from a young forest recovering from disturbance, the natural cycle of forest regeneration is altered, changing the diversity of the forest for centuries to come.<ref name=\"Native Tree Society\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nativetreesociety.org/ |title=Native Tree Society |accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>{{failed verification |reason=This is the main page of the website, not the page that actually contains information on Acer rubrum. |date=August 2018}}<ref>{{cite news | title=Eastern Forests Change Color As Red Maples Proliferate | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/27/science/eastern-forests-change-color-as-red-maples-proliferate.html | newspaper=New York Times | access-date=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Redmaplefoliage.jpg|thumb|Typical fall foliage in red maple country.]]\nThough ''A. rubrum'' is usually easy to identify, it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics.

As with all North American maple trees, they are [[deciduous]] and arranged oppositely on the twig. They are typically {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and wide with 3-5 [[palmate lobe]]s with a serrated margin. The [[sinus (botany)|sinuses]] are typically narrow, but the leaves can exhibit considerable variation.<ref name=\"VT\" /> When five lobes are present, the three at the terminal end are larger than the other two near the base. In contrast, the leaves of the related [[silver maple]], ''A. saccharinum'', are much more deeply lobed, more sharply toothed and characteristically have 5 lobes. The upper side of ''A. rubrum'''s leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either [[glaucous]] or hairy. The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long. The leaves can turn a characteristic brilliant red in autumn, but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals. Soil acidity can influence the color of the foliage and trees with female flowers are more likely to produce orange coloration while male trees produce red. The fall colors of red maple are most spectacular in the northern part of its range where climates are cooler.\n\n[[File:2013-05-10 13 40 17 Immature foliage of Red Maple in Brendan T Byrne State Forest, New Jersey.jpg|upright|thumb|Immature foliage]]\nThe [[twig]]s of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small [[lenticel]]s. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The [[bud]]s are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color, generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint.

After they reach maturity, the seeds are dispersed for a 1 to 2 week period from April through July.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n''A. rubrum'' is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern [[North America]]. It can be found from the south of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and southern [[Quebec]] to the south west of Ontario, extreme southeastern [[Manitoba]] and northern [[Minnesota]]; south to [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], eastern [[Oklahoma]], and eastern [[Texas]] in its western range; and east to [[Florida]]. It has the largest continuous range along the North American [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] of any tree that occurs in Florida. In total it ranges {{convert|2600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> The species is native to all regions of the United States east of the [[95th meridian west|95th meridian]]. The tree's range ends where the {{convert|-40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} mean minimum [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] begins, namely in southeastern [[Canada]]. ''A. rubrum'' is not present in the Prairie Peninsula of the northern [[Midwest]], the [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|coastal prairie]] in southern [[Louisiana]] and southeastern Texas and the swamp prairie of the [[Florida Everglades]].<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> Red maple's western range stops with the Great Plains where conditions become too dry for it. The absence of red maple from the Prairie Peninsula is most likely due to the tree's poor tolerance of wildfires. Red maple is most abundant in the Northeastern US, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and northeastern Wisconsin and is rare in the extreme west of its range and in the Southeastern US.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\nIn several other locations, the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats. An example is the [[Bluegrass region]] of Kentucky, where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains, but is present along streams.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Campbell| first=J| title=The Land of Cane and Clover| page=25| publisher=University of Kentucky| year=1985| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the [[Grain Belt]], despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area. In the Northeastern US, red maple can be a climax forest species in certain locations, but will eventually give way to sugar maple.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n''A. rubrum'' does very well in a wide range of soil types, with varying textures, moisture, [[pH]], and elevation, probably more so than any other forest tree in North America. ''A. rubrum''<nowiki/>'s high pH tolerance means that it can grow in a variety of places, and it  is widespread along the eastern United States<nowiki/>.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=18(2), 177\u2013184.|first=Jared|last2=McCarthy|first2=Brian|year=2011|title=Diminished Soil Quality in an Old-Growth, Mixed Mesophytic Forest Following Chronic Acid Deposition Diminished Soil Quality in an Old-growth, Mixed Mesophytic Forest Following Chronic Acid Deposition|url=|journal=Northeast Naturalist|volume=18 |issue=2|pages=177\u2013184|via=}}</ref> It grows on glaciated as well as unglaciated soils derived from the following rocks: [[granite]], [[gneiss]], [[schist]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]], [[slate]], [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[quartzite]], and [[limestone]]. [[Chlorosis]] can occur on very [[alkaline]] soils, though otherwise its pH tolerance is quite high. Moist mineral soil is best for germination of seeds.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\nRed maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes, from dry ridges and sunny, southwest-facing slopes to [[peat bog]]s and [[swamp]]s. While many types of tree prefer a south- or north-facing aspect, the red maple does not appear to have a preference.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> Its ideal conditions are in moderately well-drained, moist sites at low or intermediate elevations. However, it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges, as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes. Furthermore, it is common in swampy areas, along the banks of slow moving streams, as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions. In northern [[Michigan]] and [[New England]], the tree is found on the tops of ridges, sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils, as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps. In the far south of its range, it is almost exclusively associated with swamps.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> Additionally, red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller, J.H., & Miller, K.V. (1999). ''Forest plants of the southeast and their wildlife uses''. Champaign, IL: Kings Time Printing.</ref>\n\nRed maple is far more abundant today than when Europeans first arrived in North America. It only contributed minimally to old growth upland forests, and would only form same-species stands in [[riparian zone]]s.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> The density of the tree in many of these areas has increased 6- to 7-fold, and this trend seems to be continuing, all of which is due to human factors, mainly continued heavy logging and a recent trend of young, shrubby forests recovering from past human disturbances. Also, the decline of American elm and American chestnut due to introduced diseases has contributed to its spread. Red maple dominates such sites, but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature. This species is in fact a vital part of forest regeneration in the same way that [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]] is.<ref name=\"Native Tree Society\" />\n\nBecause it can grow on a variety of substrates, has a high pH tolerance, and grows in both shade and sun, ''A. rubrum'' is a prolific seed producer and highly adaptable, often dominating disturbed sites.  While many believe that it is replacing historically dominant tree species in the eastern United States such as [[sugar maple]]s, [[beech]]es, [[oak]]s, [[Tsuga|hemlocks]] and [[pine]]s, red maple will only dominate young forests prone to natural or human disturbance.  In areas disturbed by humans where the species thrives, it can reduce diversity, but in a mature forest it is not a dominant species; it only has a sparse presence and adds to the diversity and ecological structure of a forest.<ref name=\"Native Tree Society\" /> Extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate. Finally, disease epidemics have greatly reduced the population of elms and chestnuts in the forests of the US. While mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil, more marginal areas are increasingly being dominated by red maple.<ref name=\"Paradox\">{{cite journal\n  | last =Abrams\n  | first =Marc D\n  | authorlink =\n  | title =The Red Maple Paradox\n  | journal =BioScience\n  | volume =48\n  | issue =5\n  | pages =335\u2013364\n  | publisher =\n  | date = May 1998\n  | doi =10.2307/1313374\n  | jstor=1313374| doi-access =free\n  }}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nRed maple's maximum lifespan is 150 years, but most live less than 100 years. The tree's thin bark is easily damaged from ice and storms, animals, and when used in landscaping, being struck by flying debris from lawn mowers, allowing fungi to penetrate and cause heart rot.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />Its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce [[root]]s to suit its site from a young age. In wet locations, red maple seedlings produce short [[taproot]]s with long, well-developed lateral roots; while on dry sites, they develop long taproots with significantly shorter laterals. The roots are primarily horizontal, however, forming in the upper {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} of the ground. Mature trees have woody roots up to {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. They are very tolerant of flooding, with one study showing that 60 days of flooding caused no leaf damage. At the same time, they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second growth flush when conditions later improve, even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n[[File:Maplekeys.jpg|left|thumb|Samaras from a specimen in [[Milford, New Hampshire]]]]\n''A. rubrum'' is one of the first plants to flower in spring. A crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year. A single tree between {{convert|5|and|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter can produce between 12,000 and 91,000 seeds in a season. A tree {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> Red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples.<ref name=\"Miller\" />  Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application.\n\nThe seeds are [[epigeal germination|epigeal]] and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released, assuming a small amount of light, moisture, and sufficient temperatures are present. If the seeds are densely shaded, then germination commonly does not occur until the next spring. Most seedlings do not survive in closed [[canopy (biology)|forest canopy]] situations. However, one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy. Though they eventually die if no light reaches them, they serve as a reservoir, waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above.\n\nTrees growing in a Zone 9 or 10 area such as Florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north, for instance to Canada, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples. Due to their wide range, genetically the trees have adapted to the climatic differences.\n\n[[File:2016-03-02 17 22 36 Female Red Maple blossoms along McLearen Road (Virginia State Secondary Route 668) in Oak Hill, Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|Female flowers with red stamens protruding]]\nRed maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease, cutting, or fire. One study found that 6 years after [[clearcutting]] a {{convert|3.4|ha|acre|abbr=off}} Oak-Hickory forest containing no red maples, the plot contained more than 2,200 red maple seedlings per hectare (900 per acre) taller than {{convert|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /> One of its associates, the [[black cherry]] (''Prunus serotina''), contains benzoic acid, which has been shown to be a potential [[allelopathic]] inhibitor of red maple growth. Red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation. In one study, stem elongation was one-half completed in 1 week, after which growth slowed and was 90% completed within only 54 days. In good light and moisture conditions, the seedlings can grow {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in their first year and up to {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} each year for the next few years, making it a fast grower.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n[[File:Rubrum buds.jpg|thumb|Flowerbuds in spring before blooming]]\nThe red maple is used as a food source by several forms of wildlife. [[Elk]] and [[white-tailed deer]] in particular use the current season's growth of red maple as an important source of winter food. Several [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food, including larvae of the rosy maple moth (''[[Dryocampa rubicunda]]''); see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples]].\n\nDue to ''A. rubrum'''s very wide range, there is significant variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As a result of such variation, there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban [[cultivar]]s that require resistance from [[verticillium wilt]], air pollution, and drought.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n[[File:Autumn Blaze Maple in Toronto.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.72|''Acer \u00d7 freemanii'' 'Jeffersred' in Toronto]]\nRed maple frequently hybridizes with [[silver maple]]; the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]], known as Freeman's maple, ''[[Acer \u00d7 freemanii]]'', is intermediate between the parents.\n\n=== Allergenic potential ===\n[[File:2015-04-12 16 31 55 Male Red Maple flowers on Bayberry Road in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Male flowers]]\nThe allergenic potential of red maples varies widely based on the cultivar.\n\nThe following cultivars are completely [[male]] and are highly allergenic, with an [[OPALS (Ogren Plant Allergy Scale)|OPALS]] allergy scale rating of 8 or higher:<ref name=Ogren>{{cite book|last1=Ogren|first1=Thomas|title=The Allergy-Fighting Garden|date=2015|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-1-60774-491-7|pages=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\n* 'Autumn Flame' ('Flame')\n* 'Autumn Spire'\n* 'Columnare' ('Pyramidale')\n* 'Firedance' ('Landsburg')\n* 'Karpick'\n* 'Northwood'\n* 'October Brilliance'\n* 'Sun Valley'\n* 'Tiliford'\n\nThe following cultivars have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 3 or lower; they are completely [[female]] trees, and have low potential for causing allergies:<ref name=\"Ogren\" />\n\n* 'Autumn Glory'\n* 'Bowhall'\n* 'Davey Red'\n* 'Doric'\n* 'Embers'\n* 'Festival'\n* 'October Glory'\n* 'Red Skin'\n* 'Red Sunset' ('Franksred')\n\n=== Toxicity ===\nThe leaves of red maple, especially when dead or wilted, are extremely [[List of plants poisonous to equines|toxic to horses]]. The toxin is unknown, but believed to be an [[oxidant]] because it damages [[red blood cell]]s, causing acute [[hemolysis|oxidative hemolysis]] that inhibits the transport of [[oxygen]]. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads to the production of [[methemoglobin]], which can further damage the kidneys.

In parts of the [[Pacific Northwest]], it is one of the most common introduced trees. Its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit, its attractive and early red flowers, and most importantly, its flaming red fall foliage. The tree was introduced into the [[United Kingdom]] in 1656 and shortly thereafter entered cultivation. There it is frequently found in many parks and yards.<ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite book | last =Mitchell | first =A.

In this context, the term \"soft\" is more comparative, than descriptive; i.e., \"soft maple\", while softer than its harder cousin, sugar maple (''A. saccharum''), is still a fairly hard wood, being comparable to black cherry (''Prunus serotina'') in this regard.  Like ''A. saccharum'', the wood of red maple is close-grained, but its texture is softer, less dense, and has not as desirable an appearance, particularly under a clear finish.  However, the wood from ''Acer rubrum'' while being typically less expensive than hard maple, also has greater dimensional stability than that of ''A. saccharum'', and also machines and stains easier. Thus, high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple, particularly when it comes to making stain/paint-grade furniture. Red maple lumber also contains a greater percentage of \"curly\" (aka \"flame\"/\"fiddleback\") figure, which is prized by musical instrument/custom furniture makers, as well as the veneer industry.  As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.\n\nRed maple is also used for the production of [[maple syrup]], though the hard maples ''[[Acer saccharum]]'' (sugar maple) and ''[[Acer nigrum]]'' (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, as well as those of the ''[[Acer saccharinum]]'' (silver maple), ''[[Acer negundo]]'' (boxelder), and ''[[Acer platanoides]]'' (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\nNative Americans used red maple bark as a wash for inflamed eyes and cataracts, and as a remedy for hives and muscular aches. They also would brew tea from the inner bark to treat coughs and diarrhea. Pioneers made cinnamon-brown and black dyes from a bark extract, and iron sulphate could be added to the tannin from red maple bark in order to make ink.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/pg_acru.pdf|title=Plant Guide: Red Maple, Acer rubrum L.|last=Nesom|first=Guy|date=May 24, 2006|website=United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service}}</ref>\n\nRed maple is a medium quality firewood,<ref>{{cite web|title=Heating With Wood: Species Characteristics and Volumes|author=Michael Kuhns and Tom Schmidt|date=n.d.|publisher=UtahState University Cooperative Extension|url=http://extension.usu.edu/forestry/HomeTown/General_HeatingWithWood.htm}}</ref> possessing less heat energy, nominally {{convert|18.7|e6Btu/cord|GJ/m3|lk=on|abbr=off|order=flip}} , \nthan other hardwoods such as ash: {{convert|24|e6Btu/cord|GJ/m3|abbr=in|order=flip}}, oak: {{convert|24|e6Btu/cord|GJ/m3|abbr=in|order=flip}}, or birch: {{convert|21|e6Btu/cord|GJ/m3|abbr=in|order=flip}}.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of plants poisonous to equines]]\n* [[List of foods made from maple]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikispecies}}\n{{Commons category|Acer rubrum}}\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACRU NRCS: United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile and map: ''Acer rubrum'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060523011021/http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/acru.htm ''Acer rubrum'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n* [http://www.portraitoftheearth.com/trees/redsilvermaple.html Portrait of the Earth, Winter ID photos]\n\n{{taxonbar|from=Q161364}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|rubrum]]\n[[Category:Hardwood forest plants]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Symbols of Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Plants used in bonsai]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n", "name_user": "Harrumphings", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed double spaces", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_rubrum"}
