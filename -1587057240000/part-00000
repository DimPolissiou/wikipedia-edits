''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' had arrived in Brest on 22 Mar 1941 after the success of [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation Berlin]] in the Atlantic. More raids were planned and the ships for refitted at Brest. The ships were a substantial threat to Allied trans-Atlantic convoys and [[RAF Bomber Command]] attacked the ships from 30 Mar 1941. ''Gneisenau'' was hit on 6 April 1941 and on ''Scharnhorst'' on 24 July 1941, after dispersal to [[La Pallice]]. In late 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' (OKM German Navy high-command), to plan an operation to return the ships to German bases against a British invasion of [[Norway]]. The short route up the [[English Channel]] was preferred to a detour around the British Isles for surprise and air cover by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and on 12 January 1942, Hitler gave orders for the operation.{{sfn|Koop|Schmolke|2014|p=111}}\n\nThe British exploited decrypts of German radio messages coded with the [[Enigma machine]], air reconnaissance by the RAF [[No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF|Photographic Reconnaissance Unit]] (PRU) and agents in France to watch the ships and report the damage caused by the bombing. Operation Fuller, a joint Royal Navy-RAF contingency plan, was devised to counter a sortie by the German ships against Atlantic convoys, a return to German ports by circumnavigating the British Isles or a dash up the English Channel. The [[Royal Navy]] had to keep ships at [[Scapa Flow]] in Scotland, in case of a sortie by the German battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] from Norway. The RAF had sent squadrons from Bomber and Coastal commands overseas and kept torpedo-bombers in Scotland ready for ''Tirpitz'', which limited the number of aircraft against a dash up the Channel, as did the winter weather which reduced visibility and blocked airfields with snow.\n\nOn 11 February 1942, the ships left Brest at {{nowrap|9:14 p.m.}} and escaped detection for more than twelve hours, approaching the [[Strait of Dover]] without discovery. The ''Luftwaffe'' [[Operation Donnerkeil|''Unternehmen Donnerkeil'']] (Operation Thunderbolt) provided air cover and as the ships neared Dover, the British belatedly began operations; the RAF, the [[Fleet Air Arm]], Navy and coastal artillery operations were costly failures but ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' hit mines in the [[North Sea]] and were damaged (''Scharnhorst'' was out of action for a year). By 13 February, the ships had reached German ports, [[Winston Churchill]] had ordered an inquiry into the debacle and ''[[The Times]]'' denounced the British fiasco. The ''Kriegsmarine'' judged the operation a tactical success and a strategic failure; the threat to Atlantic convoys had been sacrificed for a hypothetical threat to Norway. On 23 February ''Prinz Eugen'' was torpedoed off Norway, repaired and spent the rest of the war in the Baltic. ''Gneisenau'' went into a dry dock and was bombed on the night of {{nowrap|26/27 February,}} never to sail again; ''Scharnhorst'' was sunk at the [[Battle of the North Cape]] on 26 December 1943.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Port of Brest, 1940\u20131941===\n\n{{Location map+ |France |width=200 |float=right |caption={{centre|La Pallice and French Channel ports}}|places=\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=48.39 |long=-4.49 |label=[[Brest, France|Brest]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=46.158333 |long=-1.227778 |label=[[La Pallice]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=49.639 |long=-1.625 |label=[[Cherbourg-en-Cotentin|Cherbourg]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=50.5186 |long=1.595 |label=[[Le Touquet]] |label_size=80 |position=left |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=50.948056 |long=1.856389 |label=[[Calais]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n}}\nGerman commerce raiding against British north Atlantic convoys was made easier by the capture of Norway and France in 1940. An abortive sortie by the cruiser [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|''Admiral Hipper'']] ended at Brest, at the west end of the Brittany peninsula, on 27 December 1940. After five weeks of bombing to no effect, the ship put to sea on 1 February 1941, sank numerous ships and returned on 14 February, before sailing to Germany using the roundabout route via the [[Denmark Strait]] the next day, reaching [[Kiel]] on 28 March.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=372\u2013373}} The commerce raids in the north [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] during the winter of 1940\u20131941 by ''Scharnhorst''-class battleships {{Ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, the [[heavy cruiser]]s [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] and ''Admiral Hipper'' sank {{convert|115622|LT|t|abbr=on}} of British shipping, a higher rate than German surface ships achieved for the rest of the war.

''Gneisenau'' needed an overhaul of her engine room and entered dry dock on 4 April. When the water was pumped out, an unexploded bomb was found between the stocks under the ship. The ship had to be carefully refloated and removed so that the bomb could be defused. ''Gneisenau'' was moored in an exposed position in the roadstead, where it was photographed by a 1 PRU Spitfire on 5 April. [[Bristol Beaufort]] torpedo bombers attacked at dawn next day; one aircraft found the harbour through the haze and torpedoed ''Gneisenau'' on the starboard side, seriously damaging the reserve command centre. The ship was dry-docked again and on the night of {{nowrap|10/11 April,}} Bomber Command achieved four hits and two near-misses. One of the hits did not explode but the others jammed 'B' turret, locally distorted the armoured deck, made about a third of the crew quarters uninhabitable by fire and blast damage, destroyed the kitchens and bakery and affected some gunnery control systems.{{sfn|Koop|Schmolke|2014|p=51}} ''Scharnhorst'' was not damaged but the bomb hits on the docks delayed its refit, which included a substantial overhaul of its machinery; the boiler superheater tubes had a manufacturing defect that had plagued the ship throughout [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation Berlin]].{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1985|p=159}} The work had been expected to take ten weeks but along with mines dropped in the vicinity, the ships were not available to support [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|''Unternehmen Rhein\u00fcbung'']] (Operation Rhine Exercise) the breakout of [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] and the ''Hipper''-class cruiser [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|''Prinz Eugen'']] into the North Atlantic. ''Bismarck'' was sunk but ''Prinz Eugen'' had returned separately and arrived at Brest on 1 June.

The sailing on 21 July of ''Scharnhorst'' to La Pallice, the deep-water port of [[La Rochelle]] down the French Atlantic coast, forestalled an attempt by Bomber Command to attack the ships in Brest by surprise. ''Scharnhorst'' was attacked by six Stirling bombers on the evening of 23 July, about six German fighters intervened and one bomber was shot down. The attack on Brest took place in daylight on 24 July, with a loss of {{nowrap|13 bombers;}} La Pallice was bombed again by fifteen [[Handley Page Halifax]]es.

The fighters near Cherbourg were to be diverted by Blenheim bombers covered by normal Spitfires of 11 Group. The Hampden crews trained for a month but the plan was upset when ''Scharnhorst'' was found to have sailed to La Pallice, beyond the reach of the long-range Spitfires.

''OKM'' preferred the Denmark Strait passage to Germany and ''[[Grand Admiral|Gro\u00dfadmiral]]'' (Grand Admiral) [[Erich Raeder]] called a journey along the English Channel impossible.{{sfn|Martienssen|1949|pp=121\u2013122}} Hitler said that the break-out should be planned with no training period, since British intelligence was bound to find out and have the ships bombed. Hitler ordered that a period of bad weather should be chosen, when the bulk of the RAF would be grounded. ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (vice admiral) [[Kurt Fricke]] (Chief of Staff of the ''[[Seekriegsleitung]] SKL'', Maritime Warfare Command) opposed Hitler but was allowed only a short time to review the policy. On 12 January 1942, Raeder again opposed the channel route but planned for it, provided that Hitler took the final decision.{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=358\u2013360}}\n\nHitler noted that the ships at Brest had diverted British bombing from Germany but that the advantage would end as soon as the ships were sufficiently damaged. Vice Admiral [[Otto Ciliax]] outlined a plan for a standing start at night to gain surprise and to pass the Strait of Dover during the day, to benefit from fighter cover at the danger point. The ''Luftwaffe'' refused to guarantee that the {{nowrap|250 fighters}} available could succeed in protecting the ships but Hitler accepted the plan.{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=358\u2013360}} Hitler ordered that the battleship ''Tirpitz'', already in Norway, was to be moved south to [[Trondheim]]. At a conference on 22 January, Hitler announced that all ships and U-boats should assemble for the defence of Norway and on 25 January, ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], the (''Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote'', ''BdU'', Commander of Submarines) was ordered to withdraw eight submarines to patrol off [[Iceland]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Scotland]]; despite protests from D\u00f6nitz, another twelve U-boats were reserved for Norway, along with the surface ships being concentrated in Norwegian waters.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|pp=149, 100, 149\u2013150}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Operation Cerberus===\n\n{{Location map+ |Norway |width=150 |float=right |caption={{centre|Norway}}|places=\n{{Location map~ |Norway |lat=63.429722 |long=10.393333 |label=[[Trondheim]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n}}\nHitler preferred the Channel route and responsibility was delegated to ''Marine-Gruppenkommando West'' (Naval Command West, Admiral [[Alfred Saalw\u00e4chter]]) for planning and operational directions; Ciliax, was commander of the Brest Group (flagship, ''Scharnhorst'').{{sfn| Martienssen|1949|pp=121\u2013122}} Care was taken to choose the best route, to avoid British minefields and to steam at high speed.

During January, the ''Kriegsmarine'' and ''Luftwaffe'' rehearsed the operation but the ships had lost seaworthiness and many technicians and experts had been transferred from Brest to more pressing duties. By 9 February, the ships had completed their trials in Brest roads and the sortie was set for 11 February.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|p=150}} Morale of the crews was high, no sabotage had occurred at Brest and the crews went ashore freely.

Hitler had exchanged the threat to British Atlantic convoys for a defensive deployment near Norway against a threat that never materialised. Roskill wrote that the British had misjudged the time of day when the German ships would sail but this mistake was less influential than the circumstantial failures of Coastal Command reconnaissance to detect the ships which had been at sea for {{nowrap|12 hours,}} four of them after dawn had broken, before the alarm was raised. Churchill ordered a Board of Enquiry (Sir [[Alfred Townsend Bucknill]]), which criticised Coastal Command for failing to ensure that a dawn reconnaissance was flown to compensate for the problems of the night patrols off Brest and Ushant to the Isle de Br\u00e9hat. The inquiry also held that there should have been more suspicion of the German radar jamming on the morning of 12 February and that involving Bomber Command in an operation for which it was untrained was a mistake.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|pp=159\u2013160}}\n\nThe board found that the delay in detecting the German ships led to the British attacks being made piecemeal, against formidable German defensive arrangements and that the few aircraft and ships that found the group were \"cut to pieces\".{{sfn|Roskill|1962|p=160}} In 2012, Ken Ford wrote that the inquiry was, perforce, a whitewash, blaming instrument failures rather than incompetence but the report was still kept secret until 1946.{{sfn|Ford|2012|p=75}} In 1991, John Buckley wrote that the ASV Hudsons had been forbidden to use flares off Brest, because of the presence of ''Sealion'' and that one of the technical faults to an ASV could have been repaired, had the operator carried out a fuze check properly. Joubert was criticised for complacency, in not sending replacement sorties, despite his earlier warning that the Brest Group was about to sail, because of the assumption in Operation Fuller since 6 April 1941, that a day sailing was certain,\n\n{{quote|...a classic example of befuddled tactical thinking, poor co-operation and almost non-existent co-ordination.|Robertson{{sfn|Buckley|1991|p=359}}}}\n\nThe dash exposed many failings in RAF planning, that only three torpedo-bomber squadrons with {{nowrap|31 Beauforts}} were in Britain, that training had been limited by the lack of torpedoes and the example of Japanese tactics had been ignored. The effectiveness of Bomber Command against moving ships was shown to be negligible and the failure to ensure unity of command before Operation Fuller began, led to piecemeal attacks using unsuitable tactics.{{sfn|Buckley|1991|pp=356\u2013365}}\n\n[[Reginald Victor Jones|R. V. Jones]] the Assistant Director of Intelligence (Science) at the Air Ministry, wrote in 1998 that on 11 February, Lieutenant-Colonel B. E. Wallace of the army Radar Interception Unit, had called for his assistance. For several days, army radar stations on the south coast had been jammed and Wallace had reported this internally but a gradual increase in jamming had misled most operators to its intensity.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=233\u2013235}} Martini, the ''[[General der Luftnachrichtentruppe]]'' (General of Air Force Communications Troops) had unobtrusively made the British radar cover \"almost useless\". Jones wrote of the ASV reconnaissance,\n\n{{quote|Nay, it were better, to meet some Dangers halfe way, though they come nothing neare, than to keepe too long a watch, upon their Approaches: For if a Man watch too long, it is odds that he will fall asleepe.|Francis Bacon, ''Of Delayes''{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=235}}}}\n\nand included an anecdote that the chain of command broke down under the shock of the Brest Group sailing so far up the Channel undiscovered. Air Marshals were said to have sat on each other's desks, thinking of pilots they could telephone to find the ships; even after the Brest Group had been found, contact was lost several times. In 1955, Jones met Captain Giessler, the Navigating Officer on ''Scharnhorst'', who said that the worst time in the operation was the thirty minutes that ''Scharnhorst'' was stationary after hitting a mine just beyond Dover; in the low cloud none of the British aircraft found them.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=235}}{{efn|In 2013, Goodchild wrote that although Operation Fuller was a scientific and technological failure, Jones exaggerated for effect in his memoir. Too much had been expected of radar and German countermeasures were underestimated, given earlier attempts to jam British radar in 1940 and British research into [[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]].{{sfn|Goodchild|2013|pp=295\u2013308}}}} In the Official History of the Royal Canadian Air Force (1994) Brereton Greenhous et al. wrote that the Canadian 401 Squadron had been sent \"to intervene in an battle between German E-boats and British MTBs\", 404 Squadron was ordered\n\n{{quote|...to maintain air superiority between 1430 and 1500 hrs whilst the main attack by Coastal and Bomber aircraft was taking place.{{sfn|Greenhous|1994|p=215}}}}\n\nand 411 Squadron had been ordered on an \"E-boat search\". \"The 'Channel block' had failed ignominiously\".{{sfn|Greenhous|1994|p=215}}\n\nIn the German semi-official history ''Germany in the Second World War'' (2001) Werner Rahn wrote that the operation had been a tactical success but that this could not disguise the fact of a strategic withdrawal. Brest was a location from which the ''Kriegsmarine'' had anticipated much success, especially after the Japanese entry into the war had diverted Allied resources to the Pacific and created new opportunities for offensive action in the Atlantic.{{sfn|Rahn|2001|p=435}}\n\n===Casualties===\n\nBritish aircraft losses to the ''Luftwaffe'' were two [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheims]], four Whirlwinds, four [[Vickers Wellington|Wellingtons]], six Hurricanes, nine [[Handley Page Hampden|Hampdens]] and ten Spitfires.

''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' had arrived in Brest on 22 Mar 1941 after the success of [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation Berlin]] in the Atlantic. More raids were planned and the ships for refitted at Brest. The ships were a substantial threat to Allied trans-Atlantic convoys and [[RAF Bomber Command]] attacked the ships from 30 Mar 1941. ''Gneisenau'' was hit on 6 April 1941 and on ''Scharnhorst'' on 24 July 1941, after dispersal to [[La Pallice]]. In late 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' (OKM German Navy high-command), to plan an operation to return the ships to German bases against a British invasion of [[Norway]]. The short route up the [[English Channel]] was preferred to a detour around the British Isles for surprise and air cover by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and on 12 January 1942, Hitler gave orders for the operation.{{sfn|Koop|Schmolke|2014|p=111}}\n\nThe British exploited decrypts of German radio messages coded with the [[Enigma machine]], air reconnaissance by the RAF [[No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF|Photographic Reconnaissance Unit]] (PRU) and agents in France to watch the ships and report the damage caused by the bombing. Operation Fuller, a joint Royal Navy-RAF contingency plan, was devised to counter a sortie by the German ships against Atlantic convoys, a return to German ports by circumnavigating the British Isles or a dash up the English Channel. The [[Royal Navy]] had to keep ships at [[Scapa Flow]] in Scotland, in case of a sortie by the German battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] from Norway. The RAF had sent squadrons from Bomber and Coastal commands overseas and kept torpedo-bombers in Scotland ready for ''Tirpitz'', which limited the number of aircraft against a dash up the Channel, as did the winter weather which reduced visibility and blocked airfields with snow.\n\nOn 11 February 1942, the ships left Brest at {{nowrap|9:14 p.m.}} and escaped detection for more than twelve hours, approaching the [[Strait of Dover]] without discovery. The ''Luftwaffe'' [[Operation Donnerkeil|''Unternehmen Donnerkeil'']] (Operation Thunderbolt) provided air cover and as the ships neared Dover, the British belatedly began operations; the RAF, the [[Fleet Air Arm]], Navy and coastal artillery operations were costly failures but ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' hit mines in the [[North Sea]] and were damaged (''Scharnhorst'' was out of action for a year). By 13 February, the ships had reached German ports, [[Winston Churchill]] had ordered an inquiry into the debacle and ''[[The Times]]'' denounced the British fiasco. The ''Kriegsmarine'' judged the operation a tactical success and a strategic failure; the threat to Atlantic convoys had been sacrificed for a hypothetical threat to Norway. On 23 February ''Prinz Eugen'' was torpedoed off Norway, repaired and spent the rest of the war in the Baltic. ''Gneisenau'' went into a dry dock and was bombed on the night of {{nowrap|26/27 February,}} never to sail again; ''Scharnhorst'' was sunk at the [[Battle of the North Cape]] on 26 December 1943.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Port of Brest, 1940\u20131941===\n\n{{Location map+ |France |width=200 |float=right |caption={{centre|La Pallice and French Channel ports}}|places=\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=48.39 |long=-4.49 |label=[[Brest, France|Brest]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=46.158333 |long=-1.227778 |label=[[La Pallice]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=49.639 |long=-1.625 |label=[[Cherbourg-en-Cotentin|Cherbourg]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=50.5186 |long=1.595 |label=[[Le Touquet]] |label_size=80 |position=left |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |France |lat=50.948056 |long=1.856389 |label=[[Calais]] |label_size=80 |position=right |marksize=6}}\n}}\nGerman commerce raiding against British north Atlantic convoys was made easier by the capture of Norway and France in 1940. An abortive sortie by the cruiser [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|''Admiral Hipper'']] ended at Brest, at the west end of the Brittany peninsula, on 27 December 1940. After five weeks of bombing to no effect, the ship put to sea on 1 February 1941, sank numerous ships and returned on 14 February, before sailing to Germany using the roundabout route via the [[Denmark Strait]] the next day, reaching [[Kiel]] on 28 March.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=372\u2013373}} The commerce raids in the north [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] during the winter of 1940\u20131941 by ''Scharnhorst''-class battleships {{Ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, the [[heavy cruiser]]s [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] and ''Admiral Hipper'' sank {{convert|115622|LT|t|abbr=on}} of British shipping, a higher rate than German surface ships achieved for the rest of the war. The British reformed [[No. 19 Group RAF|19 Group]] for [[Coastal Command]] in January 1941, which kept watch on the German ships at Brest; ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' arrived at the port of Brest on 22 March 1941.{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=223\u2013224}}\n\n===British air offensive, 1941===\n\nFrom 10 January to mid-April 1941, Bomber Command aimed {{convert|829|LT|t|abbr=on}} of bombs at the ships in Brest harbour.

''Gneisenau'' needed an overhaul of her engine room and entered dry dock on 4 April. When the water was pumped out, an unexploded bomb was found between the stocks under the ship. The ship had to be carefully refloated and removed so that the bomb could be defused. ''Gneisenau'' was moored in an exposed position in the roadstead, where it was photographed by a 1 PRU Spitfire on 5 April. [[Bristol Beaufort]] torpedo bombers attacked at dawn next day; one aircraft found the harbour through the haze and torpedoed ''Gneisenau'' on the starboard side, seriously damaging the reserve command centre. The ship was dry-docked again and on the night of {{nowrap|10/11 April,}} Bomber Command achieved four hits and two near-misses. One of the hits did not explode but the others jammed 'B' turret, locally distorted the armoured deck, made about a third of the crew quarters uninhabitable by fire and blast damage, destroyed the kitchens and bakery and affected some gunnery control systems.{{sfn|Koop|Schmolke|2014|p=51}} ''Scharnhorst'' was not damaged but the bomb hits on the docks delayed its refit, which included a substantial overhaul of its machinery; the boiler superheater tubes had a manufacturing defect that had plagued the ship throughout [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation Berlin]].{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1985|p=159}} The work had been expected to take ten weeks but along with mines dropped in the vicinity, the ships were not available to support [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|''Unternehmen Rhein\u00fcbung'']] (Operation Rhine Exercise) the breakout of [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] and the ''Hipper''-class cruiser [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|''Prinz Eugen'']] into the North Atlantic. ''Bismarck'' was sunk but ''Prinz Eugen'' had returned separately and arrived at Brest on 1 June. The loss of ''Bismarck'' severely limited the freedom of action of the German surface fleet after Hitler ordered that capital ships must operate with much greater caution.{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1985|p=246}}{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=54\u201357}}{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=223\u2013225, 233, 236\u2013237}}\n\n[[File:Brest, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1939-1941 C2228.jpg|thumb|{{centre|[[No. 35 Squadron RAF|35 Squadron]] Halifax bombers over Brest, 1941 (C2228)}}|alt=Vertical aerial photograph taken during a daylight attack on German warships docked at Brest, France.

The sailing on 21 July of ''Scharnhorst'' to La Pallice, the deep-water port of [[La Rochelle]] down the French Atlantic coast, forestalled an attempt by Bomber Command to attack the ships in Brest by surprise. ''Scharnhorst'' was attacked by six Stirling bombers on the evening of 23 July, about six German fighters intervened and one bomber was shot down. The attack on Brest took place in daylight on 24 July, with a loss of {{nowrap|13 bombers;}} La Pallice was bombed again by fifteen [[Handley Page Halifax]]es. One bomber failed to find La Pallice and the rest were met by {{nowrap|12\u201318 Bf 109s}} and anti-aircraft fire ([[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]]) and all {{nowrap|14 Halifaxes}} were hit, and affecting their bomb-aiming.

Bomber Command planners thought that {{nowrap|140\u2013150 bombers}} would be needed but the bomber pilots were inexperienced in formation flying and the number of long-range Spitfires was insufficient to escort a loose formation. Unescorted [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Fortress Is]] were to attack first at height, followed {{nowrap|15 minutes}} later by {{nowrap|18 Hampden}} bombers with three Spitfire squadron escorts, to attract German fighters and leave them short of fuel and ammunition. The main force of {{nowrap|120 Wellingtons}} and heavy bombers were to attack for {{nowrap|45 minutes,}} with the last two Spitfire squadrons in the vicinity for any German fighters that managed to make second sorties. The fighters near Cherbourg were to be diverted by Blenheim bombers covered by normal Spitfires of 11 Group. The Hampden crews trained for a month but the plan was upset when ''Scharnhorst'' was found to have sailed to La Pallice, beyond the reach of the long-range Spitfires. The heavy bombers were taken out of the Brest attack and Manchester bombers were withdrawn due to mechanical defects, reducing the main force to {{nowrap|78 bombers.}} The rest of the bombers attacked Brest on 24 July; the Fortress crews saw a few German fighters and the Hampdens reported about {{nowrap|24 more}} but the main force was too small to swamp the German ground defences and {{nowrap|11 bombers}} were shot down by fighters and flak; two more bombers crashed on their return flights.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|2006|pp=240\u2013241}}}} While returning to Brest containing {{convert|3000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of seawater, a Beaufort attacked and was shot down before the torpedo was dropped.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|2006|pp=167, 240\u2013241}}{{sfn|Richards|1974|p=361}}\n\nFrom 28 March to the end of July, {{convert|1962|LT|t|abbr=on}} of bombs were dropped in {{nowrap|1,875 sorties,}} {{nowrap|1,723 by}} Bomber Command, which also sent {{nowrap|205 minelaying}} sorties, with another {{nowrap|159 from}} Coastal Command, laying {{nowrap|275 mines}} off Brest; the British lost {{nowrap|34 aircraft,}} three being minelayers.

When ''Prinz Eugen'' was found out of dry dock on 16 December, a plan for a big night raid, followed up by a day raid was implemented, with a {{nowrap|101-bomber}} raid on the night of {{nowrap|17/18 December}} and a daylight raid by {{nowrap|41 heavy}} bombers on the afternoon of 18 December, escorted by ten fighter squadrons. ''Gneisenau'' was lightly damaged and dock gates were smashed, stranding ''Scharnhorst'' for a month, for a loss six bombers.

''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (vice admiral) [[Kurt Fricke]] (Chief of Staff of the ''[[Seekriegsleitung]] SKL'', Maritime Warfare Command) opposed Hitler but was allowed only a short time to review the policy.

Next day the Nore Command was ordered to keep six destroyers on call in the Thames and be ready to send six torpedo boats to reinforce those at Dover. The [[Abdiel-class minelayer]]s {{HMS|Manxman|M70|6}} and {{HMS|Welshman|M84|6}} were detached to Plymouth Command to mine the Brest approaches and to Dover to mine the eastern exit of the Channel respectively.

Hitler had exchanged the threat to British Atlantic convoys for a defensive deployment near Norway against a threat that never materialised. Roskill wrote that the British had misjudged the time of day when the German ships would sail but this mistake was less influential than the circumstantial failures of Coastal Command reconnaissance to detect the ships which had been at sea for {{nowrap|12 hours,}} four of them after dawn had broken, before the alarm was raised. Churchill ordered a Board of Enquiry (Sir [[Alfred Townsend Bucknill]]), which criticised Coastal Command for failing to ensure that a dawn reconnaissance was flown to compensate for the problems of the night patrols off Brest and Ushant to the Isle de Br\u00e9hat. The inquiry also held that there should have been more suspicion of the German radar jamming on the morning of 12 February and that involving Bomber Command in an operation for which it was untrained was a mistake.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|pp=159\u2013160}}\n\nThe board found that the delay in detecting the German ships led to the British attacks being made piecemeal, against formidable German defensive arrangements and that the few aircraft and ships that found the group were \"cut to pieces\".{{sfn|Roskill|1962|p=160}} In 2012, Ken Ford wrote that the inquiry was, perforce, a whitewash, blaming instrument failures rather than incompetence but the report was still kept secret until 1946.{{sfn|Ford|2012|p=75}} In 1991, John Buckley wrote that the ASV Hudsons had been forbidden to use flares off Brest, because of the presence of ''Sealion'' and that one of the technical faults to an ASV could have been repaired, had the operator carried out a fuze check properly. Joubert was criticised for complacency, in not sending replacement sorties, despite his earlier warning that the Brest Group was about to sail, because of the assumption in Operation Fuller since 6 April 1941, that a day sailing was certain,\n\n{{quote|...a classic example of befuddled tactical thinking, poor co-operation and almost non-existent co-ordination.|Robertson{{sfn|Buckley|1991|p=359}}}}\n\nThe dash exposed many failings in RAF planning, that only three torpedo-bomber squadrons with {{nowrap|31 Beauforts}} were in Britain, that training had been limited by the lack of torpedoes and the example of Japanese tactics had been ignored. The effectiveness of Bomber Command against moving ships was shown to be negligible and the failure to ensure unity of command before Operation Fuller began, led to piecemeal attacks using unsuitable tactics.{{sfn|Buckley|1991|pp=356\u2013365}}\n\n[[Reginald Victor Jones|R. V. Jones]] the Assistant Director of Intelligence (Science) at the Air Ministry, wrote in 1998 that on 11 February, Lieutenant-Colonel B. E. Wallace of the army Radar Interception Unit, had called for his assistance. For several days, army radar stations on the south coast had been jammed and Wallace had reported this internally but a gradual increase in jamming had misled most operators to its intensity.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=233\u2013235}} Martini, the ''[[General der Luftnachrichtentruppe]]'' (General of Air Force Communications Troops) had unobtrusively made the British radar cover \"almost useless\".

Air Marshals were said to have sat on each other's desks, thinking of pilots they could telephone to find the ships; even after the Brest Group had been found, contact was lost several times. In 1955, Jones met Captain Giessler, the Navigating Officer on ''Scharnhorst'', who said that the worst time in the operation was the thirty minutes that ''Scharnhorst'' was stationary after hitting a mine just beyond Dover; in the low cloud none of the British aircraft found them.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=235}}{{efn|In 2013, Goodchild wrote that although Operation Fuller was a scientific and technological failure, Jones exaggerated for effect in his memoir.

Notably, rulers of [[List of Vietnamese dynasties|Vietnam]] and Korea also declared {{transl|zh|gu\u00f3h\u00e0o}} for their respective realm.\n\n===Retroactive dynastic name===\nIn Chinese historiography, historians generally do not refer to dynasties by their official name. Instead, [[Retroactive nomenclature#Chinese history|historiographical names]], which were most commonly derived from their {{transl|zh|gu\u00f3h\u00e0o}}, are used. For instance, the [[Sui dynasty]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u968b\u671d}}) is known as such because its formal name was \"Sui\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u968b}}). Likewise, the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u91d1\u671d}}) was officially the \"Great Jin\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5927\u91d1}}).\n\nWhen more than one dynasty shared the same [[Chinese characters|Chinese character(s)]] as their formal name, as was common in Chinese history, prefixes are retroactively applied to dynastic names by historians in order to distinguish between these similarly-named regimes.<ref name=\"DynasticName1-B\">Wilkinson (2000). p. 14.</ref><ref name=\"DynasticName13\">{{cite web|url=https://kknews.cc/history/bb4gb6.html|title=\u4e3a\u4f55\u4e2d\u56fd\u53e4\u4ee3\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u671d\u4ee3\u524d\u8981\u52a0\u4e0a\"\u4e1c\u897f\u5357\u5317\"\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\"\u897f\u6c49\"\u5462\uff1f|access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref> Frequently used prefixes include:\n\n* cardinal direction\n** \"northern\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5317}}; {{transl|zh|b\u011bi}}): e.g., [[Northern Qi]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5317\u9f4a}}), [[Northern Yuan dynasty|Northern Yuan]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5317\u5143}})\n** \"southern\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5357}}; {{transl|zh|n\u00e1n}}): e.g., [[Southern Yan]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5357\u71d5}}), [[Southern Tang]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5357\u5510}})\n** \"eastern\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6771}}; {{transl|zh|d\u014dng}}): e.g., [[Jin dynasty (266\u2013420)#Eastern Jin|Eastern Jin]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6771\u6649}}), [[Eastern Wei]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6771\u9b4f}})\n** \"western\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u897f}}; {{transl|zh|x\u012b}}): e.g., [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Liang]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u897f\u6dbc}}), [[Qara Khitai|Western Liao]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u897f\u907c}})\n* sequence\n** \"former\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u524d}}; {{transl|zh|qi\u00e1n}}): e.g., [[Former Qin]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u524d\u79e6}}), [[Former Shu]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u524d\u8700}})\n** \"later\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5f8c}}; {{transl|zh|h\u00f2u}}): e.g., [[Later Zhao]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5f8c\u8d99}}), [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5f8c\u6f22}})\n* surname of the ruling family\n** e.g., [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Wu Zhou]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6b66\u5468}}), [[Ma Chu]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u99ac\u695a}})\n* other types of prefixes\n** e.g., [[Shu Han]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u8700\u6f22}}; the prefix \"Shu\" is a reference to the realm's geographic location at Sichuan), [[Xia (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Hu Xia]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u80e1\u590f}}; the prefix \"Hu\", meaning \"[[Barbarian#China|barbarian]]\", refers to the dynasty's [[Xiongnu]] origin)\n\nA dynasty could be referred to by more than one retroactive name in Chinese historiography, albeit some are more widely used than others. For instance, the [[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5289\u5b8b}}) is also known as the \"Former Song\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u524d\u5b8b}}), and the [[Yang Wu]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u694a\u5433}}) is also called the \"Southern Wu\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5357\u5433}}).\n\nScholars usually make a historiographical distinction for dynasties whose rule were interrupted. For example, the [[Song dynasty]] is divided into the [[Northern Song Dynasty|Northern Song]] and the [[Song dynasty#Southern Song, 1127\u20131279|Southern Song]], with the [[Jingkang incident|Jingkang Incident]] as the dividing line; the original \"Song\" founded by the [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] was therefore differentiated from the \"Song\" restored under the [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]]. In such cases, the regime had collapsed, only to be re-established; a distinction between the original regime and the new regime is thus necessary for historiographical purpose. Major exceptions to this historiographical practice include the [[Western Qin]] and the [[Tang dynasty]], which were interrupted by the [[Later Qin]] and the [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Wu Zhou]] respectively.\n\nIn Chinese sources, the term \"dynasty\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u671d}}; {{transl|zh|ch\u00e1o}}) is usually omitted when referencing dynasties that have prefixes in their historiographical names. Such a practice is sometimes adopted in English usage, even though the inclusion of the word \"dynasty\" is also widely seen in English scholarly writings. For example, the [[Northern Zhou]] is also sometimes referred to as the \"Northern Zhou dynasty\".<ref name=\"DynasticName14\">{{cite book|last1=Yuan|first1=Haiwang|title=This is China: The First 5,000 Years|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8GpQEIU0PGkC&pg=PA40&dq=northern+zhou+dynasty#v=onepage|page=40|isbn=9781933782768}}</ref>\n\n==List of major Chinese dynasties==\nThis list includes only major dynasties of China that are typically found in simplified forms of Chinese historical timelines.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|\n!colspan=\"2\"|Dynasty\n!colspan=\"3\"|Ruling house\n!colspan=\"2\"|Period of rule\n!colspan=\"3\"|Rulers\n|-\n!Name{{efn|name=\"Name\"|The English and Chinese names stated are historiographical nomenclature.

Instead, [[Retroactive nomenclature#Chinese history|historiographical names]], which were most commonly derived from their {{transl|zh|gu\u00f3h\u00e0o}}, are used. For instance, the [[Sui dynasty]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u968b\u671d}}) is known as such because its formal name was \"Sui\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u968b}}). Likewise, the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u91d1\u671d}}) was officially the \"Great Jin\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5927\u91d1}}).\n\nWhen more than one dynasty shared the same [[Chinese characters|Chinese character(s)]] as their formal name, as was common in Chinese history, prefixes are retroactively applied to dynastic names by historians in order to distinguish between these similarly-named regimes.<ref name=\"DynasticName1-B\">Wilkinson (2000). p. 14.</ref><ref name=\"DynasticName13\">{{cite web|url=https://kknews.cc/history/bb4gb6.html|title=\u4e3a\u4f55\u4e2d\u56fd\u53e4\u4ee3\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u671d\u4ee3\u524d\u8981\u52a0\u4e0a\"\u4e1c\u897f\u5357\u5317\"\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\"\u897f\u6c49\"\u5462\uff1f|access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref> Frequently used prefixes include:\n\n* cardinal direction\n** \"northern\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5317}}; {{transl|zh|b\u011bi}}): e.g., [[Northern Qi]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5317\u9f4a}}), [[Northern Yuan dynasty|Northern Yuan]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5317\u5143}})\n** \"southern\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5357}}; {{transl|zh|n\u00e1n}}): e.g., [[Southern Yan]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5357\u71d5}}), [[Southern Tang]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5357\u5510}})\n** \"eastern\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6771}}; {{transl|zh|d\u014dng}}): e.g., [[Jin dynasty (266\u2013420)#Eastern Jin|Eastern Jin]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6771\u6649}}), [[Eastern Wei]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6771\u9b4f}})\n** \"western\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u897f}}; {{transl|zh|x\u012b}}): e.g., [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Liang]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u897f\u6dbc}}), [[Qara Khitai|Western Liao]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u897f\u907c}})\n* sequence\n** \"former\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u524d}}; {{transl|zh|qi\u00e1n}}): e.g., [[Former Qin]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u524d\u79e6}}), [[Former Shu]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u524d\u8700}})\n** \"later\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5f8c}}; {{transl|zh|h\u00f2u}}): e.g., [[Later Zhao]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5f8c\u8d99}}), [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5f8c\u6f22}})\n* surname of the ruling family\n** e.g., [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Wu Zhou]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6b66\u5468}}), [[Ma Chu]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u99ac\u695a}})\n* other types of prefixes\n** e.g., [[Shu Han]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u8700\u6f22}}; the prefix \"Shu\" is a reference to the realm's geographic location at Sichuan), [[Xia (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Hu Xia]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u80e1\u590f}}; the prefix \"Hu\", meaning \"[[Barbarian#China|barbarian]]\", refers to the dynasty's [[Xiongnu]] origin)\n\nA dynasty could be referred to by more than one retroactive name in Chinese historiography, albeit some are more widely used than others. For instance, the [[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5289\u5b8b}}) is also known as the \"Former Song\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u524d\u5b8b}}), and the [[Yang Wu]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u694a\u5433}}) is also called the \"Southern Wu\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5357\u5433}}).\n\nScholars usually make a historiographical distinction for dynasties whose rule were interrupted. For example, the [[Song dynasty]] is divided into the [[Northern Song Dynasty|Northern Song]] and the [[Song dynasty#Southern Song, 1127\u20131279|Southern Song]], with the [[Jingkang incident|Jingkang Incident]] as the dividing line; the original \"Song\" founded by the [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] was therefore differentiated from the \"Song\" restored under the [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]]. In such cases, the regime had collapsed, only to be re-established; a distinction between the original regime and the new regime is thus necessary for historiographical purpose. Major exceptions to this historiographical practice include the [[Western Qin]] and the [[Tang dynasty]], which were interrupted by the [[Later Qin]] and the [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Wu Zhou]] respectively.\n\nIn Chinese sources, the term \"dynasty\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u671d}}; {{transl|zh|ch\u00e1o}}) is usually omitted when referencing dynasties that have prefixes in their historiographical names. Such a practice is sometimes adopted in English usage, even though the inclusion of the word \"dynasty\" is also widely seen in English scholarly writings.

He is particularly noted for his corpus of [[Latin]] letters.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Baldwinofexeterstatuecanterburycatheraloutside.jpg|thumb|Baldwin of Forde, Peter's tutor and friend, as depicted on the exterior of Canterbury Cathedral.]]\n\nPeter of Blois was born about 1130. Earlier opinion tended to place the date later in the 1130s,<ref name=dnb/> but an earlier date is now considered more likely.<ref name=odnb/> His family were minor nobility of [[Brittany|Breton]] origin.\n\nAfter an early visit to Paris, Peter received his literary education at the school attached to [[Tours Cathedral]] in the early 1140s probably accompanied and mentored by an older namesake and relative, Pierre de Blois.<ref name=odnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22012?docPos=1 Southern, ODNB]</ref> He studied under [[Bernard Silvestris]], who, he later recalled, urged him to \u201ctake up in truth not fables, but history\u201d<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba01pete#page/316/mode/2up Giles, letter 101, vol. 1, p.317]</ref> and made him memorise the letters of [[Hildebert]], a former [[Archbishop of Tours]]. It has been thought Peter also studied under the English philosopher and [[theology|theologian]] [[John of Salisbury]],<ref name=cath>{{Catholic|prescript=|wstitle=Peter de Blois}}</ref> but this is now generally discounted.<ref name=dnb>{{cite DNB |no-icon=1 |wstitle=Peter of Blois |last=Kingsford |first=Charles Lethbridge |volume=45}}</ref>\n\nPeter then studied [[Roman law]] at the [[University of Bologna]], a centre for legal studies. Here he was tutored by [[Baldwin of Forde]], a future [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and both studied under Umberto Crivelli, the future Pope [[Pope Urban III]].<ref name=odnb/> Peter was much more strongly attracted to the rhetorical and literary aspects of the subject than to jurisprudence: as he wrote later, \u201csporting with its glorious verbal trappings and charming, fanciful oratorical urbanity, attracted me powerfully and intoxicated my mind.\u201d<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba01pete#page/94/mode/2up Giles, letter 26, vol. 1, p.95]</ref>\n\nAround 1155 Peter went to study [[theology]] in Paris, remaining there for about 11 years.<ref name=odnb/> Few details of his studies are extant. It appears that he supported himself during his advance studies by taking students of his own, including two sons of [[Josceline de Bohon]], a long-serving [[Bishop of Salisbury]].\n\nIt was probably during his student years that he composed a number of Latin [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]]s after the manner of the [[Goliard]]s, some of which were preserved in the ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' collection. He also wrote ''Vacillantis trutine libramine''.<ref>William Doremus Paden - Medieval lyric: genres in historical context - Page 112 2000 - \"Peter of Blois, \"Vacillantis trutine,\" ed. Peter Dronke, The Medieval Poet and His World (Rome: Storia e Letteratura, 1984), 298-300. la Vacillantis trutine libramine mens suspensa fluctuat et estuat, in tumultus anxios dum se vertit et bipertit ...\"</ref>\n\n==The Sicilian adventure==\n[[File:Dedication mosaic - Cathedral of Monreale - Italy 2015 (crop).JPG|thumb|left|Peter's pupil, William II, depicted offering [[Monreale Cathedral]] to the [[Virgin Mary]].]]\n\nIn 1166 the regent of Sicily, [[Margaret of Navarre]], a relative of the [[Lords, counts and dukes of Perche#Counts of Perche|Counts of Perche]], wrote to her relatives in France, particularly [[Rotrou (archbishop of Rouen)|Rotrou, the Archbishop of Rouen]], to ask for help during the minority of her son, [[William II of Sicily|William II]].<ref name=odnb/> Peter of Blois and his brother Guillaume arrived in Sicily in September of that year, as part of a French party of 37 that included [[Stephen du Perche]] and [[Walter of the Mill]]. Peter became tutor to the young king, guardian of the royal [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] and a key adviser to Queen Margaret,<ref name=cath /> while Guillaume was appointed [[abbot]] of a monastery near [[Maletto]].<ref name=odnb/> However, the French clique around the regency proved unpopular with the Sicilian nobility. A revolt against French domination forced Stephen to resign the [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellorship]] and the [[Archbishopric of Palermo]] in 1169. Peter left the island to seek opportunities elsewhere, sailing initially to [[Genoa]] and then travelling back to France.\n\nThere his connection with Archbishop Rotrou proved useful, drawing him into a letter-writing campaign focussed on [[Henry II of England]]'s conflict with [[Thomas Becket]]. This brought him back into contact with [[Reginald Fitz Jocelin]], his former pupil from his days in Paris, who was now Henry's chief agent in the dispute. When Reginald was made [[Bishop of Bath]] in 1173, his role in the Becket affair made papal approval problematic and Peter's letters on his behalf proved helpful in rallying support.\n\n==Angevin service==\n[[File:Eleonora Jindra2.jpg|thumb|left|Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine holding court.]]\n[[File:Henry the Young King.jpg|thumb|The Young King Henry, whose rebellion against his father signalled a rupture in the Angevin dynasty.]]\n\n===Diplomat and apologist===\nAround 1173, Peter went to England to take up a post as chief letter-writer for [[Richard of Dover]], Becket's successor as [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]]. He also entered the service of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], acting as a diplomat in his negotiations with [[Louis VII of France]] and the [[Papacy]]. His arrival in England approximately coincided with the rupture of the ruling family and the eruption of civil strife all over the [[Angevin Empire]], carefully fomented by the French monarchy. Peter wrote an open letter to the Queen, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], to \"deplore publicly and regretfully that, while you are a most prudent woman, you have left your husband.\"<ref>M. Markowski (introduction and translation).

He wrote in praise of him to continental contacts, like Walter of the Mill, now Archbishop of Palermo, defending him against the charge that he had deliberately instigated the murder of Thomas Becket.<ref>Scott McLetchie (translator). [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1177peterblois-hen2.asp ''Peter of Blois: Description of Henry II''], at Internet History Sourcebooks Project</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba01pete#page/192/mode/2up Giles, Volume 1, p.192-7]</ref> In introducing the subject of Becket's death, Peter mentioned in passing his own [[clergy|clerical order]]: ''in verbo Domini et in ordine diaconi vobis dico'' \u2013 \u201cin the Word of God and the order of deacon I speak to you.\u201d<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba01pete#page/196/mode/2up Giles, Volume 1, p.196]</ref> At some stage in his education, he had been [[Holy orders|ordained]] a [[deacon]] and he seems to have avoided ordination to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]].\n\nIn 1176 Peter was appointed [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|Chancellor]] of the [[Archdiocese of Canterbury]], the chief record keeper and [[Latin]] secretary, serving Richard of Dover. Probably in the same year, he was appointed [[Archdeacon of Bath]],<ref name=cath/> a position he held until his death. It was probably in Henry's reign that he was appointed [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of the [[St. Peter's Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton|College of Wolverhampton]], which he found corrupt.<ref name=staffs1>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=37876 |title=Colleges: Wolverhampton, St Peter |author=M W Greenslade, R B Pugh (Editors)|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nPeter was in Rome in 1179 and there displayed the improvidence which was to become an important feature of his later life. His failure to repay a debt caused [[Pope Alexander III]] to write to the Archbishop on behalf of the creditor. This was a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' sufficient for inclusion in a compendium of [[canon law]] issued in 1234 by [[Pope Gregory IX]].<ref>[http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost13/GregoriusIX/gre_3t22.html ''Decretalium Gregorii papae IX compilationis liber III Titulus XXII:De fideiussoribus, Capitulum III''] at Bibliotheca Augustana, accessed 29 September 2014</ref> Richard of Dover died in 1184 and, after some delay, the king succeeded in getting Baldwin of Forde, Peter's friend and tutor from his Bologna days, installed as Archbishop of Canterbury. He confirmed Peter in his position as letter writer but also made him his chief legal adviser.\n\n===The Canterbury Cathedral chapter controversy===\nBaldwin soon created a legal storm that was to engulf Peter, threatening his career. He was determined to reform the diocese thoroughly, making it function more efficiently as a base for his position as one of the chief magnates of the realm. He saw the [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] as a major obstacle. Like most cathedral establishments, it had consisted of [[secular clergy]] until the [[Norman Conquest]], after which it was reconstituted as a community of [[Benedictine]] monks, known variously as the Priory of the Holy Trinity or Christchurch.<ref name=kent/> The mutual antagonism was sharpened by the rivalry between their respective [[Monasticism|monastic orders]], as Baldwin was a [[Cistercian]]. He began by recovering diocesan property which his predecessor had alienated to the priory in order to support the pilgrim traffic, centred on the shrine of Thomas Becket, as well as confiscating the ''xenia'', or Easter offerings \u2013 a process which was authorised by [[Pope Lucius III]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n206/mode/2up Stubbs, p.4]</ref> However, the monks of the chapter were soon complaining to his successor, Urban III, that his reforms were going too far and succeeded in getting the Pope to order restoration of some of the confiscated churches. Urban initially welcomed some aspects of Baldwin's overarching plan to move the chapter to [[Hackington]], north of Canterbury, and to build a second base for the diocese at [[Lambeth]], directly facing the centres of secular power in London and Westminster.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n132/mode/2up Stubbs, p.cxxii]</ref> However, the plan unfolded to include the replacement of the monastic chapter with a new episcopal staff, consisting of [[College (canon law)|colleges]] of secular clergy at Hackington and Lambeth.\n\nSeeing their influence and wealth slipping from their grasp, the Canterbury monks appealed to both the king and to Rome. Baldwin suspended the [[prior]] in December 1186 and the monks immediately began a letter-writing campaign to mobilise bishops, archbishops, even [[Philip II of France]], in their cause. Peter of Blois was despatched to the papal court at [[Verona]] to counter the chapter's arguments, which were presented by a skilled Roman lawyer called Pillius.<ref name=odnb/> As Urban was his old law teacher, he could be expected to have at least insight, and probably influence. However, his enjoyment of Roman law had always been aesthetic rather than technical.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Peter of Blois and the Popes\">\nFile:B-Alexander_III1.jpg|[[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u201381), who complained to Archbishop Richard about Peter's failure to pay his debts.\nFile:Pope_Lucius_III.png|[[Pope Lucius III]] (1181\u201385), who gave initial papal support to Baldwin's reforms.\nFile:B Urban III.jpg|[[Pope Urban III]] (1185\u201387), who, as Umberto Crivelli, was Peter's master at the University of Bologna, and who later heard him argue against the appeal of the Canterbury Cathedral chapter.\nFile:B_Gregor_VIII.jpg|[[Pope Gregory VIII]] (1187), who succeeded Urban III but survived for only two months, leaving the Canterbury priory appeal unresolved..\nFile:A08_CLEMENTE_III.jpg|[[Pope Clement III]] (1187\u201391), who finally found against Archbishop Baldwin, severely damaging Peter's reputation as a lawyer.\nFile:Innozenz3.jpg|[[Pope Innocent III]] (1198-1216), who authorised Peter's abortive attempts to purge the church at Wolverhampton.\nFile:PopeGregoryIX.jpg|[[Pope Gregory IX]] (1227\u201341), whose codification of canon law mentions Peter in its clampdown on clerical indebtedness.\n</gallery>\n\nOn 1 March 1187, before Peter's arrival, the Pope ordered Baldwin to lift the suspension of Prior Honorius, who had already reached Verona.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n224/mode/2up Stubbs, p.23]</ref> Peter arrived at Verona a few days later to find the Pope had adjourned the case until 10 April, giving Peter no chance to plead formally while a further series of decrees was issued in the monks' favour. However, Peter was no more successful in open court, suffering a continuing series of defeats. On 9 May the Pope ordered Archbishop Baldwin to cease building his new church at Hackington, abolished the fraternity he had established to staff and support it, and expressed surprise that he had so far resisted restoration of the situation to that prevailing before the appeal.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n236/mode/2up Stubbs, p.34-6]</ref> Peter remained at Verona, arguing the case, until October, and then followed the papal court to [[Ferrara]]. Provocative behaviour back home did not help Peter. Baldwin continued to build his church in defiance of the Pope but with the king's support,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n256/mode/2up Stubbs, p.54]</ref> although he did move the site some distance to the west, hurriedly putting up a wooden chapel in St Dunstan's parish.<ref name=kent>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38189 |title=Houses of Benedictine monks: The cathedral priory of the Holy Trinity or Christ Church, Canterbury |editor=Willam Page |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |date=1926 |work=A History of the County of Kent: Volume 2 |accessdate=2 October 2014 }}</ref> In August he seized the chapter's [[manor]]s, suspending and even [[excommunicating]] its members as he saw fit.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n280/mode/2up Stubbs, p.78]</ref>\n\nOn 3 October, having reached Ferrara, the Pope raised the stakes by ordering Baldwin actually to demolish his new headquarters, to desecrate the site and to suspend its clergy, to restore all members of the existing chapter to office and to refrain from further actions against them while the case continued. He was given 30 days to comply.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n302/mode/2up Stubbs, p.101-2]</ref> [[R. W. Southern]] alleges that Peter made a last, personal appeal to his old teacher while riding from Verona to Ferrara, and that the Pope was so incensed by the attempt to circumvent legal procedure that he died the following day of a heart attack.<ref name=odnb/> Kingsford's account is much less dramatic, without the foreshortened time scheme. The Pope's letter from Ferrara seems to have preceded his death by some weeks: he died on 19 October and was buried on the 20th, while [[Pope Gregory VIII]] was elected on 21 October, as Honorius reported to his monks.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n308/mode/2up Stubbs, p.106]</ref> Peter's own later account of Urban's death has him taken ill while changing horses, shortly after Peter had approached him, but also mentions he contracted [[dysentery]] on the journey from Verona<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n758/mode/2up Stubbs, p.556]</ref> \u2013 an entirely plausible cause of death. The new pope moved the court to [[Pisa]] on its way towards Rome. He seems to have been less sympathetic to the Cathedral chapter<ref name=kent/> but made no further decisions before he died at Pisa in December and was succeeded by [[Pope Clement III]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\nThe delays could only postpone Peter's inevitable defeat. Baldwin used the breathing space to renew his campaign of suspension and excommunication against his opponents,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n146/mode/2up Stubbs, p.cxxxvii]</ref> while Honorius, like Peter, remained at the papal court, as he had been ordered to return there by the chapter. However, on 26 January 1188, Clement made a final decision on the matter, which he communicated in a letter to Baldwin.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n376/mode/2up Stubbs, p.174]</ref> He rebuked the archbishop for his lack of moderation, which tended to undermine the dignity of his office, and for his disobedience, before repeating all of Urban's demands: the new [[collegiate church]] was forbidden and the previous situation was to be restored. Baldwin continued his vindictive campaign against the monks, who were imprisoned in their own priory at the cathedral until August 1189,<ref name=kent/> a month after the death of Henry II, when [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] imposed a resolution.\n\nHowever, Peter's legal advocacy had suffered a comprehensive defeat, with serious consequences for his reputation. He returned to England. In his later accounts of the issue, he ignored the political and economic issues, portraying it entirely as a failed attempt to remedy the moral abuses of the Canterbury Cathedral chapter.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n756/mode/2up Stubbs, p.555]</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n===On crusade===\n[[File:Seal - Richard I of England.jpg|thumb|King Richard I's Great Seal of 1189. Exhibited in History Museum of Vendee.]]\nAfter Henry's death in 1189, Peter seems to have dropped out of favour<ref name=cath/> \u2013 perhaps not surprisingly, in view of his outspoken support for the old king. He devoted his energy to propaganda in favour of a [[Third Crusade|new crusade]] to rescue the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] after the [[Battle of Hattin]],<ref name=odnb/> and to writing a biography of the crusader [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]].\n\nTrue to his beliefs, he and Archbishop Baldwin set out for the [[Holy Land]] late in 1189, accompanying King Richard as far as Sicily. They pressed on to join the crusaders at [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], where Baldwin died on 20 November 1190. Peter found his way back to Sicily. He then probably accompanied Eleanor of Aquitaine on the return journey through Italy and France, finally arriving in England in autumn 1191.\n\n===Continuing influence and financial difficulties===\nPeter seems to have repaired relations with Eleanor of Aquitaine. Both Br\u00e9hier<ref name=cath/> and Kingsford<ref name=dnb/> describe Peter as her secretary during the early 1190s. However, Southern merely mentions the three letters he wrote in her name to the Pope protesting against Richard I's detention by [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]].<ref name=odnb/> Southern categorically denies that he was an employee of Eleanor.\n\nWhen [[Hubert Walter]] emerged as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1193, Peter was no longer retained in any formal capacity by the archdiocese, although he was still consulted. He tried to repair relations with the cathedral chapter, claiming Henry II had compelled him to act as he did and that he had been cruelly deceived<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba02pete#page/232/mode/2up Giles, letter 238, vol. 2, p.232]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n536/mode/2up Stubbs, p.355]</ref> \u2013 a claim that probably met with incredulity. He also continued to exercise considerable influence over other leading churchmen.\n\nMatters eased slightly after Richard's death and both his influence and material fortunes seem to have revived in the early years of [[John, King of England|John]]'s reign. He was appointed [[Archdeacon of London]] by 1202. However, despite still holding a number of potentially lucrative posts, he seems always to have been in financial difficulties. He protested in a letter to [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] some time around 1200 that his income from his archdiaconate barely met his basic expenses.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba02pete#page/n97/mode/2up Giles Volume 2, p.84-86]</ref>\n\n===The Wolverhampton college affair===\nAlthough he had probably been dean of Wolverhampton for some time, very likely since the reign of Henry II,<ref name=staffs1/> the oldest extant evidence of his interest in the collegiate church dates from about 1190. He wrote to [[William Longchamp]], the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor of England]] and [[Bishop of Ely]] to denounce the \u201ctyranny of the Viscount of Stafford\u201d<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba01pete#page/340/mode/2up Giles, Volume 1, p.340]</ref> \u2013 presumably the [[Sheriff of Staffordshire]] \u2013 who was, he complained, trampling on the church's ancient privileges and oppressing the townspeople. This is fairly reliably datable, as Longchamp's ascendancy was short-lived, and he was forced to flee the country in 1191.<ref name=staffs1/> Moreover the sheriff at the time was [[Hugh Nonant]], who was actually the [[Bishop of Lichfield|Bishop of Coventry]], ally of the regent John and a sworn enemy of Longchamp.\n\nIt is probable that decreased political involvement gave Peter more opportunity to take an interest in the affairs of the town and the collegiate church. Moreover, he was taking increasing interest in the spiritual life, particularly of the Cistercians and [[Carthusians]]. Peter resolved to deal with what he saw as the venality and nepotism of the canons at Wolverhampton. One of the canons who particularly offended him was [[Robert of Shrewsbury]], who became [[Bishop of Bangor]] in 1197,<ref name=staffs1/> apparently without election, and certainly without resigning his [[prebend]] at Wolverhampton. Peter wrote directly to Robert,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba02pete#page/n87/mode/2up Giles, Volume 2, p.74]</ref> denouncing his behaviour in strong terms and commending the virtue of apostolic poverty \u2013 ironically, in view of his own notorious [[Benefice#Pluralism|pluralism]].\n\nPeter resigned as dean around 1202, and explained the situation in a letter to Innocent III. He claimed that the church was subject only to the archbishop and the king, under the Pope:<ref name=Giles2-87>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba02pete#page/n99/mode/2up Giles, Volume 2, p.87]</ref> later deans were to seek freedom from the archbishop too, with some success.<ref name=staffs1/> He claimed that the indiscipline of the canons was such that it brought forth hissing and derision from the entire population.<ref name=Giles2-87/> The solution he proposed was to replace the institution with a [[Cistercian]] abbey.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba02pete#page/n101/mode/2up Giles, Volume 2, p.89]</ref> Peter had already put forward the plan to Hubert Walter and won his and John's support for it. Walter dissolved the college and, with Papal approval, John handed over the deanery and prebends to him in January 1203, in preparation for the new venture.<ref name=staffs1/> A year later, the king granted a [[charter]] of liberties for the abbey and endowed it with properties, including the [[manor]]s of Wolverhampton and [[Tettenhall]]. Cistercian monks had already begun to move into the site, although John had appointed one Nicholas as dean on Peter's resignation. However, with the death of Hubert Walter in 1205, the entire project lapsed and John appointed as dean Henry, son of [[Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex]].\n\n==Writings==\nPeter is incorrectly associated with [[Pseudo-Ingulf]]'s ''[[Croyland Chronicle]]''. However, many of his letters and poems are extant. According to Southern, Peter's letters were widely read until the seventeenth century, \"for pleasure and instruction by cultivated readers\". They conveyed \"moral, legal and theological instruction, and ... satire on men and institutions\".<ref>Southern, R. W. ''The Making of the Middle Ages'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1953) {{ISBN|0-300-00230-0}} pp. 213-214</ref> He was the author of a number of controversial works of varying lengths.\n\nAt some time in the 1190s, for example, he wrote ''Against the Perfidy of the Jews'' ({{lang-lat|Contra perfidiam Judaeorum}}), which Peter commended in a preface to a [[Bishop of Worcester]], probably [[John of Coutances]].<ref>[https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/1198peterblois-jews.asp \"A treatise addressed to John Bishop of Worcester, probably John of Coutances who held that See, 1194-8.\"] Medieval Sourcebook: Peter of Blois: Against the Perfidy of the Jews, before 1198</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba03pete#page/62/mode/2up Giles, Volume 3, p.62-65]</ref> A strongly anti-Semitic work, it is largely a marshalling of arguments, ostensibly from Scripture, in favour of the Doctrine of the [[Trinity]] and other specifically Christian teachings, intended as a handbook of argumentation. However, he held out no hope of conversion: \"Their hour is not yet come, but He has blinded them till the time when the heathen are converted.\" Commenting on the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], he denounced the Jews as \"persisting in their malice\".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba03pete#page/94/mode/2up Giles, Volume 3, p.94]</ref>\n\n''Against the Perfidy of the Jews'' influenced official texts.

He is particularly noted for his corpus of [[Latin]] letters.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Baldwinofexeterstatuecanterburycatheraloutside.jpg|thumb|Baldwin of Forde, Peter's tutor and friend, as depicted on the exterior of Canterbury Cathedral.]]\n\nPeter of Blois was born about 1130. Earlier opinion tended to place the date later in the 1130s,<ref name=dnb/> but an earlier date is now considered more likely.<ref name=odnb/> His family were minor nobility of [[Brittany|Breton]] origin.\n\nAfter an early visit to Paris, Peter received his literary education at the school attached to [[Tours Cathedral]] in the early 1140s probably accompanied and mentored by an older namesake and relative, Pierre de Blois.<ref name=odnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22012?docPos=1 Southern, ODNB]</ref> He studied under [[Bernard Silvestris]], who, he later recalled, urged him to \u201ctake up in truth not fables, but history\u201d<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba01pete#page/316/mode/2up Giles, letter 101, vol. 1, p.317]</ref> and made him memorise the letters of [[Hildebert]], a former [[Archbishop of Tours]]. It has been thought Peter also studied under the English philosopher and [[theology|theologian]] [[John of Salisbury]],<ref name=cath>{{Catholic|prescript=|wstitle=Peter de Blois}}</ref> but this is now generally discounted.<ref name=dnb>{{cite DNB |no-icon=1 |wstitle=Peter of Blois |last=Kingsford |first=Charles Lethbridge |volume=45}}</ref>\n\nPeter then studied [[Roman law]] at the [[University of Bologna]], a centre for legal studies. Here he was tutored by [[Baldwin of Forde]], a future [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and both studied under Umberto Crivelli, the future Pope [[Pope Urban III]].<ref name=odnb/> Peter was much more strongly attracted to the rhetorical and literary aspects of the subject than to jurisprudence: as he wrote later, \u201csporting with its glorious verbal trappings and charming, fanciful oratorical urbanity, attracted me powerfully and intoxicated my mind.\u201d<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba01pete#page/94/mode/2up Giles, letter 26, vol. 1, p.95]</ref>\n\nAround 1155 Peter went to study [[theology]] in Paris, remaining there for about 11 years.<ref name=odnb/> Few details of his studies are extant. It appears that he supported himself during his advance studies by taking students of his own, including two sons of [[Josceline de Bohon]], a long-serving [[Bishop of Salisbury]].\n\nIt was probably during his student years that he composed a number of Latin [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]]s after the manner of the [[Goliard]]s, some of which were preserved in the ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' collection. He also wrote ''Vacillantis trutine libramine''.<ref>William Doremus Paden - Medieval lyric: genres in historical context - Page 112 2000 - \"Peter of Blois, \"Vacillantis trutine,\" ed.

Peter became tutor to the young king, guardian of the royal [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] and a key adviser to Queen Margaret,<ref name=cath /> while Guillaume was appointed [[abbot]] of a monastery near [[Maletto]].<ref name=odnb/> However, the French clique around the regency proved unpopular with the Sicilian nobility. A revolt against French domination forced Stephen to resign the [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellorship]] and the [[Archbishopric of Palermo]] in 1169. Peter left the island to seek opportunities elsewhere, sailing initially to [[Genoa]] and then travelling back to France.\n\nThere his connection with Archbishop Rotrou proved useful, drawing him into a letter-writing campaign focussed on [[Henry II of England]]'s conflict with [[Thomas Becket]]. This brought him back into contact with [[Reginald Fitz Jocelin]], his former pupil from his days in Paris, who was now Henry's chief agent in the dispute. When Reginald was made [[Bishop of Bath]] in 1173, his role in the Becket affair made papal approval problematic and Peter's letters on his behalf proved helpful in rallying support.\n\n==Angevin service==\n[[File:Eleonora Jindra2.jpg|thumb|left|Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine holding court.]]\n[[File:Henry the Young King.jpg|thumb|The Young King Henry, whose rebellion against his father signalled a rupture in the Angevin dynasty.]]\n\n===Diplomat and apologist===\nAround 1173, Peter went to England to take up a post as chief letter-writer for [[Richard of Dover]], Becket's successor as [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]]. He also entered the service of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], acting as a diplomat in his negotiations with [[Louis VII of France]] and the [[Papacy]]. His arrival in England approximately coincided with the rupture of the ruling family and the eruption of civil strife all over the [[Angevin Empire]], carefully fomented by the French monarchy. Peter wrote an open letter to the Queen, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], to \"deplore publicly and regretfully that, while you are a most prudent woman, you have left your husband.\"<ref>M. Markowski (introduction and translation).

He wrote in praise of him to continental contacts, like Walter of the Mill, now Archbishop of Palermo, defending him against the charge that he had deliberately instigated the murder of Thomas Becket.<ref>Scott McLetchie (translator). [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1177peterblois-hen2.asp ''Peter of Blois: Description of Henry II''], at Internet History Sourcebooks Project</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba01pete#page/192/mode/2up Giles, Volume 1, p.192-7]</ref> In introducing the subject of Becket's death, Peter mentioned in passing his own [[clergy|clerical order]]: ''in verbo Domini et in ordine diaconi vobis dico'' \u2013 \u201cin the Word of God and the order of deacon I speak to you.\u201d<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba01pete#page/196/mode/2up Giles, Volume 1, p.196]</ref> At some stage in his education, he had been [[Holy orders|ordained]] a [[deacon]] and he seems to have avoided ordination to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]].\n\nIn 1176 Peter was appointed [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|Chancellor]] of the [[Archdiocese of Canterbury]], the chief record keeper and [[Latin]] secretary, serving Richard of Dover. Probably in the same year, he was appointed [[Archdeacon of Bath]],<ref name=cath/> a position he held until his death. It was probably in Henry's reign that he was appointed [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of the [[St. Peter's Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton|College of Wolverhampton]], which he found corrupt.<ref name=staffs1>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=37876 |title=Colleges: Wolverhampton, St Peter |author=M W Greenslade, R B Pugh (Editors)|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nPeter was in Rome in 1179 and there displayed the improvidence which was to become an important feature of his later life. His failure to repay a debt caused [[Pope Alexander III]] to write to the Archbishop on behalf of the creditor. This was a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' sufficient for inclusion in a compendium of [[canon law]] issued in 1234 by [[Pope Gregory IX]].<ref>[http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost13/GregoriusIX/gre_3t22.html ''Decretalium Gregorii papae IX compilationis liber III Titulus XXII:De fideiussoribus, Capitulum III''] at Bibliotheca Augustana, accessed 29 September 2014</ref> Richard of Dover died in 1184 and, after some delay, the king succeeded in getting Baldwin of Forde, Peter's friend and tutor from his Bologna days, installed as Archbishop of Canterbury. He confirmed Peter in his position as letter writer but also made him his chief legal adviser.\n\n===The Canterbury Cathedral chapter controversy===\nBaldwin soon created a legal storm that was to engulf Peter, threatening his career. He was determined to reform the diocese thoroughly, making it function more efficiently as a base for his position as one of the chief magnates of the realm. He saw the [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] as a major obstacle. Like most cathedral establishments, it had consisted of [[secular clergy]] until the [[Norman Conquest]], after which it was reconstituted as a community of [[Benedictine]] monks, known variously as the Priory of the Holy Trinity or Christchurch.<ref name=kent/> The mutual antagonism was sharpened by the rivalry between their respective [[Monasticism|monastic orders]], as Baldwin was a [[Cistercian]]. He began by recovering diocesan property which his predecessor had alienated to the priory in order to support the pilgrim traffic, centred on the shrine of Thomas Becket, as well as confiscating the ''xenia'', or Easter offerings \u2013 a process which was authorised by [[Pope Lucius III]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n206/mode/2up Stubbs, p.4]</ref> However, the monks of the chapter were soon complaining to his successor, Urban III, that his reforms were going too far and succeeded in getting the Pope to order restoration of some of the confiscated churches. Urban initially welcomed some aspects of Baldwin's overarching plan to move the chapter to [[Hackington]], north of Canterbury, and to build a second base for the diocese at [[Lambeth]], directly facing the centres of secular power in London and Westminster.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n132/mode/2up Stubbs, p.cxxii]</ref> However, the plan unfolded to include the replacement of the monastic chapter with a new episcopal staff, consisting of [[College (canon law)|colleges]] of secular clergy at Hackington and Lambeth.\n\nSeeing their influence and wealth slipping from their grasp, the Canterbury monks appealed to both the king and to Rome. Baldwin suspended the [[prior]] in December 1186 and the monks immediately began a letter-writing campaign to mobilise bishops, archbishops, even [[Philip II of France]], in their cause. Peter of Blois was despatched to the papal court at [[Verona]] to counter the chapter's arguments, which were presented by a skilled Roman lawyer called Pillius.<ref name=odnb/> As Urban was his old law teacher, he could be expected to have at least insight, and probably influence. However, his enjoyment of Roman law had always been aesthetic rather than technical.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Peter of Blois and the Popes\">\nFile:B-Alexander_III1.jpg|[[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u201381), who complained to Archbishop Richard about Peter's failure to pay his debts.\nFile:Pope_Lucius_III.png|[[Pope Lucius III]] (1181\u201385), who gave initial papal support to Baldwin's reforms.\nFile:B Urban III.jpg|[[Pope Urban III]] (1185\u201387), who, as Umberto Crivelli, was Peter's master at the University of Bologna, and who later heard him argue against the appeal of the Canterbury Cathedral chapter.\nFile:B_Gregor_VIII.jpg|[[Pope Gregory VIII]] (1187), who succeeded Urban III but survived for only two months, leaving the Canterbury priory appeal unresolved..\nFile:A08_CLEMENTE_III.jpg|[[Pope Clement III]] (1187\u201391), who finally found against Archbishop Baldwin, severely damaging Peter's reputation as a lawyer.\nFile:Innozenz3.jpg|[[Pope Innocent III]] (1198-1216), who authorised Peter's abortive attempts to purge the church at Wolverhampton.\nFile:PopeGregoryIX.jpg|[[Pope Gregory IX]] (1227\u201341), whose codification of canon law mentions Peter in its clampdown on clerical indebtedness.\n</gallery>\n\nOn 1 March 1187, before Peter's arrival, the Pope ordered Baldwin to lift the suspension of Prior Honorius, who had already reached Verona.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n224/mode/2up Stubbs, p.23]</ref> Peter arrived at Verona a few days later to find the Pope had adjourned the case until 10 April, giving Peter no chance to plead formally while a further series of decrees was issued in the monks' favour. However, Peter was no more successful in open court, suffering a continuing series of defeats. On 9 May the Pope ordered Archbishop Baldwin to cease building his new church at Hackington, abolished the fraternity he had established to staff and support it, and expressed surprise that he had so far resisted restoration of the situation to that prevailing before the appeal.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n236/mode/2up Stubbs, p.34-6]</ref> Peter remained at Verona, arguing the case, until October, and then followed the papal court to [[Ferrara]]. Provocative behaviour back home did not help Peter. Baldwin continued to build his church in defiance of the Pope but with the king's support,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n256/mode/2up Stubbs, p.54]</ref> although he did move the site some distance to the west, hurriedly putting up a wooden chapel in St Dunstan's parish.<ref name=kent>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38189 |title=Houses of Benedictine monks: The cathedral priory of the Holy Trinity or Christ Church, Canterbury |editor=Willam Page |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |date=1926 |work=A History of the County of Kent: Volume 2 |accessdate=2 October 2014 }}</ref> In August he seized the chapter's [[manor]]s, suspending and even [[excommunicating]] its members as he saw fit.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n280/mode/2up Stubbs, p.78]</ref>\n\nOn 3 October, having reached Ferrara, the Pope raised the stakes by ordering Baldwin actually to demolish his new headquarters, to desecrate the site and to suspend its clergy, to restore all members of the existing chapter to office and to refrain from further actions against them while the case continued. He was given 30 days to comply.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n302/mode/2up Stubbs, p.101-2]</ref> [[R. W. Southern]] alleges that Peter made a last, personal appeal to his old teacher while riding from Verona to Ferrara, and that the Pope was so incensed by the attempt to circumvent legal procedure that he died the following day of a heart attack.<ref name=odnb/> Kingsford's account is much less dramatic, without the foreshortened time scheme. The Pope's letter from Ferrara seems to have preceded his death by some weeks: he died on 19 October and was buried on the 20th, while [[Pope Gregory VIII]] was elected on 21 October, as Honorius reported to his monks.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n308/mode/2up Stubbs, p.106]</ref> Peter's own later account of Urban's death has him taken ill while changing horses, shortly after Peter had approached him, but also mentions he contracted [[dysentery]] on the journey from Verona<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n758/mode/2up Stubbs, p.556]</ref> \u2013 an entirely plausible cause of death. The new pope moved the court to [[Pisa]] on its way towards Rome. He seems to have been less sympathetic to the Cathedral chapter<ref name=kent/> but made no further decisions before he died at Pisa in December and was succeeded by [[Pope Clement III]].<ref name=odnb/>\n\nThe delays could only postpone Peter's inevitable defeat. Baldwin used the breathing space to renew his campaign of suspension and excommunication against his opponents,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n146/mode/2up Stubbs, p.cxxxvii]</ref> while Honorius, like Peter, remained at the papal court, as he had been ordered to return there by the chapter. However, on 26 January 1188, Clement made a final decision on the matter, which he communicated in a letter to Baldwin.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n376/mode/2up Stubbs, p.174]</ref> He rebuked the archbishop for his lack of moderation, which tended to undermine the dignity of his office, and for his disobedience, before repeating all of Urban's demands: the new [[collegiate church]] was forbidden and the previous situation was to be restored. Baldwin continued his vindictive campaign against the monks, who were imprisoned in their own priory at the cathedral until August 1189,<ref name=kent/> a month after the death of Henry II, when [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] imposed a resolution.\n\nHowever, Peter's legal advocacy had suffered a comprehensive defeat, with serious consequences for his reputation. He returned to England. In his later accounts of the issue, he ignored the political and economic issues, portraying it entirely as a failed attempt to remedy the moral abuses of the Canterbury Cathedral chapter.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n756/mode/2up Stubbs, p.555]</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n===On crusade===\n[[File:Seal - Richard I of England.jpg|thumb|King Richard I's Great Seal of 1189. Exhibited in History Museum of Vendee.]]\nAfter Henry's death in 1189, Peter seems to have dropped out of favour<ref name=cath/> \u2013 perhaps not surprisingly, in view of his outspoken support for the old king. He devoted his energy to propaganda in favour of a [[Third Crusade|new crusade]] to rescue the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] after the [[Battle of Hattin]],<ref name=odnb/> and to writing a biography of the crusader [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]].\n\nTrue to his beliefs, he and Archbishop Baldwin set out for the [[Holy Land]] late in 1189, accompanying King Richard as far as Sicily. They pressed on to join the crusaders at [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], where Baldwin died on 20 November 1190. Peter found his way back to Sicily. He then probably accompanied Eleanor of Aquitaine on the return journey through Italy and France, finally arriving in England in autumn 1191.\n\n===Continuing influence and financial difficulties===\nPeter seems to have repaired relations with Eleanor of Aquitaine. Both Br\u00e9hier<ref name=cath/> and Kingsford<ref name=dnb/> describe Peter as her secretary during the early 1190s. However, Southern merely mentions the three letters he wrote in her name to the Pope protesting against Richard I's detention by [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]].<ref name=odnb/> Southern categorically denies that he was an employee of Eleanor.\n\nWhen [[Hubert Walter]] emerged as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1193, Peter was no longer retained in any formal capacity by the archdiocese, although he was still consulted. He tried to repair relations with the cathedral chapter, claiming Henry II had compelled him to act as he did and that he had been cruelly deceived<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba02pete#page/232/mode/2up Giles, letter 238, vol. 2, p.232]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/epistolaecantua00stubgoog#page/n536/mode/2up Stubbs, p.355]</ref> \u2013 a claim that probably met with incredulity. He also continued to exercise considerable influence over other leading churchmen.\n\nMatters eased slightly after Richard's death and both his influence and material fortunes seem to have revived in the early years of [[John, King of England|John]]'s reign. He was appointed [[Archdeacon of London]] by 1202. However, despite still holding a number of potentially lucrative posts, he seems always to have been in financial difficulties. He protested in a letter to [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] some time around 1200 that his income from his archdiaconate barely met his basic expenses.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba02pete#page/n97/mode/2up Giles Volume 2, p.84-86]</ref>\n\n===The Wolverhampton college affair===\nAlthough he had probably been dean of Wolverhampton for some time \u2013 very likely since the reign of Henry II,<ref name=staffs1/> the oldest extant evidence of his interest in the collegiate church dates from about 1190. He wrote to [[William Longchamp]], the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor of England]] and [[Bishop of Ely]] to denounce the \u201ctyranny of the Viscount of Stafford\u201d<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba01pete#page/340/mode/2up Giles, Volume 1, p.340]</ref> \u2013 presumably the [[Sheriff of Staffordshire]] \u2013 who was, he complained, trampling on the church's ancient privileges and oppressing the townspeople. This is fairly reliably datable, as Longchamp's ascendancy was short-lived, and he was forced to flee the country in 1191.<ref name=staffs1/> Moreover the sheriff at the time was [[Hugh Nonant]], who was actually the [[Bishop of Lichfield|Bishop of Coventry]], ally of the regent John and a sworn enemy of Longchamp.\n\nIt is probable that decreased political involvement gave Peter more opportunity to take an interest in the affairs of the town and the collegiate church. Moreover, he was taking increasing interest in the spiritual life, particularly of the Cistercians and [[Carthusians]]. Peter resolved to deal with what he saw as the venality and nepotism of the canons at Wolverhampton. One of the canons who particularly offended him was [[Robert of Shrewsbury]], who became [[Bishop of Bangor]] in 1197,<ref name=staffs1/> apparently without election, and certainly without resigning his [[prebend]] at Wolverhampton. Peter wrote directly to Robert,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba02pete#page/n87/mode/2up Giles, Volume 2, p.74]</ref> denouncing his behaviour in strong terms and commending the virtues of apostolic poverty \u2013 ironically, in view of his own notorious [[Benefice#Pluralism|pluralism]].\n\nPeter resigned as dean around 1202, and explained the situation in a letter to Innocent III. He claimed that the church was subject only to the archbishop and the king, under the Pope:<ref name=Giles2-87>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba02pete#page/n99/mode/2up Giles, Volume 2, p.87]</ref> later deans were to seek freedom from the archbishop too, with some success.<ref name=staffs1/> He claimed that the indiscipline of the canons was such that it brought forth hissing and derision from the entire population.<ref name=Giles2-87/> The solution he proposed was to replace the institution with a [[Cistercian]] abbey.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/petriblesensisba02pete#page/n101/mode/2up Giles, Volume 2, p.89]</ref> Peter had already put forward the plan to Hubert Walter and won his and John's support for it. Walter dissolved the college and, with Papal approval, John handed over the deanery and prebends to him in January 1203, in preparation for the new venture.<ref name=staffs1/> A year later, the king granted a [[charter]] of liberties for the abbey and endowed it with properties, including the [[manor]]s of Wolverhampton and [[Tettenhall]]. Cistercian monks had already begun to move into the site, although John had appointed one Nicholas as dean on Peter's resignation. However, with the death of Hubert Walter in 1205, the entire project lapsed and John appointed as dean Henry, son of [[Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex]].\n\n==Writings==\nPeter is incorrectly associated with [[Pseudo-Ingulf]]'s ''[[Croyland Chronicle]]''. However, many of his letters and poems are extant. According to Southern, Peter's letters were widely read until the seventeenth century, \"for pleasure and instruction by cultivated readers\".

It was filmed on location at [[Greenwich]] and the ''EastEnders'' [[Albert Square]] set, situated at [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]]. It features several of the ''EastEnders'' stars of the time. Produced for the ''[[Children in Need]]'' charity, following ''Doctor Who'''s hiatus in 1989 this special was the only dramatisation broadcast in celebration of the show's 30th anniversary.\n\nThe special over the years has been panned by the ''Doctor Who Fanbase'' and is no longer considered to be canon in the main continuity.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]] has opened a hole in time, allowing her access to the Doctor's timeline. She uses this to cycle through the Doctor's lives, causing him and his companions to jump back and forth between past and present incarnations. Her intention is to capture all of the Doctor's selves in a time loop, trapping him in London's [[East End of London|East End]]; she has already captured the [[First Doctor|First]] and [[Second Doctor]] in the time hole.  This causes the [[Fourth Doctor]] to send a message to his remaining selves, warning them of the Rani's plan:\n\n{{quote|Mayday! Mayday! This is an urgent message for all of the Doctors. It's vitally important that you listen carefully to me, for once. Our whole existence is being threatened by a renegade Time Lord known only as the Rani! She hates me. She even hates children! Two of my earlier selves have already been snared in her vicious trap. The grumpy one and the flautist, do you remember? She wants to put us out of action, lock us away in a dreary backwater of London's East End, trapped in a time-loop in perpetuity. Her evil is all around us! I can hear the heart beat of a killer. She's out there somewhere. We must be on our guard and we must stop her before she destroys all of my other selves! Oh... Good luck, my dears!|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe [[Seventh Doctor]] and [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]] are confused when the [[TARDIS]] lands in [[Greenwich]], near the [[Cutty Sark]], thanks to the Rani's attack on the TARDIS. The Doctor finds a newspaper showing the year to be 1973, but before he can make any more conclusions, the Rani causes time to jump. Ace finds herself in [[Albert Square]] in 1993 with the [[Sixth Doctor]]. Local resident [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay]] tries to sell Ace some new clothes from his stall, and when his wife [[Gita Kapoor|Gita]] tells the Sixth Doctor that it is going to be all the rage in 1994, the Rani jumps time again.\n\nThe [[Third Doctor]] and [[Mel Bush]] appear from the time jump, and question an old [[Pauline Fowler]] and [[Kathy Beale]] on when they are. When Pauline and Kathy reply that it is 2013, another time jump occurs. In 1973, Pauline and Kathy remember the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]], while Kathy tells off a young [[Ian Beale]]. The Sixth Doctor and [[Susan Foreman]] appear, but she wonders what has happened to 'her' Doctor, the First.\n\nAfter another time jump to 2013, Susan changes into [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and the Doctor changes from the Sixth to the Third Doctor. They start to piece together what is happening to them, but the Rani lets loose her menagerie of specimens, including a [[Cyberman]], Fifi (from ''[[The Happiness Patrol]]''), a [[Sea Devil (Doctor Who)|Sea Devil]], an [[Ogron]] and a [[Time Lord]] from [[Gallifrey]] in the next time jump. In 1993, the [[Fifth Doctor]], [[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]] and [[Perpugilliam Brown|Peri]] are attacked by the Rani's menagerie, and after they tried to warn [[Pat Butcher]] of the danger, the Rani stops them outside the [[Queen Vic]].\n\nIn 1993, after the Fifth Doctor changed to the Third Doctor in the next time jump, with [[Liz Shaw]], the Rani took control of Liz's mind. As [[Mandy Salter]] tries to stop the Rani, [[Mike Yates|Captain Mike Yates]] of [[UNIT]] comes in Bessie to save the Third Doctor and get him to [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart|The Brigadier]] who is waiting for them.\n\nAfter another time jump, the Doctor changed to the [[Sixth Doctor]] and after he says goodbye to the Brigadier time jumps again.  In 1993, at the Arches, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] find [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] looking for the Doctor, but they point her to [[Harold Legg|Dr. Harold Legg]]. As Romana walks past the [[Queen Vic]], the Rani captures her, in front of [[Frank Butcher]].\n\nBack in 1973, the Third Doctor explains to [[Victoria Waterfield]] who the Rani was and thinks that her control is breaking down, as they return to the TARDIS.\n\nAfter the Seventh Doctor lands the TARDIS in 1993, [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] escapes from the Rani, after being cloned in the form of Romana. This results in an additional [[Time Lord]] brain imprint being left on the computer inside the Rani's TARDIS instead of the human one she needed, which gives the Seventh Doctor, Ace, and [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] the edge needed to rig up a device to overload it, sending the Rani into the time tunnel where she had trapped the First and Second Doctors and freeing the Doctors' other selves from the loop. As the Seventh Doctor and Ace leave in the TARDIS, the Doctor observes \"Certainly, I \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 are difficult to get rid of.\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Cast notes===\n*This was the final official appearance of [[Jon Pertwee]] as the [[Third Doctor]]; Pertwee died three years later. \n*[[Tom Baker]] returned to the role of the [[Fourth Doctor]] on television for the first time since leaving it 12 years previously, though he had recorded links for the video release of the incomplete ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' the year before. Baker was reluctant to take part as he hated the script and his scenes were re-written by himself at the last minute. [[Tom Baker]] would later return to the series in 2013's [[The Day of the Doctor]] in which he appears as ''\"The Curator\"'' who may or may not be a future incarnation of the Doctor himself. He will reprise the role in [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish Productions']] ''Doctor Who: Stranded'', alongside [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]].\n*This special marks the first time that [[Peter Davison]] returned as the [[Fifth Doctor]], 9 years since he stepped down from the role after filming \"[[The Caves of Androzani]]\". He would later reprise the role again in the 2007 Mini-Episode broadcast for Children In Need [[Time Crash]] alongside his future son-in-law [[David Tennant]] as the [[Tenth Doctor]].\n*It is, to date, the final on-screen appearance of [[Colin Baker]] as the [[Sixth Doctor]].  \n*This is the last appearance on television of [[Caroline John]] as [[Liz Shaw]] (John died in 2012) and [[Deborah Watling]] as [[Victoria Waterfield]] (Watling died in 2017).\n*In February 1993, [[Sophie Aldred]] had guest-starred in a two-episode arc on ''EastEnders'' as Suzi.<ref>''EastEnders'' episodes dated 2 February 1993 and 4 February 1993</ref> She appears in ''Dimensions in Time'' as [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]], her character from ''Doctor Who'' and the final [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the classic era. This is, to date, the character's final on-screen appearance.\n*This marked the only time in which [[Nicholas Courtney]] and/or his character, [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]], appeared with the [[Sixth Doctor]] on screen; they did also meet in various [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio dramas.\n*This marked, to date, the final on-screen appearances of [[Carole Ann Ford]] as [[Susan Foreman]], [[Bonnie Langford]] as [[Melanie Bush]], [[Nicola Bryant]] as [[Peri Brown]], [[Sarah Sutton]] as [[Nyssa of Traken|Nyssa]], [[Lalla Ward]] as [[Romana]] and [[Louise Jameson]] as [[Leela]].\n\n*This marked the final appearance of [[Kate O'Mara]] as [[The Rani]]. O'Mara died in 2014.\n\n{{Episode table\n   |background =\n   |series = 6 |title = 20 | aux1=6 | airdate = 10 | viewers = 6 | country = UK\n   |seriesT    = Episode\n   |aux1T      = Run time\n   |viewersR   = {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n   |episodes   =\n  {{Episode list/sublist|Dimensions in Time\n   |EpisodeNumber      = 1\n   |Title              = Part One\n   |RTitle             =\n   |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1993|11|26|df=y}}\n   |Viewers            = 13.8\n   |Aux1               = 7:34\n   |LineColor          =\n  }}\n  {{Episode list/sublist|Dimensions in Time\n   |EpisodeNumber      = 2\n   |Title              = Part Two\n   |RTitle             =\n   |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1993|11|27|df=y}}\n   |Viewers            = 13.6\n   |Aux1               = 5:27\n   |LineColor          =\n  }}\n  }}\n\n*''The Dimensions of Time'' and ''3-Dimensions of Time'' were the working titles for this story.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} David Roden managed to convince producer John Nathan-Turner not to use either title, and instead settled on ''Dimensions In Time''.\n\nThis was David Roden's first professional script. \nRoden's original draft for a script featured Seventh Doctor, Sylvester McCoy, meeting the Brigadier, Nicholas Courtney, en route to a UNIT reunion \u2013 and becoming involved in a battle with a crashed spaceship full of Cybermen. The script was entitled ''Destination: Holocaust'', and featured the Seventh Doctor and Brigadier holed up in a burning church, trying to fight off the advancing hordes of damaged Cybermen. This original idea, written by David Roden, was vetoed by Nathan-Turner after it became apparent that Children in Need wished for the story to be a tie-in with ''EastEnders''. Despite loving the originally proposed script, Nathan-Turner also had concerns about the cost, which would have included several lengthy night-shoots and a much larger special effects budget.\n* Allegedly, [[Anthony Ainley]] was approached by Nathan-Turner to play the part of the Master in this short story, but he turned it down. Ainley, however, vehemently denied this, insisting that if he were asked, he would have had no hesitation in appearing.  [[Michael Gough]] was later approached to re-create the role of the Celestial Toymaker, and again Nathan-Turner was turned down. Finally, Kate O'Mara was asked if she would like to reprise her role of the Rani \u2013 a request to which she readily agreed. O'Mara was joined by [[Samuel West]], who played her sidekick Cyrian (named after the original intended actor, Sir [[Ian McKellen]]).\n*The special was one of several special [[3D television|3D]] programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system developed by American inventor Terry D. Beard that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]]. The technology required spectacles with one darkened lens and one transparent one; these were sold in shops to the public, with the proceeds going to Children in Need.\n*The [[Dalek]]s were also supposed to appear, but the segment was pulled after a dispute with Dalek creator [[Terry Nation]] over payments. The Dalek segment would have seen [[Peter Davison]] facing up against them again in the streets seen in the 1984 serial ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]''.\n*All actors and crew gave their services especially for Children in Need, and waived their fees on the condition that ''Dimensions in Time'' would never be repeated or sold on [[home video]] for profit. For the same reason, the story has and never will appear as an extra on a DVD release.\n*David Roden worked for the BBC Drama Department in London on the 'Writers Academy' training new writers. During 2007 and 2008 he worked for the BBC Wales Drama Department in Script Development alongside the production team for Season 4 of Russell T Davies' new ''Doctor Who''. He contributed a short story to the 'Doctor Who' novel 'The Story of Martha' (2008). Roden also wrote the ''Doctor Who'' BBC Audio Exclusive ''The Nemonite Invasion'' (2009), which was read by Catherine Tate. Roden has been a script editor for the BBC, most recently on ''Casualty'', and on ITV for ''Coronation Street''.\n\n==Broadcast==\n* Part One was broadcast as part of the 1993 [[Children in Need]] [[telethon]]. It was introduced by [[Noel Edmonds]] in a short live sketch with [[Jon Pertwee]], in character as the [[Third Doctor]].\n* At the end of Part One, viewers were asked to phone in and vote for which ''EastEnders'' character would save the Doctor at the start of Part Two. Two versions of the scene were filmed, one featuring [[Mandy Salter|Mandy]] and the other [['Big' Ron]]. The \u00a3101,000 raised from phone calls went to Children in Need.

It was filmed on location at [[Greenwich]] and the ''EastEnders'' [[Albert Square]] set, situated at [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]]. It features several of the ''EastEnders'' stars of the time. Produced for the ''[[Children in Need]]'' charity, following ''Doctor Who'''s hiatus in 1989 this special was the only dramatisation broadcast in celebration of the show's 30th anniversary.\n\nThe special over the years has been panned by the ''Doctor Who Fanbase'' and is no longer considered to be canon in the main continuity.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]] has opened a hole in time, allowing her access to the Doctor's timeline. She uses this to cycle through the Doctor's lives, causing him and his companions to jump back and forth between past and present incarnations. Her intention is to capture all of the Doctor's selves in a time loop, trapping him in London's [[East End of London|East End]]; she has already captured the [[First Doctor|First]] and [[Second Doctor]] in the time hole.  This causes the [[Fourth Doctor]] to send a message to his remaining selves, warning them of the Rani's plan:\n\n{{quote|Mayday! Mayday! This is an urgent message for all of the Doctors. It's vitally important that you listen carefully to me, for once. Our whole existence is being threatened by a renegade Time Lord known only as the Rani! She hates me. She even hates children! Two of my earlier selves have already been snared in her vicious trap. The grumpy one and the flautist, do you remember? She wants to put us out of action, lock us away in a dreary backwater of London's East End, trapped in a time-loop in perpetuity. Her evil is all around us! I can hear the heart beat of a killer. She's out there somewhere. We must be on our guard and we must stop her before she destroys all of my other selves! Oh... Good luck, my dears!|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe [[Seventh Doctor]] and [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]] are confused when the [[TARDIS]] lands in [[Greenwich]], near the [[Cutty Sark]], thanks to the Rani's attack on the TARDIS. The Doctor finds a newspaper showing the year to be 1973, but before he can make any more conclusions, the Rani causes time to jump. Ace finds herself in [[Albert Square]] in 1993 with the [[Sixth Doctor]]. Local resident [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay]] tries to sell Ace some new clothes from his stall, and when his wife [[Gita Kapoor|Gita]] tells the Sixth Doctor that it is going to be all the rage in 1994, the Rani jumps time again.\n\nThe [[Third Doctor]] and [[Mel Bush]] appear from the time jump, and question an old [[Pauline Fowler]] and [[Kathy Beale]] on when they are. When Pauline and Kathy reply that it is 2013, another time jump occurs. In 1973, Pauline and Kathy remember the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]], while Kathy tells off a young [[Ian Beale]]. The Sixth Doctor and [[Susan Foreman]] appear, but she wonders what has happened to 'her' Doctor, the First.\n\nAfter another time jump to 2013, Susan changes into [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and the Doctor changes from the Sixth to the Third Doctor. They start to piece together what is happening to them, but the Rani lets loose her menagerie of specimens, including a [[Cyberman]], Fifi (from ''[[The Happiness Patrol]]''), a [[Sea Devil (Doctor Who)|Sea Devil]], an [[Ogron]] and a [[Time Lord]] from [[Gallifrey]] in the next time jump. In 1993, the [[Fifth Doctor]], [[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]] and [[Perpugilliam Brown|Peri]] are attacked by the Rani's menagerie, and after they tried to warn [[Pat Butcher]] of the danger, the Rani stops them outside the [[Queen Vic]].\n\nIn 1993, after the Fifth Doctor changed to the Third Doctor in the next time jump, with [[Liz Shaw]], the Rani took control of Liz's mind. As [[Mandy Salter]] tries to stop the Rani, [[Mike Yates|Captain Mike Yates]] of [[UNIT]] comes in Bessie to save the Third Doctor and get him to [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart|The Brigadier]] who is waiting for them.\n\nAfter another time jump, the Doctor changed to the [[Sixth Doctor]] and after he says goodbye to the Brigadier time jumps again.  In 1993, at the Arches, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] find [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] looking for the Doctor, but they point her to [[Harold Legg|Dr. Harold Legg]]. As Romana walks past the [[Queen Vic]], the Rani captures her, in front of [[Frank Butcher]].\n\nBack in 1973, the Third Doctor explains to [[Victoria Waterfield]] who the Rani was and thinks that her control is breaking down, as they return to the TARDIS.\n\nAfter the Seventh Doctor lands the TARDIS in 1993, [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] escapes from the Rani, after being cloned in the form of Romana. This results in an additional [[Time Lord]] brain imprint being left on the computer inside the Rani's TARDIS instead of the human one she needed, which gives the Seventh Doctor, Ace, and [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] the edge needed to rig up a device to overload it, sending the Rani into the time tunnel where she had trapped the First and Second Doctors and freeing the Doctors' other selves from the loop. As the Seventh Doctor and Ace leave in the TARDIS, the Doctor observes \"Certainly, I \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 are difficult to get rid of.\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Cast notes===\n*This was the final official appearance of [[Jon Pertwee]] as the [[Third Doctor]]; Pertwee died three years later. \n*[[Tom Baker]] returned to the role of the [[Fourth Doctor]] on television for the first time since leaving it 12 years previously, though he had recorded links for the video release of the incomplete ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' the year before. Baker was reluctant to take part as he hated the script and his scenes were re-written by himself at the last minute. [[Tom Baker]] would later return to the series in 2013's [[The Day of the Doctor]] in which he appears as ''\"The Curator\"'' who may or may not be a future incarnation of the Doctor himself. He will reprise the role in [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish Productions']] ''Doctor Who: Stranded'', alongside [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]].\n*This special marks the first time that [[Peter Davison]] returned as the [[Fifth Doctor]], 9 years since he stepped down from the role after filming \"[[The Caves of Androzani]]\". He would later reprise the role again in the 2007 Mini-Episode broadcast for Children In Need [[Time Crash]] alongside his future son-in-law [[David Tennant]] as the [[Tenth Doctor]].\n*It is, to date, the final on-screen appearance of [[Colin Baker]] as the [[Sixth Doctor]].  \n*This is the last appearance on television of [[Caroline John]] as [[Liz Shaw]] (John died in 2012) and [[Deborah Watling]] as [[Victoria Waterfield]] (Watling died in 2017).\n*In February 1993, [[Sophie Aldred]] had guest-starred in a two-episode arc on ''EastEnders'' as Suzi.<ref>''EastEnders'' episodes dated 2 February 1993 and 4 February 1993</ref> She appears in ''Dimensions in Time'' as [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]], her character from ''Doctor Who'' and the final [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the classic era. This is, to date, the character's final on-screen appearance.\n*This marked the only time in which [[Nicholas Courtney]] and/or his character, [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]], appeared with the [[Sixth Doctor]] on screen; they did also meet in various [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio dramas.\n*This marked, to date, the final on-screen appearances of [[Carole Ann Ford]] as [[Susan Foreman]], [[Bonnie Langford]] as [[Melanie Bush]], [[Nicola Bryant]] as [[Peri Brown]], [[Sarah Sutton]] as [[Nyssa]], [[Lalla Ward]] as [[Romana]] and [[Louise Jameson]] as [[Leela]].\n\n*This marked the final appearance of [[Kate O'Mara]] as [[The Rani]]. O'Mara died in 2014.\n\n{{Episode table\n   |background =\n   |series = 6 |title = 20 | aux1=6 | airdate = 10 | viewers = 6 | country = UK\n   |seriesT    = Episode\n   |aux1T      = Run time\n   |viewersR   = {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n   |episodes   =\n  {{Episode list/sublist|Dimensions in Time\n   |EpisodeNumber      = 1\n   |Title              = Part One\n   |RTitle             =\n   |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1993|11|26|df=y}}\n   |Viewers            = 13.8\n   |Aux1               = 7:34\n   |LineColor          =\n  }}\n  {{Episode list/sublist|Dimensions in Time\n   |EpisodeNumber      = 2\n   |Title              = Part Two\n   |RTitle             =\n   |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1993|11|27|df=y}}\n   |Viewers            = 13.6\n   |Aux1               = 5:27\n   |LineColor          =\n  }}\n  }}\n\n*''The Dimensions of Time'' and ''3-Dimensions of Time'' were the working titles for this story.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} David Roden managed to convince producer John Nathan-Turner not to use either title, and instead settled on ''Dimensions In Time''.\n\nThis was David Roden's first professional script. \nRoden's original draft for a script featured Seventh Doctor, Sylvester McCoy, meeting the Brigadier, Nicholas Courtney, en route to a UNIT reunion \u2013 and becoming involved in a battle with a crashed spaceship full of Cybermen. The script was entitled ''Destination: Holocaust'', and featured the Seventh Doctor and Brigadier holed up in a burning church, trying to fight off the advancing hordes of damaged Cybermen. This original idea, written by David Roden, was vetoed by Nathan-Turner after it became apparent that Children in Need wished for the story to be a tie-in with ''EastEnders''. Despite loving the originally proposed script, Nathan-Turner also had concerns about the cost, which would have included several lengthy night-shoots and a much larger special effects budget.\n* Allegedly, [[Anthony Ainley]] was approached by Nathan-Turner to play the part of the Master in this short story, but he turned it down. Ainley, however, vehemently denied this, insisting that if he were asked, he would have had no hesitation in appearing.  [[Michael Gough]] was later approached to re-create the role of the Celestial Toymaker, and again Nathan-Turner was turned down. Finally, Kate O'Mara was asked if she would like to reprise her role of the Rani \u2013 a request to which she readily agreed. O'Mara was joined by [[Samuel West]], who played her sidekick Cyrian (named after the original intended actor, Sir [[Ian McKellen]]).\n*The special was one of several special [[3D television|3D]] programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system developed by American inventor Terry D. Beard that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]]. The technology required spectacles with one darkened lens and one transparent one; these were sold in shops to the public, with the proceeds going to Children in Need.\n*The [[Dalek]]s were also supposed to appear, but the segment was pulled after a dispute with Dalek creator [[Terry Nation]] over payments. The Dalek segment would have seen [[Peter Davison]] facing up against them again in the streets seen in the 1984 serial ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]''.\n*All actors and crew gave their services especially for Children in Need, and waived their fees on the condition that ''Dimensions in Time'' would never be repeated or sold on [[home video]] for profit. For the same reason, the story has and never will appear as an extra on a DVD release.\n*David Roden worked for the BBC Drama Department in London on the 'Writers Academy' training new writers. During 2007 and 2008 he worked for the BBC Wales Drama Department in Script Development alongside the production team for Season 4 of Russell T Davies' new ''Doctor Who''. He contributed a short story to the 'Doctor Who' novel 'The Story of Martha' (2008). Roden also wrote the ''Doctor Who'' BBC Audio Exclusive ''The Nemonite Invasion'' (2009), which was read by Catherine Tate. Roden has been a script editor for the BBC, most recently on ''Casualty'', and on ITV for ''Coronation Street''.\n\n==Broadcast==\n* Part One was broadcast as part of the 1993 [[Children in Need]] [[telethon]]. It was introduced by [[Noel Edmonds]] in a short live sketch with [[Jon Pertwee]], in character as the [[Third Doctor]].\n* At the end of Part One, viewers were asked to phone in and vote for which ''EastEnders'' character would save the Doctor at the start of Part Two. Two versions of the scene were filmed, one featuring [[Mandy Salter|Mandy]] and the other [['Big' Ron]]. The \u00a3101,000 raised from phone calls went to Children in Need. The result of the vote was announced prior to the screening of Part Two. The version featuring Mandy was broadcast after it won 56% of the vote.\n* Part Two was broadcast as part of popular UK programme ''[[Noel's House Party]]''.\n\n==Ratings==\n''Dimensions in Time'' achieved viewing figures of 13.8 million viewers for the first part and 13.6 million for the second part, making them two of the most highly watched episodes of ''Doctor Who'' ever produced. The highest single audience figure was for Part Four of ''[[City of Death]]'', at 16.1 million viewers.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://homepages.bw.edu/~jcurtis/Scripts/DIT/intro.html Doctor Who Scripts Project page for ''Dimensions in Time'']\n*{{BBCCDW| id=dimensionstime | title= Dimensions in Time}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060622072451/http://www.doctorwhoworld.org.uk/dimensions.htm ''Doctor Who World'' episode guide entry for ''Dimensions in Time'']\n*[http://drwhoguide.com/mp3/dimens.mp3 Title music]\n*[http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/toby-hadoke-s-who-s-round-128---david-roden-1337 Toby Hadoke\u2019s Who\u2019s Round - David Roden] - interview with writer\n{{Doctor Who}}\n{{EastEnders}}\n{{Multi-Doctor stories}}\n{{First Doctor stories}}\n{{Cybermen stories}}\n{{UNIT stories}}\n\n[[Category:Doctor Who crossovers]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who multi-Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who spin-offs]]\n[[Category:EastEnders spin-offs]]\n[[Category:Third Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Fourth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Fifth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Sixth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:The Rani (Doctor Who) stories]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who charity episodes]]\n[[Category:Children in Need]]\n[[Category:1993 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:3D television programs]]\n[[Category:Anniversary television episodes]]\n[[Category:British television episodes in multiple parts]]\n[[Category:Crossover television]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1973]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 2013]]\n", "name_user": "ArkhamBen17", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCast notes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensions_in_Time"}

There are smaller villages and undeveloped green belt areas in its peripheral countryside, though the seat is primarily suburban and middle-class, with low levels of deprivation throughout.  Workless claimants stood at only 2% of the population in November 2012, below every regional average in the UK.  In the study of that date, only three of the 59 West Midlands seats had a lower proportion of registered jobseekers.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/nov/17/unemployment-and-employment-statistics-economics Unemployment claimants by constituency] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing boundary changes, the northernmost tip of the seat now contains the point in England furthest from the coast in any direction.\n\n==Boundaries==\nThe constituency is one of two covering the [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull]].  It covers the town of [[Solihull]] itself, as well as [[Shirley, West Midlands|Shirley]] and [[Olton]].  It is a largely well-off, residential area, in the south-east of the [[West Midlands conurbation]].\n\n'''1945\u20131974''': The Urban District of Solihull.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': The County Borough of Solihull.\n\n'''1983\u2013present''': The Metropolitan Borough of Solihull wards of Elmdon, Lyndon, Olton, St Alphege, Shirley East, Shirley South, Shirley West, and Silhill.\n\n==History==\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidates won the seat from its outset in 1945 until a loss in 2005, the seat meanwhile seeing boundary changes covered above. In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] Solihull was won by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], with [[Lorely Burt]] beating the incumbent [[John Mark Taylor|John Taylor]] by a majority of 279 votes. Burt won the seat again at the 2010 general election, this time by just 175 votes following two recounts. Since 2015 the seat has been represented by [[Julian Knight (politician)|Julian Knight]], who won the seat with a majority of 12,902 beating incumbent Lorely Burt. At the 2017 election, Knight increased his majority to just over 20,000, with a very similar result in 2019, making Solihull a [[Safe seat|safe]] Conservative seat.\n\n==Elections==\n===Elections in

There are smaller villages and undeveloped green belt areas in its peripheral countryside, though the seat is primarily suburban and middle-class, with low levels of deprivation throughout.  Workless claimants stood at only 2% of the population in November 2012, below every regional average in the UK.  In the study of that date, only three of the 59 West Midlands seats had a lower proportion of registered jobseekers.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/nov/17/unemployment-and-employment-statistics-economics Unemployment claimants by constituency] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\nFollowing boundary changes, the northernmost tip of the seat now contains the point in England furthest from the coast in any direction.\n\n==Boundaries==\nThe constituency is one of two covering the [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull]].  It covers the town of [[Solihull]] itself, as well as [[Shirley, West Midlands|Shirley]] and [[Olton]].  It is a largely well-off, residential area, in the south-east of the [[West Midlands conurbation]].\n\n'''1945\u20131974''': The Urban District of Solihull.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': The County Borough of Solihull.\n\n'''1983\u2013present''': The Metropolitan Borough of Solihull wards of Elmdon, Lyndon, Olton, St Alphege, Shirley East, Shirley South, Shirley West, and Silhill.\n\n==History==\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidates won the seat from its outset in 1945 until a loss in 2005, the seat meanwhile seeing boundary changes covered above. In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] Solihull was won by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], with [[Lorely Burt]] beating the incumbent [[John Mark Taylor|John Taylor]] by a majority of 279 votes. Burt won the seat again at the 2010 general election, this time by just 175 votes following two recounts. Since 2015 the seat has been represented by [[Julian Knight (politician)|Julian Knight]], who won the seat with a majority of 12,902 beating incumbent Lorely Burt. At the 2017 election, Knight increased his majority to just over 20,000, with a very similar result in 2019, making Solihull a [[Safe seat|safe]] Conservative seat.\n\n==Elections==\n===Elections in
