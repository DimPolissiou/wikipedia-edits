In the 10 years from 1144, two successive [[count of Anjou|counts of Anjou]] in France, [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]] and his son, the future Henry II, won control of a vast assemblage of lands in western Europe that would last for 80 years and would retrospectively be referred to as the [[Angevin Empire]]. As a political entity this was structurally different from the preceding [[House of Normandy|Norman]] and subsequent [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] realms. Geoffrey became [[Duke of Normandy]] in 1144 and died in 1151. In 1152 his heir, Henry, added Aquitaine by virtue of his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Henry also inherited the claim of his mother, [[Empress Matilda]], the daughter of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]], to the English throne, to which he succeeded in 1154 following the death of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=1}}</ref>\n\nHenry was succeeded by his third son, [[Richard I of England|Richard]], whose reputation for martial prowess won him the epithet \"{{lang|fr|C\u0153ur de Lion}}\" or \"Lionheart\".<ref name=\"Turner & Heiser 71\">{{harvnb|Turner|Heiser|2000|p=71}}</ref> He was born and raised in England but spent very little time there during his adult life, perhaps as little as six months.

In 1204 John lost much of the Angevins' continental territories, including Anjou, to the French crown. He and his successors were still recognized as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|dukes of Aquitaine]]. The loss of Anjou from which the dynasty is named is the rationale behind John's son, [[Henry III of England]], being considered the first [[Plantagenet]] {{ndash}} a name derived from the nickname of his great-grandfather, Geoffrey. Where no distinction is made between the Angevins{{mdash}}and Angevin era{{mdash}}and subsequent English Kings, Henry II is the first Plantagenet king.<ref>{{harvnb| Blockmans|Hoppenbrouwers |2014|p=173}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=15\u201323}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Power|2007|pp=85\u201386}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1991|pp=228\u2013229}}</ref> From John the dynasty continued successfully and unbroken in the senior male line until the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] before dividing into two competing [[cadet branch]]es, the [[House of Lancaster]] and the [[House of York]].\n\n== Terminology ==\n\n===Angevin===\nThe adjective Angevin is especially used in English history to refer to the kings who were also counts of Anjou{{mdash}}beginning with Henry II{{mdash}}descended from Geoffrey and Matilda; their characteristics, descendants and the period of history which they covered from the mid-twelfth to early-thirteenth centuries. In addition it is also used pertaining to Anjou, or any sovereign, government derived from this. As a noun it is used for any native of Anjou or Angevin ruler. As such Angevin is also used for other [[Counts and Dukes of Anjou]]; including the three kings' ancestors, their cousins who held the crown of [[King of Jerusalem#House of Anjou|Jerusalem]] and unrelated later members of the French royal family who were granted the titles to form different dynasties amongst which were the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] and the [[Valois House of Anjou]].<ref>{{OED|Angevin}}</ref>\n\n===Angevin Empire===\n\nThe term \"Angevin Empire\" was coined in 1887 by [[Kate Norgate]]. As far as it is known there was no contemporary name for this assemblage of territories which were referred to{{mdash}}if at all{{mdash}}by clumsy circumlocutions such as ''our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be'' or ''the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father''. Whereas the Angevin part of this term has proved uncontentious the empire portion has proved controversial. In 1986 a convention of historical specialists concluded that there had been no Angevin state and no empire but the term ''espace Plantagenet'' was acceptable.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=2\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n\n[[Image:The Children of Henry2 England.jpg|thumb|right|350px|alt=An illuminated diagram showing the Angevins; coloured lines connect the two to show the lineal descent|Thirteenth-century depiction of the Angevins ([[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and his legitimate children): (''left to right'') [[William IX, Count of Poitiers|William]], [[Henry the Young King|Henry]], [[Richard I of England|Richard]], [[Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony|Matilda]], [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]] and [[John, King of England|John]]]]\nThe Angevins descend from [[Geoffrey II, Count of G\u00e2tinais]] and [[Ermengarde of Anjou, Duchess of Burgundy|Ermengarde of Anjou]]. In 1060 this couple inherited, via [[cognatic kinship]], the county of Anjou from an older line dating from 870 and a noble called [[Ingelger]].<ref name=Davies1997p190>{{harvnb|Davies|1997|p=190}}</ref><ref name=\"vauchezsixtyfive\">{{harvnb|Vauchez|2000|p=65}}</ref> The marriage of Count Geoffrey to Matilda, the only surviving legitimate child of [[Henry I of England]], was part of a struggle for power during the tenth and eleventh centuries among the lords of [[Normandy]], [[Brittany]], [[Poitou]], [[Blois]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and the kings of France. It was from this marriage that Geoffrey's son, Henry, inherited the claims to England, Normandy and Anjou that marks the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties.<ref name=Gillingham7>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=7}}</ref>  This was the third attempt by Geoffrey's father [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk V]] to build a political alliance with Normandy. The first was by marrying his daughter [[Matilda of Anjou|Matilda]] to Henry's heir [[William Adelin]], who drowned in the wreck of the ''[[White Ship]]''. Fulk then married his daughter [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla]] to [[William Clito]], heir to Henry's older brother [[Robert Curthose]], but Henry had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to his lands.<ref name=Davies1999p309>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=309}}</ref>\n\n==Inheritance custom and Angevin practice==\n\nAs society became more prosperous and stable in the 11th century, inheritance customs developed  that allowed daughters (in the absence of sons) to succeed to principalities as well as landed estates. The twelfth-century chronicler [[Ralph de Diceto]] noted that the counts of Anjou extended their dominion over their neighbours by marriage rather than conquest.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> The marriage of Geoffrey to the daughter of a king (and widow of an emperor) occurred in this context.  It is unknown whether King Henry intended to make Geoffrey his heir, but it is known that the threat presented by William Clito's rival claim to the duchy of Normandy made his negotiating position very weak. Even so, it is probable that, should the marriage be childless, King Henry would have attempted to be succeeded by one of his Norman kinsmen such as [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]] or [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]] who in the event did seize King Henry's English crown. King Henry's great relief in 1133 at the birth of a son to the couple, described as \"the heir to the Kingdom\", is understandable in the light of this situation. Following this the birth of a second son raised the question of whether custom would be followed with the maternal inheritance passing to first born and the paternal inheritance going to his brother, [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=10\u201312}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[William of Newburgh]] writing in the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey's early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the paternal and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=18}}</ref> Henry's brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 21\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe unity of Henry's assemblage of domains was largely dependent on the ruling family, influencing the opinion of most historians that this instability made it unlikely to endure. The French custom of partible inheritance at the time would lead to political fragmentation. Indeed, if Henry II's sons Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany had not died young, the inheritance of 1189 would have been fundamentally altered. Henry and Richard both planned for partition on their deaths while attempting to provide overriding sovereignty to hold the lands together. For example, in 1173 and 1183 Henry tried to force Richard to acknowledge allegiance to his older brother for the duchy of Aquitaine and later Richard would confiscate Ireland from John. This was complicated by the Angevins' being subjects of the kings of France, who felt these feudal rights of homage and the right of allegiance more legally belonged to them. This was particularly true when the wardship of Geoffrey's son Arthur and lordship of Brittany was contended between 1202 and 1204. On the Young King's death in 1183, Richard became heir in chief, but refused to give up Aquitaine to give John an inheritance. More by accident than design this meant that, while Richard inherited the patrimony, John would become lord of Ireland and Arthur would be duke of Brittany. By the mid-thirteenth century there was a clear unified patrimony and Plantagenet empire but this cannot be called an ''Angevin Empire'' as by this date Anjou and most of the continental lands had been lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=119\u2013121}}</ref>\n\n=={{Anchor|Angevin arrival in England}}Arrival in England==\n[[File:France 1154-en.svg|thumb|right|alt=Multi-coloured map of 12th-century France and southern England|Henry's continental holdings in 1154, showing the lands known as the Angevin Empire in shades of red.]]\nHenry I of England named his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] heir; but when he died in 1135 Matilda was far from England in Anjou or Maine, while her cousin [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] was closer in Boulogne, giving him the advantage he needed to race to England and have himself crowned and anointed king of England.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=13}}</ref>  Matilda's husband Geoffrey, though he had little interest in England, commenced a long struggle for the duchy of Normandy.<ref name=\"Grant\">{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=7}}.</ref> To create a second front Matilda landed in England during 1139 to challenge Stephen, instigating the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. In 1141 she captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|battle of Lincoln]], prompting the collapse of his support.  While Geoffrey pushed on with the conquest of Normandy over the next four years, Matilda threw away her position through arrogance and inability to be magnanimous in victory. She was even forced to release Stephen in a hostage exchange for her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], allowing Stephen to resume control of much of England. Geoffrey never visited England to offer practical assistance but instead sent Henry as a male figurehead{{mdash}}beginning in 1142 when Henry was only 9{{mdash}}with a view that if England was conquered it would be Henry that would become king. In 1150 Geoffrey also transferred the title of Duke of Normandy to Henry but retained the dominant role in governance.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=15\u201318}}</ref> Three fortuitous events allowed Henry to finally bring the conflict to a successful conclusion:\n* In 1151 Count Geoffrey died before having time to complete his plan to divide his inheritance between his sons Henry and [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]], who would have received England and Anjou respectively.\n* [[Louis VII of France]] divorced [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] whom Henry quickly married, greatly increasing his resources and power with the acquisition of [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].\n* In 1153 Stephen's son [[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] died. The disheartened Stephen, who had also recently been widowed, gave up the fight and, with the [[Treaty of Wallingford]], repeated the peace offer that Matilda had rejected in 1142: Stephen would be king for life, Henry his successor, preserving Stephen's second son [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]]'s rights to his family estates. Stephen did not live long and so Henry inherited in late 1154.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=19\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHenry faced many challenges to secure possession of his father's and grandfathers\u2019 lands that required the reassertion and extension of old suzerainties.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=23}}</ref>  In 1162 [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], died, and Henry saw an opportunity to re-establish what he saw as his rights over the church in England by appointing his friend [[Thomas Becket]] to succeed him.  Instead, Becket proved to be an inept politician whose defiance alienated the king and his counsellors.  Henry and Becket clashed repeatedly: over church tenures, Henry's brother's marriage and taxation. Henry reacted by getting Becket, and other members of the English episcopate, to recognise sixteen ancient customs{{mdash}}governing relations between the king, his courts, and the church{{mdash}}in writing for the first time in the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]. When Becket tried to leave the country without permission, Henry attempted to ruin him by laying a number of suits relating to Becket's time as chancellor. In response Becket fled into exile for five years. Relations later improved, allowing Becket's return, but soured again when Becket saw the coronation of Henry's son as [[coregent]] by the [[Archbishop of York]] as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him. When he heard the news, Henry said: \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk.\" Three of Henry's men killed Becket in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] after Becket resisted a botched attempt to arrest him. Within Christian Europe Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket's death. The opinion of this transgression against the church made Henry a pariah, so in penance he walked barefoot into Canterbury Cathedral where he was scourged by monks.<ref>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=142}}</ref>\n\nIn 1171 Henry invaded Ireland to assert his overlordship following alarm at the success of knights he had allowed to recruit soldiers in England and Wales who had assumed the role of colonisers and accrued autonomous power, including [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]]. [[Pope Adrian IV]] had given Henry a papal [[Laudabiliter|blessing]] to expand his power into Ireland to reform the Irish church.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=53}}.</ref>  Originally this would have allowed some territory to be granted to Henry's brother, William, but other matters had distracted Henry and William was now dead. Instead Henry's designs were made plain when he gave the lordship of Ireland to his youngest son, John.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nIn 1172 Henry II tried to give his landless youngest son John a wedding gift of the three castles  of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon|Chinon]], [[Loudun]] and [[Mirebeau]]. This angered the 18-year-old Young King who had yet to receive any lands from his father and prompted a [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174|rebellion]] by Henry II's wife and three eldest sons. [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] supported the rebellion to destabilise Henry II. [[William the Lion]] and other subjects of Henry II also joined the revolt and it took 18 months for Henry to force the rebels to submit to his authority.<ref name=Jones2012p82>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=82\u201392}}</ref> In Le Mans in 1182, Henry II gathered his children to plan a [[partible inheritance]] in which his eldest son (also called Henry) would inherit England, Normandy and Anjou; [[Richard I of England|Richard]] the Duchy of Aquitaine; [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] Brittany, and John Ireland. This degenerated into further conflict. [[Henry the Young King|The younger Henry]] rebelled again before he died of [[dysentery]] and, in 1186, Geoffrey died after a tournament accident. In 1189 Richard and [[Philip II of France]] took advantage of Henry's failing health and forced him to accept humiliating peace terms, including naming Richard as his sole heir.<ref name=Jones2012p109>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=109}}</ref> Two days later the old king died, defeated and miserable in the knowledge that even his favoured son John had rebelled.

In the 10 years from 1144, two successive [[count of Anjou|counts of Anjou]] in France, [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]] and his son, the future Henry II, won control of a vast assemblage of lands in western Europe that would last for 80 years and would retrospectively be referred to as the [[Angevin Empire]]. As a political entity this was structurally different from the preceding [[House of Normandy|Norman]] and subsequent [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] realms. Geoffrey became [[Duke of Normandy]] in 1144 and died in 1151. In 1152 his heir, Henry, added Aquitaine by virtue of his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Henry also inherited the claim of his mother, [[Empress Matilda]], the daughter of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]], to the English throne, to which he succeeded in 1154 following the death of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=1}}</ref>\n\nHenry was succeeded by his third son, [[Richard I of England|Richard]], whose reputation for martial prowess won him the epithet \"{{lang|fr|C\u0153ur de Lion}}\" or \"Lionheart\".<ref name=\"Turner & Heiser 71\">{{harvnb|Turner|Heiser|2000|p=71}}</ref> He was born and raised in England but spent very little time there during his adult life, perhaps as little as six months. Despite this Richard remains an enduring [[icon]]ic figure both in England and in France, and is one of very few kings of England remembered by his nickname as opposed to [[regnal number]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|1948|p=58}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Richard died, his brother John \u2013 Henry's fifth and only surviving son \u2013 took the throne. In 1204 John lost much of the Angevins' continental territories, including Anjou, to the French crown. He and his successors were still recognized as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|dukes of Aquitaine]]. The loss of Anjou from which the dynasty is named is the rationale behind John's son, [[Henry III of England]], being considered the first [[Plantagenet]] {{ndash}} a name derived from the nickname of his great-grandfather, Geoffrey. Where no distinction is made between the Angevins{{mdash}}and Angevin era{{mdash}}and subsequent English Kings, Henry II is the first Plantagenet king.<ref>{{harvnb| Blockmans|Hoppenbrouwers |2014|p=173}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=15\u201323}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Power|2007|pp=85\u201386}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1991|pp=228\u2013229}}</ref> From John the dynasty continued successfully and unbroken in the senior male line until the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] before dividing into two competing [[cadet branch]]es, the [[House of Lancaster]] and the [[House of York]].\n\n== Terminology ==\n\n===Angevin===\nThe adjective Angevin is especially used in English history to refer to the kings who were also counts of Anjou{{mdash}}beginning with Henry II{{mdash}}descended from Geoffrey and Matilda; their characteristics, descendants and the period of history which they covered from the mid-twelfth to early-thirteenth centuries. In addition it is also used pertaining to Anjou, or any sovereign, government derived from this. As a noun it is used for any native of Anjou or Angevin ruler. As such Angevin is also used for other [[Counts and Dukes of Anjou]]; including the three kings' ancestors, their cousins who held the crown of [[King of Jerusalem#House of Anjou|Jerusalem]] and unrelated later members of the French royal family who were granted the titles to form different dynasties amongst which were the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] and the [[Valois House of Anjou]].<ref>{{OED|Angevin}}</ref>\n\n===Angevin Empire===\n\nThe term \"Angevin Empire\" was coined in 1887 by [[Kate Norgate]]. As far as it is known there was no contemporary name for this assemblage of territories which were referred to{{mdash}}if at all{{mdash}}by clumsy circumlocutions such as ''our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be'' or ''the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father''. Whereas the Angevin part of this term has proved uncontentious the empire portion has proved controversial. In 1986 a convention of historical specialists concluded that there had been no Angevin state and no empire but the term ''espace Plantagenet'' was acceptable.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=2\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n\n[[Image:The Children of Henry2 England.jpg|thumb|right|350px|alt=An illuminated diagram showing the Angevins; coloured lines connect the two to show the lineal descent|Thirteenth-century depiction of the Angevins ([[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and his legitimate children): (''left to right'') [[William IX, Count of Poitiers|William]], [[Henry the Young King|Henry]], [[Richard I of England|Richard]], [[Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony|Matilda]], [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]] and [[John, King of England|John]]]]\nThe Angevins descend from [[Geoffrey II, Count of G\u00e2tinais]] and [[Ermengarde of Anjou, Duchess of Burgundy|Ermengarde of Anjou]]. In 1060 this couple inherited, via [[cognatic kinship]], the county of Anjou from an older line dating from 870 and a noble called [[Ingelger]].<ref name=Davies1997p190>{{harvnb|Davies|1997|p=190}}</ref><ref name=\"vauchezsixtyfive\">{{harvnb|Vauchez|2000|p=65}}</ref> The marriage of Count Geoffrey to Matilda, the only surviving legitimate child of [[Henry I of England]], was part of a struggle for power during the tenth and eleventh centuries among the lords of [[Normandy]], [[Brittany]], [[Poitou]], [[Blois]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and the kings of France. It was from this marriage that Geoffrey's son, Henry, inherited the claims to England, Normandy and Anjou that marks the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties.<ref name=Gillingham7>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=7}}</ref>  This was the third attempt by Geoffrey's father [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk V]] to build a political alliance with Normandy. The first was by marrying his daughter [[Matilda of Anjou|Matilda]] to Henry's heir [[William Adelin]], who drowned in the wreck of the ''[[White Ship]]''. Fulk then married his daughter [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla]] to [[William Clito]], heir to Henry's older brother [[Robert Curthose]], but Henry had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to his lands.<ref name=Davies1999p309>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=309}}</ref>\n\n==Inheritance custom and Angevin practice==\n\nAs society became more prosperous and stable in the 11th century, inheritance customs developed  that allowed daughters (in the absence of sons) to succeed to principalities as well as landed estates. The twelfth-century chronicler [[Ralph de Diceto]] noted that the counts of Anjou extended their dominion over their neighbours by marriage rather than conquest.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=7\u20138}}</ref> The marriage of Geoffrey to the daughter of a king (and widow of an emperor) occurred in this context.  It is unknown whether King Henry intended to make Geoffrey his heir, but it is known that the threat presented by William Clito's rival claim to the duchy of Normandy made his negotiating position very weak. Even so, it is probable that, should the marriage be childless, King Henry would have attempted to be succeeded by one of his Norman kinsmen such as [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]] or [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]] who in the event did seize King Henry's English crown. King Henry's great relief in 1133 at the birth of a son to the couple, described as \"the heir to the Kingdom\", is understandable in the light of this situation. Following this the birth of a second son raised the question of whether custom would be followed with the maternal inheritance passing to first born and the paternal inheritance going to his brother, [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=10\u201312}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[William of Newburgh]] writing in the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey's early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the paternal and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=18}}</ref> Henry's brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 21\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe unity of Henry's assemblage of domains was largely dependent on the ruling family, influencing the opinion of most historians that this instability made it unlikely to endure. The French custom of partible inheritance at the time would lead to political fragmentation. Indeed, if Henry II's sons Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany had not died young, the inheritance of 1189 would have been fundamentally altered. Henry and Richard both planned for partition on their deaths while attempting to provide overriding sovereignty to hold the lands together. For example, in 1173 and 1183 Henry tried to force Richard to acknowledge allegiance to his older brother for the duchy of Aquitaine and later Richard would confiscate Ireland from John. This was complicated by the Angevins' being subjects of the kings of France, who felt these feudal rights of homage and the right of allegiance more legally belonged to them. This was particularly true when the wardship of Geoffrey's son Arthur and lordship of Brittany was contended between 1202 and 1204. On the Young King's death in 1183, Richard became heir in chief, but refused to give up Aquitaine to give John an inheritance. More by accident than design this meant that, while Richard inherited the patrimony, John would become lord of Ireland and Arthur would be duke of Brittany. By the mid-thirteenth century there was a clear unified patrimony and Plantagenet empire but this cannot be called an ''Angevin Empire'' as by this date Anjou and most of the continental lands had been lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=119\u2013121}}</ref>\n\n=={{Anchor|Angevin arrival in England}}Arrival in England==\n[[File:France 1154-en.svg|thumb|right|alt=Multi-coloured map of 12th-century France and southern England|Henry's continental holdings in 1154, showing the lands known as the Angevin Empire in shades of red.]]\nHenry I of England named his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] heir; but when he died in 1135 Matilda was far from England in Anjou or Maine, while her cousin [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] was closer in Boulogne, giving him the advantage he needed to race to England and have himself crowned and anointed king of England.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=13}}</ref>  Matilda's husband Geoffrey, though he had little interest in England, commenced a long struggle for the duchy of Normandy.<ref name=\"Grant\">{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=7}}.</ref> To create a second front Matilda landed in England during 1139 to challenge Stephen, instigating the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. In 1141 she captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|battle of Lincoln]], prompting the collapse of his support.  While Geoffrey pushed on with the conquest of Normandy over the next four years, Matilda threw away her position through arrogance and inability to be magnanimous in victory. She was even forced to release Stephen in a hostage exchange for her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], allowing Stephen to resume control of much of England. Geoffrey never visited England to offer practical assistance but instead sent Henry as a male figurehead{{mdash}}beginning in 1142 when Henry was only 9{{mdash}}with a view that if England was conquered it would be Henry that would become king. In 1150 Geoffrey also transferred the title of Duke of Normandy to Henry but retained the dominant role in governance.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=15\u201318}}</ref> Three fortuitous events allowed Henry to finally bring the conflict to a successful conclusion:\n* In 1151 Count Geoffrey died before having time to complete his plan to divide his inheritance between his sons Henry and [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]], who would have received England and Anjou respectively.\n* [[Louis VII of France]] divorced [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] whom Henry quickly married, greatly increasing his resources and power with the acquisition of [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].\n* In 1153 Stephen's son [[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] died. The disheartened Stephen, who had also recently been widowed, gave up the fight and, with the [[Treaty of Wallingford]], repeated the peace offer that Matilda had rejected in 1142: Stephen would be king for life, Henry his successor, preserving Stephen's second son [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]]'s rights to his family estates. Stephen did not live long and so Henry inherited in late 1154.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=19\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHenry faced many challenges to secure possession of his father's and grandfathers\u2019 lands that required the reassertion and extension of old suzerainties.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=23}}</ref>  In 1162 [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], died, and Henry saw an opportunity to re-establish what he saw as his rights over the church in England by appointing his friend [[Thomas Becket]] to succeed him.  Instead, Becket proved to be an inept politician whose defiance alienated the king and his counsellors.  Henry and Becket clashed repeatedly: over church tenures, Henry's brother's marriage and taxation. Henry reacted by getting Becket, and other members of the English episcopate, to recognise sixteen ancient customs{{mdash}}governing relations between the king, his courts, and the church{{mdash}}in writing for the first time in the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]. When Becket tried to leave the country without permission, Henry attempted to ruin him by laying a number of suits relating to Becket's time as chancellor. In response Becket fled into exile for five years. Relations later improved, allowing Becket's return, but soured again when Becket saw the coronation of Henry's son as [[coregent]] by the [[Archbishop of York]] as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him. When he heard the news, Henry said: \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk.\" Three of Henry's men killed Becket in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] after Becket resisted a botched attempt to arrest him. Within Christian Europe Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket's death. The opinion of this transgression against the church made Henry a pariah, so in penance he walked barefoot into Canterbury Cathedral where he was scourged by monks.<ref>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=142}}</ref>\n\nIn 1171 Henry invaded Ireland to assert his overlordship following alarm at the success of knights he had allowed to recruit soldiers in England and Wales who had assumed the role of colonisers and accrued autonomous power, including [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]]. [[Pope Adrian IV]] had given Henry a papal [[Laudabiliter|blessing]] to expand his power into Ireland to reform the Irish church.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=53}}.</ref>  Originally this would have allowed some territory to be granted to Henry's brother, William, but other matters had distracted Henry and William was now dead.

This angered the 18-year-old Young King who had yet to receive any lands from his father and prompted a [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174|rebellion]] by Henry II's wife and three eldest sons. [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] supported the rebellion to destabilise Henry II. [[William the Lion]] and other subjects of Henry II also joined the revolt and it took 18 months for Henry to force the rebels to submit to his authority.<ref name=Jones2012p82>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=82\u201392}}</ref> In Le Mans in 1182, Henry II gathered his children to plan a [[partible inheritance]] in which his eldest son (also called Henry) would inherit England, Normandy and Anjou; [[Richard I of England|Richard]] the Duchy of Aquitaine; [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] Brittany, and John Ireland. This degenerated into further conflict. [[Henry the Young King|The younger Henry]] rebelled again before he died of [[dysentery]] and, in 1186, Geoffrey died after a tournament accident.

motion of \"moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body\").

Ischemic stroke is the result of a thrombus occluding a blood vessel, restricting blood supply to a particular area of the brain. Other causes of focal damage potentially leading to Wernicke\u2019s aphasia include head trauma, infections affecting the central nervous system, neurodegenerative disease, and neoplasms. <ref name=\":1\" /> A cerebrovascular event is more likely the cause in an acute-onset presentation of aphasia, whereas a degenerative disease should be suspected in aphasia with gradual progression over time.\u00a0<ref name=\":0\" /> Imaging is often useful in identifying a lesion, with most common initial imaging consisting of computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia|title=Aphasia|last=|first=|date=March 6, 2017|website=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Electroencephalography (EEG) can also be useful in patients with transient aphasia, where findings may be due to seizures, although this is a less common cause. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDiagnosis of aphasia, as well as characterization of type of aphasia, is done with language testing by the provider. Testing should evaluate fluency of speech, comprehension, repetition, ability to name objects, and writing skills. <ref name=\":1\" /> Fluency is assessed by observing the patient\u2019s spontaneous speech. Abnormalities in fluency would include shortened phrases, decreased number of words per minute, increased effort with speech, and agrammatism. <ref name=\":0\" /> Patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia should have fluent speech, so abnormalities in fluency may indicate a different type of aphasia. Comprehension is assessed by giving the patient commands to follow, beginning with simple commands and progressing to more complex commands. Repetition is evaluated by having the patient repeat phrases, progressing from simple to more complex phrases. <ref name=\":0\" /> Both comprehension and repetition would be abnormal in Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. Content should also be assessed, by listening to a patient\u2019s spontaneous or instructed speech. Content abnormalities include paraphasic errors and neologisms, both indicative of a diagnosis of Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. <ref name=\":0\" />  Neologisms are novel words that may resemble existing words. Patients with severe Wernicke's aphasia may also produce strings of such neologisms with a few connecting words, known as jargon. Errors in the selection of phonemes of patients with Wernicke's aphasia include addition, omission, or change in position. Another symptom of Wernicke's aphasia is use of semantic [[paraphasia]]s or \"empty speech\" which is the use of generic terms like \"stuff\" or \"things\" to stand in for the specific words that the patient cannot think of. Some Wernicke's aphasia patients also talk around missing words, which is called \"[[circumlocution]].\" Patients with Wernicke's aphasia can tend to run on when they talk, due to circumlocution combined with deficient self-monitoring. This overabundance of words or press of speech can be described as logorrhea. If symptoms are present, a full neurologic exam should also be done, which will help differentiate aphasia from other neurologic diagnoses potentially causing altered mental status with abnormal speech and comprehension. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an example, a patient with Wernicke's aphasia was asked what brought him to the hospital.

range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study carried out at the [[University of Rochester]] in which [[American Sign Language]] native speakers were subject to [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax (relationship is determined by the word order) or inflection (relationship is determined by physical motion of \"moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body\").  Distinct areas of the brain were activated with the frontal cortex (associated with ability to put information into sequences) being more active in the syntax condition and the temporal lobes (associated with dividing information into its constituent parts) being more active in the inflection condition.  However, these areas are not mutually exclusive and show a large amount of overlap.  These findings imply that while speech processing is a very complex process, the brain may be using fairly basic, preexisting computational methods.<ref name=\"Newman2010\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman AJ, Supalla T, Hauser P, Newport EL, Bavelier D | title = Dissociating neural subsystems for grammar by contrasting word order and inflection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 107 | issue = 16 | pages = 7539\u201344 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20368422 | pmc = 2867749 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1003174107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.7539N }}</ref>\n\n==Clinical significance==\n[[File:Wernicke's area animation.gif|thumb|Human brain with Wernicke's area highlighted in red]]\n\n===Aphasia===\n\nWernicke's area is named after [[Carl Wernicke]], a [[Germany|German]] [[neurologist]] and [[psychiatrist]] who, in 1874, hypothesized a link between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables that associated the sensory and motor images of spoken words.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wernicke K. |chapter=The aphasia symptom-complex: A psychological study on an anatomical basis (1875) |editor=Paul Eling |title=Reader in the History of Aphasia: From '''sasi'''(Franz Gall to) |publisher=John Benjamins Pub Co |location=Amsterdam |year=1995 |pages=69\u201389 |isbn=978-90-272-1893-3 |volume=4 }}</ref> He did this on the basis of the location of [[Acquired brain injury|brain injuries]] that caused [[aphasia]]. [[Receptive aphasia]] in which such abilities are preserved is also known as '''Wernicke's aphasia'''. In this condition there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax]]. Language as a result is largely meaningless (a condition sometimes called ''fluent'' or ''[[jargon aphasia]]'').\n\nWernicke\u2019s area receives information from the auditory cortex, and functions to assign word meanings. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia?search=wernicke%27s%20aphasia&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1~4&usage_type=default&display_rank=1|title=Approach to the patient with aphasia|last=Glenn Clark|first=David|date=2018|website=Up To Date|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This is why damage to this area results in meaningless speech, often with paraphasic errors and newly created words or expressions.

Normal sentence structure and prosody are preserved, with normal intonation, inflection, rate ,and rhythm.<ref name=\":1\" /> This differs from Broca\u2019s aphasia, which is characterized by nonfluency. Patients are typically not aware that their speech is impaired in this way, as they have altered comprehension of their speech. Written language, reading, and repetition are affected as well. <ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDamage to the posterior temporal lobe of the dominant hemisphere is the cause of Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. <ref name=\":1\" /> The etiology of this damage can vary greatly, with the most common cause being a cerebrovascular event such as an ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke is the result of a thrombus occluding a blood vessel, restricting blood supply to a particular area of the brain. Other causes of focal damage potentially leading to Wernicke\u2019s aphasia include head trauma, infections affecting the central nervous system, neurodegenerative disease, and neoplasms. <ref name=\":1\" /> A cerebrovascular event is more likely the cause in an acute-onset presentation of aphasia, whereas a degenerative disease should be suspected in aphasia with gradual progression over time.\u00a0<ref name=\":0\" /> Imaging is often useful in identifying a lesion, with most common initial imaging consisting of computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia|title=Aphasia|last=|first=|date=March 6, 2017|website=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Electroencephalography (EEG) can also be useful in patients with transient aphasia, where findings may be due to seizures, although this is a less common cause. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDiagnosis of aphasia, as well as characterization of type of aphasia, is done with language testing by the provider. Testing should evaluate fluency of speech, comprehension, repetition, ability to name objects, and writing skills. <ref name=\":1\" /> Fluency is assessed by observing the patient\u2019s spontaneous speech. Abnormalities in fluency would include shortened phrases, decreased number of words per minute, increased effort with speech, and agrammatism. <ref name=\":0\" /> Patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia should have fluent speech, so abnormalities in fluency may indicate a different type of aphasia. Comprehension is assessed by giving the patient commands to follow, beginning with simple commands and progressing to more complex commands. Repetition is evaluated by having the patient repeat phrases, progressing from simple to more complex phrases. <ref name=\":0\" /> Both comprehension and repetition would be abnormal in Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. Content should also be assessed, by listening to a patient\u2019s spontaneous or instructed speech. Content abnormalities include paraphasic errors and neologisms, both indicative of a diagnosis of Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. <ref name=\":0\" />  Neologisms are novel words that may resemble existing words. Patients with severe Wernicke's aphasia may also produce strings of such neologisms with a few connecting words, known as jargon. Errors in the selection of phonemes of patients with Wernicke's aphasia include addition, omission, or change in position. Another symptom of Wernicke's aphasia is use of semantic [[paraphasia]]s or \"empty speech\" which is the use of generic terms like \"stuff\" or \"things\" to stand in for the specific words that the patient cannot think of. Some Wernicke's aphasia patients also talk around missing words, which is called \"[[circumlocution]].\" Patients with Wernicke's aphasia can tend to run on when they talk, due to circumlocution combined with deficient self-monitoring. This overabundance of words or press of speech can be described as logorrhea. If symptoms are present, a full neurologic exam should also be done, which will help differentiate aphasia from other neurologic diagnoses potentially causing altered mental status with abnormal speech and comprehension. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an example, a patient with Wernicke's aphasia was asked what brought him to the hospital. His response was, \"Is this some of the work that we work as we did before? ... All right ... From when wine [why] I'm here. What\u2019s wrong with me because I ... was myself until the taenz took something about the time between me and my regular time in that time and they took the time in that time here and that\u2019s when the the time took around here and saw me around in it\u2019s started with me no time and I bekan [began] work of nothing else that's the way the doctor find me that way...\"<ref>Akbari, R.

Speech and language therapy is the first line treatment for the aphasia itself, and has a goal of improving language deficits as well as preserving the patient\u2019s remaining language skills. <ref name=\":1\" /> A subsequent critical goal of therapy is to teach the patient how to communicate in alternative ways, so they can successfully communicate in daily life. <ref name=\":1\" /> This may include gestures, pictures, or use of electronic devices. <ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nWhile neuroimaging and lesion evidence generally support the idea that malfunction of or damage to Wernicke's area is common in people with receptive aphasia, this is not always so. Some people may use the right hemisphere for language, and isolated damage of Wernicke's area cortex (sparing white matter and other areas) may not cause severe receptive aphasia.<ref name=\"Bogen\" /><ref>{{cite book |author1=Dronkers NF. |author2=Redfern B B. |author3=Knight R T. |chapter=The neural architecture of language disorders |editor1=Bizzi, Emilio |editor2=Gazzaniga, Michael S. |title=The New cognitive neurosciences |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2000 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newcognitiveneur0000unse/page/949 949\u201358] |isbn=978-0-262-07195-6 |edition=2nd |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/newcognitiveneur0000unse |url=https://archive.org/details/newcognitiveneur0000unse/page/949 }}</ref> Even when patients with Wernicke's area lesions have comprehension deficits, these are usually not restricted to [[language processing in the brain|language processing]] alone.

The A690 road from Durham turns into the A689 leading up through [[Wolsingham]] and [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] into the upper reaches of [[Weardale]] (an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]). Located on the edge of [[Weardale]], Crook is consequently sometimes referred to as the \"Gateway to Weardale\".\n\nThe centre of Crook, a designated conservation area, features a variety of shops and businesses with the market held on Tuesdays and Saturdays. There are two prominent churches, the centrally located St Catherine's CE and Our Lady Immaculate & St Cuthbert's RC on Church Hill. On top of the hills to the east sits Crook Golf Club. For a town of its size Crook also features a good selection of pubs, cafes and restaurants.{{original research inline|date=October 2017}}\n\nCrook is the 10th largest settlement in County Durham and the 35th largest in the [[North East of England]] as of 2016.\n\n==History==\nCrook first appeared as an agricultural village around 1795 although its surrounding districts \u2013 Billy Row, Stanley, White Lea, Roddymoor and Helmington Row \u2013 were established much earlier.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\">[http://www.dur.ac.uk/4schools/Localhistory/history.htm  The development of Crook: some background history<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112031124/http://www.dur.ac.uk/4schools/Localhistory/history.htm |date=12 January 2008 }}</ref> In these days Crook was predominantly farmland; however, it also had an Inn and a blacksmith shop, consequently the primary field of employment was within the agricultural industry. 40 years later; Crook became a mining village, and thrived as the coal was very close to the surface<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/> and soon there were over 20 mines around the Crook area, and by the end of the nineteenth century the town had developed rapidly in population and economy. However a lot of the population in the area had declined in the following century as the coal mines and industries closed with over 34% of the population being unemployed.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/>\n\nCrook's football team, [[Crook Town F.C.]], have won the [[FA Amateur Cup]] five times, most recently beating [[Enfield F.C.]] in 1964, before the cup was abolished in 1974. This record is second only to Crook's near neighbours, [[Bishop Auckland F.C.]]. The club have also reached the third round of the [[FA Cup]] and formed a key role in the development of [[FC Barcelona]], playing a number of friendly matches in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nThe town is also home to oldest purpose built Cinema in the North, built as the Electric Palace and opened on 21 November 1910. Currently the building is a Car Parts and Accessories shop but a group was set up in 2015 with the intention of restoring the building back to a working cinema. Much of the original interior features remain inside.\n\nIn 2014, [[Lidl]] announced they were to open a new store in Crook, on the site of the former [[Co-op Food]] store on New Road, the store opened in June 2017. In September 2016, [[Aldi]] announced plans to open a new store in the town on Elliott street, which was to create 30 new jobs. The store opened in October 2019.\n\n== Landscape ==\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Crook Landscape.jpg\n|height  = 160px\n|alt     = Crook landscape\n|caption = Crook landscape\n}}\nCrook has a backdrop of traditional and modern buildings. The tallest building in the town is the Council Building. It has 5 floors and at about 100&nbsp;ft, it is a prominent feature of the Crook skyline. However, the council building is dwarfed by Crook's surrounding hills, which completely surround the town except on the south side. The tallest stands at 300 metres above the town, about 980&nbsp;ft. The highest point in the town is on West Road where the height is 210 metres (about 690&nbsp;ft).\n\nApproximately 2 miles to the west of Crook on the A689 towards Wolsingham and Weardale, 400 yards past the roundabout junction with the A68, is the surviving [[World War II]] [[Harperley POW Camp 93]], a ''Scheduled Ancient Monument'' within [[English Heritage]].\n\n== Landmarks ==\n[[File:The Devil's Stone a.k.a.

The A690 road from Durham turns into the A689 leading up through [[Wolsingham]] and [[Stanhope, County Durham|Stanhope]] into the upper reaches of [[Weardale]] (an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]). Located on the edge of [[Weardale]], Crook is consequently sometimes referred to as the \"Gateway to Weardale\".\n\nThe centre of Crook, a designated conservation area, features a variety of shops and businesses with the market held on Tuesdays and Saturdays. There are two prominent churches, the centrally located St Catherine's CE and Our Lady Immaculate & St Cuthbert's RC on Church Hill. On top of the hills to the east sits Crook Golf Club. For a town of its size Crook also features a good selection of pubs, cafes and restaurants.{{original research inline|date=October 2017}}\n\nCrook is the 10th largest settlement in County Durham and the 35th largest in the [[North East of England]] as of 2016.\n\n==History==\nCrook first appeared as an agricultural village around 1795 although its surrounding districts \u2013 Billy Row, Stanley, White Lea, Roddymoor and Helmington Row \u2013 were established much earlier.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\">[http://www.dur.ac.uk/4schools/Localhistory/history.htm  The development of Crook: some background history<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112031124/http://www.dur.ac.uk/4schools/Localhistory/history.htm |date=12 January 2008 }}</ref> In these days Crook was predominantly farmland; however, it also had an Inn and a blacksmith shop, consequently the primary field of employment was within the agricultural industry. 40 years later; Crook became a mining village, and thrived as the coal was very close to the surface<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/> and soon there were over 20 mines around the Crook area, and by the end of the nineteenth century the town had developed rapidly in population and economy. However a lot of the population in the area had declined in the following century as the coal mines and industries closed with over 34% of the population being unemployed.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/>\n\nCrook's football team, [[Crook Town F.C.]], have won the [[FA Amateur Cup]] five times, most recently beating [[Enfield F.C.]] in 1964, before the cup was abolished in 1974. This record is second only to Crook's near neighbours, [[Bishop Auckland F.C.]]. The club have also reached the third round of the [[FA Cup]] and formed a key role in the development of [[FC Barcelona]], playing a number of friendly matches in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nThe town is also home to oldest purpose built Cinema in the North, built as the Electric Palace and opened on 21 November 1910. Currently the building is a Car Parts and Accessories shop but a group was set up in 2015 with the intention of restoring the building back to a working cinema. Much of the original interior features remain inside.\n\nIn 2014, [[Lidl]] announced they were to open a new store in Crook, on the site of the former [[Co-op Food]] store on New Road, the store opened in June 2017. In September 2016, [[Aldi]] announced plans to open a new store in the town on Elliott street, which was to create 30 new jobs. The store opened in October 2019.\n\n== Landscape ==\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Crook Landscape.jpg\n|height  = 160px\n|alt     = Crook landscape\n|caption = Crook landscape\n}}\nCrook has a backdrop of traditional and modern buildings. The tallest building in the town is the Council Building. It has 5 floors and at about 100&nbsp;ft, it is a prominent feature of the Crook skyline. However, the council building is dwarfed by Crook's surrounding hills, which completely surround the town except on the south side. The tallest stands at 300 metres above the town, about 980&nbsp;ft. The highest point in the town is on West Road where the height is 210 metres (about 690&nbsp;ft).\n\nApproximately 2 miles to the west of Crook on the A689 towards Wolsingham and Weardale, 400 yards past the roundabout junction with the A68, is the surviving [[World War II]] [[Harperley POW Camp 93]], a ''Scheduled Ancient Monument'' within [[English Heritage]].\n\n== Landmarks ==\n[[File:The Devil's Stone a.k.a.

The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Forth Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point called Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the entire valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountains in the south and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the Woodstock Tower, which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain offering panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley. Woodstock Tower is a historic observation post built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley on the east, over Massanutten Mountain, from Camp Roosevelt to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]].

The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==History==\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley from the north, at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible last stand against the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. The [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's plans unnecessary.\n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley that offers sweeping and unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as a strategic military observation post. The observation post can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It's accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace.\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Landforms of Shenandoah County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Valleys of Virginia]]\n\n\n{{ShenandoahCountyVA-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2014}}\n{{Infobox valley\n| name = Fort Valley\n| photo = Fort_Valley_air.jpg\n| photo_caption = Air photo of Fort Valley, facing south, with the North (right) and South (left) Forks of the [[Shenandoah River]] visible.

The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley that offers sweeping and unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as a strategic military observation post. The observation post can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It's accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace.\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Landforms of Shenandoah County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Valleys of Virginia]]\n\n\n{{ShenandoahCountyVA-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Woodrusher", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Valley_(Virginia)"}

The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Roy Huggins]] and [[John Pogue]]. The film is a spin-off to the 1993 motion picture ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', which in turn was based on the [[The Fugitive (TV series)|television series of the same name]], created by Huggins. The story does not involve the character of [[Dr. Richard Kimble]], portrayed by [[Harrison Ford]] in the initial film, but instead the plot centers on United States Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, once again played by [[Tommy Lee Jones]]. The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive, Mark Sheridan, played by [[Wesley Snipes]], who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal. The cast features [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], [[Daniel Roebuck]], [[Thomas Mills Wood|Tom Wood]], and [[LaTanya Richardson]], several of whom portrayed Deputy Marshals in the previous film.\n\nThe film was a co-production between [[Warner Bros.]] and Kopelson Entertainment. The score was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]].\n\n''U.S. Marshals'' premiered in theaters in the United States on March 6, 1998, grossing $57 million in its domestic run. The film took in an additional $45 million through international release for a worldwide total of $102 million. The film was generally met with mixed critical reviews. The film was released on home video on July 21, 1998.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agents are killed while trying to intercept a briefcase exchange taking place in a [[United Nations]] parking garage. The murders are caught on a security camera, but the criminal escapes with top secret information.\n\nMonths later, tow truck driver Mark Warren is arrested for an illegal weapons possession charge following a vehicular collision in Chicago. Through a fingerprint check, the police determine that he is actually federal fugitive Mark Roberts, wanted for a homicide. Roberts boards a prisoner transport aircraft back to New York, sharing the flight with Deputy [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Samuel Gerard, who is escorting prisoners unrelated to Roberts' case. Roberts thwarts an assassination attempt by a Chinese prisoner with an [[improvised firearm]], but the bullet pierces a window and depressurizes the cabin, forcing an emergency landing which leads to a crash in Southern Illinois . Gerard discovers Roberts has fled the crash site. DSS Special Agent John Royce is assigned to join Gerard's team to hunt Roberts.\n\nRoberts flees to New York City. There, he secures money, weapons and fake identification. Roberts also begins conducting surveillance on a Chinese diplomat named Xiang Chen. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux as well as the airplane mechanic who hid the zip gun, whom the Marshals find murdered by Chen. Gerard and his colleagues watch the surveillance footage of the murders in the parking garage and realize that Roberts acted in self-defense and was wearing gloves; thus couldn't have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as was earlier claimed. Confronted with the evidence, DSS Director Bertram Lamb informs Gerard that Mark Roberts is in fact Mark Sheridan, a former [[CIA]] [[Special Activities Division]] operative and a former [[Force Recon]] Marine, that went rogue during an investigation to uncover a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within the U.S. State Department that had been selling covert secrets to China. Chen was the contact delivering the money to Sheridan for the information and when DSS agents tried to apprehend him, Sheridan killed them in resistance and fled the scene.\n\nEventually, Gerard and his team catch up with Sheridan in Queens Hill Cemetery where he meets with, and threatens to expose, DSS Special Agent Frank Barrows as one of the conspirators who framed him. Chen tries to assassinate Sheridan as he leaves the cemetery, but inadvertently kills Barrows instead. Sheridan flees to a retirement home followed by Gerard, Royce and Deputy Marshal Noah Newman. Meanwhile, Chen is caught and detained by Deputy Marshals Savannah Cooper and Bob Biggs. At the senior care facility, Newman overhears a physical struggle and walks into a room where he witnesses Royce holding Sheridan at gunpoint. Royce suddenly shoots Newman with his gun and later lies to his associates, claiming Sheridan shot Newman. Sheridan escapes by jumping from the building onto the roof of a passing train. Newman dies of his gunshot wound.\n\nAfter retrieving fingerprints from an abandoned vehicle at a marine loading dock, Gerard tracks down Sheridan on a freighter bound for Canada. During a scuffle between Sheridan and Gerard aboard the vessel, Royce shoots Sheridan, injuring him. Sheridan is later taken into custody. Gerard begins to suspect Royce may be the mole when he notices the firearm that shot Newman had its serial number filed off (in an attempt to hide it), was actually Royce's own gun earlier. Left alone to guard Sheridan's hospital room, Royce wakes Sheridan up to murder him just as Gerard steps in and kills Royce first. After leaving the hospital, Sheridan's charges are dropped as he is exonerated and released from custody.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Wesleysnipes cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wesley Snipes, who portrayed Mark Sheridan.]]\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Mark J.

The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Roy Huggins]] and [[John Pogue]]. The film is a spin-off to the 1993 motion picture ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', which in turn was based on the [[The Fugitive (TV series)|television series of the same name]], created by Huggins. The story does not involve the character of [[Dr. Richard Kimble]], portrayed by [[Harrison Ford]] in the initial film, but instead the plot centers on United States Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, once again played by [[Tommy Lee Jones]]. The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive, Mark Sheridan, played by [[Wesley Snipes]], who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal. The cast features [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], [[Daniel Roebuck]], [[Thomas Mills Wood|Tom Wood]], and [[LaTanya Richardson]], several of whom portrayed Deputy Marshals in the previous film.\n\nThe film was a co-production between [[Warner Bros.]] and Kopelson Entertainment. The score was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]].\n\n''U.S. Marshals'' premiered in theaters in the United States on March 6, 1998, grossing $57 million in its domestic run. The film took in an additional $45 million through international release for a worldwide total of $102 million. The film was generally met with mixed critical reviews. The film was released on home video on July 21, 1998.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agents are killed while trying to intercept a briefcase exchange taking place in a [[United Nations]] parking garage. The murders are caught on a security camera, but the criminal escapes with top secret information.\n\nMonths later, tow truck driver Mark Warren is arrested for an illegal weapons possession charge following a vehicular collision in Chicago. Through a fingerprint check, the police determine that he is actually federal fugitive Mark Roberts, wanted for a homicide. Roberts boards a prisoner transport aircraft back to New York, sharing the flight with Deputy [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Samuel Gerard, who is escorting prisoners unrelated to Roberts' case. Roberts thwarts an assassination attempt by a Chinese prisoner with an [[improvised firearm]], but the bullet pierces a window and depressurizes the cabin, forcing an emergency landing which leads to a crash in Southern Illinois . Gerard discovers Roberts has fled the crash site. DSS Special Agent John Royce is assigned to join Gerard's team to hunt Roberts.\n\nRoberts flees to New York City. There, he secures money, weapons and fake identification. Roberts also begins conducting surveillance on a Chinese diplomat named Xiang Chen. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux as well as the airplane mechanic who hid the zip gun, whom the Marshals find murdered by Chen. Gerard and his colleagues watch the surveillance footage of the murders in the parking garage and realize that Roberts acted in self-defense and was wearing gloves; thus couldn't have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as was earlier claimed. Confronted with the evidence, DSS Director Bertram Lamb informs Gerard that Mark Roberts is in fact Mark Sheridan, a former [[CIA]] [[Special Activities Division]] operative and a former [[Force Recon]] Marine, that went rogue during an investigation to uncover a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within the U.S. State Department that had been selling covert secrets to China. Chen was the contact delivering the money to Sheridan for the information and when DSS agents tried to apprehend him, Sheridan killed them in resistance and fled the scene.\n\nEventually, Gerard and his team catch up with Sheridan in Queens Hill Cemetery where he meets with, and threatens to expose, DSS Special Agent Frank Barrows as one of the conspirators who framed him. Chen tries to assassinate Sheridan as he leaves the cemetery, but inadvertently kills Barrows instead. Sheridan flees to a retirement home followed by Gerard, Royce and Deputy Marshal Noah Newman. Meanwhile, Chen is caught and detained by Deputy Marshals Savannah Cooper and Bob Biggs. At the senior care facility, Newman overhears a physical struggle and walks into a room where he witnesses Royce holding Sheridan at gunpoint. Royce suddenly shoots Newman with his gun and later lies to his associates, claiming Sheridan shot Newman. Sheridan escapes by jumping from the building onto the roof of a passing train. Newman dies of his gunshot wound.\n\nAfter retrieving fingerprints from an abandoned vehicle at a marine loading dock, Gerard tracks down Sheridan on a freighter bound for Canada. During a scuffle between Sheridan and Gerard aboard the vessel, Royce shoots Sheridan, injuring him. Sheridan is later taken into custody. Gerard begins to suspect Royce may be the mole when he notices the firearm that shot Newman had its serial number filed off (in an attempt to hide it), was actually Royce's own gun earlier. Left alone to guard Sheridan's hospital room, Royce wakes Sheridan up to murder him just as Gerard steps in and kills Royce first. After leaving the hospital, Sheridan's charges are dropped as he is exonerated and released from custody.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Wesleysnipes cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wesley Snipes, who portrayed Mark Sheridan.]]\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Mark J.
