A total of five seasons of the series have been released: 4 seasons on the internet, and 1 season on television. \n\nIn 1999, the crew began the series with a pilot episode. The pilot was named ''Banjo Frenzy'', which featured a blue dinosaur, a sky blue squirrel, a yellow rabbit and a purple beaver. The first official episode was named ''Spin Fun Knowin' Ya!'' and featured later versions of the dinosaur, the rabbit, the squirrel and the beaver and, from that point on, the crew began introducing new characters to the show. It quickly became an internet phenomenon featuring millions of visits per episode. The ''Happy Tree Friends'' television series aired on [[G4 (American TV channel)|G4]] in the United States in 2006. It also aired on [[G4 (Canadian TV channel)|G4]] and [[MTV2 (Canadian TV channel)|Razer]] in Canada in 2007.\n\nA spin-off called ''Ka-Pow!'' debuted on September 2008. In 2010, after airing fifteen episodes for the third web season, a hiatus began, in which there were only Break shorts airing with a [[subliminal message]] at the end of each, which reads \"Happy Tree Friends is dead!\". This situation concerned many fans because they thought that the series were going to end soon. The writers confirmed that they were playing a joke on the fact that the characters die a lot and made a pun phrase with the word \"dead\". The hiatus ended on December 8, 2011 and the series returned once again with the fifteenth episode of the third season, which was named \"Clause for Concern\".\n\nIn addition to the show's five seasons and a spin-off, there have been some special episodes and shorts. These include eleven \"Smoochies\", ten \"Kringles\", thirteen \"Break\" shorts, five \"Love Bites\", and sixteen other irregular episodes that are unindexed. The \"Smoochie\" shorts involve three different items being dropped next to a main character, only for them to be killed in three different ways, each regarding the item. These have been adapted into the ''Happy Tree Friends'' website where one can choose an item to drop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Smoochies |url=http://htf.atom.com/index.php/category/playground/playthings/smoochies/ |publisher=HTF.atom.com |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}</ref> The \"Kringle\" shorts are [[Christmas]]-themed shorts that feature the main characters doing various Christmas-related tasks, only to be killed in various ways.<ref>{{cite web |title=Happy Tree Friends \u2013 Kringles |url=http://htf.atom.com/index.php/category/episodes/kringles |publisher=HTF.atom.com |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}</ref> The \"Love Bites\" were [[Valentine's Day]]-themed shorts, that went with the basic structure of a ''Happy Tree Friends'' episode. The \"Break\" shorts were produced in 2008, when no new episodes were produced until the following year. A new break short debuted in 2009.\n\n==Series overview==\n<!-- Full linking is used in the following table because it is transcluded to the main series article -->\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n|released      = y\n\n| color1       = ##000000\n| link1        = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Season 1 (1999\u20132001)\n| episodes1    = 27\n| start1       = {{Start date|1999|12|24}}\n| end1         = {{End date|2001|10|20}}\n| network1     = [[Mondo Media]]\n\n| color2       = #FF7F00\n| link2        = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Season 2 (2001\u20132005)\n| episodes2    = 28\n| start2       = {{Start date|2001|10|27}}\n| end2         = {{End date|2005|12|15}}\n\n| color2S      = #AC1F24\n| link2S       = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Television series (2006)\n| linkT2S      = TV series\n| episodes2S   = 39\n| start2S      = {{Start date|2006|9|25}}\n| end2S        = {{End date|2006|12|25}}\n| network2S    = [[G4 (American TV channel)|G4]]\n\n| color3       = #FFFF00\n| link3        = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Season 3 (2007\u20132013)\n| episodes3    = 24\n| start3       = {{Start date|2007|10|24}}\n| end3         = {{End date|2013|3|29}}\n| network3     = [[Mondo Media]]<br/>[[YouTube]]\n\n| color4       = #40E0D0\n| link4        = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Season 4 (2013\u20132014)\n| episodes4    = 9\n| start4       = {{Start date|2013|6|14}}\n| end4         = {{End date|2014|3|6}}\n\n| color5       = #009E60\n| link5        = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Season 5: Still Alive (2016)\n| linkT5       = ''Still Alive''\n| episodes5    = 5\n| start5       = {{Start date|2016|12|7}}\n| end5         = {{End date|2016|12|22}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Internet shorts==\n===Season 1 (1999\u20132001)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=#000000|overall=1|season=|released=1|title=20|director=14|writer=15|airdate=20|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=Spin Fun Knowin' Ya!\n|DirectedBy= [[Rhode Montijo]]\n|WrittenBy= [[Warren Graff]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|12|24}}\n|ShortSummary= Lumpy is spinning a playground merry-go-round with Cuddles, Toothy and Giggles on it.

When he's out of soda, he looks closely at the neck of the bottle, only to have Sniffles' head hit the back of his head. Handy jerks back his head in anguish as the bottle is now lodged into one of his eye sockets. Inside the bottle, Handy's eye rattles around. His nubs try in vain to remove the bottle from his head, but unfortunately all he can do is scream in pain. \nMoral: \"Laughter is the best medicine!\"\n|LineColor=1B4054\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=25\n|EpisodeNumber2=25\n|Title=Snow What?

She turns around to find Cro-Marmot standing next to her with a stack of snowballs at his side. Giggles says hello to him and decides to play along. She makes a snowball and throws it at Cro-Marmot. Unfortunately, the amount of pressure causes Cro-Marmot to slide down a nearby cliff. Realizing this, Giggles screams in horror and runs down to stop him. Down the cliff, Petunia can be seen making a snow angel, when suddenly, Cro-Marmot slides by and runs over her. This causes Petunia's lower body to rip off (which causes several of her organs to rip off as well), leaving only her upper body intact. Giggles then comes by and quickly runs over her remains. Further down the slope, Lumpy can be seen relaxing on a hammock, apparently getting his holidays mixed up when he's wearing beach attire. Cro-Marmot slides by, and causes his hammock to wrap around him tightly, squeezing out a large quantity of blood. When Giggles passes by, she unravels the hammock and when it opens, a mangled up Lumpy begins to groan in pain. Giggles manages to catch up with Cro-Marmot, and screams in horror when she realizes that Cro-Marmot is heading straight towards a tree. Running at full speed, she moves right in front of Cro-Marmot just before hitting the tree. Giggles gives a big sigh of relief, and laughs it off, when suddenly, some snow falls on top of her nose. She looks up to find icicles about to melt off. Giggles screams, as two average sized icicles impale her eyes, and a third, rather large icicle crushes her entire forehead. As she still stands, Cro-Marmot throws one last snowball at her. \nMoral: \"Never eat the last cookie!\"\n|LineColor=1B4054\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=26\n|EpisodeNumber2=26\n|Title=This Is Your Knife\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Mark Fiorenza, Warren Graff, Rhode Montijo, Kenn Navarro & Paul Allan\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2001|4|14}}\n|ShortSummary= On a clear, starlit night in the middle of the woods, Cuddles, Giggles, and Flaky are sitting around a campfire, apparently on a camping trip. Cuddles watches the fire, Giggles eats a sandwich, and Flaky roasts marshmallows on a stick. Moments later, Flippy walks by, and the gang greets him. Cuddles then encourages Flippy to take a seat and enjoy the fire. However, the moment Flippy sits down and begins to warm his hands with the fire, some sparks fly out, and nearly hit Flippy. Flippy stares into the fire, and since this bright energy reminds Flippy of the war, Flippy emerges into his evil side, Fliqpy. Seeing Flippy flip out, Cuddles laughs nervously and says hello to Fliqpy again in hopes that he will turn back into Flippy. Unfortunately, Flippy's evil side still remains, Fliqpy jumps through the campfire, and slashes Cuddles' face away with a rock, knocking out two of his teeth as well as one of his eyes. Giggles, who is still eating her sandwich, gets Cuddles' blood splattered all over her body, making her scream in shock. As Cuddles sits on the ground, dead, Fliqpy uses his Bowie knife to cut a large hole on Cuddles' stomach, and pulls out Cuddles' intestines. Fliqpy then uses these intestines to snag Giggles by her neck, and he continuously yanks on the intestines up to the point where Giggles gets strangled to death. Flaky, having witnessed Cuddles and Giggles' deaths, lets out a shriek of panic and takes cover in her sleeping bag. As Flaky hugs her knees in fear inside her sleeping bag, she notices that she is getting lifted into the air. Outside, it turns out that Fliqpy is raising Flaky into the air. Fliqpy lets out an evil chuckle, and tosses Flaky's bag into the campfire. Flaky begins to scream loudly as the fire slowly burns her body. Fliqpy then begins to laugh evilly, just before bringing out some marshmallows on a stick, and holding it over the fire, not caring about Flaky's screams of pain. \nMoral: \"Plant a tree!\"\n|LineColor=1B4054\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=27\n|EpisodeNumber2=27\n|Title=Happy Trails\n|RTitle=<small> (Part 1)</small>\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Mark Fiorenza, Warren Graff, Rhode Montijo, Kenn Navarro & Paul Allan\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2001|10|20}}\n|ShortSummary= The Happy Tree Friends are riding in a school bus, and everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. Drinking juice, sticking their heads out the windows, and enjoying a snack of peanuts means everyone is having a great time, even though they did not get ready, follow directions, be cool, or participate. Lumpy is driving the bus, but he gets distracted by Petunia who has had one juice box too many and needs to use the bathroom. Lumpy orders her to sit back down. While doing so, the bus runs over a bump in the road. Deterioration of the characters' lives comes to existence! The first victim is Cuddles. Cuddles' window quickly closes while he is leaning out the window, detaching his hands from his arms and slicing him in half in the process. The bus hits another bump just as Mime tosses a peanut up into his mouth, causing him to choke due to the nut going down the wrong pipe (or because of his shock of seeing Cuddles dead). Mime fails to get a napping Sniffles' attention, so he tries waving to Lumpy for help. Not noticing that Mime is choking, Lumpy gets up from the driver's seat while the bus is still in motion and goes to reprimand Mime for causing a disturbance. As Mime suffocates, Petunia points out that the bus is headed for a curvy portion of the road with a cliff drop-off nearby. Lumpy and Petunia embrace each other in fear as Petunia urinates herself all over the floor in fright. The bus runs over the Cursed Idol, which causes Petunia to lose her balance. She falls on and gets impaled by the gear lever of the bus. Lumpy tries to shift gears, but this causes the hole in Petunia's torso to expand. Lumpy cannot get the gears to move where he wants it, and as a result, the bus goes flying off a cliff, hitting two birds, flinging Toothy out the window, and leaving the rest of the students screaming in horror! \nMoral: \"Keep your promises!\"\n|LineColor=1B4054\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2 (2001\u20132005)===\n{{Expand section|Plot summaries|date=January 2020}}\n{{Episode table\n|background=#FF7F00|overall=1|season=|released=1|title=20|director=14|writer=12|airdate=20|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=28\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=Happy Trails\n|RTitle=<small> (Part 2: Jumping The Shark)</small>\n|DirectedBy= [[Rhode Montijo]]\n|WrittenBy= [[Mark Fiorenza]], [[Warren Graff]], [[Rhode Montijo]], [[Kenn Navarro]] & [[Paul Allan]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2001|10|27}}\n|ShortSummary= After the events of the previous episode, the survivors are stranded on a deserted island. The bus is in shambles, the ocean is shark-infested, and many have died in the accident. Flippy creates small graves for those who died in the crash, while the others look on mournfully. The next day, Giggles happily catches a fish in the ocean for food, using a long pointed stick as a makeshift spear. a Jellyfish swims by and zaps her left foot, causing her to shriek in pain and curiously observe the bump on her foot. Later that day; during night, Giggles is suffering from extreme chills, wrapped in a blanket, and her stung foot is incredibly swollen. The scene cuts to Flippy sadly pounding down another grave with Giggles' bow tied around it, indicating that she died of hypothermia. When Flippy is done pounding in Giggles' grave, Lifty and Shifty reveal they have an inflatable raft the group can escape on. As the group sails away from the island as Lifty and Shifty paddle with their hands, everyone is relieved and in good spirits. Unfortunately, as Flaky sits down, her quills pop the raft, causing the raft to start sinking as a shark swims along. The group hurriedly swims back to the island, but Lifty and Shifty are taken and eaten by the shark. As everybody catches their breath, Flaky looks on nervously at her fellow members, who are obviously furious at her for popping their only ride home. As the scene changes to night, Flippy laughs evilly as he pounds Flaky's grave into the sand, while the others watch on the background with evil expressions, implying that at least one of them killed Flaky. The next day, the school bus and the tree on the island are gone and in their place stands a rocket ship made up of the bus parts. The group boards their creation with makeshift helmets made of coconuts, and they lift-off, singing the theme song as they go. Eventually, the rocket stops moving upwards. They throw several weighty objects out of the rocket, one of which being Lumpy, and the rocket continues upwards. Sadly, now the rocket moves too fast and it is headed towards the sun. Sniffles' head explodes as they get closer to the sun, while Handy and Flippy are suffering from second and/or third-degree burns. Back on Earth, Lumpy makes the best of his situation by relaxing in a chair and holding his sock over a fire. A \"puff!\" suddenly appears in the sun, indicating that the rocket ship made contact with the sun, without Lumpy even noticing. As the episode ends, Lumpy begins applying sunscreen to his arm. \nMoral: \"Give but never give up!\"\n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=29\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|Title=Eye Candy\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Warren Graff, Rhode Montijo & Kenn Navarro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2002|9|8}}\n|ShortSummary= Toothy is cheerfully running through the forest, holding a large yellow lollipop in front of him. His happiness ends soon as he trips over a log, causing the lollipop to get lodged in his eye socket. Screaming, he pulls on the lollipop's stick, causing his eye and the optic nerve, still connected to his head, to fly out of his eye socket and get tangled around a tree branch. Toothy tries pulling on his optic nerve, but fails to get his eyeball down from the branch. Whining and wailing in pain, he begins climbing the tree. When he reaches the branch his eyeball is resting on, we get a view of how difficult it is for Toothy to see with both of his eyes pointed in different directions. Toothy reaches for his eye, but unfortunately, a woodpecker lands on the branch and starts pecking his eyeball. Recoiling from the pain, Toothy loses his balance and falls off the tree, which is revealed to have been located on the edge of a cliff, causing Toothy to dangle from the branch of a tree off a cliff from only his optic nerve (which acts as a bungee cord). Toothy tries climbing back up his optic nerve, but he loses his grip and slides down again. Ultimately, Toothy's brain is pulled out from his eye socket, followed by his other eye as Toothy falls to the ground a few feet below him.

Flaky nearly falls over, and she hugs the wall for safety. But when someone quickly skates past Flaky, she gets filled with determination, and lets go of the wall. Flaky begins to get the hang of it, but not for long, as Disco Bear skates in and carelessly pushes Flaky aside. Elsewhere in the rink, Lumpy is seen cleaning the rink with a floor buffer in his underwear. Suddenly, Flaky comes by, and she falls under Lumpy's floor buffer. As Flaky gets sucked in, her body begins rubbing against the floor at a fast speed that kills her, and soon her quills begin to fly all over the place. As Disco Bear skates along, Flaky's quills suddenly come in and puncture Disco Bear all over his face and torso, which kills him. Meanwhile, Lumpy can no longer contain the malfunctioning buffer, and the brushes get cemented to the floor. Because of this, Lumpy is now getting twirled all over the place just before he gets flung away. At the arcade of the rink, Cub can be seen playing at a claw machine. Suddenly, Lumpy comes in and his body crashes through the machine. As a dazed Lumpy regains consciousness, he notices the claw machine's hook hovering over his body. It comes down, punctures his chest, and pulls out his heart. As Lumpy screams at the loss of his heart, he suddenly passes out and dies.

Petunia is hard at work cooking the burgers, while Cuddles and Giggles are eating together. Cuddles tries to squirt some ketchup on their fries, but he accidentally squirts it on Giggles. At just that moment, a happy and hungry Flippy opens the door. He sees Giggles covered in ketchup and suddenly goes into a trance. Though Cuddles and Giggles laugh about the incident, Flippy believes that she has been injured, causing him to react and in result, he sees Giggles dead with blood all around her in the background as Flippy flips out and shows his scary, evil face at the audience, now turned into Fliqpy. Fliqpy jumps over to their table and flips it over, causing fries to fly everywhere. Cuddles turns his attention to Fliqpy, but he doesn't seem too worried as he continues sipping on his drink through a straw. Fliqpy grabs Cuddles' straw and uses it to stab him in the heart. Blood starts pouring out of the straw and, in a panic, Cuddles drinks his blood through the straw to get the blood back into his body, but this doesn't work, and he soon dies. Giggles screams and looks around the room, having lost sight of Fliqpy. He emerges above her and shoves a ketchup bottle in one of her ears and a mustard bottle in the other. He squeezes both bottles as hard as he can, causing ketchup and mustard to pour out of her nose, killing her. Next, Fliqpy goes behind the grill where Petunia is standing. He grabs her by the back of the head with her screaming and shoves her face down on the burger grill, causing her to scream in anguish. Laughing, he pulls her head up and we see that the grease has melted her face onto the grill, exposing the nerves of her face. As Petunia is still screaming, Fliqpy shoves her face back onto the grill, burning the exposing nerves of her face with her screaming. Outside the building, Petunia is heard screaming but stops (indicating that she had died). Pop and Cub get ready to enter. Before they can open the door, however, the front of the building explodes, crushing the two beneath the door. Fliqpy lands on the ground, just before the fries. Seeing a pool of Cuddles' blood, Fliqpy grabs a fry and dips it in the blood, mistaking it for ketchup. Fliqpy eats the fry and sighs contently upon tasting the blood. \nMoral: \"You are what you eat!\"\n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=32\n|EpisodeNumber2=5\n|Title=Get Whale Soon\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Warren Graff, Rhode Montijo & Kenn Navarro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2002|9|29}}\n|ShortSummary= Russell happily sits in his boat, humming and holding a harpoon. As he looks through his telescope, he realizes he's floating in the open mouth of a giant whale. Having no time to react, Russell gets eaten, plunging him into darkness. Inside the whale with darkness surrounding him, Russell lights a match to light up his surroundings. He finds a road raged Lumpy sitting in his car and honking his horn, unaware that he is in a whale's stomach. Lumpy turns on his car's headlights and they both see that they have no way out. Russell, however, gets an idea. They bundle some sticks together and Russell pulls out a box of matches. Looking inside, they see there's only one match left. After several unsuccessful attempts, Russell manages to light the match, only for Lumpy to sneeze it out, angering Russell. Next, Lumpy lifts Russell up to the whale's uvula. Russell stabs it and pulls on it with his hook, making the two laugh. This only succeeds in making the whale vomit all over them. Disheartened, Russell and Lumpy find a new hope when they look up and see the whale's blowhole. Russell throws his harpoon towards the blowhole, but unfortunately he misses and the falling object accidentally pierces Lumpy's head, killing him. Russell starts to go insane, and begins using his hook to slash the inside of the whale's stomach. The whale, feeling the pain of Russell's hook, fires Russell out of its blowhole. At first, Russell is still laughing and slashing around like a maniac while in mid-air, but he rejoices upon learning that he's free. Sadly, Russell falls from the sky and his head gets impaled on the mast of a nearby ship.

Cub sees the shiny scissors and tries to reach for them. Pop slaps his hand away, forbidding him to touch them. Pop removes Cub's beanie to reveal that Cub has a full head of long, flowing hair. Pop begins cutting Cub's hair with the scissors, but stops when he accidentally cuts Cub's right ear off. Cub begins to scream and cry in pain and Pop starts panicking as blood spurts out of Cub's wound. The scene fades to black. The scene then fades back to Cub happily licking a lollipop while wearing bandages over the right side of his head. Pop proudly looks at Cub and then looks for the electric shaver, which he has apparently misplaced. He hears a buzzing sound and looks up to see a laughing Cub, who now has a flap of skin detached from his forehead, holding the shaver, while Cub appears not to care about his loss. A panicked Pop rushes over and grabs the shaver, quickly turning it off. Pop then cautiously combs and pushes down on the loose flap of skin on Cub's head without any cries or protests from the child. Satisfied, Pop tries to turn the shaver back on, but to no avail. He sees that the shaver has become unplugged, so, setting the shaver down next to Cub, he goes to plug it back in. Cub starts playing with the shaver, and puts it in his mouth to suck on it. Pop plugs the shaver back in, and it starts tearing the inside of Cub's mouth, throat, and eventually his esophagus to pieces. Cub falls face down on his highchair deadly, while an oblivious Pop searches for his scissors. Locating them, Pop cuts a lock of Cub's hair, brushes some loose hair from his head, and places Cub's beanie back on his son's head, still unaware that his son is dead. \nMoral:\"Don't run with scissors!\" \n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=34\n|EpisodeNumber2=7\n|Title=Eyes Cold Lemonade\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Rhode Montijo, Kenn Navarro, [[Jeff Biancalana]] & [[David Winn]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|12|26}}\n|ShortSummary= Giggles and Petunia happily sit at their lemonade stand, awaiting customers. Petunia sighs contentedly, and Giggles pours her some lemonade. Petunia gladly drinks it. Giggles notices that they are out of lemonade, so she grabs a knife and a lemon so she could make some more. She gets ready to cut into the lemon, but she makes sure to move her finger to avoid accidentally cutting herself. After slicing the lemon in half, Giggles notices that a nail from the lemonade stand's sign has fallen off. She looks up to see that part of the sign has become detached from the stand. The sign swoops down in front of her, slicing her face off. Giggles screams in pain, causing Petunia to spit out her lemonade all over Giggles' face in shock. The citric acid from the lemonade burns the inside of Giggles' face, and she screams in pain, again. Later on, we see that Petunia has reset the sign, only now with far more nails than before and in a sloppy manner. Satisfied with her work, Petunia starts squeezing lemons again. Meanwhile, Giggles, who has bandages wrapped around most of her face, including both of her eyes, ignores her injury and continues to work. She blindly reaches for a lemon and manages to slice it in half. Another nail falls from the sign, only now from the other side. The sign begins sliding downwards towards Petunia. Petunia notices this, but unfortunately for her, not fast enough. The sign crushes her head against the side of the lemonade stand, killing her. One of Petunia's eyeballs comes loose from her head and rolls over to Giggles. Giggles picks up the eye, thinking that it is a lemon, and slowly cuts it in half. She then juices the fluid out of the eye and pours the liquid into a glass. Giggles takes a sip and obviously does not like the taste. She adds some sugar to the concoction, drops some ice cubes in, and places a slice of Petunia's eye on the rim of the glass.\nMoral:\"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade!\"\n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=35\n|EpisodeNumber2=8\n|Title=Milkin' It\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Rhode Montijo, Kenn Navarro, Jeff Biancalana, David Winn & Alan Lau\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2004|1|4}}\n|ShortSummary= Lifty and Shifty are seen running out of a barnyard, carrying a cow, while Lumpy the farmer shouts and chases after them. The thieving brothers toss the cow into a hot air balloon, untie the anchor (rope), and fly away with their prize. Lumpy grabs onto the rope hanging down from the balloon, only to get dragged across the ground. His farm clothes are torn off, his stomach gets scraped, and he is dragged through the circular opening of the pivot the balloon was tied to. This tears the skin off the upper half of Lumpy's body and compresses his body, killing him. Lifty and Shifty tease and laugh at Lumpy, but they then turn to find that the balloon is headed straight for a power line. A bird lands on the power line and is instantly vaporized, leading Lifty and Shifty to lighten the load of the balloon to float above the wire to avoid being vaporized. They begin by throwing multiple heavy objects out of the balloon. This doesn't have any meaningful effect however and the balloon is still on a direct course for the power line. Lifty and Shifty begin to debate on who has to milk the cow to lighten it. Eventually, Lifty begins milking the cow while Shifty pours the milk out of the balloon with a bucket. Eventually, the cow becomes emaciated and is out of milk, but they are still headed for the power line. Lifty shrugs, unsure of what to do, but Shifty has a devious plan to steer clear from the power line. Shifty cold-heartedly throws Lifty out of the balloon, where he is gruesomely impaled on a pine tree through his mouth, spreading his organs on the branches like a Christmas tree. The balloon makes it over the power line, and Shifty begins jumping up and down in celebration. The basket he's jumping on breaks, however, causing Shifty to grab onto the cow's udders for dear life. Shifty sees that the balloon is headed for a fast-moving windmill, and because he is hanging below the basket, Shifty begins getting cut by the blades, shredding his entire lower body, making him scream and groan in pain. His intestines get caught on one of the blades, and his spinal cord is torn by his refusal to let go of the cow. Shifty accidentally lets go of the cow's udders and is spun around the windmill several times before he finally stops, dead. The cow gets out of the balloon, which lands nearby, and begins eating some grass. Before the episode ends, the cow's udders slightly swell up.\nMoral:\"Don't cry over spilled milk!\"\n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=36\n|EpisodeNumber2=9\n|Title=Out of Sight, Out of Mime\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Rhode Montijo, Kenn Navarro, Jeff Biancalana & David Winn\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2004|2|22}}\n|ShortSummary= It is nighttime, and the Happy Tree Friends are enjoying Halloween.

Lumpy orders Lifty and Shifty to shake Flaky, making her dandruff fall and create the illusion that it is snowing. Lumpy then orders Toothy to sing \"O Christmas Tree\", with Sniffles as a candy cane, Giggles as a present, and Cuddles as a Christmas tree. Nutty gets excited when he sees Sniffles' costume and bites off the right side, along with Sniffles' arm, mistaken for a real candy cane. As Lumpy orders Toothy to continue singing, Sniffles runs into a rope, causing a weight to drop down and cause Giggles' costume to slice off her face.

A total of five seasons of the series have been released: 4 seasons on the internet, and 1 season on television. \n\nIn 1999, the crew began the series with a pilot episode. The pilot was named ''Banjo Frenzy'', which featured a blue dinosaur, a sky blue squirrel, a yellow rabbit and a purple beaver. The first official episode was named ''Spin Fun Knowin' Ya!'' and featured later versions of the dinosaur, the rabbit, the squirrel and the beaver and, from that point on, the crew began introducing new characters to the show. It quickly became an internet phenomenon featuring millions of visits per episode. The ''Happy Tree Friends'' television series aired on [[G4 (American TV channel)|G4]] in the United States in 2006. It also aired on [[G4 (Canadian TV channel)|G4]] and [[MTV2 (Canadian TV channel)|Razer]] in Canada in 2007.\n\nA spin-off called ''Ka-Pow!'' debuted on September 2008. In 2010, after airing fifteen episodes for the third web season, a hiatus began, in which there were only Break shorts airing with a [[subliminal message]] at the end of each, which reads \"Happy Tree Friends is dead!\". This situation concerned many fans because they thought that the series were going to end soon. The writers confirmed that they were playing a joke on the fact that the characters die a lot and made a pun phrase with the word \"dead\". The hiatus ended on December 8, 2011 and the series returned once again with the fifteenth episode of the third season, which was named \"Clause for Concern\".\n\nIn addition to the show's five seasons and a spin-off, there have been some special episodes and shorts. These include eleven \"Smoochies\", ten \"Kringles\", thirteen \"Break\" shorts, five \"Love Bites\", and sixteen other irregular episodes that are unindexed. The \"Smoochie\" shorts involve three different items being dropped next to a main character, only for them to be killed in three different ways, each regarding the item. These have been adapted into the ''Happy Tree Friends'' website where one can choose an item to drop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Smoochies |url=http://htf.atom.com/index.php/category/playground/playthings/smoochies/ |publisher=HTF.atom.com |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}</ref> The \"Kringle\" shorts are [[Christmas]]-themed shorts that feature the main characters doing various Christmas-related tasks, only to be killed in various ways.<ref>{{cite web |title=Happy Tree Friends \u2013 Kringles |url=http://htf.atom.com/index.php/category/episodes/kringles |publisher=HTF.atom.com |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}</ref> The \"Love Bites\" were [[Valentine's Day]]-themed shorts, that went with the basic structure of a ''Happy Tree Friends'' episode. The \"Break\" shorts were produced in 2008, when no new episodes were produced until the following year. A new break short debuted in 2009.\n\n==Series overview==\n<!-- Full linking is used in the following table because it is transcluded to the main series article -->\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n|released      = y\n\n| color1       = ##000000\n| link1        = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Season 1 (1999\u20132001)\n| episodes1    = 27\n| start1       = {{Start date|1999|12|24}}\n| end1         = {{End date|2001|10|20}}\n| network1     = [[Mondo Media]]\n\n| color2       = #FF7F00\n| link2        = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Season 2 (2001\u20132005)\n| episodes2    = 28\n| start2       = {{Start date|2001|10|27}}\n| end2         = {{End date|2005|12|15}}\n\n| color2S      = #AC1F24\n| link2S       = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Television series (2006)\n| linkT2S      = TV series\n| episodes2S   = 39\n| start2S      = {{Start date|2006|9|25}}\n| end2S        = {{End date|2006|12|25}}\n| network2S    = [[G4 (American TV channel)|G4]]\n\n| color3       = #FFFF00\n| link3        = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Season 3 (2007\u20132013)\n| episodes3    = 24\n| start3       = {{Start date|2007|10|24}}\n| end3         = {{End date|2013|3|29}}\n| network3     = [[Mondo Media]]<br/>[[YouTube]]\n\n| color4       = #40E0D0\n| link4        = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Season 4 (2013\u20132014)\n| episodes4    = 9\n| start4       = {{Start date|2013|6|14}}\n| end4         = {{End date|2014|3|6}}\n\n| color5       = #009E60\n| link5        = <includeonly>List of Happy Tree Friends episodes</includeonly>#Season 5: Still Alive (2016)\n| linkT5       = ''Still Alive''\n| episodes5    = 5\n| start5       = {{Start date|2016|12|7}}\n| end5         = {{End date|2016|12|22}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Internet shorts==\n===Season 1 (1999\u20132001)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=#000000|overall=1|season=|released=1|title=20|director=14|writer=15|airdate=20|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=Spin Fun Knowin' Ya!\n|DirectedBy= [[Rhode Montijo]]\n|WrittenBy= [[Warren Graff]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|12|24}}\n|ShortSummary= Lumpy is spinning a playground merry-go-round with Cuddles, Toothy and Giggles on it.

Cub unknowingly rides the mower over a brick, making him stop in his tracks. Realizing this, Cub looks under the mower and finds the brick lodged between the blades. Cub then attempts to pull the brick out, even though he forgets to turn the mower off. Luckily, Pop wakes up and witnesses this. Over the fear of his son getting injured, Pop snatches Cub just before something bad could've happened. Pop places Cub on his hammock, and orders him to stay. Pop looks under the mower, and pulls out the brick. Pop then proceeds to mow the rest of the lawn himself, with Cub watching. An oblivious Pop starts pushing the mower right towards pieces of broken glass and syringes that are scattered all over the ground. The mower runs over the sharp objects, and they get flung out of the ejection port at full speed right towards Cub. The sharp objects then pierce Cub all over his body, and is finally killed when a broken bottle flies through his head, taking away a part of his skull, as well as his brain. Cub's now dead body falls right into a nearby pile of leaves, which cover up his entire body. Pop then comes in, raking some leaves with a rake. Stopping for a second, he lights up a match to restart his pipe. Once his pipe is lit once more, he unknowingly throws the still lit match at the leaf pile where Cub fell in, setting it on fire.     \nMoral: Plant kindness and gather love!\n|LineColor=1B4054\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=13\n|EpisodeNumber2=13\n|Title=Nuttin' but the Tooth\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Mark Fiorenza, Warren Graff, Rhode Montijo & Kenn Navarro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2000|5|19}}\n|ShortSummary= Nutty is a patient of Toothy the dentist. Toothy is reading a dentistry instruction book prior to performing Nutty's checkup, before ensuring Nutty that the operation will go smoothly (evident when he gives the \"Okay\" sign). As Nutty's mouth opens wide, Toothy comes across a cavity that needs to be removed, so he tries to drill out the tooth. When Toothy is drilling, the drill's battery goes dead, much to his disappointment. However, Toothy managed to get another battery. Unfortunately, he only succeeds in drilling a hole in the back of Nutty's throat and through the headrest of the chair. Next, Toothy tries the old-fashioned method of tying one end of a string around Nutty's tooth, and the other end to a doorknob. Toothy rings a doorbell on a trailer, and Lumpy answers the door, causing Nutty's jaw to get ripped from his head. Nutty's rotten tooth is one of only a few teeth that aren't torn out.

Flippy begins counting, while the others run to hide. As Flippy continues to count, a woodpecker behind him begins pecking at the tree it's perching on. The sound of the woodpecker's pecking causes Flippy to act all scared. Just seconds later, Flippy thinks of these sounds as a machine gun being fired, and he starts to act all vicious, as if he's back in a war. Once Flippy flips out, and becomes his alter ego, Fliqpy, he throws a knife through the woodpecker's chest, killing it. At Toothy's hiding spot, behind a tree, Toothy giggles while hiding. Fliqpy, in camouflage to the tree behind Toothy, grabs Toothy's head, and gives it a big twist, which snaps his neck. Elsewhere, a panting Flaky continues to look for her hiding spot. Suddenly, a piano wire comes down and it snatches Flaky by her neck, which strangles her to death. Petunia, having witnessed Flaky's death, begins to back away in fear while whimpering. Petunia then trips and falls into a Punji stake pit. As Petunia yells in pain by being pierced all over her body, Fliqpy arrives. Petunia struggles to lift her arm, and hopes that Flippy will grab her hand to pull her out. Fliqpy instead gives Petunia an activated grenade. Seeing what Flippy gave her, Petunia screams in horror.

Suddenly, it grabs Sniffles' head, and gives it a hard scratch, cutting up his head and revealing his brain. Giggles screams in terror, she starts whimpering and can barely look away from Sniffles' corpse. Giggles doesn't notice that their cart is approaching an axe swinging back and forth. Flaky tries to warn Giggles, but she's still traumatized and she doesn't move. As a result, she gets sliced in half.

Moments later, Mime holds a balloon animal in front of Toothy, surprising him. As Mime begins juggling some balls, Toothy begins giggling at Mime's silly antics. Mime then pretends that a bandage on Toothy's leg is a cobra rising out of its basket. Toothy finds it funny, that is, until the bandage gets snagged into a desk fan next to his bed. His leg snaps in half, causing him to scream in pain. As Mime hears the poor beaver's cries of pain, he proceeds to help by rubbing his wound with rubbing alcohol.

Leaving the iron pressed down on his shirt, Lumpy then moves over to a mixer where he begins making a cake. He is interrupted by the doorbell. He answers the door to find Giggles in a Girl Scout outfit selling cookies. A gust of wind blows Lumpy's towel off his body, exposing his private area to Giggles. Lumpy doesn't notice this as he ponders whether or not to buy some cookies, but Giggles catches a disturbing eyeful of his privates and shrieks in complete shock, bringing Lumpy back to reality. Lumpy panics and begins to look around for something to cover his nudity. When he looks back, Lumpy sees smoke coming from the iron and his shirt. He runs to the iron, but he trips over the many cords plugged into an overloaded electrical socket. He accidentally flips the ironing board over, causing the iron to fly onto Giggles' face, burning it. While struggling to put his shirt on, Lumpy's arm accidentally hits his still activated mixer, which flies through the air and lands in Giggles' eye sockets, shredding her eye sockets, making her scream in agony. The mixer eventually falls out of Giggles' head, along with a large quantity of her blood and both of her eyeballs, still intact.

Sniffles seems to have some trouble with his footing. As he gets a good balance, an ant skates by. Fascinated, Sniffles proceeds to eat the ant. As he launches his tongue, his tongue misses the ant and instead hits the ice. Sniffles attempts to pull his tongue off the ice, but as he does so, he tears off the skin on the bottom of his tongue. The ants now use this as an opportunity to get back at Sniffles. First, they throw a toy mouse on Sniffles' tongue, and one of the ants releases a cat. The cat quickly jumps on Sniffles' tongue. The cat finds Sniffles' tongue so comfortable and kneads it, making Sniffles shout in pain. Behind Sniffles, one of the ants ties a rope to Sniffles' tail, another ant is seen holding a bottle of wine. The ant swings it at an anvil, which is also tied to the rope. The anvil begins to sink into a hole in the ice. As the anvil sinks down, Sniffles is about to get pulled in as well. Luckily for him, his tongue is the only thing not making him fall in completely. Unfortunately, the cat claws at Sniffles' tongue, slicing it off in one swing. With his tongue severed, Sniffles starts sliding into the hole, up until Sniffles sinks completely.

As Cuddles continues to ride, Nutty begins to chase him on his scooter. Cuddles then notices Nutty following him, and screams in shock at the realization. After Cuddles and Nutty ride down a small hill, Cuddles yells in panic when he realizes that a chopped down tree is blocking the road. Luckily, there's a small wooden plank which acts as a ramp. Cuddles rides up the ramp, successfully dodging a beehive above him. When Cuddles lands on the floor, Nutty's scooter catches up to him, but Nutty isn't on it. Nutty didn't quite manage to dodge the beehive, and now he has his whole head stuck inside. Nutty begins to scream in panic as the bees viciously attack him.

Splendid arrives, and discovers that Lumpy has bear traps clamped all over his body, apparently allured by the blocks of cheese each trap held. Splendid looks at the bear trap clamping on his right arm and attempts to open it so he can get it off of him. Unfortunately, the bear trap slips from his hands and it clamps down on his arm, causing his arm to fall off, and a large quantity of blood to pour out. This makes Splendid gasp in sheer shock, and Lumpy to scream in pain. Acting quickly, he ties the severed arm like a balloon knot to stop the blood from spilling out, saving and calming Lumpy down. Splendid comes up with an easier idea to get the bear traps off of Lumpy: he karate chops them off. With all the bear traps off of Lumpy, Splendid gathers them up, and hurls them far away. Somewhere else, Cub is shown playing with his toys. The bear traps come down. One lands on the ground, another pinches down on his ball, and the last one falls on Cub's head, providing a gruesome death for the poor baby. Lumpy shakes hands with Splendid for the help, and Splendid flies off, where Lumpy bids him farewell. Not long after his departure, Splendid hears a loud snap, forcing him to stop and look. It turns out that Lumpy has fallen victim for another bear trap, way larger than the other ones and clamping on almost his entire body. Sighing out of exhaustion, he resorts to using his laser vision to cut the bear trap. Satisfied that he got the job done, Splendid flies away. Unfortunately, not only has Splendid cut the bear trap into pieces, but he unknowingly decapitated Lumpy in the process. Lumpy's severed head slips off from his body, and lands on one last bear trap.

His head manages to knock all of the pins over, and his snout is hacked off by the pin clearer, exposing his teeth.

Unfortunately, the amount of pressure causes Cro-Marmot to slide down a nearby cliff. Realizing this, Giggles screams in horror and runs down to stop him. Down the cliff, Petunia can be seen making a snow angel, when suddenly, Cro-Marmot slides by and runs over her. This causes Petunia's lower body to rip off (which causes several of her organs to rip off as well), leaving only her upper body intact. Giggles then comes by and quickly runs over her remains. Further down the slope, Lumpy can be seen relaxing on a hammock, apparently getting his holidays mixed up when he's wearing beach attire. Cro-Marmot slides by, and causes his hammock to wrap around him tightly, squeezing out a large quantity of blood. When Giggles passes by, she unravels the hammock and when it opens, a mangled up Lumpy begins to groan in pain. Giggles manages to catch up with Cro-Marmot, and screams in horror when she realizes that Cro-Marmot is heading straight towards a tree.

Cuddles then encourages Flippy to take a seat and enjoy the fire. However, the moment Flippy sits down and begins to warm his hands with the fire, some sparks fly out, and nearly hit Flippy. Flippy stares into the fire, and since this bright energy reminds Flippy of the war, Flippy emerges into his evil side, Fliqpy. Seeing Flippy flip out, Cuddles laughs nervously and says hello to Fliqpy again in hopes that he will turn back into Flippy. Unfortunately, Flippy's evil side still remains, Fliqpy jumps through the campfire, and slashes Cuddles' face away with a rock, knocking out two of his teeth as well as one of his eyes. Giggles, who is still eating her sandwich, gets Cuddles' blood splattered all over her body, making her scream in shock. As Cuddles sits on the ground, dead, Fliqpy uses his Bowie knife to cut a large hole on Cuddles' stomach, and pulls out Cuddles' intestines.

Not noticing that Mime is choking, Lumpy gets up from the driver's seat while the bus is still in motion and goes to reprimand Mime for causing a disturbance.

Lumpy and Petunia embrace each other in fear as Petunia urinates herself all over the floor in fright. The bus runs over the Cursed Idol, which causes Petunia to lose her balance. She falls on and gets impaled by the gear lever of the bus. Lumpy tries to shift gears, but this causes the hole in Petunia's torso to expand.

The bus is in shambles, the ocean is shark-infested, and many have died in the accident. Flippy creates small graves for those who died in the crash, while the others look on mournfully. The next day, Giggles happily catches a fish in the ocean for food, using a long pointed stick as a makeshift spear. a Jellyfish swims by and zaps her left foot, causing her to shriek in pain and curiously observe the bump on her foot. Later that day; during night, Giggles is suffering from extreme chills, wrapped in a blanket, and her stung foot is incredibly swollen. The scene cuts to Flippy sadly pounding down another grave with Giggles' bow tied around it, indicating that she died of hypothermia. When Flippy is done pounding in Giggles' grave, Lifty and Shifty reveal they have an inflatable raft the group can escape on. As the group sails away from the island as Lifty and Shifty paddle with their hands, everyone is relieved and in good spirits. Unfortunately, as Flaky sits down, her quills pop the raft, causing the raft to start sinking as a shark swims along. The group hurriedly swims back to the island, but Lifty and Shifty are taken and eaten by the shark. As everybody catches their breath, Flaky looks on nervously at her fellow members, who are obviously furious at her for popping their only ride home. As the scene changes to night, Flippy laughs evilly as he pounds Flaky's grave into the sand, while the others watch on the background with evil expressions, implying that at least one of them killed Flaky. The next day, the school bus and the tree on the island are gone and in their place stands a rocket ship made up of the bus parts. The group boards their creation with makeshift helmets made of coconuts, and they lift-off, singing the theme song as they go. Eventually, the rocket stops moving upwards. They throw several weighty objects out of the rocket, one of which being Lumpy, and the rocket continues upwards. Sadly, now the rocket moves too fast and it is headed towards the sun. Sniffles' head explodes as they get closer to the sun, while Handy and Flippy are suffering from second and/or third-degree burns. Back on Earth, Lumpy makes the best of his situation by relaxing in a chair and holding his sock over a fire. A \"puff!\" suddenly appears in the sun, indicating that the rocket ship made contact with the sun, without Lumpy even noticing. As the episode ends, Lumpy begins applying sunscreen to his arm. \nMoral: \"Give but never give up!\"\n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=29\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|Title=Eye Candy\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Warren Graff, Rhode Montijo & Kenn Navarro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2002|9|8}}\n|ShortSummary= Toothy is cheerfully running through the forest, holding a large yellow lollipop in front of him. His happiness ends soon as he trips over a log, causing the lollipop to get lodged in his eye socket. Screaming, he pulls on the lollipop's stick, causing his eye and the optic nerve, still connected to his head, to fly out of his eye socket and get tangled around a tree branch. Toothy tries pulling on his optic nerve, but fails to get his eyeball down from the branch. Whining and wailing in pain, he begins climbing the tree. When he reaches the branch his eyeball is resting on, we get a view of how difficult it is for Toothy to see with both of his eyes pointed in different directions. Toothy reaches for his eye, but unfortunately, a woodpecker lands on the branch and starts pecking his eyeball. Recoiling from the pain, Toothy loses his balance and falls off the tree, which is revealed to have been located on the edge of a cliff, causing Toothy to dangle from the branch of a tree off a cliff from only his optic nerve (which acts as a bungee cord). Toothy tries climbing back up his optic nerve, but he loses his grip and slides down again. Ultimately, Toothy's brain is pulled out from his eye socket, followed by his other eye as Toothy falls to the ground a few feet below him. Before the episode ends, the bird poops on Toothy's head. \nMoral: \"Keep your eye on the prize!\"\n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=30\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=Rink Hijinks\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Mark Fiorenza, Warren Graff, Rhode Montijo, Kenn Navarro, Paul Allan & Jessica Teach\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2002|9|15}}\n|ShortSummary= Flaky enters a roller skating rink, but she seems to have some trouble with her footing. Flaky nearly falls over, and she hugs the wall for safety. But when someone quickly skates past Flaky, she gets filled with determination, and lets go of the wall. Flaky begins to get the hang of it, but not for long, as Disco Bear skates in and carelessly pushes Flaky aside. Elsewhere in the rink, Lumpy is seen cleaning the rink with a floor buffer in his underwear. Suddenly, Flaky comes by, and she falls under Lumpy's floor buffer. As Flaky gets sucked in, her body begins rubbing against the floor at a fast speed that kills her, and soon her quills begin to fly all over the place. As Disco Bear skates along, Flaky's quills suddenly come in and puncture Disco Bear all over his face and torso, which kills him. Meanwhile, Lumpy can no longer contain the malfunctioning buffer, and the brushes get cemented to the floor. Because of this, Lumpy is now getting twirled all over the place just before he gets flung away. At the arcade of the rink, Cub can be seen playing at a claw machine. Suddenly, Lumpy comes in and his body crashes through the machine. As a dazed Lumpy regains consciousness, he notices the claw machine's hook hovering over his body. It comes down, punctures his chest, and pulls out his heart. As Lumpy screams at the loss of his heart, he suddenly passes out and dies. Lumpy's heart falls into the prize slot, and Cub immediately grabs it. At first, Cub seems confused by his \"prize,\" but once it throbs, Cub gets fascinated and hugs it. \n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=31\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|Title=Flippin' Burgers\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Warren Graff, Rhode Montijo & Kenn Navarro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2002|9|22}}\n|ShortSummary= At a small burger joint in the middle of the woods, the Happy Tree Friends enjoy lunch. Petunia is hard at work cooking the burgers, while Cuddles and Giggles are eating together. Cuddles tries to squirt some ketchup on their fries, but he accidentally squirts it on Giggles. At just that moment, a happy and hungry Flippy opens the door. He sees Giggles covered in ketchup and suddenly goes into a trance. Though Cuddles and Giggles laugh about the incident, Flippy believes that she has been injured, causing him to react and in result, he sees Giggles dead with blood all around her in the background as Flippy flips out and shows his scary, evil face at the audience, now turned into Fliqpy. Fliqpy jumps over to their table and flips it over, causing fries to fly everywhere. Cuddles turns his attention to Fliqpy, but he doesn't seem too worried as he continues sipping on his drink through a straw. Fliqpy grabs Cuddles' straw and uses it to stab him in the heart. Blood starts pouring out of the straw and, in a panic, Cuddles drinks his blood through the straw to get the blood back into his body, but this doesn't work, and he soon dies. Giggles screams and looks around the room, having lost sight of Fliqpy. He emerges above her and shoves a ketchup bottle in one of her ears and a mustard bottle in the other. He squeezes both bottles as hard as he can, causing ketchup and mustard to pour out of her nose, killing her. Next, Fliqpy goes behind the grill where Petunia is standing. He grabs her by the back of the head with her screaming and shoves her face down on the burger grill, causing her to scream in anguish. Laughing, he pulls her head up and we see that the grease has melted her face onto the grill, exposing the nerves of her face. As Petunia is still screaming, Fliqpy shoves her face back onto the grill, burning the exposing nerves of her face with her screaming. Outside the building, Petunia is heard screaming but stops (indicating that she had died). Pop and Cub get ready to enter. Before they can open the door, however, the front of the building explodes, crushing the two beneath the door. Fliqpy lands on the ground, just before the fries. Seeing a pool of Cuddles' blood, Fliqpy grabs a fry and dips it in the blood, mistaking it for ketchup. Fliqpy eats the fry and sighs contently upon tasting the blood. \nMoral: \"You are what you eat!\"\n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=32\n|EpisodeNumber2=5\n|Title=Get Whale Soon\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Warren Graff, Rhode Montijo & Kenn Navarro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2002|9|29}}\n|ShortSummary= Russell happily sits in his boat, humming and holding a harpoon. As he looks through his telescope, he realizes he's floating in the open mouth of a giant whale. Having no time to react, Russell gets eaten, plunging him into darkness. Inside the whale with darkness surrounding him, Russell lights a match to light up his surroundings. He finds a road raged Lumpy sitting in his car and honking his horn, unaware that he is in a whale's stomach. Lumpy turns on his car's headlights and they both see that they have no way out. Russell, however, gets an idea. They bundle some sticks together and Russell pulls out a box of matches. Looking inside, they see there's only one match left. After several unsuccessful attempts, Russell manages to light the match, only for Lumpy to sneeze it out, angering Russell. Next, Lumpy lifts Russell up to the whale's uvula. Russell stabs it and pulls on it with his hook, making the two laugh. This only succeeds in making the whale vomit all over them. Disheartened, Russell and Lumpy find a new hope when they look up and see the whale's blowhole. Russell throws his harpoon towards the blowhole, but unfortunately he misses and the falling object accidentally pierces Lumpy's head, killing him. Russell starts to go insane, and begins using his hook to slash the inside of the whale's stomach. The whale, feeling the pain of Russell's hook, fires Russell out of its blowhole. At first, Russell is still laughing and slashing around like a maniac while in mid-air, but he rejoices upon learning that he's free. Sadly, Russell falls from the sky and his head gets impaled on the mast of a nearby ship. The whale then comes and swallows the ship to add insult to injury. \nMoral: \"Don't bite off more than you can chew!\" \n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=33\n|EpisodeNumber2=6\n|Title=Snip, Snip Hooray!\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Warren Graff, Rhode Montijo & Kenn Navarro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|5|30}}\n|ShortSummary= Cub happily sits in his highchair as Pop brings in a tray containing a comb, a pair of scissors, and an electric shaver. Cub sees the shiny scissors and tries to reach for them. Pop slaps his hand away, forbidding him to touch them. Pop removes Cub's beanie to reveal that Cub has a full head of long, flowing hair. Pop begins cutting Cub's hair with the scissors, but stops when he accidentally cuts Cub's right ear off. Cub begins to scream and cry in pain and Pop starts panicking as blood spurts out of Cub's wound. The scene fades to black. The scene then fades back to Cub happily licking a lollipop while wearing bandages over the right side of his head. Pop proudly looks at Cub and then looks for the electric shaver, which he has apparently misplaced. He hears a buzzing sound and looks up to see a laughing Cub, who now has a flap of skin detached from his forehead, holding the shaver, while Cub appears not to care about his loss. A panicked Pop rushes over and grabs the shaver, quickly turning it off. Pop then cautiously combs and pushes down on the loose flap of skin on Cub's head without any cries or protests from the child. Satisfied, Pop tries to turn the shaver back on, but to no avail. He sees that the shaver has become unplugged, so, setting the shaver down next to Cub, he goes to plug it back in. Cub starts playing with the shaver, and puts it in his mouth to suck on it. Pop plugs the shaver back in, and it starts tearing the inside of Cub's mouth, throat, and eventually his esophagus to pieces. Cub falls face down on his highchair deadly, while an oblivious Pop searches for his scissors. Locating them, Pop cuts a lock of Cub's hair, brushes some loose hair from his head, and places Cub's beanie back on his son's head, still unaware that his son is dead. \nMoral:\"Don't run with scissors!\" \n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=34\n|EpisodeNumber2=7\n|Title=Eyes Cold Lemonade\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Rhode Montijo, Kenn Navarro, [[Jeff Biancalana]] & [[David Winn]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|12|26}}\n|ShortSummary= Giggles and Petunia happily sit at their lemonade stand, awaiting customers. Petunia sighs contentedly, and Giggles pours her some lemonade. Petunia gladly drinks it. Giggles notices that they are out of lemonade, so she grabs a knife and a lemon so she could make some more. She gets ready to cut into the lemon, but she makes sure to move her finger to avoid accidentally cutting herself. After slicing the lemon in half, Giggles notices that a nail from the lemonade stand's sign has fallen off. She looks up to see that part of the sign has become detached from the stand. The sign swoops down in front of her, slicing her face off. Giggles screams in pain, causing Petunia to spit out her lemonade all over Giggles' face in shock. The citric acid from the lemonade burns the inside of Giggles' face, and she screams in pain, again. Later on, we see that Petunia has reset the sign, only now with far more nails than before and in a sloppy manner. Satisfied with her work, Petunia starts squeezing lemons again. Meanwhile, Giggles, who has bandages wrapped around most of her face, including both of her eyes, ignores her injury and continues to work. She blindly reaches for a lemon and manages to slice it in half. Another nail falls from the sign, only now from the other side. The sign begins sliding downwards towards Petunia. Petunia notices this, but unfortunately for her, not fast enough. The sign crushes her head against the side of the lemonade stand, killing her. One of Petunia's eyeballs comes loose from her head and rolls over to Giggles. Giggles picks up the eye, thinking that it is a lemon, and slowly cuts it in half. She then juices the fluid out of the eye and pours the liquid into a glass. Giggles takes a sip and obviously does not like the taste. She adds some sugar to the concoction, drops some ice cubes in, and places a slice of Petunia's eye on the rim of the glass.\nMoral:\"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade!\"\n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=35\n|EpisodeNumber2=8\n|Title=Milkin' It\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Rhode Montijo, Kenn Navarro, Jeff Biancalana, David Winn & [[Alan Lau]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2004|1|4}}\n|ShortSummary= Lifty and Shifty are seen running out of a barnyard, carrying a cow, while Lumpy the farmer shouts and chases after them. The thieving brothers toss the cow into a hot air balloon, untie the anchor (rope), and fly away with their prize. Lumpy grabs onto the rope hanging down from the balloon, only to get dragged across the ground. His farm clothes are torn off, his stomach gets scraped, and he is dragged through the circular opening of the pivot the balloon was tied to. This tears the skin off the upper half of Lumpy's body and compresses his body, killing him. Lifty and Shifty tease and laugh at Lumpy, but they then turn to find that the balloon is headed straight for a power line. A bird lands on the power line and is instantly vaporized, leading Lifty and Shifty to lighten the load of the balloon to float above the wire to avoid being vaporized. They begin by throwing multiple heavy objects out of the balloon. This doesn't have any meaningful effect however and the balloon is still on a direct course for the power line. Lifty and Shifty begin to debate on who has to milk the cow to lighten it. Eventually, Lifty begins milking the cow while Shifty pours the milk out of the balloon with a bucket. Eventually, the cow becomes emaciated and is out of milk, but they are still headed for the power line. Lifty shrugs, unsure of what to do, but Shifty has a devious plan to steer clear from the power line. Shifty cold-heartedly throws Lifty out of the balloon, where he is gruesomely impaled on a pine tree through his mouth, spreading his organs on the branches like a Christmas tree. The balloon makes it over the power line, and Shifty begins jumping up and down in celebration. The basket he's jumping on breaks, however, causing Shifty to grab onto the cow's udders for dear life. Shifty sees that the balloon is headed for a fast-moving windmill, and because he is hanging below the basket, Shifty begins getting cut by the blades, shredding his entire lower body, making him scream and groan in pain. His intestines get caught on one of the blades, and his spinal cord is torn by his refusal to let go of the cow. Shifty accidentally lets go of the cow's udders and is spun around the windmill several times before he finally stops, dead. The cow gets out of the balloon, which lands nearby, and begins eating some grass. Before the episode ends, the cow's udders slightly swell up.\nMoral:\"Don't cry over spilled milk!\"\n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=36\n|EpisodeNumber2=9\n|Title=Out of Sight, Out of Mime\n|DirectedBy= Rhode Montijo\n|WrittenBy= Rhode Montijo, Kenn Navarro, Jeff Biancalana & David Winn\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2004|2|22}}\n|ShortSummary= It is nighttime, and the Happy Tree Friends are enjoying Halloween.

The stage has Nutty sleeping in a bed. The director, Lumpy orders Toothy, who is holding a candle, to arrive on stage. A spotlight turns on, with the Mole manning it. He points it towards Toothy. Lumpy orders Lifty and Shifty to shake Flaky, making her dandruff fall and create the illusion that it is snowing. Lumpy then orders Toothy to sing \"O Christmas Tree\", with Sniffles as a candy cane, Giggles as a present, and Cuddles as a Christmas tree. Nutty gets excited when he sees Sniffles' costume and bites off the right side, along with Sniffles' arm, mistaken for a real candy cane. As Lumpy orders Toothy to continue singing, Sniffles runs into a rope, causing a weight to drop down and cause Giggles' costume to slice off her face. As it falls off, Toothy continues singing, although tearfully, but Giggles slips on her face and causes it to fly into the Mole's face. He moves the spotlight over to Lifty and Shifty, who get blinded by the light and drop Flaky. She falls down the chimmney, causing her quills to get stuck in it, before hitting the ground, skinned. Toothy and Cuddles now scream, and noticing that Lumpy has escaped the building, try to leave. Toothy accidentally drops the candle he was holding and causes the theater to burst into flames. Cuddles tries to escape, but his costume prevents him from leaving. The audience also plans on escaping, pushing Cuddles so hard that his face falls off, presumably killing him. Everyone escapes, although harmed. Toothy prepares to sing, and everyone holds hands around the burning building.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]], and is the first in a [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|series of shows]] that lead to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover miniseries. The series is produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with DeKnight Productions for the [[Daredevil (season 1)|first season]] and Goddard Textiles for the first and second seasons. [[Steven S. DeKnight]] serves as [[showrunner]] on the first season, with [[Doug Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez taking over for the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]], and [[Erik Oleson]] joining the series as its showrunner for its [[Daredevil (season 3)|third season]]; Goddard serves as a consultant for the series.\n\n[[Charlie Cox]] stars as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a blind lawyer-by-day who fights crime as a masked vigilante by night. [[Deborah Ann Woll]], [[Elden Henson]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] also star, with [[Toby Leonard Moore]], [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]], [[Bob Gunton]], and [[Ayelet Zurer]] joining them for season one, [[Jon Bernthal]], [[\u00c9lodie Yung]], and [[Stephen Rider]] joining the cast for season two, and [[Wilson Bethel]] and [[Jay Ali]] joining in season three. ''Daredevil'' entered development in late 2013, a year after the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel, with Goddard initially hired in December 2013. DeKnight replaced him as showrunner and Cox was hired to star in May 2014. Filming takes place in New York City, in areas that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].\n\nAll episodes of the first season were released on Netflix on April 10, 2015, while the second season was released in its entirety on March 18, 2016. They were met with positive reviews. In July 2016, the series was renewed for a third season, which was released on October 19, 2018. A spin-off series, centered on Bernthal's character [[Punisher|Frank Castle / Punisher]] and titled ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]'', was ordered by Netflix in April 2016. On November 29, 2018, Netflix canceled ''Daredevil''.<!--Do not add a citation here per WP:LEADCITE! It is cited in the body of the article.

But every night he breaks that oath, and goes out and does very violent things.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> The character's [[Catholicism]] plays a large role in the series, with DeKnight calling him \"one of the most, if not the most, religious characters in the Marvel Universe\".<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> Cox worked with blind consultant Joe Strechay,<ref name=\"CoxConsultant\" /> and was conscious of what his eyes were doing at all times, to ensure they would not look at or react to something unlike a blind person.<ref name=\"NZHerald\" /> Skylar Gaertner plays a young Matt Murdock.<ref name=\"Gaertner\" />\n* [[Deborah Ann Woll]] as [[Karen Page]]: <br />An enigmatic young woman whose quest for justice sends her crashing into Murdock's life.<ref name=\"Woll2\" /> After portraying [[Jessica Hamby]] in ''[[True Blood]]'' from 2008 to 2014, Woll specifically tried to \"steer differently than that\" with Page.<ref name=\"WollQuote\" /> Woll noted that Page's backstory would be different than the one from the comics, saying, \"In the comic books, in the beginning Karen is very innocent, and then towards the end she's really swung a full 180, she's in a lot of trouble, so I wanted to find a way to make her both of those things at the same time. Can she be a really wonderful, kind person who is a little bit attracted to danger? She's not just always getting into trouble because 'Oh, silly woman!' Karen is actually looking for it, and she won't let her fear stop her from finding the truth.\"<ref name=\"NZHerald\" />\n* [[Elden Henson]] as [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson]]: <br />Murdock's best friend and law partner.<ref name=\"Henson\" /> In April 2015, Henson spoke of his excitement for the character's role in the series, saying \"I was really excited as I was getting the scripts and reading that Foggy wasn't just a useless sidekick. He's not just comic relief. I mean, he is some of those things. He does have comic relief, but it was exciting to know that these other characters would have their own path and their own things that they're dealing with.\"<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" />\n* [[Toby Leonard Moore]] as [[James Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]]: Wilson Fisk's right-hand man.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> Moore described Wesley as both charming and \"dastardly as all hell\".<ref name=\"MooreCBR\" />\n* [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as [[Ben Urich]]: An investigative journalist for the ''New York Bulletin''.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" />\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Leland Owlsley]]: A Wall Street financialist, accountant, and a key figure in Wilson Fisk's plans for Hell's Kitchen.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20142\" />\n* [[Ayelet Zurer]] as [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna-Fisk]]: An art gallery employee who, unlike the comic version, knows of and accepts Wilson Fisk's true dealings and eventually marries him.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" />\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]]: <br />A nurse who helps Murdock.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20142\" /> The character is an amalgam of the comic characters [[Claire Temple]] and [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]].<ref name=\"DawsonTime\" /> The character was originally going to be \"the actual Night Nurse\", but was merged with Temple when the writers learned that [[Marvel Studios]] had plans for that character in their films.<ref name=\"DeKnightNightNurse\" /> Dawson explained that Temple \"is a normal person and she becomes more heroic in a way that she maybe didn't expect\",<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" /> and \"She's not a love interest\u2014she's this skeptical eye looking at this strange situation. She's the one who can be like, \"You're not really good at this.\" That makes it feel more real.\"<ref name=\"DawsonTime\" />\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk / Kingpin]]: <br />A powerful businessman and crime lord whose interests in the future of Hell's Kitchen brings him into conflict with Murdock and Daredevil.<ref name=\"D'OnofrioKingpin\" /><ref name=\"D'Onofrio\" /><ref name=\"BustleS2EasterEggs\" /> D'Onofrio stated that he hoped his portrayal of Fisk was a new way to look at the character, and that it would be the definitive portrayal of Fisk.<ref name=\"D'OnofrioPortrayal\" /> DeKnight detailed that \"Fisk has very many different aspects so it's not all, \"I want to conquer the city and make a lot of money\". In our story, we tell the story of how he met his wife Vanessa and how they fell in love\". He also said that \"if you're looking for a juicy, multi-faceted crime drama, Wilson Fisk was the obvious choice to play the antagonist ... [he] really felt like the right yin to the yang for Matt, and for what we wanted to do this season.\"<ref name=\"EW7Things\" /> Cole Jensen plays a young Wilson Fisk.<ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as [[Punisher|Frank Castle / Punisher]]: <br />A vigilante who aims to clean up Hell's Kitchen by any means necessary, no matter how lethal the results.<ref name=\"Bernthal\" /><ref name=\"Yung\" /> DeKnight said this version of Punisher would be \"completely the Marvel version,\" as previous portrayals did not appear under the [[Marvel Studios]] / [[Marvel Television]] banner. He also felt Bernthal's Punisher would not be as \"graphically violent\" as in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''.<ref name=\"DeKnightPunisher\" /> Season two showrunner [[Doug Petrie]] stated that [[Travis Bickle]] from ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' was an influence on the character, as well as current events, saying, \"Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings.\" Bernthal added that \"This character has resonated with law enforcement and military ... and the best thing about him is that if he offends you, he just doesn't care.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2015\" />\n* [[\u00c9lodie Yung]] as [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]]: <br />A mysterious and dangerous woman from Murdock's past. The character was referred to in the first season, before Yung was cast in the role.<ref name=\"Yung\" /><ref name=\"GlennS2\" /><ref name=\"S2Release\" /> Describing Elektra's effect on Murdock, Petrie called her \"the best bad girlfriend you can possibly have. She does everything wrong and attractive, she's [Matt's] id, the wild side. Matt is always taming his wild side. Elektra just lets it out. He's both repulsed and deeply drawn to that.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2015\" /> Yung described Elektra as \"kind of a sociopath. This world is a game for her. It's like a chess game, and what motivates her is what she wants. She'll use anything she needs to use to get to her goal, and if she needs to kill people, she would.\" She added that Elektra is neither good nor bad, but a \"person with different traits\" and layers.<ref name=\"IGNPunisherElektra\" /> Lily Chee plays a young Elektra.<ref name=\"AVClubS2E12\" />\n* [[Stephen Rider]] as [[Blake Tower]]: A New York district attorney who assists Daredevil with information to help track down and capture criminals.<ref name=\"Rider\" />\n* [[Joanne Whalley]] as [[Maggie Murdock|Maggie Grace]]: A nun with strong opinions who speaks her mind, and cares for Murdock as he recovers from his injuries.<ref name=\"Whalley\" /><ref name=\"WhalleyCollider\" /> She is later revealed to be Murdock's mother.\n* [[Jay Ali]] as Rahul \"Ray\" Nadeem: An honest and ambitious FBI agent.<ref name=\"Ali\" />\n* [[Wilson Bethel]] as [[Bullseye (comics)|Benjamin \"Dex\" Poindexter<!--Do not add Bullseye until he is referred to as such-->]]: A [[psychotic]] FBI agent who is able to use almost any object as a lethal projectile.<ref name=\"Bethel\" /><ref name=\"Bullseye\" />\n<!-- Main characters only!

But what we all sort of realized is that, this movie doesn't want to cost $200&nbsp;million. The thing about Matt Murdock is, he's not saving the world. He's just keeping his corner clean. So it would feel wrong to have spaceships crashing in the middle of the city. But because of that, Marvel on the movie side is not in the business of making $25&nbsp;million movies. They're going big, as they should.\"<ref name=\"GoddardSept2015\" /> Marvel Studios eventually decided that the character would be better served in a television series.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" />\n\nIn October 2013, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to [[video on demand]] services and cable providers, with [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Instant Video|Amazon]] and [[WGN America]] expressing interest.<ref name=\"DeadlineOct2013\" /> A few weeks later, Marvel and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] announced that Marvel Television and [[ABC Studios]] would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Daredevil, [[Jessica Jones]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Luke Cage]], leading up to a miniseries based on the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref name=\"DeadlineNov2013\" /> This format was chosen due to the success of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', for which the characters of [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]], [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|The Hulk]], [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]], and [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] were all introduced separately before being teamed up in that film.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" /> In December, Goddard was officially hired as executive producer and [[showrunner]] for ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"GoddardExecProd\" /> and was happy with the change to television from his film idea \"because you can take time and deal with these smaller things, which to me are much more interesting on a character level\".<ref name=\"GoddardOct2018\" /> However, Marvel announced in May 2014 that Goddard had stepped down as showrunner to focus on directing a feature film based on Marvel's [[Sinister Six]] team for [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]]. Goddard, who wrote the first two episodes of the series, remained with the show as a consultant while [[Steven S. DeKnight]] took over as showrunner. The series was officially titled ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"GoddardDaredevilExit\" /> with Loeb, Jim Chory, [[Dan Buckley]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], Cindy Holland, Kris Henigman, Allie Goss, and Peter Friedlander also serving as executive producers.<ref name=\"VarietyS1Review\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Marvel and Netflix announced that ''Daredevil'' had been renewed for a second season, but DeKnight would not be returning due to prior commitments. He was replaced as showrunner by [[Doug Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez, who served as writers for the first season and worked closely with DeKnight and Goddard.<ref name=\"Season2Ordered\" /> Petrie, Ramirez, Alison Engel, and Mark Verheiden became executive producers for the second season, while Friedlander left the show.<ref name=\"VarietyS2Review\" /> The series was renewed for a third season in July 2016, with Petrie and Ramirez intended to return as showrunners,<ref name=\"Season3\" /> but [[Erik Oleson]] was announced in October 2017 to be taking over as showrunner.<ref name=\"Oleson\" />\n\n===Writing===\nGoddard was always a fan of Daredevil after being raised Catholic, and identifying with the character's story of a \"Catholic superhero struggling with the notions of right and wrong\".<ref name=\"GoddardOct2018\" /> He did not want to be \"a guy that just takes the comics and then shoots them onscreen. I think it's our job to treat it as if it's our run. If I'm the writer of a comic book, you wouldn't just retell someone else's story, you would just take that ball and move it forward.\"<ref name=\"GoddardCBR\" />\n\nIn August 2014, when talking about the series in comparison to the 2003 film, Ted Sarandos said, \"The series will not be afraid to go darker than the film did. What we love about this particular set of heroes is that they're a little more down to Earth. Costume wise and also in that these are gritty crime stories, more in the streets than in the clouds.\"<ref name=\"SeriesFilmComparison\" /> Elaborating on this, DeKnight said, \"It is a little grittier and edgier than Marvel has gone before, but we're not looking to push it to extreme graphic violence, gratuitous nudity or anything like that. The story does not require that and I think [it] would suffer if you pushed it that far.\"<ref name=\"EW7Things\" /> Marvel Television head and executive producer Loeb later stated that, \"There aren't going to be people flying through the sky; there are no magic hammers. We've always approached this as a crime drama first, superhero show second.\"<ref name=\"EW2015Preview\" /> DeKnight took inspiration from ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', and stated that \"we would rather lean toward ''[[The Wire]]'' than what's considered a classic superhero television show.\"<ref name=\"EW7Things\" />\n\nLoeb compared the series' approach to telling stories over multiple seasons to \"the world of publishing, where you have the [[Frank Miller (comics creator)|Frank Miller]], you have the [[Brian Michael Bendis|Brian Bendis]] run, you have the [[Ed Brubaker]] run. I was lucky enough to do ''Daredevil: Yellow''. But they feel different. They have different elements to them. Same cast. In many cases, same tone. But a different adventure ... you can watch ''Daredevil'' season two without having seen ''Daredevil'' season one. But if you watch each of them, it's like getting two different books. It's closer to the world of the graphic novel than it is to the world of the ongoing, serialized show.\"<ref name=\"LoebSDCC2016\" />\n\n===Casting===\nAt the end of May 2014, [[Charlie Cox]] was cast as Daredevil.<ref name=\"Cox\" /> Cox was the first choice for the role, suggested by Quesada in 2012 before Marvel Studios gained the rights to the character from 20th Century Fox.<ref name=\"Cox3\" /> On June 10, Marvel announced that [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] would portray [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk / Kingpin]] in the series,<ref name=\"D'Onofrio\" /><ref name=\"BustleS2EasterEggs\" /> and on June 20, [[Rosario Dawson]] joined the cast.<ref name=\"DawsonCast\" /> A few days later, [[Elden Henson]] was cast as [[Foggy Nelson]],<ref name=\"Henson\" /> while on July 17, [[Deborah Ann Woll]] was cast as [[Karen Page]].<ref name=\"Woll\" /> On October 11, Dawson's role was revealed to be [[Claire Temple]],<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /> a character resembling that of [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]],<ref name=\"NYCC20142\" /> while [[Ayelet Zurer]], [[Bob Gunton]], [[Toby Leonard Moore]], and [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] joined the series as [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Mariana]], [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Leland Owlsley]], [[Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]], and [[Ben Urich]], respectively.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" />\n\nIn June 2015, Marvel announced that [[Jon Bernthal]] was cast as Frank Castle / Punisher for the second season, joining season one returners Cox, Woll, Henson, Dawson, and D'Onofrio.<ref name=\"Bernthal\" /><ref name=\"Yung\" /><ref name=\"FiskS2\" /> The next month, [[\u00c9lodie Yung]] was cast as Elektra Natchios, a character that had been mentioned already in the first season.<ref name=\"Yung\" /><ref name=\"GlennS2\" /><ref name=\"S2Release\" /> In September 2015, [[Stephen Rider]] joined the cast in the role of [[Blake Tower]].<ref name=\"Rider\" /> Cox, Woll, Henson, D'Onofrio,<ref name=\"Oleson\" /> and Rider return for the third season.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} [[Wilson Bethel]] was revealed to be joining them in November 2017, as [[Bullseye (comics)|Benjamin \"Dex\" Poindexter]],<ref name=\"Bethel\" /><ref name=\"Bullseye\" /> with [[Joanne Whalley]] joining as Sister [[Maggie Murdock|Maggie Grace]] by January 2018,<ref name=\"Whalley\" /><ref name=\"WhalleyCollider\" /> and Jay Ali joining as Rahul \"Ray\" Nadeem, another FBI agent by March 2018.<ref name=\"Ali\" /> Zurer has a guest appearance in the season.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nOn the casting process, DeKnight stated that \"You just have to hope you find the right way. Luckily our cast came together, and I couldn't have been happier. No one will ever perfectly fit what's in your head. For me, the more important thing is not whether or not they look the part, but if they feel the part.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> Laray Mayfield and Julie Schubert served as casting directors on the series.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" /> In December 2017, D'Onofrio revealed he had \"a standing agreement with Jeph Loeb\", created before the first season, that allowed him to \"come in and out of the show\", with an unspecified amount of notice given when Marvel hoped to use D'Onofrio in the series.<ref name=\"D'OnofrioAgreement\" />\n\n===Design===\n====Costumes====\nCostume designer Stephanie Maslansky, talking about the inspiration and vision for the series, said \"''Daredevil'' is rooted in the authentically gritty New York City neighborhood, Hell's Kitchen where Matt Murdock grew up. In the comics\u2014particularly those of the Frank Miller era in the early 1990s\u2014there were detailed illustrations we endeavored to bring to life in a grounded, gritty, and updated way, with respect and a strong nod to the original characters. We wanted to pick up where the comics version left off. I studied the illustrations from ''The Man Without Fear'', ''Daredevil Yellow'', and the issues of the 1960s, to which the newer collections pay homage. I wanted the costume design to reflect the illustrations of those volumes through a modern lens while maintaining a retro sensibility.\"<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> Joshua Shaw, who has also done design work on ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', helped design costumes for several characters on ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /><ref name=\"ShawSHIELD\" /> while Lorraine Calvert took over as costume designer for the second season.<ref name=\"Calvert\" />\n\nFor Daredevil's red suit, introduced at the end of the first season, Marvel Comics' [[Chief creative officer]] Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on ''Daredevil'' comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which lead to the use of rivets and \"architectural\" shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with \"deeper portions\" in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, \"because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor's face is going to be doing something else\". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], \"There was a discussion early in the process, because Charlie Cox [and his stunt double] Chris Brewster are both right handed, of having the billy clubs holster on the right leg. But Daredevil wears those billy clubs on the left hand side. So while it would have been easier to place the holster on the right we all felt that we had to keep to the classic profile and keep them on the left.\"<ref name=\"MarvelSuit\" />\n\nThe suit was upgraded for the second season, with Calvert calling it \"a much more fluid suit and much more tactical in a way.\" The costume department \"streamlined\" the suit to make it simpler, using less material on the gauntlets and boots.<ref name=\"Calvert\" /> Cox described the changes as \"tweaks\" that were needed after seeing the suit in action in the first season, and noted that the changes are woven into the storyline of the season, including the need for a new, redesigned mask.<ref name=\"CoxS2Costume\" />\n\n====Title sequence====\n{{external media|float=right|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFYFh8w4758 The opening title sequence of ''Daredevil''], showcasing Elastic's design work and composer [[John Paesano]]'s main theme for the series.}}\nThe opening [[title sequence]] was created by Elastic. The company previously created the title sequence for ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]'', which had stood out to the creators in terms of \"imagination and delivering on what the show was about\". DeKnight explained that multiple companies had made pitches to the creative team involving \"variations of the same idea, where you zoom in on an eye and you see a sonar map of the city.\" However, one of Elastic's pitches had \"fluid-like blood dripping over everything ... as if paint were covering something invisible and revealing it\", which both DeKnight and Loeb wanted to use immediately.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" />\n\nElastic's Creative Director Patrick Clair \"came up with the idea of making a red world that was revealed by liquid.\" Simulating the CG liquid, which was meant to be an ambiguous reference to poison and blood that behaved like \"something in between liquid chocolate and tar\", was difficult, with Clair saying \"It's hard to make an algorithm act \"insidious\"\". CG Lead Andrew Romatz elaborated that \"Developing the right consistency and behavior of the fluids was definitely a tricky process. Getting the scale to feel right was something that we had to play with quite a bit in simulation and also in lighting and texturing. Patrick wanted the sculptures we were forming to feel like miniatures, so we did a lot of experimenting with scene scale and with camera settings, simulating depth of field to achieve that look.\" Fluids Lead Miguel A. Salek stated that \"Each shot required custom flow maps to be painted on the sculptures, along with small attraction fields and thousands of tiny adjustments to achieve the shapes and behavior Patrick was looking for. In the end I simulated hundreds of tests and thousands of frames of fluids to achieve just the right balance for each shot.\" Due to time constraints, references to Murdock's boxing history such as a punching bag and boxing ring were cut from the final sequence. The final sequence was animated to a [[temp track]]\u2014\"an old piece of 90s trip hop\"\u2014before John Paesano's music for the sequence was completed.<ref name=\"ArtTitle\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the series takes place in New York City, in areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old Hell's Kitchen, in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> The production has an eight-day-per-episode shooting schedule.<ref name=\"BernthalEWJan2016\" /> On the feel of the show, DeKnight stated, \"We're going for a gritty, 1970s' New York feel for the show. We love the idea of beauty and the decay of the city, and Hell's Kitchen being a place that's both beautiful and gritty at the same time. And that's why Matt Murdock loves it and wants to protect it.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightJuly2014\" /> The series' action sequences take inspiration from ''[[The Raid: Redemption|The Raid]]'' films.<ref name=\"RSApr2015\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by the New York studio Shade VFX. Bryan Goswin serves as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"ShadeVFX\" />\n\n===Music===\nIt was revealed that [[John Paesano]] would be composing the music for the series in October 2014.<ref name=\"Paesano\" /> The main theme of the series, which was co-composed by Braden Kimball,<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /> is derived from Paesano's original [[Demo (music)|demo]] for the series, which he submitted during the auditioning process. Paesano noted that it is rare for such material to be incorporated into a final score like this.<ref name=\"PaesanoApr2015\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Daredevil (season 1)#Music|first season]] was released digitally on April 27, 2015,<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /> for the [[Daredevil (season 2)#Music|second season]] on July 15, 2016,<ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" /> and for the [[Daredevil (season 3)#Music|third season]] on October 19, 2018.<ref name=\"Soundtrack3\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=If you live in New York, there are things that are going on all the time. I would never make light of the tragedy of [[9/11]], but 9/11 affected different neighborhoods in very different ways. They were all aware that this had happened, but the further down you got towards that area, the more affected you were by it. So we started with that sort of idea, that if the sky opened up and Chitauri were raining down with giant whales, and the Hulk and the Avengers were there to save the day, that's really exciting, but how did that affect the people who were six blocks over and three avenues down? That's the richness of the Marvel Universe.

But the truth of the matter is, 'I've never seen him. Have you ever seen him?' It's that kind of world that we exist in. For us, it makes Marvel what Marvel has always been, which is grounded.|source=Jeph Loeb on the opportunities that ''Daredevil'' existing within the Marvel Cinematic Universe presents.<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" />}}\n''Daredevil'' is the first of the ordered Netflix series, and is followed by ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', and ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', which lead to the miniseries ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"JulyFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"CageThird\" /><ref name=\"OriginalReleaseOrder\" /> In November 2013, Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, \"It's quite possible that they could become feature films,\"<ref name=\"VarietyTVNov2013\" /> which Sarandos echoed in July 2015.<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\" /> In August 2014, D'Onofrio stated that after the \"series stuff with Netflix\", Marvel has \"a bigger plan to branch out\".<ref name=\"D'OnofrioPortrayal\" /> In December 2014, Loeb explained that \"Within the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [Iron Man]. It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies.\"<ref name=\"EW7Things\" /> Dawson later elaborated that \"When you've got that level of superpowers, the fighting is different, the stakes are different, and it has a grander feel. In that world, they exist in it, so they know it and it's normal to them. But in reality when people are fighting and doing really bad, elicit [sic] crimes on the ground and there are guns and drugs\u2014bones are going to break. People aren't hitting each other and nothing's going to happen because they're indestructible. These are people. They're vulnerable and you get to experience that.\"<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" />\n\nIn March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the series to crossover with the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU films]] and the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC television series]], saying, \"As it is now, in the same way that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to ''The Avengers'', it became more practical for Captain America to do a little crossover into ''[[Thor: The Dark World|Thor 2]]'' and for Bruce Banner to appear at the end of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling in terms of where it's going.\"<ref name=\"LoebDigitalSpy\" /> In April, Cox stated that crossing over with the films is \"possible. I think there's a way that the worlds can merge. I think our show feels tonally and thematically a bit different from the ''Avengers'' movies, but it's all one universe and I feel like there's a way for Daredevil\u2014and other characters, Luke Cage and street level crime characters\u2014to fit into that universe. I think there has to be a way, and I think it's about finding an autonomous tone for that [crossover] film\".<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" /> Cox also said that he is contractually obligated to appear in films if asked by Marvel.<ref name=\"CoxContract\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[Disney Consumer Products]] created a small line of products to cater to a more adult audience, given the show's edgier tone. Paul Gitter, senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney Consumer Products explained that the focus would be more on teens and adults than very young people, with products at outlets like [[Hot Topic]]. Additionally, a Marvel Knights merchandise program was created to support the series, which creates new opportunities for individual product lines and collector focused products. Licensing partners wanted to pair up with Marvel, despite this not being a film project, given its previous successes.<ref name=\"Merchandise\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Streaming===\n''Daredevil'' is available on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available, in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] (HDR).<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"VarietyTrailerUltraHD\" /><ref name=\"HDR\" /> The first two seasons were enhanced to be available in HDR after their initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" /> The episodes for each season were released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage [[binge-watching]], a format which has been used for [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|other Netflix original series]].<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> ''Daredevil'' was the first Netflix original series to receive its [[Descriptive Video Service]] [[audio description]] track.<ref name=\"NetflixAudioDescription\" />\n\n===Home media===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"3\"| [[DVD]] release dates\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"2\"| [[Blu-ray]] release dates\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]]\n|-\n!

The data, which came from Netflix's \"1,300 'taste communities' around the world, where subscribers are grouped based on what they watch\", showed that viewers would not watch the series in chronological order by release, rather starting with ''Jessica Jones'', then ''Daredevil'', ''Luke Cage'' and finally ''Iron Fist''. Todd Yellin, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, noted that audiences watch the series \"in order of how they're interested in them and how they learn about them.\" Netflix's data also showed that a viewer watching ''Daredevil'' would most often then move on to ''Jessica Jones'', and vice versa, while other series \"with antiheroes and themes of moral ambiguity\" such as ''[[Bloodline (TV series)|Bloodline]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' and ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' led viewers to starting ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"NetflixAug2017ViewingPatterns\" /> In October 2018, Crimson Hexagon, a consumer insights company, released data that examined the \"social-media buzz\" for the series to try to correlate it with potential viewership. The data showed that when the first season premiered in April 2015, the season had nearly 275,000 Twitter and Instagram posts regarding it. For when the second season was released in March 2016, the posts had declined to just over 200,000, and for the third season, looking at data gathered halfway through October 2018, the posts had declined to 75,000.<ref name=\"CrimsonHexagonData\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:10px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#0A2252;\"|\n| [[Daredevil (season 1)#Critical response|1]]\n| 99% (71 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS1RT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s01/ |title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 1 (2015) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=February 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| 75 (22 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS1MC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil |title=Marvel's Daredevil : Season 1 |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#395971;\"|\n| [[Daredevil (season 2)#Critical response|2]]\n| 81% (57 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS2RT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s02/ |title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 2 (2016) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n| 68 (13 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS2MC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil/season-2 |title=Marvel's Daredevil : Season 2 |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#A91E1E;\"|\n| [[Daredevil (season 3)#Critical response|3]]\n| 97% (64 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS3RT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s03 |title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 3 (2018) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n| 71 (6 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS3MC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil/season-3 |title=Marvel's Daredevil : Season 3 |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=October 21, 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 99% approval rating for the first season, based on 71 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10.

The series would be centered on Bernthal as Castle, and was described as a stand-alone project, outside of the series leading up to ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"PunisherTVLine\" /><ref name=\"PunisherTHR\" /><ref name=\"SarandosJan2016\" /> Loeb implied that Marvel Television had not instigated the development of the spin-off and were focusing on making \"the best 13 episodes of ''Daredevil'' season two\" at the time, but did say, \"I'm never going to discourage a network from looking at one of our characters and encouraging us to do more....If we are lucky enough that through the writing, through the direction, through the actor that people want to see more of that person, terrific.\"<ref name=\"LoebPunisherResponse\" /> In April 2016, Marvel and Netflix ordered ''The Punisher'', confirmed Bernthal's involvement and named [[Steve Lightfoot]] as showrunner.<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /> The series was released in November 2017.<ref name=\"PunisherRelease\" /> Woll reprises her role as Karen Page in the series.<ref name=\"WollPunisher\" />\n\n==Other media==\nIn November 2015, an update for the mobile fighting game, ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]'', was released featuring a six-part story quest involving Daredevil and Jessica Jones, along with a level based on Hell's Kitchen.<ref name=\"MarvelMobile\" />\n\n==Cancellation and future==\nAhead of the release of season three, ''Deadline Hollywood'' noted the series was expected to be renewed for a fourth season since it was \"widely watched and critically acclaimed\".<ref name=\"S4Expected\" /> Oleson pitched what he wanted to do with a fourth season to Netflix in November 2018, and was hoping that this meeting would lead to an official renewal of the series.<ref name=\"OlesonS4Pitch\" /> Despite the pitch, on November 29, 2018, Netflix canceled the series after three seasons. Netflix said the three seasons would remain on the service, while the character would \"live on in future projects for Marvel\". ''Deadline Hollywood'' noted, that \"unlike ''Iron Fist'' or ''Luke Cage'', the door seems to be wide open\" for the series to continue elsewhere, potentially on Disney's streaming service, [[Disney+]].<ref name=\"Canceled\" /> However, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' felt this was unlikely,<ref name=\"CanceledTHR\" /> especially since, per the original deal between Marvel and Netflix for the series, the characters cannot appear in any non-Netflix series or films for at least two years following the cancellation of ''Daredevil'', as reported by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=\"TwoYearWait\" /> [[Kevin A. Mayer]], chairman of [[Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International]], noted that, while it had not yet been discussed, it was a possibility that Disney+ could revive the series.<ref name=\"Disney+Possible\" />\n\nCox was saddened by the cancellation, since it \"felt like we had a lot of stories to tell\", especially since he had been excited by what had been discussed for a potential fourth season. He added that many of the cast and crew \"really expected to keep going\" and that he was hopeful there would be an opportunity to portray the character again in some form.<ref name=\"CoxCancellation\" /> [[Amy Rutberg]], who portrays Marci Stahl in the series, confirmed the two-year wait requirement and also said the decision to cancel the series came as a surprise to the executives at Marvel given the extensive work that had been done for a potential fourth season. She added that filming for the fourth season had been expected to begin around February 2019 and that many of the cast and crew felt the series would last for five seasons, with a new antagonist in the fourth before a final showdown between Daredevil and Fisk in the fifth.<ref name=\"RutbergCancellation\" /> That same month, [[Hulu]]'s senior vice president of originals Craig Erwich said that the streaming service was open to reviving the series, along with the other former Netflix series.<ref name=\"HuluInterestFeb2019\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"FilmRights\">{{cite news |last=Fleming Jr. |first=Mike |title=TOLDJA!

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]], and is the first in a [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|series of shows]] that lead to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover miniseries. The series is produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with DeKnight Productions for the [[Daredevil (season 1)|first season]] and Goddard Textiles for the first and second seasons. [[Steven S. DeKnight]] serves as [[showrunner]] on the first season, with [[Doug Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez taking over for the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]], and [[Erik Oleson]] joining the series as its showrunner for its [[Daredevil (season 3)|third season]]; Goddard serves as a consultant for the series.\n\n[[Charlie Cox]] stars as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a blind lawyer-by-day who fights crime as a masked vigilante by night. [[Deborah Ann Woll]], [[Elden Henson]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] also star, with [[Toby Leonard Moore]], [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]], [[Bob Gunton]], and [[Ayelet Zurer]] joining them for season one, [[Jon Bernthal]], [[\u00c9lodie Yung]], and [[Stephen Rider]] joining the cast for season two, and [[Wilson Bethel]] and [[Jay Ali]] joining in season three. ''Daredevil'' entered development in late 2013, a year after the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel, with Goddard initially hired in December 2013. DeKnight replaced him as showrunner and Cox was hired to star in May 2014. Filming takes place in New York City, in areas that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].\n\nAll episodes of the first season were released on Netflix on April 10, 2015, while the second season was released in its entirety on March 18, 2016. They were met with positive reviews. In July 2016, the series was renewed for a third season, which was released on October 19, 2018. A spin-off series, centered on Bernthal's character [[Punisher|Frank Castle / Punisher]] and titled ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]'', was ordered by Netflix in April 2016. On November 29, 2018, Netflix canceled ''Daredevil''.<!--Do not add a citation here per WP:LEADCITE! It is cited in the body of the article.

He's not invulnerable... he just has senses that are better than a normal human's.\" On the character's \"grey\" morals, he noted, \"He's a lawyer by day, and he's taken this oath. But every night he breaks that oath, and goes out and does very violent things.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> The character's [[Catholicism]] plays a large role in the series, with DeKnight calling him \"one of the most, if not the most, religious characters in the Marvel Universe\".<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> Cox worked with blind consultant Joe Strechay,<ref name=\"CoxConsultant\" /> and was conscious of what his eyes were doing at all times, to ensure they would not look at or react to something unlike a blind person.<ref name=\"NZHerald\" /> Skylar Gaertner plays a young Matt Murdock.<ref name=\"Gaertner\" />\n* [[Deborah Ann Woll]] as [[Karen Page]]: <br />An enigmatic young woman whose quest for justice sends her crashing into Murdock's life.<ref name=\"Woll2\" /> After portraying [[Jessica Hamby]] in ''[[True Blood]]'' from 2008 to 2014, Woll specifically tried to \"steer differently than that\" with Page.<ref name=\"WollQuote\" /> Woll noted that Page's backstory would be different than the one from the comics, saying, \"In the comic books, in the beginning Karen is very innocent, and then towards the end she's really swung a full 180, she's in a lot of trouble, so I wanted to find a way to make her both of those things at the same time. Can she be a really wonderful, kind person who is a little bit attracted to danger? She's not just always getting into trouble because 'Oh, silly woman!' Karen is actually looking for it, and she won't let her fear stop her from finding the truth.\"<ref name=\"NZHerald\" />\n* [[Elden Henson]] as [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson]]: <br />Murdock's best friend and law partner.<ref name=\"Henson\" /> In April 2015, Henson spoke of his excitement for the character's role in the series, saying \"I was really excited as I was getting the scripts and reading that Foggy wasn't just a useless sidekick. He's not just comic relief. I mean, he is some of those things. He does have comic relief, but it was exciting to know that these other characters would have their own path and their own things that they're dealing with.\"<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" />\n* [[Toby Leonard Moore]] as [[James Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]]: Wilson Fisk's right-hand man.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> Moore described Wesley as both charming and \"dastardly as all hell\".<ref name=\"MooreCBR\" />\n* [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as [[Ben Urich]]: An investigative journalist for the ''New York Bulletin''.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" />\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Leland Owlsley]]: A Wall Street financialist, accountant, and a key figure in Wilson Fisk's plans for Hell's Kitchen.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20142\" />\n* [[Ayelet Zurer]] as [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna-Fisk]]: An art gallery employee who, unlike the comic version, knows of and accepts Wilson Fisk's true dealings and eventually marries him.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" />\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]]: <br />A nurse who helps Murdock.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20142\" /> The character is an amalgam of the comic characters [[Claire Temple]] and [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]].<ref name=\"DawsonTime\" /> The character was originally going to be \"the actual Night Nurse\", but was merged with Temple when the writers learned that [[Marvel Studios]] had plans for that character in their films.<ref name=\"DeKnightNightNurse\" /> Dawson explained that Temple \"is a normal person and she becomes more heroic in a way that she maybe didn't expect\",<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" /> and \"She's not a love interest\u2014she's this skeptical eye looking at this strange situation.

In our story, we tell the story of how he met his wife Vanessa and how they fell in love\". He also said that \"if you're looking for a juicy, multi-faceted crime drama, Wilson Fisk was the obvious choice to play the antagonist ...

He also felt Bernthal's Punisher would not be as \"graphically violent\" as in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''.<ref name=\"DeKnightPunisher\" /> Season two showrunner [[Doug Petrie]] stated that [[Travis Bickle]] from ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' was an influence on the character, as well as current events, saying, \"Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings.\" Bernthal added that \"This character has resonated with law enforcement and military ... and the best thing about him is that if he offends you, he just doesn't care.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2015\" />\n* [[\u00c9lodie Yung]] as [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]]: <br />A mysterious and dangerous woman from Murdock's past.

She does everything wrong and attractive, she's [Matt's] id, the wild side. Matt is always taming his wild side. Elektra just lets it out. He's both repulsed and deeply drawn to that.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2015\" /> Yung described Elektra as \"kind of a sociopath. This world is a game for her.

But what we all sort of realized is that, this movie doesn't want to cost $200&nbsp;million. The thing about Matt Murdock is, he's not saving the world. He's just keeping his corner clean. So it would feel wrong to have spaceships crashing in the middle of the city. But because of that, Marvel on the movie side is not in the business of making $25&nbsp;million movies. They're going big, as they should.\"<ref name=\"GoddardSept2015\" /> Marvel Studios eventually decided that the character would be better served in a television series.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" />\n\nIn October 2013, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to [[video on demand]] services and cable providers, with [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Instant Video|Amazon]] and [[WGN America]] expressing interest.<ref name=\"DeadlineOct2013\" /> A few weeks later, Marvel and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] announced that Marvel Television and [[ABC Studios]] would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Daredevil, [[Jessica Jones]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Luke Cage]], leading up to a miniseries based on the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref name=\"DeadlineNov2013\" /> This format was chosen due to the success of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', for which the characters of [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]], [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|The Hulk]], [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]], and [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] were all introduced separately before being teamed up in that film.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" /> In December, Goddard was officially hired as executive producer and [[showrunner]] for ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"GoddardExecProd\" /> and was happy with the change to television from his film idea \"because you can take time and deal with these smaller things, which to me are much more interesting on a character level\".<ref name=\"GoddardOct2018\" /> However, Marvel announced in May 2014 that Goddard had stepped down as showrunner to focus on directing a feature film based on Marvel's [[Sinister Six]] team for [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]]. Goddard, who wrote the first two episodes of the series, remained with the show as a consultant while [[Steven S. DeKnight]] took over as showrunner. The series was officially titled ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"GoddardDaredevilExit\" /> with Loeb, Jim Chory, [[Dan Buckley]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], Cindy Holland, Kris Henigman, Allie Goss, and Peter Friedlander also serving as executive producers.<ref name=\"VarietyS1Review\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Marvel and Netflix announced that ''Daredevil'' had been renewed for a second season, but DeKnight would not be returning due to prior commitments. He was replaced as showrunner by [[Doug Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez, who served as writers for the first season and worked closely with DeKnight and Goddard.<ref name=\"Season2Ordered\" /> Petrie, Ramirez, Alison Engel, and Mark Verheiden became executive producers for the second season, while Friedlander left the show.<ref name=\"VarietyS2Review\" /> The series was renewed for a third season in July 2016, with Petrie and Ramirez intended to return as showrunners,<ref name=\"Season3\" /> but [[Erik Oleson]] was announced in October 2017 to be taking over as showrunner.<ref name=\"Oleson\" />\n\n===Writing===\nGoddard was always a fan of Daredevil after being raised Catholic, and identifying with the character's story of a \"Catholic superhero struggling with the notions of right and wrong\".<ref name=\"GoddardOct2018\" /> He did not want to be \"a guy that just takes the comics and then shoots them onscreen. I think it's our job to treat it as if it's our run. If I'm the writer of a comic book, you wouldn't just retell someone else's story, you would just take that ball and move it forward.\"<ref name=\"GoddardCBR\" />\n\nIn August 2014, when talking about the series in comparison to the 2003 film, Ted Sarandos said, \"The series will not be afraid to go darker than the film did. What we love about this particular set of heroes is that they're a little more down to Earth. Costume wise and also in that these are gritty crime stories, more in the streets than in the clouds.\"<ref name=\"SeriesFilmComparison\" /> Elaborating on this, DeKnight said, \"It is a little grittier and edgier than Marvel has gone before, but we're not looking to push it to extreme graphic violence, gratuitous nudity or anything like that. The story does not require that and I think [it] would suffer if you pushed it that far.\"<ref name=\"EW7Things\" /> Marvel Television head and executive producer Loeb later stated that, \"There aren't going to be people flying through the sky; there are no magic hammers. We've always approached this as a crime drama first, superhero show second.\"<ref name=\"EW2015Preview\" /> DeKnight took inspiration from ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', and stated that \"we would rather lean toward ''[[The Wire]]'' than what's considered a classic superhero television show.\"<ref name=\"EW7Things\" />\n\nLoeb compared the series' approach to telling stories over multiple seasons to \"the world of publishing, where you have the [[Frank Miller (comics creator)|Frank Miller]], you have the [[Brian Michael Bendis|Brian Bendis]] run, you have the [[Ed Brubaker]] run. I was lucky enough to do ''Daredevil: Yellow''. But they feel different. They have different elements to them. Same cast. In many cases, same tone. But a different adventure ... you can watch ''Daredevil'' season two without having seen ''Daredevil'' season one. But if you watch each of them, it's like getting two different books. It's closer to the world of the graphic novel than it is to the world of the ongoing, serialized show.\"<ref name=\"LoebSDCC2016\" />\n\n===Casting===\nAt the end of May 2014, [[Charlie Cox]] was cast as Daredevil.<ref name=\"Cox\" /> Cox was the first choice for the role, suggested by Quesada in 2012 before Marvel Studios gained the rights to the character from 20th Century Fox.<ref name=\"Cox3\" /> On June 10, Marvel announced that [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] would portray [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk / Kingpin]] in the series,<ref name=\"D'Onofrio\" /><ref name=\"BustleS2EasterEggs\" /> and on June 20, [[Rosario Dawson]] joined the cast.<ref name=\"DawsonCast\" /> A few days later, [[Elden Henson]] was cast as [[Foggy Nelson]],<ref name=\"Henson\" /> while on July 17, [[Deborah Ann Woll]] was cast as [[Karen Page]].<ref name=\"Woll\" /> On October 11, Dawson's role was revealed to be [[Claire Temple]],<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /> a character resembling that of [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]],<ref name=\"NYCC20142\" /> while [[Ayelet Zurer]], [[Bob Gunton]], [[Toby Leonard Moore]], and [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] joined the series as [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Mariana]], [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Leland Owlsley]], [[Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]], and [[Ben Urich]], respectively.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" />\n\nIn June 2015, Marvel announced that [[Jon Bernthal]] was cast as Frank Castle / Punisher for the second season, joining season one returners Cox, Woll, Henson, Dawson, and D'Onofrio.<ref name=\"Bernthal\" /><ref name=\"Yung\" /><ref name=\"FiskS2\" /> The next month, [[\u00c9lodie Yung]] was cast as Elektra Natchios, a character that had been mentioned already in the first season.<ref name=\"Yung\" /><ref name=\"GlennS2\" /><ref name=\"S2Release\" /> In September 2015, [[Stephen Rider]] joined the cast in the role of [[Blake Tower]].<ref name=\"Rider\" /> Cox, Woll, Henson, D'Onofrio,<ref name=\"Oleson\" /> and Rider return for the third season.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} [[Wilson Bethel]] was revealed to be joining them in November 2017, as [[Bullseye (comics)|Benjamin \"Dex\" Poindexter]],<ref name=\"Bethel\" /><ref name=\"Bullseye\" /> with [[Joanne Whalley]] joining as Sister [[Maggie Murdock|Maggie Grace]] by January 2018,<ref name=\"Whalley\" /><ref name=\"WhalleyCollider\" /> and Jay Ali joining as Rahul \"Ray\" Nadeem, another FBI agent by March 2018.<ref name=\"Ali\" /> Zurer has a guest appearance in the season.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nOn the casting process, DeKnight stated that \"You just have to hope you find the right way. Luckily our cast came together, and I couldn't have been happier. No one will ever perfectly fit what's in your head. For me, the more important thing is not whether or not they look the part, but if they feel the part.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> Laray Mayfield and Julie Schubert served as casting directors on the series.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" /> In December 2017, D'Onofrio revealed he had \"a standing agreement with Jeph Loeb\", created before the first season, that allowed him to \"come in and out of the show\", with an unspecified amount of notice given when Marvel hoped to use D'Onofrio in the series.<ref name=\"D'OnofrioAgreement\" />\n\n===Design===\n====Costumes====\nCostume designer Stephanie Maslansky, talking about the inspiration and vision for the series, said \"''Daredevil'' is rooted in the authentically gritty New York City neighborhood, Hell's Kitchen where Matt Murdock grew up. In the comics\u2014particularly those of the Frank Miller era in the early 1990s\u2014there were detailed illustrations we endeavored to bring to life in a grounded, gritty, and updated way, with respect and a strong nod to the original characters. We wanted to pick up where the comics version left off. I studied the illustrations from ''The Man Without Fear'', ''Daredevil Yellow'', and the issues of the 1960s, to which the newer collections pay homage. I wanted the costume design to reflect the illustrations of those volumes through a modern lens while maintaining a retro sensibility.\"<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> Joshua Shaw, who has also done design work on ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', helped design costumes for several characters on ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /><ref name=\"ShawSHIELD\" /> while Lorraine Calvert took over as costume designer for the second season.<ref name=\"Calvert\" />\n\nFor Daredevil's red suit, introduced at the end of the first season, Marvel Comics' [[Chief creative officer]] Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on ''Daredevil'' comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which lead to the use of rivets and \"architectural\" shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with \"deeper portions\" in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, \"because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor's face is going to be doing something else\". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], \"There was a discussion early in the process, because Charlie Cox [and his stunt double] Chris Brewster are both right handed, of having the billy clubs holster on the right leg. But Daredevil wears those billy clubs on the left hand side. So while it would have been easier to place the holster on the right we all felt that we had to keep to the classic profile and keep them on the left.\"<ref name=\"MarvelSuit\" />\n\nThe suit was upgraded for the second season, with Calvert calling it \"a much more fluid suit and much more tactical in a way.\" The costume department \"streamlined\" the suit to make it simpler, using less material on the gauntlets and boots.<ref name=\"Calvert\" /> Cox described the changes as \"tweaks\" that were needed after seeing the suit in action in the first season, and noted that the changes are woven into the storyline of the season, including the need for a new, redesigned mask.<ref name=\"CoxS2Costume\" />\n\n====Title sequence====\n{{external media|float=right|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFYFh8w4758 The opening title sequence of ''Daredevil''], showcasing Elastic's design work and composer [[John Paesano]]'s main theme for the series.}}\nThe opening [[title sequence]] was created by Elastic. The company previously created the title sequence for ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]'', which had stood out to the creators in terms of \"imagination and delivering on what the show was about\". DeKnight explained that multiple companies had made pitches to the creative team involving \"variations of the same idea, where you zoom in on an eye and you see a sonar map of the city.\" However, one of Elastic's pitches had \"fluid-like blood dripping over everything ... as if paint were covering something invisible and revealing it\", which both DeKnight and Loeb wanted to use immediately.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" />\n\nElastic's Creative Director Patrick Clair \"came up with the idea of making a red world that was revealed by liquid.\" Simulating the CG liquid, which was meant to be an ambiguous reference to poison and blood that behaved like \"something in between liquid chocolate and tar\", was difficult, with Clair saying \"It's hard to make an algorithm act \"insidious\"\". CG Lead Andrew Romatz elaborated that \"Developing the right consistency and behavior of the fluids was definitely a tricky process. Getting the scale to feel right was something that we had to play with quite a bit in simulation and also in lighting and texturing. Patrick wanted the sculptures we were forming to feel like miniatures, so we did a lot of experimenting with scene scale and with camera settings, simulating depth of field to achieve that look.\" Fluids Lead Miguel A. Salek stated that \"Each shot required custom flow maps to be painted on the sculptures, along with small attraction fields and thousands of tiny adjustments to achieve the shapes and behavior Patrick was looking for. In the end I simulated hundreds of tests and thousands of frames of fluids to achieve just the right balance for each shot.\" Due to time constraints, references to Murdock's boxing history such as a punching bag and boxing ring were cut from the final sequence. The final sequence was animated to a [[temp track]]\u2014\"an old piece of 90s trip hop\"\u2014before John Paesano's music for the sequence was completed.<ref name=\"ArtTitle\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the series takes place in New York City, in areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old Hell's Kitchen, in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> The production has an eight-day-per-episode shooting schedule.<ref name=\"BernthalEWJan2016\" /> On the feel of the show, DeKnight stated, \"We're going for a gritty, 1970s' New York feel for the show. We love the idea of beauty and the decay of the city, and Hell's Kitchen being a place that's both beautiful and gritty at the same time. And that's why Matt Murdock loves it and wants to protect it.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightJuly2014\" /> The series' action sequences take inspiration from ''[[The Raid: Redemption|The Raid]]'' films.<ref name=\"RSApr2015\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by the New York studio Shade VFX. Bryan Goswin serves as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"ShadeVFX\" />\n\n===Music===\nIt was revealed that [[John Paesano]] would be composing the music for the series in October 2014.<ref name=\"Paesano\" /> The main theme of the series, which was co-composed by Braden Kimball,<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /> is derived from Paesano's original [[Demo (music)|demo]] for the series, which he submitted during the auditioning process. Paesano noted that it is rare for such material to be incorporated into a final score like this.<ref name=\"PaesanoApr2015\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Daredevil (season 1)#Music|first season]] was released digitally on April 27, 2015,<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /> for the [[Daredevil (season 2)#Music|second season]] on July 15, 2016,<ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" /> and for the [[Daredevil (season 3)#Music|third season]] on October 19, 2018.<ref name=\"Soundtrack3\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=If you live in New York, there are things that are going on all the time. I would never make light of the tragedy of [[9/11]], but 9/11 affected different neighborhoods in very different ways. They were all aware that this had happened, but the further down you got towards that area, the more affected you were by it. So we started with that sort of idea, that if the sky opened up and Chitauri were raining down with giant whales, and the Hulk and the Avengers were there to save the day, that's really exciting, but how did that affect the people who were six blocks over and three avenues down? That's the richness of the Marvel Universe. You can have that sort of thing happen and refer to it, but not have it be&nbsp;\u2013 we're not the world of the comics where you look up in the sky and Thor flies by all the time. This is a world where people do refer to Tony Stark as a billionaire in a tin suit, or the idea that they think there's a Thor out there with a magic hammer. But the truth of the matter is, 'I've never seen him. Have you ever seen him?' It's that kind of world that we exist in. For us, it makes Marvel what Marvel has always been, which is grounded.|source=Jeph Loeb on the opportunities that ''Daredevil'' existing within the Marvel Cinematic Universe presents.<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" />}}\n''Daredevil'' is the first of the ordered Netflix series, and is followed by ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', and ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', which lead to the miniseries ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"JulyFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"CageThird\" /><ref name=\"OriginalReleaseOrder\" /> In November 2013, Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, \"It's quite possible that they could become feature films,\"<ref name=\"VarietyTVNov2013\" /> which Sarandos echoed in July 2015.<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\" /> In August 2014, D'Onofrio stated that after the \"series stuff with Netflix\", Marvel has \"a bigger plan to branch out\".<ref name=\"D'OnofrioPortrayal\" /> In December 2014, Loeb explained that \"Within the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [Iron Man]. It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies.\"<ref name=\"EW7Things\" /> Dawson later elaborated that \"When you've got that level of superpowers, the fighting is different, the stakes are different, and it has a grander feel. In that world, they exist in it, so they know it and it's normal to them. But in reality when people are fighting and doing really bad, elicit [sic] crimes on the ground and there are guns and drugs\u2014bones are going to break. People aren't hitting each other and nothing's going to happen because they're indestructible. These are people. They're vulnerable and you get to experience that.\"<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" />\n\nIn March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the series to crossover with the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU films]] and the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC television series]], saying, \"As it is now, in the same way that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to ''The Avengers'', it became more practical for Captain America to do a little crossover into ''[[Thor: The Dark World|Thor 2]]'' and for Bruce Banner to appear at the end of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling in terms of where it's going.\"<ref name=\"LoebDigitalSpy\" /> In April, Cox stated that crossing over with the films is \"possible. I think there's a way that the worlds can merge. I think our show feels tonally and thematically a bit different from the ''Avengers'' movies, but it's all one universe and I feel like there's a way for Daredevil\u2014and other characters, Luke Cage and street level crime characters\u2014to fit into that universe. I think there has to be a way, and I think it's about finding an autonomous tone for that [crossover] film\".<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" /> Cox also said that he is contractually obligated to appear in films if asked by Marvel.<ref name=\"CoxContract\" />\n\n===Marketing===\n[[Disney Consumer Products]] created a small line of products to cater to a more adult audience, given the show's edgier tone. Paul Gitter, senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney Consumer Products explained that the focus would be more on teens and adults than very young people, with products at outlets like [[Hot Topic]]. Additionally, a Marvel Knights merchandise program was created to support the series, which creates new opportunities for individual product lines and collector focused products. Licensing partners wanted to pair up with Marvel, despite this not being a film project, given its previous successes.<ref name=\"Merchandise\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Streaming===\n''Daredevil'' is available on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available, in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] (HDR).<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"VarietyTrailerUltraHD\" /><ref name=\"HDR\" /> The first two seasons were enhanced to be available in HDR after their initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" /> The episodes for each season were released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage [[binge-watching]], a format which has been used for [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|other Netflix original series]].<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> ''Daredevil'' was the first Netflix original series to receive its [[Descriptive Video Service]] [[audio description]] track.<ref name=\"NetflixAudioDescription\" />\n\n===Home media===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"3\"| [[DVD]] release dates\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"2\"| [[Blu-ray]] release dates\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]]\n|-\n!

The data, which came from Netflix's \"1,300 'taste communities' around the world, where subscribers are grouped based on what they watch\", showed that viewers would not watch the series in chronological order by release, rather starting with ''Jessica Jones'', then ''Daredevil'', ''Luke Cage'' and finally ''Iron Fist''. Todd Yellin, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, noted that audiences watch the series \"in order of how they're interested in them and how they learn about them.\" Netflix's data also showed that a viewer watching ''Daredevil'' would most often then move on to ''Jessica Jones'', and vice versa, while other series \"with antiheroes and themes of moral ambiguity\" such as ''[[Bloodline (TV series)|Bloodline]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' and ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' led viewers to starting ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"NetflixAug2017ViewingPatterns\" /> In October 2018, Crimson Hexagon, a consumer insights company, released data that examined the \"social-media buzz\" for the series to try to correlate it with potential viewership. The data showed that when the first season premiered in April 2015, the season had nearly 275,000 Twitter and Instagram posts regarding it. For when the second season was released in March 2016, the posts had declined to just over 200,000, and for the third season, looking at data gathered halfway through October 2018, the posts had declined to 75,000.<ref name=\"CrimsonHexagonData\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:10px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#0A2252;\"|\n| [[Daredevil (season 1)#Critical response|1]]\n| 99% (71 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS1RT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s01/ |title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 1 (2015) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=February 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| 75 (22 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS1MC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil |title=Marvel's Daredevil : Season 1 |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#395971;\"|\n| [[Daredevil (season 2)#Critical response|2]]\n| 81% (57 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS2RT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s02/ |title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 2 (2016) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n| 68 (13 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS2MC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil/season-2 |title=Marvel's Daredevil : Season 2 |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#A91E1E;\"|\n| [[Daredevil (season 3)#Critical response|3]]\n| 97% (64 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS3RT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s03 |title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 3 (2018) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n| 71 (6 reviews)<ref name=\"DDS3MC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil/season-3 |title=Marvel's Daredevil : Season 3 |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=October 21, 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 99% approval rating for the first season, based on 71 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10.

The series would be centered on Bernthal as Castle, and was described as a stand-alone project, outside of the series leading up to ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"PunisherTVLine\" /><ref name=\"PunisherTHR\" /><ref name=\"SarandosJan2016\" /> Loeb implied that Marvel Television had not instigated the development of the spin-off and were focusing on making \"the best 13 episodes of ''Daredevil'' season two\" at the time, but did say, \"I'm never going to discourage a network from looking at one of our characters and encouraging us to do more....If we are lucky enough that through the writing, through the direction, through the actor that people want to see more of that person, terrific.\"<ref name=\"LoebPunisherResponse\" /> In April 2016, Marvel and Netflix ordered ''The Punisher'', confirmed Bernthal's involvement and named [[Steve Lightfoot]] as showrunner.<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /> The series was released in November 2017.<ref name=\"PunisherRelease\" /> Woll reprises her role as Karen Page in the series.<ref name=\"WollPunisher\" />\n\n==Other media==\nIn November 2015, an update for the mobile fighting game, ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]'', was released featuring a six-part story quest involving Daredevil and Jessica Jones, along with a level based on Hell's Kitchen.<ref name=\"MarvelMobile\" />\n\n==Cancellation and future==\nAhead of the release of season three, ''Deadline Hollywood'' noted the series was expected to be renewed for a fourth season since it was \"widely watched and critically acclaimed\".<ref name=\"S4Expected\" /> Oleson pitched what he wanted to do with a fourth season to Netflix in November 2018, and was hoping that this meeting would lead to an official renewal of the series.<ref name=\"OlesonS4Pitch\" /> Despite the pitch, on November 29, 2018, Netflix canceled the series after three seasons. Netflix said the three seasons would remain on the service, while the character would \"live on in future projects for Marvel\". ''Deadline Hollywood'' noted, that \"unlike ''Iron Fist'' or ''Luke Cage'', the door seems to be wide open\" for the series to continue elsewhere, potentially on Disney's streaming service, [[Disney+]].<ref name=\"Canceled\" /> However, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' felt this was unlikely,<ref name=\"CanceledTHR\" /> especially since, per the original deal between Marvel and Netflix for the series, the characters cannot appear in any non-Netflix series or films for at least two years following the cancellation of ''Daredevil'', as reported by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=\"TwoYearWait\" /> [[Kevin A. Mayer]], chairman of [[Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International]], noted that, while it had not yet been discussed, it was a possibility that Disney+ could revive the series.<ref name=\"Disney+Possible\" />\n\nCox was saddened by the cancellation, since it \"felt like we had a lot of stories to tell\", especially since he had been excited by what had been discussed for a potential fourth season. He added that many of the cast and crew \"really expected to keep going\" and that he was hopeful there would be an opportunity to portray the character again in some form.<ref name=\"CoxCancellation\" /> [[Amy Rutberg]], who portrays Marci Stahl in the series, confirmed the two-year wait requirement and also said the decision to cancel the series came as a surprise to the executives at Marvel given the extensive work that had been done for a potential fourth season. She added that filming for the fourth season had been expected to begin around February 2019 and that many of the cast and crew felt the series would last for five seasons, with a new antagonist in the fourth before a final showdown between Daredevil and Fisk in the fifth.<ref name=\"RutbergCancellation\" /> That same month, [[Hulu]]'s senior vice president of originals Craig Erwich said that the streaming service was open to reviving the series, along with the other former Netflix series.<ref name=\"HuluInterestFeb2019\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"FilmRights\">{{cite news |last=Fleming Jr. |first=Mike |title=TOLDJA!

G. Wells]] and jointly produced and released by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures]]. It stars [[Tom Cruise]] with [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Justin Chatwin]], [[Miranda Otto]], and [[Tim Robbins]] in supporting roles. It also features narration by [[Morgan Freeman]]. The film follows an American dock worker who is forced to look after his children, from whom he lives separately, as he struggles to protect them and reunite them with their mother when [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|extraterrestrials]] [[Alien invasion|invade]] the Earth and devastate cities with giant [[Tripod (War of the Worlds)|war machines]]. This was [[Gene Barry]]'s final film before his retirement that year and his death in 2009.\n\nThe film was shot in 73 days, using five different sound stages as well as locations in [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Virginia]]. The film was surrounded by a secrecy campaign so few details would be leaked before its release. Tie-in promotions were made with several companies, including [[Hitachi]].\n\n''War of the Worlds'' was released in the United States on June 29, 2005 and in United Kingdom on July 1, 2005, by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly those of Cruise and Fanning), Spielberg's direction, screenplay, action sequences and visual effects, and was a box office success, becoming 2005's fourth most successful film both [[List of 2005 box office number-one films in the United States#Highest-grossing films|domestically]] and [[2005 in film#Highest-grossing films|worldwide]], with $234 million in North America, and $591 million overall. The film earned three [[Academy Awards]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nDivorced [[longshoreman]] Ray Ferrier works at a dock in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and is estranged from his children: 10-year-old daughter Rachel, and teenage son Robbie. Ray's ex-wife, Mary Ann, drops them off at his house in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], on her way to visit her parents in [[Boston]]. \n\nLater, a strange storm occurs during which lightning strikes multiple times into the middle of a local intersection, disrupting all electricity. Ray joins the crowd at the scene of the impacts, where a massive \"[[Fighting machine (The War of the Worlds)|tripod]]\" war machine emerges from the ground and uses powerful energy weapons to destroy the area, disintegrating most of the witnesses into a grey dust. Ray collects his children, steals a van that had just been repaired, and drives to Mary Ann's empty home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge. That night, they take shelter in the basement, but they soon hear a strange roaring noise followed by an explosion, which destroys the house. The next morning, Ray discovers that a [[Boeing 747]] had crashed into the neighborhood. A wandering news team scavenging food from the wreckage explains to him that there are multiple tripods that have attacked major cities around the world. The tripods have [[Force field (fiction)|force shields]] to protect them from human weapons, and the tripods' pilots traveled to Earth within the lightning storms as a way to enter their machines, which are assumed to have been buried underground for millions of years. \n\nRay decides to drive the kids to [[Boston]] to be with their mother, but a desperate mob swarm their vehicle and they are forced to abandon it. They eventually board a ferry to cross the [[Hudson River]] only to be surrounded by several tripods, who begin massacring and abducting many of the refugees, but Ray's family manages to escape. They then witness [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] engaging in a futile battle with some tripods; Ray tries to stop Robbie from joining the fight, but is reluctantly forced to release him so that he can take Rachel to safety. Ray and Rachel flee as the machines annihilate the soldiers, and are offered shelter in a farmhouse basement by a deranged man named Harlan Ogilvy. \n\nThe three remain undetected for several days, even as a probe and a group of tripod aliens explore the basement. They soon discover that the aliens are cultivating a [[Red weed|red-colored vegetation]] across the landscape that is quickly spreading; the group deduces the aliens are modifying Earth to make it more like their home planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown upon witnessing the tripods harvesting human blood and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] to fertilize the alien vegetation. Fearing that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the aliens, Ray reluctantly kills him. A second tripod probe catches the Ferriers sleeping; Rachel flees and is abducted by a nearby tripod, and Ray joins her after picking up a belt of [[Fragmentation grenade|grenades]]. Ray uses the grenades to destroy the tripod from within, freeing all the abductees.\n\nRay and Rachel arrive in Boston, where they find the alien vegetation withering and the tripods inexplicably collapsing. When an active tripod appears, Ray notices birds landing on it, indicating its shields are offline. Ray alerts the soldiers escorting the fleeing crowd, who shoot it down with [[FGM-148 Javelin|anti-tank missiles]]. As the soldiers advance on the downed tripod, a hatch opens and a sickly alien struggles halfway out before dying. Ray and Rachel finally reach Mary Ann's parents' house, where they are reunited with Mary Ann and Robbie. \n\nA closing narration explains that the aliens' immune systems could not handle the countless billions of [[microbes]] that inhabit the Earth, and that humanity has \"earned\" the right to the planet by virtue of naturally coexisting with the rest of its biosphere.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Dakota Fanning]] portray the two main characters of the film.\n| width     = 160\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Tom Cruis.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| image2    = Dakota Fanning WOTW London retouch.jpg\n| alt2      =\n}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Tom Cruise]] as Ray Ferrier\n*[[Dakota Fanning]] as Rachel Ferrier\n*[[Justin Chatwin]] as Robbie Ferrier\n*[[Miranda Otto]] as Mary Ann Ferrier\n*[[Tim Robbins]] as Harlan Ogilvy\n*[[Rick Gonzalez]] as Vincent\n*[[Yul V\u00e1zquez]] as Julio\n*[[Lenny Venito]] as Manny the Mechanic\n*[[Lisa Ann Walter]] as Sheryl\n*[[Ann Robinson]] as Grandmother (she played the lead role of Sylvia van Buren in the 1953 film)\n*[[Gene Barry]] as Grandfather (he played lead role of Dr. Clayton Forrester in the 1953 film)\n*[[David Alan Basche]] as Tim\n*[[Roz Abrams]] as Herself\n*[[Camillia Sanes]] as News Producer\n*[[Amy Ryan]] as Neighbor with Toddler\n*[[Danny Hoch]] as Policeman\n*[[Morgan Freeman]] as the Narrator (voice)\n*[[Dee Bradley Baker]] as Alien Vocals (uncredited)\n*[[Columbus Short]] as Soldier\n*[[Channing Tatum]] as Boy in Church Scene (scene cut)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAfter collaborating in 2002's ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Tom Cruise]] were interested in working together again.

Producer and longtime collaborator [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] notes that with ''War of the Worlds'', Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in ''E.T.'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''. \"When we first started developing ''E.T.'', it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign.

Some aspects of the book were heavily adapted and condensed: Tim Robbins' character was an amalgam of two characters in the book, with the name borrowed from a third. While changing the setting from 19th century to present day, Koepp also tried to \"take the modern world back to the 1800s\", with the characters being devoid of electricity and modern techniques of communication.<ref name=d1>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=378|title=David Koepp on War of the Worlds|last=Freer|first=Ian|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=January 17, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017165808/http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=378|archivedate=October 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nSpielberg accepted the script after finding it had several similarities to his [[Steven Spielberg#Personal life|personal life]], including the divorce of his parents (Ray and Mary Ann's divorce), and because the plight of the fictional survivors reflects his own uncertainty after the devastation of the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name=\"d5\"/> For Spielberg, the characters' stories of survival needed to be the main focus, as they featured the [[American way|American mindset]] of never giving up.<ref name=\"d5\"/> Spielberg described ''War of the Worlds'' as \"a polar opposite\" to ''Close Encounters'', with that movie featuring a man leaving family to travel with aliens, while ''War of the Worlds'' focused on keeping the family together.<ref name=\"d5\"/> At the same time, the aliens and their motivations would not be much explored, as \"we just experience the results of these nefarious plans to replace us with themselves\".<ref name=design/>\n\nAlthough accepting the script, Spielberg asked for several changes. Spielberg had been against the idea of the aliens arriving in [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)#Novel|spaceship]]s, since every alien invasion movie used such a vehicle.<ref name=\"d10\"/> The original [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martian]] cylinders were discarded, where Spielberg replaced the origins of the [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|Tripod]]s with stating they were buried underground in the Earth long ago.<ref name=d2/><ref name=\"d10\"/>\n\nSpielberg had [[Miranda Otto]] in mind for the part of Mary Ann, but at the time he called her she was pregnant and thought the opportunity would be missed. Spielberg then decided to incorporate Otto's pregnancy into the film, changing the part for her.\n\nLawrence Brown wrote: \"Spielberg's decision to present the invaders' fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which did not exist in the original Wells book. In Spielberg's version, these invaders had been here before, long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself \u2013 a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers \u2013 and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us \u2013 all humans over the whole of history \u2013 have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be 'harvested'\".<ref>Lawrence C.

G. Wells]] and jointly produced and released by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures]]. It stars [[Tom Cruise]] with [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Justin Chatwin]], [[Miranda Otto]], and [[Tim Robbins]] in supporting roles. It also features narration by [[Morgan Freeman]]. The film follows an American dock worker who is forced to look after his children, from whom he lives separately, as he struggles to protect them and reunite them with their mother when [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|extraterrestrials]] [[Alien invasion|invade]] the Earth and devastate cities with giant [[Tripod (War of the Worlds)|war machines]]. This was [[Gene Barry]]'s final film before his retirement that year and his death in 2009.\n\nThe film was shot in 73 days, using five different sound stages as well as locations in [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Virginia]]. The film was surrounded by a secrecy campaign so few details would be leaked before its release. Tie-in promotions were made with several companies, including [[Hitachi]].\n\n''War of the Worlds'' was released in the United States on June 29, 2005 and in United Kingdom on July 1, 2005, by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly those of Cruise and Fanning), Spielberg's direction, screenplay, action sequences and visual effects, and was a box office success, becoming 2005's fourth most successful film both [[List of 2005 box office number-one films in the United States#Highest-grossing films|domestically]] and [[2005 in film#Highest-grossing films|worldwide]], with $234 million in North America, and $591 million overall. The film earned three [[Academy Awards]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nDivorced [[longshoreman]] Ray Ferrier works at a dock in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and is estranged from his children: 10-year-old daughter Rachel, and teenage son Robbie. Ray's ex-wife, Mary Ann, drops them off at his house in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], on her way to visit her parents in [[Boston]]. \n\nLater, a strange storm occurs during which lightning strikes multiple times into the middle of a local intersection, disrupting all electricity. Ray joins the crowd at the scene of the impacts, where a massive \"[[Fighting machine (The War of the Worlds)|tripod]]\" war machine emerges from the ground and uses powerful energy weapons to destroy the area, disintegrating most of the witnesses into a grey dust. Ray collects his children, steals a van that had just been repaired, and drives to Mary Ann's empty home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge. That night, they take shelter in the basement, but they soon hear a strange roaring noise followed by an explosion, which destroys the house. The next morning, Ray discovers that a [[Boeing 747]] had crashed into the neighborhood. A news team scavenging for food while surveying the wreckage explains to him that there are multiple tripods that have attacked major cities around the world. The tripods have [[Force field (fiction)|force shields]] to protect them from human weapons, and the tripods' pilots traveled to Earth within the lightning storms as a way to enter their machines, which are assumed to have been buried underground for millions of years. \n\nRay decides to drive the kids to [[Boston]] to be with their mother, but a desperate mob swarm their vehicle and they are forced to abandon it. They eventually board a ferry to cross the [[Hudson River]] only to be surrounded by several tripods, who begin massacring and abducting many of the refugees, but Ray's family manages to escape. They then witness [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] engaging in a futile battle with some tripods; Ray tries to stop Robbie from joining the fight, but is reluctantly forced to release him so that he can take Rachel to safety. Ray and Rachel flee as the machines annihilate the soldiers, and are offered shelter in a farmhouse basement by a deranged man named Harlan Ogilvy. \n\nThe three remain undetected for several days, even as a probe and a group of tripod aliens explore the basement. They soon discover that the aliens are cultivating a [[Red weed|red-colored vegetation]] across the landscape that is quickly spreading; the group deduces the aliens are modifying Earth to make it more like their home planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown upon witnessing the tripods harvesting human blood and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] to fertilize the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the aliens to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. A second tripod probe catches the Ferriers sleeping; Rachel flees and is abducted by a nearby tripod, and Ray joins her after picking up a belt of [[Fragmentation grenade|grenades]]. Ray uses the grenades to destroy the tripod from within, freeing all the abductees.\n\nRay and Rachel arrive in Boston, where they find the alien vegetation withering and the tripods inexplicably collapsing. When an active tripod appears, Ray notices birds landing on it, indicating its shields are offline. Ray alerts the soldiers escorting the fleeing crowd, who shoot it down with [[FGM-148 Javelin|anti-tank missiles]]. As the soldiers advance on the downed tripod, a hatch opens and a sickly alien struggles halfway out before dying. Ray and Rachel finally reach Mary Ann's parents' house, where they are reunited with Mary Ann and Robbie. \n\nA closing narration explains that the aliens' immune systems could not handle the countless billions of [[microbes]] that inhabit the Earth, and that humanity has \"earned\" the right to the planet by virtue of naturally coexisting with the rest of its biosphere.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Dakota Fanning]] portray the two main characters of the film.\n| width     = 160\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Tom Cruis.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| image2    = Dakota Fanning WOTW London retouch.jpg\n| alt2      =\n}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Tom Cruise]] as Ray Ferrier\n*[[Dakota Fanning]] as Rachel Ferrier\n*[[Justin Chatwin]] as Robbie Ferrier\n*[[Miranda Otto]] as Mary Ann Ferrier\n*[[Tim Robbins]] as Harlan Ogilvy\n*[[Rick Gonzalez]] as Vincent\n*[[Yul V\u00e1zquez]] as Julio\n*[[Lenny Venito]] as Manny the Mechanic\n*[[Lisa Ann Walter]] as Sheryl\n*[[Ann Robinson]] as Grandmother (she played the lead role of Sylvia van Buren in the 1953 film)\n*[[Gene Barry]] as Grandfather (he played lead role of Dr. Clayton Forrester in the 1953 film)\n*[[David Alan Basche]] as Tim\n*[[Roz Abrams]] as Herself\n*[[Camillia Sanes]] as News Producer\n*[[Amy Ryan]] as Neighbor with Toddler\n*[[Danny Hoch]] as Policeman\n*[[Morgan Freeman]] as the Narrator (voice)\n*[[Dee Bradley Baker]] as Alien Vocals (uncredited)\n*[[Columbus Short]] as Soldier\n*[[Channing Tatum]] as Boy in Church Scene (scene cut)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAfter collaborating in 2002's ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Tom Cruise]] were interested in working together again.

Some aspects of the book were heavily adapted and condensed: Tim Robbins' character was an amalgam of two characters in the book, with the name borrowed from a third.

Spielberg had been against the idea of the aliens arriving in [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)#Novel|spaceship]]s, since every alien invasion movie used such a vehicle.<ref name=\"d10\"/> The original [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martian]] cylinders were discarded, where Spielberg replaced the origins of the [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|Tripod]]s with stating they were buried underground in the Earth long ago.<ref name=d2/><ref name=\"d10\"/>\n\nSpielberg had [[Miranda Otto]] in mind for the part of Mary Ann, but at the time he called her she was pregnant and thought the opportunity would be missed. Spielberg then decided to incorporate Otto's pregnancy into the film, changing the part for her.\n\nLawrence Brown wrote: \"Spielberg's decision to present the invaders' fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which did not exist in the original Wells book. In Spielberg's version, these invaders had been here before, long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself \u2013 a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers \u2013 and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us \u2013 all humans over the whole of history \u2013 have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be 'harvested'\".<ref>Lawrence C.

While May manages to escape, Beetle is eventually beaten by Spider-Man and Coulson (with help from May). In the episode \"Hawkeye\", Beetle went to destroy the new S.H.I.E.L.D.

In the episode \"Agent Venom\", Beetle is hired by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] to obtain a sample of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote. He chases after [[Flash Thompson]], ignoring [[Harry Osborn]] and Mary Jane in the process. Beetle subsequently had to fight with Spider-Man and then Agent Venom.

The villain manages to escape with the piece of the Bio-Nexus Device,  but he unwillingly leaves behind a clue for Spider-Man about Electro's plan: an invitation to the Science and Industry Ball.

While flying through the city, Beetle encounters Spider-Man and tries to shake him off, but the hero chases him to a construction site, where the two have a brief fight, before Beetle manages to escape by ducking into the nearby Latverian Embassy, although Spider-Man learns about it from some passing civilians and informs S.H.I.E.L.D.

In the episode \"Beetle Mania\", he targets the [[Daily Bugle|Daily Bugle Communications]] for [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s campaign that exposes the mercenary's criminal dealings with various supervillains, such as helping [[MODOK]] out of prison and deals with [[Doctor Doom]]. When he fights the S.H.I.E.L.D. trainees, Beetle's assassination attempt is stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and he is knocked out by [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]; Jameson's monitor renderings were there whereas [[Mary Jane Watson]] is actually there physically. In the episode \"The Attack of the Beetle\", Beetle is shown having a penchant for holding grudges against Spider-Man for their previous encounter as well as [[Phil Coulson]] for being 'sparring partners'. During his first fight with the two, Beetle decides to use [[Aunt May|May Parker]] as a hostage. While May manages to escape, Beetle is eventually beaten by Spider-Man and Coulson (with help from May). In the episode \"Hawkeye\", Beetle went to destroy the new S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier|Tri-Carrier]] but is defeated and captured by Spider-Man and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]. In the episode \"The Sinister Six\", Beetle appeared as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] alongside [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Kraven the Hunter]] and the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Along with the group, he fought Spider-Man, before the trainees arrived, when Beetle fought [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]], but was defeated by [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] after Spider-Man's teammates switch opponents and subsequently taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. In the episode \"Agent Venom\", Beetle is hired by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] to obtain a sample of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote. He chases after [[Flash Thompson]], ignoring [[Harry Osborn]] and Mary Jane in the process. Beetle subsequently had to fight with Spider-Man and then Agent Venom. While Spider-Man deals with Taskmaster, Beetle is eventually defeated by Agent Venom. In the episode \"New Warriors\", Beetle is among the escaped supervillains along with Doctor Octopus, [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], and the Green Goblin during a showdown between Taskmaster's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|team]] and the [[New Warriors]]. Along with his fellow supervillains, Beetle is eventually defeated by the New Warriors. In the episode \"Contest of Champions\" Pt. 1, Beetle - alongside the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]] - are sent by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] to obtain Spider-Man for the contest against the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. In the episode \"Anti-Venom\", Beetle attempts to steal a truck only to be attacked by Spider-Man and Agent Venom in order to defeat Sinister Six's possible recruits. However, [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] had previously upgraded Beetle's armor, allowing him to fight off the duo until the Patrioteer hacks Beetle's armor and sends Beetle crashing into the pavement.\n* The Abner Jenkins version of Beetle appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> \n\n===Video games===\n[[File:Ultimate Beetle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Beetle in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game.]]\n* The Abner Jenkins version of Beetle appears in both the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] ''[[Spider-Man Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man Animated Series]]'' games based on the animated series.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n* The Abner Jenkins version of Beetle was the first boss in the 1995 Super Famicom game ''[[Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'', a game only released in Japan.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n* The Abner Jenkins version of Beetle briefly appears in the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] exlcusive game ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]'', voiced by [[Daran Norris]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> He is one of the supervillains aiding [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s schemes and first appears as an unseen contact whom [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] gives a briefcase with a piece of the Bio-Nexus Device, to prevent Spider-Man from getting it. After Spider-Man defeats Shocker, the contract escapes via helicopter, but Spider-Man places a spider-tracer on the helicopter and follows it to a trainyard owned by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], where the contract is about to escape aboard a train. Spider-Man manages to board the train just in time, despite the intervenience of the mob-employed night staff and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and confronts the contact, discovering that he is Beetle. The villain manages to escape with the piece of the Bio-Nexus Device,  but he unwillingly leaves behind a clue for Spider-Man about Electro's plan: an invitation to the Science and Industry Ball. Later, Beetle is briefly seen with Hammerhead and his goons when they volunteer to kidnap Dr. Watts, the creator of the Bio-Nexus Device, at the ball. Beetle is the only villain featured in the game not to be fought against.\n* The Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Beetle appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game, voiced by [[Tucker Smallwood]].{{cn|date=September 2019}} This version acts as the [[Latveria]]ns' agent, collecting genetic information from superhumans to genetically engineer super-soldiers. When he first arrives in New York, he steals a vial containing [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and releases the [[Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]] from his cell on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D]] [[Helicarrier]], most likely as a distraction while he continues on with his plans. While flying through the city, Beetle encounters Spider-Man and tries to shake him off, but the hero chases him to a construction site, where the two have a brief fight, before Beetle manages to escape by ducking into the nearby Latverian Embassy, although Spider-Man learns about it from some passing civillians and informs S.H.I.E.L.D. Concept art in the game's special edition shows Beetle giving Sandman's vial to [[Doctor Doom]]. Beetle is later sent to take a sample of the [[Symbiote (comics)|Venom symbiote]] and attacks [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], luring him to an abandoned warehouse at the docks, where he traps him in a giant energy cage.
