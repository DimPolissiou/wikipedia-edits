There are five winches that almost complete a circle. These are all for halyards and vangs. All sheeting leads to the cockpit. There are two winches on the coach roof and two primary and two secondary winches at normal locations in the cockpit.\"<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nDarrell Nicholson, editor of Practical Sailor, wrote in a 2003 review, \"the N-41 makes an excellent case for the fact that a boat that was designed intelligently and built well in the first place has a good chance of standing the tests of time ... Speed and maneuverability are significant virtues in a cruising boat, and the N-41 has retained them. Sailors who enjoy racing but are less happy about the expense, discomfort, and \u201cto the edge\u201d design of today\u2019s racing boats will find the Newport 41 to their liking.\"<ref name=\"Nicholson\">{{cite web|url = https://www.practical-sailor.com/sailboat-reviews/used_sailboats/newport-41|title = Newport 41|access-date = 15 April 2020|last =Nicholson |first = Darrell  |work = Practical Sailor|date = 10 November 2003|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200419180121/https://www.practical-sailor.com/sailboat-reviews/used_sailboats/newport-41|archivedate = 19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of sailing boat types]]\n\n'''Similar sailboats'''\n*[[Dickerson 41]]\n*[[Lord Nelson 41]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- ==External links== -->\n[[Category:Keelboats]]\n[[Category:1980s sailboat type designs]]\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use American English|date=April 2020}}\n{{short description|Sailboat class}}\n{{Infobox sailboat specifications \n|name              =Newport 41S\n|class_image       =\n|line drawing      =\n|line size         =\n|line alt          =\n|line caption      =\n|image boat        =\n|image size        =\n|image alt         =\n|image caption     =\n\n|designer          = [[C&C Design]]\n|location          = [[United States]]\n|year              = circa 1972\n|no built          = \n|design            =\n|class             =\n|brand             =\n|builder           = [[Capital Yachts]]\n|role              =\n\n|boats             =\n|crew              =\n|trapeze           =\n|draft             = {{convert|6.25|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n|air draft         =\n|displacement      = {{convert|18000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n\n|hulls             =\n|hull type         = [[Monohull]]\n|construction      = [[Fiberglass]]\n|loa               = {{convert|41.00|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n|loh               =\n|lwl               = {{convert|30.00|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n|beam              = {{convert|11.25|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n|hull draft        =\n|hull weight       =\n|engine            = [[Yanmar]] {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[diesel engine]]\n\n|appendages        =\n|keel type         = fin keel\n|ballast           = {{convert|8215|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|rudder type       = spade-type [[rudder]]\n\n|rigs              =\n|rig type          = [[Bermuda rig]]\n|I                 = {{convert|52.00|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n|J                 = {{convert|17.00|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n|P                 = {{convert|44.00|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n|E                 = {{convert|13.60|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n|mast length       =\n|rig other         =\n\n|sails             =\n|sailplan          = [[Masthead sloop]]\n|sailarea main     = {{convert|299.20|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}\n|sailarea headsail = {{convert|442.00|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}\n|sailarea spin     =\n|sailarea gen      =\n|sails other       =\n|sailarea upwind   =\n|sailarea downwind =\n|sailarea total    = {{convert|741.20|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}\n\n|rating            =\n|d-pn              = 74.5\n|rya-pn            =\n|phrf              = 114\n\n|status            =\n|previous          =[[Redline 41]]\n|successor         =\n}}\n\nThe '''Newport 41''' is a family of [[United States|American]] [[sailboat]]s that was designed by [[C&C Design]] as [[International Offshore Rule]] (IOR) [[Sailing (sport)|racer]]-[[Cruising (maritime)|cruisers]] and first built in about 1972.<ref name=\"Data\">{{cite web|url = https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/newport-41s|title = Newport 41S sailboat |access-date = 19 April 2020|last= McArthur| first = Bruce |work = sailboatdata.com|year = 2020|archiveurl = |archivedate =}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url =https://sailboatdata.com/designer/cc-design|title = C&C Design|access-date = 19 April 2020|last= McArthur| first = Bruce |work = sailboatdata.com|year = 2020|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190803204823/https://sailboatdata.com/designer/cc-design|archivedate = 3 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Sherwood\">Sherwood, Richard M.: ''A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition'', pages 358-359.

There are five winches that almost complete a circle. These are all for halyards and vangs. All sheeting leads to the cockpit. There are two winches on the coach roof and two primary and two secondary winches at normal locations in the cockpit.\"<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nDarrell Nicholson, editor of Practical Sailor, wrote in a 2003 review, \"the N-41 makes an excellent case for the fact that a boat that was designed intelligently and built well in the first place has a good chance of standing the tests of time ... Speed and maneuverability are significant virtues in a cruising boat, and the N-41 has retained them. Sailors who enjoy racing but are less happy about the expense, discomfort, and \u201cto the edge\u201d design of today\u2019s racing boats will find the Newport 41 to their liking.\"<ref name=\"Nicholson\">{{cite web|url = https://www.practical-sailor.com/sailboat-reviews/used_sailboats/newport-41|title = Newport 41|access-date = 15 April 2020|last =Nicholson |first = Darrell  |work = Practical Sailor|date = 10 November 2003|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200419180121/https://www.practical-sailor.com/sailboat-reviews/used_sailboats/newport-41|archivedate = 19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of sailing boat types]]\n\n'''Similar sailboats'''\n*[[Dickerson 41]]\n*[[Lord Nelson 41]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- ==External links== -->\n[[Category:Keelboats]]\n[[Category:1980s sailboat type designs]]\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "name_user": "Ahunt", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDesign:clarify", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_41"}

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

She began writing and composing songs during her teenage years. Arias's artistic talents in music, painting, and composing{{spaced ndash}} including playing for silent movies{{spaced ndash}} emerged early in Iquitos. She achieved scholastic and artistic recognition, with numerous honors. Her perfect pitch and exceptional ability to sight read made her a highly sought accompanist.\n\nShe moved to [[New York City]] in 1923 to study music.<ref name=\"si\">{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/documentsgallery/exhibitions/arias/|title=Not Lost in Translation|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=April 1, 2013}}</ref> She married Jos\u00e9 Anduaga, another Peruvian artist, in 1929. They settled in [[Brooklyn]] and had a son, Roger. By the early 1940s, Arias had divorced Anduaga and moved to Manhattan with her son. In 1942, she became a [[Naturalization|naturalized U.S. citizen]].<ref name=\"Baumann\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s, Arias gained success as a composer in the male-dominated advertising industry. She worked for advertising agencies and composed [[jingle]]s  for [[Alkaseltzer]], the [[Ford Motor Company]] and the [[Campbell Soup Company]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.npr.org/2012/10/10/162570722/an-immigrants-star-spangled-banner-en-espa-ol|title = An Immigrant's 'Star-Spangled Banner,' En Espanol|date = October 10, 2012|accessdate = |website = NPR Music|publisher = NPR|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nArias composed other serious classical songs, including \"Idilio Roto (Broken Idyll),\" as well as songs in the popular style of the 1930s, some of which she sold door to door to help support her family. Later, she collaborated with notable composers and writers, including [[Marjorie Harper]], [[Andy Razaf]], [[Albert Gamse]] and [[Irving Caesar]]. Best known were her Spanish lyrics to song hits \"[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]\" (English lyrics by [[Morey Amsterdam]]) and \"Managua Nicaragua\" (English lyrics by [[Albert Gamse]]).\n\nAmongst her numerous compositions, \"Huiracocha\" may be the best known. Named for [[Viracocha|a god of the Incas]], the song retells the legend of his emergence from the depths of [[Lake Titicaca]] to create the sun, moon, and stars, and to breathe life into Allcavica, ancestor of the Inca people. According to Arias's own program note, this song is \"dedicated to the Indian, the Forgotten Man of the Americas\".  It tells of the \"sadness of a race calling to the ancient god of their forefathers, who no longer hears his children\".\n\n== Tributes ==\nOn December 9, 2006,<ref>The Dec 9th 2006 [http://classicalsource.com/db_control/db_concert_review.php?id=4008 performance program]</ref> \"Huiracocha\" was performed at London's [[Barbican Hall]] by tenor [[Juan Diego Florez|Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez]].

She began writing and composing songs during her teenage years. Arias's artistic talents in music, painting, and composing{{spaced ndash}} including playing for silent movies{{spaced ndash}} emerged early in Iquitos. She achieved scholastic and artistic recognition, with numerous honors. Her perfect pitch and exceptional ability to sight read made her a highly sought accompanist.\n\n\n\nShe moved to [[New York City]] in 1923 to study music.<ref name=\"si\">{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/documentsgallery/exhibitions/arias/|title=Not Lost in Translation|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=April 1, 2013}}</ref> She married Jos\u00e9 Anduaga, another Peruvian artist, in 1929. They settled in [[Brooklyn]] and had a son, Roger. By the early 1940s, Arias had divorced Anduaga and moved to Manhattan with her son. In 1942, she became a [[Naturalization|naturalized U.S. citizen]].<ref name=\"Baumann\"/>\n\n\n\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s, Arias gained success as a composer in the male-dominated advertising industry. She worked for advertising agencies and composed [[jingle]]s  for [[Alkaseltzer]], the [[Ford Motor Company]] and the [[Campbell Soup Company]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.npr.org/2012/10/10/162570722/an-immigrants-star-spangled-banner-en-espa-ol|title = An Immigrant's 'Star-Spangled Banner,' En Espanol|date = October 10, 2012|accessdate = |website = NPR Music|publisher = NPR|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n\n\nArias composed other serious classical songs, including \"Idilio Roto (Broken Idyll),\" as well as songs in the popular style of the 1930s, some of which she sold door to door to help support her family. Later, she collaborated with notable composers and writers, including [[Marjorie Harper]], [[Andy Razaf]], [[Albert Gamse]] and [[Irving Caesar]]. Best known were her Spanish lyrics to song hits \"[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]\" (English lyrics by [[Morey Amsterdam]]) and \"Managua Nicaragua\" (English lyrics by [[Albert Gamse]]).\n\n\nAmongst her numerous compositions, \"Huiracocha\" may be the best known. Named for [[Viracocha|a god of the Incas]], the song retells the legend of his emergence from the depths of [[Lake Titicaca]] to create the sun, moon, and stars, and to breathe life into Allcavica, ancestor of the Inca people. According to Arias's own program note, this song is \"dedicated to the Indian, the Forgotten Man of the Americas\".  It tells of the \"sadness of a race calling to the ancient god of their forefathers, who no longer hears his children\".\n\n== Tributes ==\nOn December 9, 2006,<ref>The Dec 9th 2006 [http://classicalsource.com/db_control/db_concert_review.php?id=4008 performance program]</ref> \"Huiracocha\" was performed at London's [[Barbican Hall]] by tenor [[Juan Diego Florez|Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez]].

Set in [[Chicago]] in the [[Jazz Age|jazz age]], the musical is based on a [[Chicago (play)|1926 play of the same name]] by reporter [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], about actual criminals and the crimes on which she reported. The story is a [[satire]] on [[Political corruption|corruption]] in the administration of [[criminal justice]] and the concept of the \"celebrity criminal\".\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened in 1975 at the [[46th Street Theatre]]<ref name=\"ChitaRivera.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chitarivera.com/productions/chicago.htm|title=Chicago|accessdate=January 6, 2009}}</ref> and ran for 936 performances, until 1977. Bob Fosse choreographed the original production, and his style is strongly identified with the show. It debuted in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1979, where it ran for 600 performances. ''Chicago'' was revived on Broadway in 1996, and a year later in the West End.\n\nThe 1996 Broadway production holds the record as the longest-running musical revival and the longest-running American musical in Broadway history. It is the second [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|longest-running show to ever run on Broadway]], behind only ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. ''Chicago'' surpassed ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' on November 23, 2014, when it played its 7,486th performance.<ref>Gans, Andrew. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/all-that-jazz-chicago-becomes-second-longest-running-broadway-show-tonight-335960 \"\"All That Jazz\": ''Chicago'' Becomes Second Longest-Running Broadway Show Tonight\"] Playbill.com, November 23, 2014</ref> The West End revival became the longest-running American musical in West End history. ''Chicago'' has been staged in numerous productions around the world, and has toured extensively in the United States and United Kingdom. The [[Chicago (2002 film)|2002 film version]] of the musical won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==History==\nThe musical ''Chicago'' is based on [[Chicago (play)|a play]] of the same name by reporter and playwright [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of accused murderers [[Beulah Annan]] and [[Belva Gaertner]] for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.  In the early 1920s, Chicago's press and public became riveted by the subject of homicides committed by women. Several high-profile cases arose, which generally involved women killing their lovers or husbands. These cases were tried against a backdrop of changing views of women in the [[jazz age]], and a long string of acquittals by [[Cook County]] juries of female murderers (juries at the time were all male, and convicted murderers generally faced death by hanging). A lore arose that, in Chicago, feminine or attractive women could not be convicted. The ''Chicago Tribune'' generally favored the prosecution's case, while still presenting the details of these women's lives. Its rivals at the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst papers]] were more pro-defendant, and employed what were derisively called \"sob-sisters\" \u2013 women reporters who focused on the plight, attractiveness, redemption, or grace of the female defendants.

The ''Tribune'' reported that Annan played the [[foxtrot]] record ''Hula Lou'' over and over for two hours before calling her husband to say she killed a man who \"tried to make love to her\".   Her husband Albert Annan inspired the character, Amos Hart. Albert was an auto mechanic who bankrupted himself to defend his wife, only for her to publicly dump him the day after she was acquitted. [[Velma Kelly]] is based on Gaertner, who was a cabaret singer, and society divorc\u00e9e. The body of Walter Law was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of Gaertner's abandoned car on March 12, 1924. Two police officers testified that they had seen a woman getting into the car and shortly thereafter heard gunshots. A bottle of gin and an automatic pistol were found on the floor of the car. Lawyers William Scott Stewart and W. W. O'Brien were models for a composite character in ''Chicago'', [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Just days apart, separate juries acquitted both women.<ref>McConnell, Virginia A.

The show received both good box-office sales and newspaper notices and was mounted on Broadway in 1926, running 172 performances. [[Cecil B. DeMille]] produced a [[silent film]] version, ''[[Chicago (1927 film)|Chicago]]'' (1927), starring former [[Mack Sennett]] bathing beauty [[Phyllis Haver]] as Roxie Hart. It was later remade as ''[[Roxie Hart (film)|Roxie Hart]]'' (1942) starring [[Ginger Rogers]], but in this version, Roxie was accused of murder without having really committed it.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Gwen Verdon]] read the play and asked her husband, Bob Fosse, about the possibility of creating a musical adaptation. Fosse (himself a native of  Chicago) approached playwright Watkins numerous times to buy the rights, but she repeatedly declined; by this point she may have regretted that Annan and Gaertner had been allowed to walk free, and that her treatment of them should not be glamorized.<ref name=Grubb /> Nonetheless, upon her death in 1969, her [[Estate (law)|estate]] sold the rights to producer Richard Fryer, Verdon, and Fosse.<ref name=Grubb /> [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] began work on the musical score, modeling each number on a traditional [[vaudeville]] number or a vaudeville performer. This format made explicit the show's comparison between \"justice\", \"show-business\", and contemporary society. Ebb and Fosse penned the book of the musical, and Fosse also directed and [[choreography|choreographed]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n=== Act I ===\n[[Velma Kelly]] is a [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] who welcomes the audience to tonight's show (\"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\"). Interplayed with the opening number, the scene cuts to February 14, 1928 in the bedroom of chorus girl [[Roxie Hart]], where she murders Fred Casely as he attempts to break off an affair with her.\n\nRoxie convinces her husband Amos that the victim was a burglar, and Amos agrees to take the blame. Roxie expresses her appreciation of her husband's willingness to do anything for her (\"Funny Honey\"). However, when the police mention the deceased's name, Amos belatedly realizes that Roxie has lied to him. Roxie, feeling betrayed, confesses and is arrested. She is sent to the women's block in the [[Courthouse Place|Cook County Jail]], where several women accused of killing their lovers are held (\"[[Cell Block Tango]]\"); among the inmates is Velma Kelly, revealing herself to have been involved in the death of her husband and sister, though she denies committing the act. The block is presided over by Matron \"Mama\" Morton, whose system of taking [[bribery|bribes]] (\"When You're Good to Mama\") perfectly suits her clientele. She has helped Velma become the media's top murderer-of-the-week and is acting as a booking agent for Velma's big return to vaudeville.\n\nVelma is not happy to see Roxie, who is stealing not only her limelight but also her lawyer, [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Roxie convinces Amos to pay for Billy Flynn to be her lawyer (\"A Tap Dance\"), though Amos lacks the funds. Eagerly awaited by his all-woman clientele, Billy sings his anthem, complete with a chorus of fan dancers (\"All I Care About\"). Billy takes Roxie's case before realizing Amos doesn't have the money; to make up the difference, he turns the case into a [[media circus]] and rearranges her story for consumption by sympathetic tabloid columnist Mary Sunshine (\"A Little Bit of Good\"), hoping to sell proceeds in an auction. Roxie's press conference turns into a ventriloquist act, with Billy dictating a new version of the truth (\"We Both Reached for the Gun\") to the reporters while Roxie mouths the words.\n\nRoxie becomes the most popular celebrity in Chicago, as she boastfully proclaims while planning for her future career in vaudeville (\"Roxie\"). As Roxie's fame grows, Velma's notoriety subsides, and in an act of desperation she tries to talk Roxie into recreating the sister act (\"I Can't Do It Alone\"). Roxie turns her down, only to find her own headlines replaced by the latest sordid crime of passion (\"Chicago After Midnight\"). Separately, Roxie and Velma realize there is no one they can count on but themselves (\"My Own Best Friend\"), and Roxie decides that being pregnant in prison would put her back on the front page.\n\n===Act II===\nVelma returns to introduce the opening act, resentful of Roxie's manipulation of the system (\"I Know a Girl\") and ability to seduce a doctor into saying Roxie is pregnant; as Roxie emerges, she sings gleefully of the future of her unborn (nonexistent) child (\"Me and My Baby\"). Amos proudly claims paternity, but still, nobody notices him, and Billy exposes holes in Roxie's story by noting that she and Amos had not had sex in four months, meaning if she were pregnant, the child was not Amos's, in hopes that Amos will divorce her and look like a villain, which Amos almost does (\"Mr. Cellophane\"). Velma tries to show Billy all the tricks she has planned for her trial (\"When Velma Takes The Stand\"), which Roxie treats skeptically. Roxie, upset with being treated like a \"common criminal\" and considering herself a celebrity, has a heated argument with Billy and fires him; Billy warns her that her kind of [[15 minutes of fame|celebrity is fleeting]] and that she would be just as famous hanging from a noose. At that moment, Roxie witnesses one of her fellow inmates, a Hungarian woman who insisted her innocence but could not speak English and whose public lawyer refused to defend her, as she is hanged (\"Hungarian Rope Trick\").\n\nThe trial date arrives, and the now freshly terrified Roxie runs back to Billy, who calms Roxie by suggesting she will be fine so long as she makes a show of the trial (\"Razzle Dazzle\"). Billy uses Amos as a pawn, turning around and insisting that Amos is actually the father of Roxie's child. Roxie steals all of Velma's schtick, down to the rhinestone garter, to the dismay of Mama and Velma (\"Class\"). As promised, Billy gets Roxie acquitted, but just as the verdict is announced, some even more sensational crime pulls the press away, and Roxie's fleeting celebrity life is over. Billy leaves, done with the case, admitting that he only did it for the money. Amos tries to get Roxie to come home and forget the ordeal, but she is more concerned with the end of her brief run of fame and admits she isn't pregnant, leaving Amos in the dust.\n\nThe final scene cuts to a Chicago vaudeville theater, where Roxie and Velma (acquitted off-stage) are performing a new act in which they bittersweetly sing about modern life (\"Nowadays\"). The former Mary Sunshine, revealed during the trial to actually be a man in drag, takes his natural male form as a pushy vaudeville promoter, shaping Roxie and Velma's dance (\"Hot Honey Rag\") to make it as sexy as possible. The show ends with a brief finale (\"Finale\").<ref>Plot Summary based on that of Bill Rosenfield, copyright 1997 BMG Music</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n;1975 Original Broadway Production\n'''''\"Chicago: A Musical Vaudeville\"'''''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\" \u2013 Velma Kelly and Company\n* \"Funny Honey\" \u2013 Roxie Hart, Amos Hart, Sergeant Fogarty \n* \"[[Cell Block Tango]]\" \u2013 Velma and the Girls\n* \"When You're Good to Mama\" \u2013 Matron \"Mama\" Morton\n* \"Tap Dance\" - Roxie, Amos, and Boys\n* \"All I Care About\" \u2013 Billy Flynn and the Girls\n* \"A Little Bit of Good\" \u2013 Mary Sunshine\n* \"We Both Reached for the Gun\" \u2013 Billy, Roxie, Mary Sunshine\n* \"Roxie\" \u2013 Roxie and Boys\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Chicago After Midnight\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"My Own Best Friend\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 2\n* \"I Know a Girl\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Me and My Baby\" \u2013 Roxie and Company\n* \"Mr. Cellophane\" \u2013 Amos Hart\n* \"When Velma Takes the Stand\" \u2013 Velma and Boys\n* \"Razzle Dazzle\" \u2013 Billy and Company\n* \"Class\" \u2013 Velma and Morton\n* \"Nowadays\" \u2013 Roxie\n* Finale: \"Nowadays\"/\"R.S.V.P\"/\"Keep It Hot\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma \u2020\n{{col-end}}\n\n;1996 Revival Production\n'''''\"Chicago: The Musical\"'''''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\" \u2013 Velma Kelly and Company\n* \"Funny Honey\" \u2013 Roxie Hart\n* \"[[Cell Block Tango]]\" \u2013 Velma and the Murderesses\n* \"When You're Good to Mama\" \u2013 Matron \"Mama\" Morton\n* \"Tap Dance\" - Roxie, Amos, and Boys\n* \"All I Care About\" \u2013 Billy Flynn and the Girls\n* \"A Little Bit of Good\" \u2013 Mary Sunshine\n* \"We Both Reached for the Gun\" \u2013 Billy, Roxie, Mary and the Reporters\n* \"Roxie\" \u2013 Roxie and the Boys\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"I Can't Do It Alone (Reprise)\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Chicago After Midnight\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"My Own Best Friend\" \u2013 Roxie and Velma\n* \"Finale Act I: All That Jazz (Reprise)\" \u2013 Velma\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 2\n* \"Entr'acte\"  \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"I Know a Girl\" \u2013 Velma\n* \"Me and My Baby\" \u2013 Roxie and Company\n* \"Mr. Cellophane\" \u2013 Amos Hart\n* \"When Velma Takes the Stand\" \u2013 Velma and the Boys\n* \"Razzle Dazzle\" \u2013 Billy and Company\n* \"Class\" \u2013 Velma and Mama Morton\n* \"Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag\" \u2013 Velma and Roxie\n* \"Finale Act II: All That Jazz (Reprise)\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n<small>\u2020 In the 1975 Original Broadway Production and its Playbill, there are a few contradicting song lists.

Every musical moment in the show was loosely modeled on someone else: Roxie was [[Helen Morgan]], Velma was [[Texas Guinan]], Billy Flynn was [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]], Mama Morton was [[Sophie Tucker]].\" Kander elaborates that the reason the show was called a vaudeville \"is because many of the songs we wrote are related to specific performers like those you mentioned, and Eddie Cantor and Bert Williams as well.\"<ref name=light>{{cite book|last1=Kander|first1=John|last2=Ebb|first2=Fred|last3=Lawrence|first3=Greg|title=Colored Lights: Forty Years of Words and Music, Show Biz, Collaboration, and All That Jazz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qJKRpOcNxE8C|date=October 2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-571-21169-2|pages=128\u2013129}}</ref>\n\nIt was through the initial production, and not the writing, that many of the \"traditional\" ''Chicago'' staging conventions were developed:\n\nThe double snap in \"Razzle Dazzle\" was added as an afterthought at the suggestion of Fred Ebb to John Kander. Kander explains: \"I remember when we wrote \"Razzle Dazzle\", before we took it in and played it for Bob, you [Ebb] said with absolute confidence 'Try adding a couple of finger snaps to it. Bobby will love that.' We added them...and as soon as he heard the finger snaps, he loved the song.\"<ref name=light/> During rehearsals, \"Razzle Dazzle\" was originally staged as an orgy on the steps of the courthouse. Fosse was talked out of allowing this staging, when Jerry Orbach \"convinced him that he was missing the Brechtian subtlety intrinsic in the number.\"<ref name=leve>Leve, James.

The piece was cut and replaced with \"Nowadays\". Instrumental sections of \"Loopin' the Loop\" can still be heard in the Overture.<ref name=leve/> Two other sections termed \"Keep It Hot\" and \"RSVP\" were cut from the finale as well.\n\nAnother principal character, a theatrical agent named Harry Glassman, was played by [[David Rounds]], whose role was to exploit the notoriety of the prisoners for his own gain. He also served as the evening's [[Master of Ceremonies|M.C]]. This character's role and the song \"Ten Percent\" was cut,<ref>Bloom, Ken; Vlastnik, Frank; and Orbach, Jerry.

Set in [[Chicago]] in the [[Jazz Age|jazz age]], the musical is based on a [[Chicago (play)|1926 play of the same name]] by reporter [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], about actual criminals and the crimes on which she reported. The story is a [[satire]] on [[Political corruption|corruption]] in the administration of [[criminal justice]] and the concept of the \"celebrity criminal\".\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened in 1975 at the [[46th Street Theatre]]<ref name=\"ChitaRivera.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chitarivera.com/productions/chicago.htm|title=Chicago|accessdate=January 6, 2009}}</ref> and ran for 936 performances, until 1977. Bob Fosse choreographed the original production, and his style is strongly identified with the show. It debuted in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1979, where it ran for 600 performances. ''Chicago'' was revived on Broadway in 1996, and a year later in the West End.\n\nThe 1996 Broadway production holds the record as the longest-running musical revival and the longest-running American musical in Broadway history. It is the second [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|longest-running show to ever run on Broadway]], behind only ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. ''Chicago'' surpassed ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' on November 23, 2014, when it played its 7,486th performance.<ref>Gans, Andrew. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/all-that-jazz-chicago-becomes-second-longest-running-broadway-show-tonight-335960 \"\"All That Jazz\": ''Chicago'' Becomes Second Longest-Running Broadway Show Tonight\"] Playbill.com, November 23, 2014</ref> The West End revival became the longest-running American musical in West End history. ''Chicago'' has been staged in numerous productions around the world, and has toured extensively in the United States and United Kingdom. The [[Chicago (2002 film)|2002 film version]] of the musical won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==History==\nThe musical ''Chicago'' is based on [[Chicago (play)|a play]] of the same name by reporter and playwright [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of accused murderers [[Beulah Annan]] and [[Belva Gaertner]] for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.  In the early 1920s, Chicago's press and public became riveted by the subject of homicides committed by women. Several high-profile cases arose, which generally involved women killing their lovers or husbands. These cases were tried against a backdrop of changing views of women in the [[jazz age]], and a long string of acquittals by [[Cook County]] juries of female murderers (juries at the time were all male, and convicted murderers generally faced death by hanging). A lore arose that, in Chicago, feminine or attractive women could not be convicted. The ''Chicago Tribune'' generally favored the prosecution's case, while still presenting the details of these women's lives. Its rivals at the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst papers]] were more pro-defendant, and employed what were derisively called \"sob-sisters\" \u2013 women reporters who focused on the plight, attractiveness, redemption, or grace of the female defendants. Regardless of stance, the press covered several of these women as celebrities.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Girls of Murder City: fame, lust, and the beautiful killers that inspired ''Chicago'' | publisher=Penguin Group /Viking Press |author=Perry, Douglas | year=2010 | location=New York | pages=1\u20137, 16\u201318, 57\u201358 | isbn=978-0-670-02197-0}}</ref>\n\nAnnan, the model for the character of [[Roxie Hart]], was 23 when she was accused of the April 3, 1924,<ref name=Grubb>{{cite book |title=Razzle Dazzle: The Life and Work of Bob Fosse |last=Grubb |first=Kevin Boyd |year=1989 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-03414-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/razzledazzlelife0000grub/page/193 193\u2013203] |url=https://archive.org/details/razzledazzlelife0000grub/page/193 }}</ref> murder of Harry Kalstedt, who served as the basis for the Fred Casely character.  The ''Tribune'' reported that Annan played the [[foxtrot]] record ''Hula Lou'' over and over for two hours before calling her husband to say she killed a man who \"tried to make love to her\".   Her husband Albert Annan inspired the character, Amos Hart. Albert was an auto mechanic who bankrupted himself to defend his wife, only for her to publicly dump him the day after she was acquitted. [[Velma Kelly]] is based on Gaertner, who was a cabaret singer, and society divorc\u00e9e. The body of Walter Law was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of Gaertner's abandoned car on March 12, 1924. Two police officers testified that they had seen a woman getting into the car and shortly thereafter heard gunshots. A bottle of gin and an automatic pistol were found on the floor of the car. Lawyers William Scott Stewart and W. W. O'Brien were models for a composite character in ''Chicago'', [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Just days apart, separate juries acquitted both women.<ref>McConnell, Virginia A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0JCxU4cNunQC&lpg=PA62&dq=%22William%20Scott%20Stewart%22%20Chicago%20%22Billy%20OR%20Flynn%22&pg=PA62#v=onepage&q=%22William%20Scott%20Stewart%22%20Chicago%20%22Billy%20OR%20Flynn%22&f=false ''Fatal Fortune: the Death of Chicago's Millionaire Orphan'', p. 62] ''Fatal Fortune: the Death of Chicago's Millionaire Orphan'' (books.google), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005, {{ISBN|0-275-98473-7}}. p. 62</ref>\n\nWatkins' sensational columns documenting these trials proved so popular that she wrote a play based on them. The show received both good box-office sales and newspaper notices and was mounted on Broadway in 1926, running 172 performances. [[Cecil B. DeMille]] produced a [[silent film]] version, ''[[Chicago (1927 film)|Chicago]]'' (1927), starring former [[Mack Sennett]] bathing beauty [[Phyllis Haver]] as Roxie Hart. It was later remade as ''[[Roxie Hart (film)|Roxie Hart]]'' (1942) starring [[Ginger Rogers]], but in this version, Roxie was accused of murder without having really committed it.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Gwen Verdon]] read the play and asked her husband, Bob Fosse, about the possibility of creating a musical adaptation. Fosse (himself a native of  Chicago) approached playwright Watkins numerous times to buy the rights, but she repeatedly declined; by this point she may have regretted that Annan and Gaertner had been allowed to walk free, and that her treatment of them should not be glamorized.<ref name=Grubb /> Nonetheless, upon her death in 1969, her [[Estate (law)|estate]] sold the rights to producer Richard Fryer, Verdon, and Fosse.<ref name=Grubb /> [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] began work on the musical score, modeling each number on a traditional [[vaudeville]] number or a vaudeville performer. This format made explicit the show's comparison between \"justice\", \"show-business\", and contemporary society. Ebb and Fosse penned the book of the musical, and Fosse also directed and [[choreography|choreographed]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n=== Act I ===\n[[Velma Kelly]] is a [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] who welcomes the audience to tonight's show (\"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\"). Interplayed with the opening number, the scene cuts to February 14, 1928 in the bedroom of chorus girl [[Roxie Hart]], where she murders Fred Casely as he attempts to break off an affair with her.\n\nRoxie convinces her husband Amos that the victim was a burglar, and Amos agrees to take the blame. Roxie expresses her appreciation of her husband's willingness to do anything for her (\"Funny Honey\"). However, when the police mention the deceased's name, Amos belatedly realizes that Roxie has lied to him. Roxie, feeling betrayed, confesses and is arrested. She is sent to the women's block in the [[Courthouse Place|Cook County Jail]], where several women accused of killing their lovers are held (\"[[Cell Block Tango]]\"); among the inmates is Velma Kelly, revealing herself to have been involved in the death of her husband and sister, though she denies committing the act. The block is presided over by Matron \"Mama\" Morton, whose system of taking [[bribery|bribes]] (\"When You're Good to Mama\") perfectly suits her clientele. She has helped Velma become the media's top murderer-of-the-week and is acting as a booking agent for Velma's big return to vaudeville.\n\nVelma is not happy to see Roxie, who is stealing not only her limelight but also her lawyer, [[Billy Flynn (Chicago)|Billy Flynn]]. Roxie convinces Amos to pay for Billy Flynn to be her lawyer (\"A Tap Dance\"), though Amos lacks the funds. Eagerly awaited by his all-woman clientele, Billy sings his anthem, complete with a chorus of fan dancers (\"All I Care About\"). Billy takes Roxie's case before realizing Amos doesn't have the money; to make up the difference, he turns the case into a [[media circus]] and rearranges her story for consumption by sympathetic tabloid columnist Mary Sunshine (\"A Little Bit of Good\"), hoping to sell proceeds in an auction. Roxie's press conference turns into a ventriloquist act, with Billy dictating a new version of the truth (\"We Both Reached for the Gun\") to the reporters while Roxie mouths the words.\n\nRoxie becomes the most popular celebrity in Chicago, as she boastfully proclaims while planning for her future career in vaudeville (\"Roxie\"). As Roxie's fame grows, Velma's notoriety subsides, and in an act of desperation she tries to talk Roxie into recreating the sister act (\"I Can't Do It Alone\"). Roxie turns her down, only to find her own headlines replaced by the latest sordid crime of passion (\"Chicago After Midnight\"). Separately, Roxie and Velma realize there is no one they can count on but themselves (\"My Own Best Friend\"), and Roxie decides that being pregnant in prison would put her back on the front page.\n\n===Act II===\nVelma returns to introduce the opening act, resentful of Roxie's manipulation of the system (\"I Know a Girl\") and ability to seduce a doctor into saying Roxie is pregnant; as Roxie emerges, she sings gleefully of the future of her unborn (nonexistent) child (\"Me and My Baby\"). Amos proudly claims paternity, but still, nobody notices him, and Billy exposes holes in Roxie's story by noting that she and Amos had not had sex in four months, meaning if she were pregnant, the child was not Amos's, in hopes that Amos will divorce her and look like a villain, which Amos almost does (\"Mr. Cellophane\"). Velma tries to show Billy all the tricks she has planned for her trial (\"When Velma Takes The Stand\"), which Roxie treats skeptically. Roxie, upset with being treated like a \"common criminal\" and considering herself a celebrity, has a heated argument with Billy and fires him; Billy warns her that her kind of [[15 minutes of fame|celebrity is fleeting]] and that she would be just as famous hanging from a noose. At that moment, Roxie witnesses one of her fellow inmates, a Hungarian woman who insisted her innocence but could not speak English and whose public lawyer refused to defend her, as she is hanged (\"Hungarian Rope Trick\").\n\nThe trial date arrives, and the now freshly terrified Roxie runs back to Billy, who calms Roxie by suggesting she will be fine so long as she makes a show of the trial (\"Razzle Dazzle\"). Billy uses Amos as a pawn, turning around and insisting that Amos is actually the father of Roxie's child. Roxie steals all of Velma's schtick, down to the rhinestone garter, to the dismay of Mama and Velma (\"Class\"). As promised, Billy gets Roxie acquitted, but just as the verdict is announced, some even more sensational crime pulls the press away, and Roxie's fleeting celebrity life is over. Billy leaves, done with the case, admitting that he only did it for the money. Amos tries to get Roxie to come home and forget the ordeal, but she is more concerned with the end of her brief run of fame and admits she isn't pregnant, leaving Amos in the dust.\n\nThe final scene cuts to a Chicago vaudeville theater, where Roxie and Velma (acquitted off-stage) are performing a new act in which they bittersweetly sing about modern life (\"Nowadays\"). The former Mary Sunshine, revealed during the trial to actually be a man in drag, takes his natural male form as a pushy vaudeville promoter, shaping Roxie and Velma's dance (\"Hot Honey Rag\") to make it as sexy as possible.

Every musical moment in the show was loosely modeled on someone else: Roxie was [[Helen Morgan]], Velma was [[Texas Guinan]], Billy Flynn was [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]], Mama Morton was [[Sophie Tucker]].\" Kander elaborates that the reason the show was called a vaudeville \"is because many of the songs we wrote are related to specific performers like those you mentioned, and Eddie Cantor and Bert Williams as well.\"<ref name=light>{{cite book|last1=Kander|first1=John|last2=Ebb|first2=Fred|last3=Lawrence|first3=Greg|title=Colored Lights: Forty Years of Words and Music, Show Biz, Collaboration, and All That Jazz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qJKRpOcNxE8C|date=October 2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-571-21169-2|pages=128\u2013129}}</ref>\n\nIt was through the initial production, and not the writing, that many of the \"traditional\" ''Chicago'' staging conventions were developed:\n\nThe double snap in \"Razzle Dazzle\" was added as an afterthought at the suggestion of Fred Ebb to John Kander. Kander explains: \"I remember when we wrote \"Razzle Dazzle\", before we took it in and played it for Bob, you [Ebb] said with absolute confidence 'Try adding a couple of finger snaps to it. Bobby will love that.' We added them...and as soon as he heard the finger snaps, he loved the song.\"<ref name=light/> During rehearsals, \"Razzle Dazzle\" was originally staged as an orgy on the steps of the courthouse. Fosse was talked out of allowing this staging, when Jerry Orbach \"convinced him that he was missing the Brechtian subtlety intrinsic in the number.\"<ref name=leve>Leve, James.

The piece was cut and replaced with \"Nowadays\". Instrumental sections of \"Loopin' the Loop\" can still be heard in the Overture.<ref name=leve/> Two other sections termed \"Keep It Hot\" and \"RSVP\" were cut from the finale as well.\n\nAnother principal character, a theatrical agent named Harry Glassman, was played by [[David Rounds]], whose role was to exploit the notoriety of the prisoners for his own gain. He also served as the evening's [[Master of Ceremonies|M.C]]. This character's role and the song \"Ten Percent\" was cut,<ref>Bloom, Ken; Vlastnik, Frank; and Orbach, Jerry.

One of the original lyrics \"Every guy is a snot/Every girl is a twat\" was restored for the 2002 movie, although the entire number was cut from the final release of the movie.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n[[File:Michael O'Haughey and Jerry Orbach in Chicago musical.JPG|thumb|right| M.

When he was 10 years old, his father died at age 33 of a heart attack. About one year later, at age 11, Mallett found a ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'' comic book version of [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The Time Machine]]''. Inspired by this literature, he resolved to travel back in time to save his father.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MWUyRNUS3U&t=0m1s|title=Dr. Ronald Mallett Builds a Time Machine|date=16 July 2012|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> This idea became a lifelong obsession and the basis of his research into time travel. Mallett served in the [[United States Air Force]] for four years, during the [[Vietnam War]].  He returned to civilian life in 1966.  This was the year that the science fiction TV series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' started, in which he \"quickly became immersed\".  During its first season, Mallett watched the episode ''[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]'' that \"involved both the theme of time travel and lost love\", and this became his favorite of the entire series.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/156858363X|title=Time Traveler: A Scientist's Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality|author=Ronald L.

This technology would be based upon a [[ring laser]]'s properties in the context of Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]]. Mallett first argued that the ring laser would produce a limited amount of [[frame-dragging]] which might be measured experimentally, saying:<ref>R. L. Mallett, \"''Weak gravitational field of the electromagnetic radiation in a ring laser''\",  [http://www.physics.uconn.edu/~mallett/Mallett2000.pdf Phys. Lett. A 269, 214 (2000)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903161207/http://www.physics.uconn.edu/~mallett/Mallett2000.pdf |date=2006-09-03 }}. [[pdf]]</ref><blockquote>\n\"In Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, both matter and energy can create a gravitational field. This means that the energy of a light beam can produce a gravitational field. My current research considers both the weak and strong gravitational fields produced by a single continuously circulating unidirectional beam of light. In the weak gravitational field of an unidirectional ring laser, it is predicted that a spinning neutral particle, when placed in the ring, is dragged around by the resulting gravitational field.\"\n</blockquote>In a later paper, Mallett argued that at sufficient energies, the circulating laser might produce not just frame-dragging but also [[closed timelike curve]]s (CTC), allowing time travel into the past:<ref>R. L. Mallett, \"''The gravitational field of a circulating light beam''\", [http://www.physics.uconn.edu/~mallett/Mallett2003.pdf Foundations of Physics 33, 1307 (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903161227/http://www.physics.uconn.edu/~mallett/Mallett2003.pdf |date=2006-09-03 }}. [[pdf]]</ref><blockquote>\n\nFor the strong gravitational field of a circulating cylinder of light, I have found new exact solutions of the Einstein field equations for the exterior and interior gravitational fields of the [[light cylinder]]. The exterior gravitational field is shown to contain closed timelike lines.<br />The presence of closed timelike lines indicates the possibility of time travel into the past. This creates the foundation for a time machine based on a circulating cylinder of light.\n</blockquote>Funding for his program, now known as the Space-time Twisting by Light (STL) project, is progressing. Full details on the project, Mallett's theories, a list of upcoming public lectures and links to popular articles on his work can be found at the Mallett's faculty web page, and an illustration showing the concept on which Mallett has designed the time machine can be seen [http://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/timetravelconcept.jpg here].\n\nMallett also wrote a book entitled, ''Time Traveler: A Scientist's Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality'', co-written with author [[Bruce Henderson (author)|Bruce Henderson]], that was first published in 2006. In June 2008, motion picture director [[Spike Lee]]'s production company announced it had acquired the film rights to Mallett's book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~mallett/main/aspikeleefilm.htm|title=Time Traveler: A Spike Lee Film|website=Phys.uconn.edu}}</ref> Lee is co-writing the movie script and directing the picture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/06/17/spike-lees-time-traveler/|title=Spike Lee's Time Traveler \u2013 /Film|work=[[Slashfilm]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Mallett declared that time travel into the past would be possible in the 21st century and possibly within a decade. Mallett used general relativity to attempt to substantiate his claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news63371210.html|title=Professor predicts human time travel this century|website=[[Physorg.com]]|accessdate=10 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe created a prototype illustrating how lasers could be used to create a circulating beam of light that twists space and time, and has an equation which he claimed supports his theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/time-travel-ron-mallett-scn/index.html|title=The scientist trying to travel back in time|first=Francesca |last=Street|date=2019-12-31|website=CNN Travel|language=en|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref><ref name=\"FTM-2019003\">{{cite news |last=Houser |first=Kristin |title=Astrophysicist Says He Knows How to Build a Time Machine - But his peers are far from convinced that it'll work. |url=https://futurism.com/astrophysicist-build-time-machine-past |date=3 January 2020 |work=Futurism.om |accessdate=3 January 2020 }}</ref>\n\n====Criticism====\nIn a paper by Ken Olum and Allen Everett<ref name=\"olumeverett\">{{cite journal | first = Ken D. | last = Olum |author2=Allen Everett  | title = Can a circulating light beam produce a time machine? | journal = Foundations of Physics Letters | volume = 18 | year=2005 | issue = 4 | pages = 379\u2013385 | doi = 10.1007/s10702-005-7127-4 |arxiv=gr-qc/0410078|bibcode = 2005FoPhL..18..379O }}</ref> the authors claimed to have found problems with Mallett's analysis. One of their objections is that the [[spacetime]] which Mallett used in his analysis contains a [[gravitational singularity|singularity]] even when the power to the laser is off and is not the spacetime that would be expected to arise naturally if the circulating laser were activated in previously empty space. Mallett has not offered a published response to Olum and Everett, but in his book ''Time Traveler'' he mentions that he was unable to directly model the [[optical fiber]] or [[photonic crystal]] which bends the light's path as it travels through it, so the light circulates around rather than moving in a straight line; as a substitute he chose to include a \"line source\" (a type of one-dimensional singularity) which would act as a \"geometric constraint\", bending spacetime in such a way that the light would circulate around on a [[helix]]-shaped path in a vacuum<ref name=Time-Traveler_pages167-168>{{cite book | last = Mallett | first = Ronald | title = Time Traveler: A Scientist's Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality | publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press | year = 2006 | pages = 167\u2013168 | isbn = 1-56025-869-1}}</ref> (for an older solution involving an infinite cylinder which creates CTCs, in this case due to the cylinder's own rotation rather than light circulating around it, see the [[Tipler cylinder]]). He notes that closed timelike curves are present in a spacetime containing both the line source and the circulating light, while they are not present in a spacetime containing only the line source, so that \"the closed loops in time had been produced by the circulating flow of light, and not by the non-moving line source.\"<ref name=\"Time-Traveler_page173\">{{cite book | last = Mallett | first = Ronald | title = Time Traveler: A Scientist's Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality | publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-56025-869-1 | page = 173}}</ref> However, he does not provide any additional argument as to why we should expect to see closed timelike curves in a different spacetime where there is no line source, and where the light is caused to circulate due to passing through a physical substance like a photonic crystal rather than circulating in a vacuum due to the curved spacetime around the line source.\n\nAnother objection by Olum and Everett is that even if Mallett's choice of spacetime were correct, the energy required to twist spacetime sufficiently would be huge, and that with lasers of the type in use today the ring would have to be much larger in circumference than the observable universe. At one point Mallett agreed that in a [[vacuum]] the energy requirements would be impractical but noted that the energy required goes down as the [[speed of light]] goes down. He then argued that if the light is slowed down significantly by passing it through a [[transmission medium|medium]] (as in the experiments of [[Lene Hau]] where light was passed through a [[superfluid]] and slowed to about 17 metres per second) the needed energy would be attainable.<ref name=\"spacedaily\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/timetravel-01a.html |title=Getting In A Twist Over Time | publisher =Space Media Network| work =SpaceDaily|date=May 19, 2001|accessdate=2006-12-19 |author=Brooks, Michael| authorlink = Michael Brooks (science writer)}}</ref> However, the physicist [[J. Richard Gott]] argues that slowing down light by passing it through a medium cannot be treated as equivalent to lowering the constant ''c'' (the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum) in the equations of General Relativity, saying:<ref name=\"Gott\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wonderquest.com/TimeTravel.htm |title=\"...they can't come to us..,\" Carl Sagan |work=WonderQuest|date=June 20, 2001|accessdate=2006-12-19 |author=Holladay, April| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123114341/http://www.wonderquest.com/TimeTravel.htm | archivedate= January 23, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><blockquote>\nOne has to distinguish between the speed of light in a vacuum, which is a constant, and through any other medium, which can vary enormously. Light travels more slowly through water than through empty space, for example, but this does not mean that you age more slowly while scuba diving or that it is easier to twist space-time underwater.<br>The experiments done so far don't lower the speed of light in empty space; they just lower the speed of light in a medium and should not make it easier to twist space-time. Thus, it should not take any less mass-energy to form a black hole or a time machine of a given size in such a medium.\n</blockquote>Later, Mallett abandoned the idea of using slowed light to reduce the energy, writing that, \"For a time, I considered the possibility that slowing down light might increase the gravitational frame dragging effect of the ring laser ... Slow light, however, turned out to be helpful for my research.\"<ref name=Time-Traveler_page205>{{cite book | last = Mallett | first = Ronald | title = Time Traveler: A Scientist's Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality | publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-56025-869-1 | page = 205}}</ref>\n\nFinally, Olum and Everett note a theorem proven by [[Stephen Hawking]] in a 1992 paper on the [[Chronology Protection Conjecture]],<ref name=\"chronology protection\">{{cite journal | first=Stephen | last=Hawking | authorlink = Stephen Hawking | url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v46/p603 | title=Chronology protection conjecture | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 46 | year=1992 | issue=2 | pages = 603\u2013611 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.46.603 | bibcode=1992PhRvD..46..603H}}</ref> which demonstrated that according to General Relativity it should be impossible to create closed timelike curves in any finite region that satisfies the [[weak energy condition]], meaning that the region contains no [[exotic matter]] with negative energy. Mallett's original solution involved a spacetime containing a line source of infinite length, so it did not violate this theorem despite the absence of exotic matter, but Olum and Everett point out that the theorem \"would, however, rule out the creation of CTC's in any finite-sized approximation to this spacetime.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nMallett is a member of both the [[American Physical Society]] and the [[National Society of Black Physicists]];<ref name=MallettCV/> his brother is artist [[Keith Mallett]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of contributors to general relativity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography|Physics}}\n*[https://physics.uconn.edu/ronald-mallett/ Mallett's UConn homepage]\n*{{imdb name|2390870}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060903161207/http://www.physics.uconn.edu/~mallett/Mallett2000.pdf R.

This technology would be based upon a [[ring laser]]'s properties in the context of Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]]. Mallett first argued that the ring laser would produce a limited amount of [[frame-dragging]] which might be measured experimentally, saying:<ref>R. L. Mallett, \"''Weak gravitational field of the electromagnetic radiation in a ring laser''\",  [http://www.physics.uconn.edu/~mallett/Mallett2000.pdf Phys. Lett. A 269, 214 (2000)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903161207/http://www.physics.uconn.edu/~mallett/Mallett2000.pdf |date=2006-09-03 }}. [[pdf]]</ref><blockquote>\n\"In Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, both matter and energy can create a gravitational field. This means that the energy of a light beam can produce a gravitational field. My current research considers both the weak and strong gravitational fields produced by a single continuously circulating unidirectional beam of light. In the weak gravitational field of an unidirectional ring laser, it is predicted that a spinning neutral particle, when placed in the ring, is dragged around by the resulting gravitational field.\"\n</blockquote>In a later paper, Mallett argued that at sufficient energies, the circulating laser might produce not just frame-dragging but also [[closed timelike curve]]s (CTC), allowing time travel into the past:<ref>R. L. Mallett, \"''The gravitational field of a circulating light beam''\", [http://www.physics.uconn.edu/~mallett/Mallett2003.pdf Foundations of Physics 33, 1307 (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903161227/http://www.physics.uconn.edu/~mallett/Mallett2003.pdf |date=2006-09-03 }}. [[pdf]]</ref><blockquote>\n\nFor the strong gravitational field of a circulating cylinder of light, I have found new exact solutions of the Einstein field equations for the exterior and interior gravitational fields of the [[light cylinder]]. The exterior gravitational field is shown to contain closed timelike lines.<br />The presence of closed timelike lines indicates the possibility of time travel into the past. This creates the foundation for a time machine based on a circulating cylinder of light.\n</blockquote>Funding for his program, now known as the Space-time Twisting by Light (STL) project, is progressing. Full details on the project, Mallett's theories, a list of upcoming public lectures and links to popular articles on his work can be found at the Mallett's faculty web page, and an illustration showing the concept on which Mallett has designed the time machine can be seen [http://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/timetravelconcept.jpg here].\n\nMallett also wrote a book entitled, ''Time Traveler: A Scientist's Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality'', co-written with author [[Bruce Henderson (author)|Bruce Henderson]], that was first published in 2006. In June 2008, motion picture director [[Spike Lee]]'s production company announced it had acquired the film rights to Mallett's book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~mallett/main/aspikeleefilm.htm|title=Time Traveler: A Spike Lee Film|website=Phys.uconn.edu}}</ref> Lee is co-writing the movie script and directing the picture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/06/17/spike-lees-time-traveler/|title=Spike Lee's Time Traveler \u2013 /Film|work=[[Slashfilm]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Mallett declared that time travel into the past would be possible in the 21st century and possibly within a decade.  Mallett uses general relativity to attempt to substantiate his claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news63371210.html|title=Professor predicts human time travel this century|website=[[Physorg.com]]|accessdate=10 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe has created a prototype illustrating how lasers could be used to create a circulating beam of light that twists space and time.

One of their objections is that the [[spacetime]] which Mallett used in his analysis contains a [[gravitational singularity|singularity]] even when the power to the laser is off and is not the spacetime that would be expected to arise naturally if the circulating laser were activated in previously empty space. Mallett has not offered a published response to Olum and Everett, but in his book ''Time Traveler'' he mentions that he was unable to directly model the [[optical fiber]] or [[photonic crystal]] which bends the light's path as it travels through it, so the light circulates around rather than moving in a straight line; as a substitute he chose to include a \"line source\" (a type of one-dimensional singularity) which would act as a \"geometric constraint\", bending spacetime in such a way that the light would circulate around on a [[helix]]-shaped path in a vacuum<ref name=Time-Traveler_pages167-168>{{cite book | last = Mallett | first = Ronald | title = Time Traveler: A Scientist's Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality | publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press | year = 2006 | pages = 167\u2013168 | isbn = 1-56025-869-1}}</ref> (for an older solution involving an infinite cylinder which creates CTCs, in this case due to the cylinder's own rotation rather than light circulating around it, see the [[Tipler cylinder]]). He notes that closed timelike curves are present in a spacetime containing both the line source and the circulating light, while they are not present in a spacetime containing only the line source, so that \"the closed loops in time had been produced by the circulating flow of light, and not by the non-moving line source.\"<ref name=\"Time-Traveler_page173\">{{cite book | last = Mallett | first = Ronald | title = Time Traveler: A Scientist's Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality | publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-56025-869-1 | page = 173}}</ref> However, he does not provide any additional argument as to why we should expect to see closed timelike curves in a different spacetime where there is no line source, and where the light is caused to circulate due to passing through a physical substance like a photonic crystal rather than circulating in a vacuum due to the curved spacetime around the line source.\n\nAnother objection by Olum and Everett is that even if Mallett's choice of spacetime were correct, the energy required to twist spacetime sufficiently would be huge, and that with lasers of the type in use today the ring would have to be much larger in circumference than the observable universe. At one point Mallett agreed that in a [[vacuum]] the energy requirements would be impractical but noted that the energy required goes down as the [[speed of light]] goes down. He then argued that if the light is slowed down significantly by passing it through a [[transmission medium|medium]] (as in the experiments of [[Lene Hau]] where light was passed through a [[superfluid]] and slowed to about 17 metres per second) the needed energy would be attainable.<ref name=\"spacedaily\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/timetravel-01a.html |title=Getting In A Twist Over Time | publisher =Space Media Network| work =SpaceDaily|date=May 19, 2001|accessdate=2006-12-19 |author=Brooks, Michael| authorlink = Michael Brooks (science writer)}}</ref> However, the physicist [[J. Richard Gott]] argues that slowing down light by passing it through a medium cannot be treated as equivalent to lowering the constant ''c'' (the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum) in the equations of General Relativity, saying:<ref name=\"Gott\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wonderquest.com/TimeTravel.htm |title=\"...they can't come to us..,\" Carl Sagan |work=WonderQuest|date=June 20, 2001|accessdate=2006-12-19 |author=Holladay, April| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123114341/http://www.wonderquest.com/TimeTravel.htm | archivedate= January 23, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><blockquote>\nOne has to distinguish between the speed of light in a vacuum, which is a constant, and through any other medium, which can vary enormously. Light travels more slowly through water than through empty space, for example, but this does not mean that you age more slowly while scuba diving or that it is easier to twist space-time underwater.<br>The experiments done so far don't lower the speed of light in empty space; they just lower the speed of light in a medium and should not make it easier to twist space-time. Thus, it should not take any less mass-energy to form a black hole or a time machine of a given size in such a medium.\n</blockquote>Later, Mallett abandoned the idea of using slowed light to reduce the energy, writing that, \"For a time, I considered the possibility that slowing down light might increase the gravitational frame dragging effect of the ring laser ... Slow light, however, turned out to be helpful for my research.\"<ref name=Time-Traveler_page205>{{cite book | last = Mallett | first = Ronald | title = Time Traveler: A Scientist's Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality | publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-56025-869-1 | page = 205}}</ref>\n\nFinally, Olum and Everett note a theorem proven by [[Stephen Hawking]] in a 1992 paper on the [[Chronology Protection Conjecture]],<ref name=\"chronology protection\">{{cite journal | first=Stephen | last=Hawking | authorlink = Stephen Hawking | url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v46/p603 | title=Chronology protection conjecture | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 46 | year=1992 | issue=2 | pages = 603\u2013611 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.46.603 | bibcode=1992PhRvD..46..603H}}</ref> which demonstrated that according to General Relativity it should be impossible to create closed timelike curves in any finite region that satisfies the [[weak energy condition]], meaning that the region contains no [[exotic matter]] with negative energy. Mallett's original solution involved a spacetime containing a line source of infinite length, so it did not violate this theorem despite the absence of exotic matter, but Olum and Everett point out that the theorem \"would, however, rule out the creation of CTC's in any finite-sized approximation to this spacetime.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nMallett is a member of both the [[American Physical Society]] and the [[National Society of Black Physicists]];<ref name=MallettCV/> his brother is artist [[Keith Mallett]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of contributors to general relativity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography|Physics}}\n*[https://physics.uconn.edu/ronald-mallett/ Mallett's UConn homepage]\n*{{imdb name|2390870}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060903161207/http://www.physics.uconn.edu/~mallett/Mallett2000.pdf R.

It moved to the current site in Eversley in 1894, acquired charitable trust status under a governing board in 1955, opened a co-educational pre-prep in 1988 and attained full co-education in 1990. Since 1997 the school has worked a five-day week, with weekly and flexi-boarding from Year 3. The boarding ceased in 2015.

Monuments to their residents can be seen in [[Mary, mother of Jesus|St Mary's]] Church, a medieval building mostly rebuilt in the 18th century.\n\n[[File:St Mary's Church, Eversley.jpg|thumb|left|St Mary's Church, Eversley]]\n\nThe churchyard is the burial-place of [[Charles Kingsley]], who for 35 years was rector of the parish. As you enter the churchyard. Kingsley was a significant author and commentator in the 19th century: his novels include ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies]]'' and ''[[Westward Ho! (novel)|Westward Ho!]]''. He was also a social critic and an early founder of modern [[Christian socialism]]. One of his poems, \"The Bad Squire\", is displayed in the church.\n\n==Education==\n===Charles Kingsley's Primary School===\nIn Eversley there is a primary school called Charles Kingsley's Primary School, founded by Charles Kingsley in 1853. In 2011, it was inspected by OFSTED, and graded as \"outstanding\".{{needs update|date=March 2020}}\n\n===St. Neot's Preparatory School===\nThe village is home to St. Neots, also an independent preparatory school. It was founded in Sunningdale in 1888 as a proprietorial boys\u2019 preparatory boarding school. It moved to the current site in Eversley in 1894, acquired charitable trust status under a governing board in 1955, opened a co-educational pre-prep in 1988 and attained full co-education in 1990. Since 1997 the school has worked a five-day week, with weekly and flexi-boarding from Year 3. The boarding ceased in 2015. The boar was taken as a symbol of the school, replacing the deer, to link it with the meaning of the name of the village Eversley.\n\n==Modern notoriety==\nOn 1 April 1992, Jacqueline Palmer-Radford, a 40-year-old mother of two, was found dead after having been raped and strangled at her home in the village. The murder remains unsolved despite being featured on the television programme ''[[Crimewatch]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.truecrimelibrary.com/crime_series_show.php?id=103&series_number=11|title=Gone But Not Forgotten - April 1st 1/4/1992 Jacqueline Palmer-Radford \u2013 Eversley|work=True Crime Library|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108185350/http://www.truecrimelibrary.com/crime_series_show.php?id=103&series_number=11|archive-date=8 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Laura Marling]], musician\n* [[Will Carling]], former [[rugby union]] player\n* [[Rob Collard]], [[auto racing]] driver\n* [[Nigel Adkins]], former professional footballer, physiotherapist and manager\n\n==Sport==\n[[Eversley F.C.]] was founded in 1910.

However, he is much darker, in clothing and humor, when [[Quasimodo]] and [[Captain Phoebus]] arrive in the Court of Miracles, suggesting his personality during the day to have been something of a [[Masking (personality)|fa\u00e7ade]]. However, he shows to have a gentle nature at the end of the film when he picks a little girl up and entertains her with a puppet resembling [[Claude Frollo|Judge Claude Frollo]]. Clopin's ending pitch of the song \"[[The Bells of Notre Dame]]\" has garnered incredible acclaim for its high D-note singing. He is voiced by [[Paul Kandel]] and animated by Michael Surrey.\n\nAs well as narrating the whole film, Clopin introduces the film and begins the story with the song \"The Bells of Notre Dame,\" where he introduces the audience to the story by explaining how Quasimodo, the bell ringer from Notre Dame, ended up there. He also sings \"[[Topsy Turvy (song)|Topsy Turvy]]\" about the traditional Parisian \"[[Feast of Fools]],\" also known as [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] held every year on January 6.\n\nClopin wears two main costumes during the film: a [[jester]] suit (seen to the right), which he wears at the Festival of Fools; he also wears a similar costume in the [[catacombs]], but it is almost completely purple with no gold trim, no mask, and no bells. In \"The Court of Miracles,\" he wears a lawyer's outfit, a judge's outfit (resembling Frollo's), and an executioner's outfit for brief periods of time.\n\nAs the movie's narrator, Clopin has a great deal of knowledge about Quasimodo's past, seemingly more than Quasimodo himself. This suggests that to know the whole story, throughout Paris he must have many contacts. Clopin's age is never estimated, so it is unknown if he was a child or at least old enough to hear about the murder of Quasimodo's mother.\n\nNot only is Clopin the narrator in the story, but he is also the King of the Gypsies, who at the time were being rounded up and murdered in an act of \"purification\" by Frollo.\n\n===Original film===\nClopin appears in the film five times. The first appearance is when Clopin sings \"The Bells of Notre Dame,\" which tells the tale of how Frollo killed Quasimodo's mother, but was stopped by the Archdeacon before he could kill the infant Quasimodo by drowning him in a well.\n\nThe second appearance is at the Festival of Fools, where he acts as the [[Lord of Misrule]], or [[master of ceremonies]], sings \"Topsy Turvy,\" a dance number that explains that it is \"the day we do the things that we deplore on the other three-hundred-and-sixty-four.\" It is also during this song that he crowns Quasimodo the \"King of Fools.\"\n\nHis third appearance is much later in the film, at the Court of Miracles, where a much darker side to his personality is shown. He and a large group of gypsies believe Quasimodo and Phoebus to be spies. They sing the song \"The Court of Miracles\" as Clopin puts Quasimodo and Phoebus on \"trial\" which includes a jury consisting of a puppet crafted in Clopin's likeness. He eventually finds them \"totally innocent, which is the worst crime of all.\" He prepares to hang them, but [[Esmeralda (Disney)|Esmeralda]] arrives in time to stop him and tell the gypsies of their good intentions, explaining how Phoebus rescued the miller and his family from being burned by Frollo and how Quasimodo helped her escape the cathedral. Clopin, forgetting that he'd gagged Quasimodo and Phoebus, humorously asks why they didn't just say so. Phoebus informs the gypsy people to leave, saying that Frollo knows of their hideout, a statement confirmed by Quasimodo, who was told of this by Frollo before. Realizing this, all the gypsies (including Clopin) agree and prepare to leave Paris, but unfortunately, Frollo arrives just in time to attack the Court of Miracles and Clopin is seen with his people struggling to break free from their bonds to no avail.\n\nHis fourth appearance is briefly during the climax of the film where Esmeralda is at the scaffold before Notre Dame. When Quasimodo rescues Esmeralda, Phoebus breaks free and rouses the civilians into action, inciting them to release the gypsies and help them protect the cathedral from Frollo's soldiers. Clopin is seen jumping out of one of the many cages that hold the gypsies freed by the civilians. Along with the civilians and French army, they attack Frollo's soldiers.\n\nHis fifth and final appearance is at the end, where Quasimodo is escorted out from the cathedral to be praised by the people for his actions. Having developed a newfound respect for Quasimodo, Clopin happily declares \"Three cheers for Quasimodo!\" He then sings a reprise of \"The Bells of Notre Dame\" while entertaining one of the young children as the civilians finally cheer Quasimodo, accepting him into their society.\n\n===Sequel===\nClopin also appeared in the straight-to-video sequel, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]'', as the host for the Festival of Love (Le Jour D'Amour, \"the day of love\"), although he is no longer the narrator and plays a much smaller role.\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|France|Novels}}\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trouillefou, Clopin}}\n[[Category:The Hunchback of Notre-Dame characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional clowns]]\n[[Category:Fictional singers]]\n[[Category:Fictional dancers]]\n[[Category:Fictional kings]]\n[[Category:Fictional tribal chiefs]]\n[[Category:Fictional Romani people]]\n[[Category:Fictional jesters]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people in literature]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1831]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n{{Primary sources|date=January 2008}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Clopin Trouillefou\n| series             = [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]\n| creator            = [[Victor Hugo]]\n| gender             = Male\n| nationality        = [[Romani people|Romani]]\n}}\n\n'''Clopin Trouillefou''' ({{IPA-fr|kl\u0254.p\u025b\u0303 t\u0281uj.fu|pron}}, literally \"Lame Fear-Fool\") is a fictional character first created in the 1831 novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' by French author [[Victor Hugo]], and subsequently adapted.\n\n==In the novel==\nIn the story, Clopin disrupts [[Pierre Gringoire]]'s play, begging the audience for money.

[[Henry Evans Maude|H.E. Maude]] and Niel Gunson had both assumed it to be the whaler ''Mary'' owned by John Lydekker (1778\u20131832) and that her captain, Edward Reed Lacy, had reported the island. The entry for August 5, 1824, of that ''Mary's'' logbook, however, mentions no discovery, nor a ship ''Ph\u0153nix''. The ship ''Mary'' truly there that day (her master presumably Abijah Lock) happened to be also a whaler from London, but was in fact owned by ''Hill, Boulcott & Hill'', a firm that consisted of the two brothers James & Amon Hill and their brother-in-law [[John Ellerker Boulcott]].

During this time, the American party claimed the island for the United States, erecting a small monument with two American flags. According to one account, the British warship [[HMS Wellington (U65)|HMS ''Wellington'']] fired a shot across the bow of the [[USS Avocet (AVP-4)|USS ''Avocet'']], when the latter refused to cede the choicest anchorage spot to the British vessel.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> The American ship allegedly responded in kind, following which both captains agreed to \"cease fire\" until instructions could be received from their respective governments.

Although the British ambassador to the United States requested removal of markers claiming U.S. sovereignty, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] formally placed the island under control of the U.S. Interior department on 3&nbsp;March 1938. Both parties continued to press their competing claims until 6&nbsp;April 1939, when the U.S. and Britain agreed to hold Kanton under joint control for the next fifty years as the [[Canton and Enderbury Islands]] [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. The U.S./U.K. tenure proved cordial and cooperative thereafter, with each party enjoying the other's hospitality and working together to ensure smooth operation of island facilities.

[[British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines]] (BCPA), Australia's first trans-Pacific airline, served the island via a cooperative agreement with [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA) initially with Douglas DC-4's on a routing of Sydney - Auckland - Fiji - Kanton Island - Honolulu - San Francisco - Vancouver, with the inaugural flight departing Australia on 15&nbsp;September 1946.  BCPA then began flying luxurious [[Douglas DC-6B]]s on the Sydney to Vancouver route. [[Qantas]] took over this service shortly thereafter as BCPA subsequently ceased all operations and went out of business. [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] also used the island as well for its Douglas DC-4 service between Vancouver and the southern hemisphere.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 12.</ref> A full-scale community was established to support these airline operations, including an electrical power station, a hotel for the airline passengers' use, a medical dispensary, school for dependent children of station personnel, and other necessary facilities. The island was jointly administered by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British and American post offices were both operated from a single building. The American administrator, who was an employee of the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (predecessor to the [[FAA]]) and island manager for that agency, also served as the U.S. resident administrator under the Department of the Interior and as a U.S. special deputy marshal under the Department of Justice. William J. Evans held this position from 1952\u20131956, during which time a crew from ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' magazine visited the island and highlighted it in the magazine's January 1955 issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Walker |first=Howell |title=Air age grings life to Canton Island |magazine=The [[National Geographic Magazine]] |date=January 1955 |pages=117\u2013132}}</ref>\n\nVice-President [[Richard Nixon]] and his wife visited the island in October&nbsp;1953, en route to New Zealand, where they stayed overnight and were interviewed by Fred Carpenter for the local radio station KIBS.<ref>{{cite web |title=RNZI Airs new Radio Heritage Feature - The Lost Nixon Tape - KIBS Canton Island 1953 |publisher=Radio Heritage Foundation |url=http://www.radioheritage.net/RHF_Media_Release_20121008_RNZI.pdf |date=8 October 2012 | accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sounds Historical - 16&nbsp;June 2013 - Show Notes - 8:23 Mr and Mrs&nbsp;Nixon |publisher=Radio New Zealand | url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/soundshistorical |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>  By 1956, Pan Am was operating a [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]] service into the airport from Los Angeles and San Francisco, via a stop in Honolulu, with these flights continuing on to [[Sydney]] with a stop at [[Nadi Airport]] in [[Fiji]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timetableimages.com |date=1 July 1956 |title=Pan American World Airways system timetable}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the introduction of long-range jet aircraft spelled the end of Kanton's usefulness as an aircraft refueling station, and all airlines ended their operations there by the late 1950s&mdash;except for Pan Am, which continued a monthly service with [[Douglas DC-7C]] prop aircraft via Auckland, Nadi, Pago Pago, Kanton, Honolulu and return. This service was conducted using the outbased DC-7C aircraft N743PA and N744PA, which provided feeder service from Auckland to three points on the jet service schedules. The last Pan Am flight was in November 1965 when the final DC-7C returned to Miami after the opening of a new airport in Auckland, enabling New Zealand to be added to Pan Am's [[Boeing 707]] jet routes. Kanton's airport remained operational, however, as an emergency landing field.\n\n[[File:Kanton Island 02.jpg|thumb|left|House on Kanton Island, 2008.]]\n\n===After the airlines===\nIn 1960 a tracking station for the [[Mercury program]] was built on Kanton, and used through November&nbsp;1965. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Organization continued to use the island for missile-tracking operations through 1976. That year marked the complete end of the American presence; the airfield was abandoned and all U.S. personnel were removed.<ref>http://www.tighar.org/TTracks/14_1/Kanton_Mission.html.</ref> The British closed their [[post office]], ending their presence on Kanton as well. With the independence of [[Kiribati]] from Britain in 1979, the Anglo-American condominium was formally terminated, and the island transferred to Kiribati sovereignty.

In late March, the 31 men tried their luck by putting to sea in the four open boats and made their way northwest for 49 days straight when finally they reached safety in [[Guam]], 2,900 nautical miles from where they had started.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LraODwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=the+armchair+navigator&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjuj6WOhsLkAhWNa1AKHSxFBeEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=The Armchair Navigator I|last=Dehner|first=Steve|publisher=|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Geography, flora and fauna==\nKanton has been described as being shaped like a large pork chop.<ref name=\"JRi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.janeresture.com/kiribati_phoenix_group/canton.htm|title=Canton Island (Kanton - Abariringa) Phoenix Group, Kiribati|last=Resture|first=Jane|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> From its northwest to southeast points is a distance of {{convert|14.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}, while the land rim varies in width from {{convert|50|-|600|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} and {{convert|1.5|-|7|m|ft|abbr=on|round=5}} in elevation.

According to Edwin H. Bryan's ''American Polynesia and the Hawaiian Chain'', Kanton possessed in 1941 a total of twelve native species of vegetation, including low herbs and bunch grass, a thick stand of ''[[Scaevola (plant)|Scaevola]]'' shrubs on the island's south side ({{convert|2|-|3|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} high), some ''[[Suriana|Suriana maritima]]'' shrubs near the lagoon entrance, heliotrope (''[[Heliotropium foertherianum]]'') and kou (''[[Cordia subcordata]]'') trees, and [[coconut]] palms.<ref name=\"JRi\"/><ref>Bryan, p.&nbsp;46.</ref> [[Geoffrey Armstrong Buddle|Geoffrey Buddle]] of the New Zealand solar eclipse expedition of 1937 reported 23&nbsp;bird species on Kanton, together with [[Polynesian rat]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[hermit crab]]s and [[turtle]]s.

Rainwater is caught in cisterns; [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] had a large [[distillation]] [[Desalination|plant]] on the island when it operated there during the 1940s and 50s. Rainfall is sparse, averaging {{convert|8.71|-|35.97|in|mm|abbr=on}} between 1938 and 1953,<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 5.</ref> though later reports suggest a wetter climate in recent years.<ref>http://www.tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Bulletins/04_Kantonresults.html.</ref>\n\n==History==\n===British claims===\nThe [[United Kingdom|British]] laid claim to Kanton Island during the 1850s.<ref name=\"JRi\"/>  The official British claim was formally reasserted on 6&nbsp;August 1936, and an [[order in council]] issued in March&nbsp;1937 including Kanton and other [[Phoenix Islands]] in the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] Colony, with the British making several visits to the island culminating in the placement of two radio operators on Kanton on 31&nbsp;August 1937.\n\n===Americans arrive===\n[[File:Kanton Island 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Rusting fire truck on Kanton Island, 2008.]]\nOn [[Solar eclipse of June 8, 1937|8&nbsp;June 1937]], Kanton was the site of a total [[solar eclipse]] and the island was occupied briefly by [[United States|American]] and [[New Zealand]] scientists, members of an expedition organized by the [[National Geographic Society]], and led by the [[astronomer]] [[Samuel Alfred Mitchell]]. During this time, the American party claimed the island for the United States, erecting a small monument with two American flags. According to one account, the British warship [[HMS Wellington (U65)|HMS ''Wellington'']] fired a shot across the bow of the [[USS Avocet (AVP-4)|USS ''Avocet'']], when the latter refused to cede the choicest anchorage spot to the British vessel.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> The American ship allegedly responded in kind, following which both captains agreed to \"cease fire\" until instructions could be received from their respective governments. [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[London]] quickly ordered no further escalation, and both parties observed the solar eclipse together, \"though officially a bit cool.\"<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 10.</ref>\n\nIn response to the British reoccupation of Kanton in August&nbsp;1937, seven Americans from the [[American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project]] landed on the island on 7&nbsp;March 1938. Although the British ambassador to the United States requested removal of markers claiming U.S. sovereignty, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] formally placed the island under control of the U.S. Interior department on 3&nbsp;March 1938. Both parties continued to press their competing claims until 6&nbsp;April 1939, when the U.S. and Britain agreed to hold Kanton under joint control for the next fifty years as the [[Canton and Enderbury Islands]] [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. The U.S./U.K. tenure proved cordial and cooperative thereafter, with each party enjoying the other's hospitality and working together to ensure smooth operation of island facilities. A United States office was open between 1940 and 1965 and from 1970.<ref name=\"Post Office\">{{Cite web  |last=Premier Postal History |title=Post Office List |publisher=Premier Postal Auctions |url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=ge&country= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> Canton Island Post Office opened on 25&nbsp;January 1941 and closed around February 1968.\n\n===Airplane oasis===\n[[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) arrived on Kanton on 18&nbsp;May 1939, to build facilities for their planned [[New Zealand]] flying boat service.<ref name=\"JRi\"/> Service commenced on 12&nbsp;July 1940 with the [[Boeing 314 Clipper]].

[[British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines]] (BCPA), Australia's first trans-Pacific airline, served the island via a cooperative agreement with [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA) initially with Douglas DC-4's on a routing of Sydney - Auckland - Fiji - Kanton Island - Honolulu - San Francisco - Vancouver, with the inaugural flight departing Australia on 15&nbsp;September 1946.  BCPA then began flying luxurious [[Douglas DC-6B]]s on the Sydney to Vancouver route. [[Qantas]] took over this service shortly thereafter as BCPA subsequently ceased all operations and went out of business. [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] also used the island as well for its Douglas DC-4 service between Vancouver and the southern hemisphere.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 12.</ref> A full-scale community was established to support these airline operations, including an electrical power station, a hotel for the airline passengers' use, a medical dispensary, school for dependent children of station personnel, and other necessary facilities. The island was jointly administered by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British and American post offices were both operated from a single building. The American administrator, who was an employee of the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (predecessor to the [[FAA]]) and island manager for that agency, also served as the U.S. resident administrator under the Department of the Interior and as a U.S. special deputy marshal under the Department of Justice. William J. Evans held this position from 1952\u20131956, during which time a crew from ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' magazine visited the island and highlighted it in the magazine's January 1955 issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Walker |first=Howell |title=Air age grings life to Canton Island |magazine=The [[National Geographic Magazine]] |date=January 1955 |pages=117\u2013132}}</ref>\n\nVice-President [[Richard Nixon]] and his wife visited the island in October&nbsp;1953, en route to New Zealand, where they stayed overnight and were interviewed by Fred Carpenter for the local radio station KIBS.<ref>{{cite web |title=RNZI Airs new Radio Heritage Feature - The Lost Nixon Tape - KIBS Canton Island 1953 |publisher=Radio Heritage Foundation |url=http://www.radioheritage.net/RHF_Media_Release_20121008_RNZI.pdf |date=8 October 2012 | accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sounds Historical - 16&nbsp;June 2013 - Show Notes - 8:23 Mr and Mrs&nbsp;Nixon |publisher=Radio New Zealand | url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/soundshistorical |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>  By 1956, Pan Am was operating a [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]] service into the airport from Los Angeles and San Francisco, via a stop in Honolulu, with these flights continuing on to [[Sydney]] with a stop at [[Nadi Airport]] in [[Fiji]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timetableimages.com |date=1 July 1956 |title=Pan American World Airways system timetable}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the introduction of long-range jet aircraft spelled the end of Kanton's usefulness as an aircraft refueling station, and all airlines ended their operations there by the late 1950s&mdash;except for Pan Am, which continued a monthly service with [[Douglas DC-7C]] prop aircraft via Auckland, Nadi, Pago Pago, Kanton, Honolulu and return. This service was conducted using the outbased DC-7C aircraft N743PA and N744PA, which provided feeder service from Auckland to three points on the jet service schedules. The last Pan Am flight was in November 1965 when the final DC-7C returned to Miami after the opening of a new airport in Auckland, enabling New Zealand to be added to Pan Am's [[Boeing 707]] jet routes. Kanton's airport remained operational, however, as an emergency landing field.\n\n[[File:Kanton Island 02.jpg|thumb|left|House on Kanton Island, 2008.]]\n\n===After the airlines===\nIn 1960 a tracking station for the [[Mercury program]] was built on Kanton, and used through November&nbsp;1965. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Organization continued to use the island for missile-tracking operations through 1976. That year marked the complete end of the American presence; the airfield was abandoned and all U.S. personnel were removed.<ref>http://www.tighar.org/TTracks/14_1/Kanton_Mission.html.</ref> The British closed their [[post office]], ending their presence on Kanton as well. With the independence of [[Kiribati]] from Britain in 1979, the Anglo-American condominium was formally terminated, and the island transferred to Kiribati sovereignty. Kanton's post office was reopened by the Kiribati government, and the island was repopulated with a few people from the more crowded atolls of the [[Gilbert Islands]], who reside in several of the abandoned residences left over from the Anglo-American presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/d14/units/kukui/Kanton.htm |title=USCGC Kukui (WLB - 203)|author=|date=|website=www.uscg.mil|accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nKanton is occasionally visited by Republic of Kiribati vessels, the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and various fishing boats.
