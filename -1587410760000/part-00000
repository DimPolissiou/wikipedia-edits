In Bulgarian, the title became known as \"Kan\" (as in the \"Nominalia of the Bulgarian Kans\"), while in modern Turkic, the title became ''Khaan'' with the 'g' sound becoming almost silent or non-existent (i.e. a very light [[voiceless velar fricative]]); the ''\u011f'' in modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Ka\u011fan'' is also silent. Since the [[division of the Mongol Empire]], emperors of the [[Yuan dynasty]] held the title of Khagan and their successors in Mongolia continued to have the title. ''Ka\u011fan'' and ''Kaan'' are common [[Turkish names]] in [[Turkey]].\n\nThe common western rendering as '''Great Khan''' (or Grand Khan), notably in the case of the [[Mongol Empire]], is a translation of ''Yekhe Khagan'' (Great Emperor or \u0418\u0445 \u0425\u0430\u0430\u043d).\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term is of unknown origin and possibly a loanword from the [[Ruanruan language]].<ref>Vovin, Alexander (2010). \"Once Again on the Ruan-ruan language.\" ''\u00d6t\u00fcken'den \u0130stanbul'a T\u00fcrk\u00e7enin 1290 Y\u0131l\u0131 (720\u20132010) Sempozyumu / From \u00d6t\u00fcken to Istanbul, 1290 Years of Turkish (720\u20132010).'' 3\u20135 Aral\u0131k 2010, \u0130stanbul / 3\u20135 December 2010, \u0130stanbul, pp. 1\u201310.</ref>.

While Sinor believes ''qa\u03b3an'' or ''qap\u03b3an'' is an intensification of ''qan'' just as ''qap-qara'' is an intensification of ''qara'' \"black\", in Turkic (with the eventual loss of the ''p''), Shiratori rejects a Turkic etymology, instead supporting a Mongolic origin for both ''qan'' and the female form ''qatun''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shiratori|first=Kurakichi|date=1926|title=On the Titles KHAN and KAGHAN|journal=Proceedings of the Imperial Academy|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=241\u2013244|doi=10.2183/pjab1912.2.241|issn=0369-9846|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=KRADER|first=LAWRENCE|date=1955|title=QAN-QA\u03b3AN AND THE BEGINNINGS OF MONGOL KINGSHIP|journal=Central Asiatic Journal|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17\u201335|issn=0008-9192|jstor=41926298}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Vovin, the word ''*qa-qan'' \"great-qan\" (''*qa-'' for \"great\" or \"supreme\") is of non-Altaic origin, but instead linked to [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] ''*q\u03b5\u0294 ~ qa\u0294'' \"big, great\". The origin of ''qan'' itself is harder according to Vovin. He says that the origin for the word ''qan'' is not found in any reconstructed proto-language and was used widely by Turkic, Mongolic, Chinese and Korean people with variations from ''kan, qan, han and hwan.'' A relation exists possibly to the Yeniseian words ''*q\u028c:j'' or ''*\u03c7\u028c:j'' meaning \"ruler\". \n\nIt may be impossible to prove the ultimate origin of the title, but Vovin says: \"Thus, it seems to be quite likely that the ultimate source of both ''qa\u03b3an'' and ''qan'' can be traced back to Xiong-nu and Yeniseian\".<ref name=Vovin_2007 />\n\n==History==\nThe title was first seen in a speech between 283 and 289, when the [[Xianbei]] chief [[Tuyuhun]] tried to escape from his younger stepbrother [[Murong Hui]], and began his route from the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] to the areas of [[Ordos Desert]]. In the speech one of Murong's generals, Yinalou, addressed him as ''kehan'' ({{zh|c=\u53ef\u5bd2}}, later {{zh|c=\u53ef\u6c57}}); some sources suggests that Tuyuhun might also have used the title after settling at [[Qinghai Lake]] in the 3rd century.<ref>Zhou 1985, p. 3-6</ref>\n\nThe [[Rouran Khaganate]] (330\u2013555) was the first people to use the titles Khagan and Khan for their emperors, replacing the [[Chanyu]] of the [[Xiongnu]], whom Grousset and others assume to be [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]].<ref>Grousset (1970), pp. 61, 585, n. 92.</ref> The Rouran are assumed to be [[proto-Mongols]] or a \"non-Altaic\" group.<ref>Art, Iranian-Bulletin of the Asia Institute, volume 17, p. 122</ref><ref>Nihon Gakushiin-Proceedings of the Japan Academy, volume 2, p. 241</ref><ref>Teikoku Gakushiin (Japan)-Proceedings of the Imperial Academy, volume 2, p. 241</ref><ref>Vovin, Alexander. 2010.

For example, the Ilkhans' coins carried the Khagan's name up until the early 14th century. It was also once said that Khagan is \"the blessing of the creator\" at the court of the Golden Horde during the reign of [[Ozbek Khan]] (1313\u201341).}}\n\nAfter the breakdown of Mongol Empire and the fall of the Yuan dynasty in the mid-14th century, the Mongols turned into a political turmoil. [[Dayan Khan]] (1464\u20131517/1543) once revived Emperor's authority and recovered its reputation in Mongolia, but with the distribution of his empire among his sons and relatives as fiefs it again caused decentralized rule. The last Khagan of the [[Chahars]], [[Ligdan Khan]], died in 1634 while fighting the [[Qing dynasty]] founded by the [[Manchu people]]. In contemporary [[Mongolian language]] the words \"Khaan\" and \"Khan\" have different meanings, while [[English language]] usually does not differentiate between them. The title is also used as a generic term for a king or emperor (as \u044d\u0437\u044d\u043d \u0445\u0430\u0430\u043d, ''ezen khaan''), as in \"\u0418\u0441\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439\u043d \u0445\u0430\u0430\u043d \u0425\u0443\u0430\u043d \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0441\" (''Ispaniin khaan Khuan Karlos'', \"king/khaan of Spain Juan Carlos\").\n\nThe early Khagans of the [[Mongol Empire]] were:\n# [[Genghis Khan]] (1206\u20131227) (21 years)\n# [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] (1229\u20131241) (12 years)\n# [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan]] (1246\u20131248) (2 years)\n# [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] (1251\u20131259) (8 years)\n\n== Among Turkic peoples ==\n{{see also|G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk family tree}}\nThe title became associated with the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] ruling clan of the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]] and their dynastic successors among such peoples as the [[Khazars]] (cf. the compound military title [[Khagan Bek]]). Minor rulers were rather relegated to the lower title of khan.\n\nBoth Khagan as such and the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] form Hakan, with the specification in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-Barrayn wa al-Bahrayn'' (meaning literally \"of both lands and both seas\"), or rather fully in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] ''Hakan \u00fcl-Berreyn vel-Bahreyn'', were among the titles in the official full style of the Great Sultan (and later Caliph) of the [[Ottoman Empire]], reflecting the historical legitimation of the dynasty's rule as political successor to various conquered (often Islamised) states. (The title began: Sultan H\u00e2n N.N., [[Padishah]], ''H\u00fcnkar'', Sovereign of the House of Osman, [[Sultan of Sultans]], Khan of Khans, Commander of the Faithful and Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe; next followed a series of specifically 'regional' titles, starting with Protector of the Holy Cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem.)\n\n\"Khagan\" is the second title of [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] shahs (kings) of Iran. For example, Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar, Fath Ali Shah and other Qajar shahs used this title. The nickname of Shah Ismail and other Safavid shahs is ''Kagan-i Suleyman shan'' (Khagan with the glory of Solomon).\n\n=== Ottoman Empire ===\nOttoman rulers, after the 14th century, used only two titles \"shah\" and \"khan\" until end of the empire.<ref>H\u00fcseyin Y\u0131lmaz, (2018), ''Caliphate Redefined: The Mystical Turn in Ottoman Political Thought'', p. 124</ref> Sultans like [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] and [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] used the title \"Khagan of the two seas\".<ref>Cihan Y\u00fcksel Muslu, (2014), The Ottomans and the Mamluks: Imperial Diplomacy and Warfare in the Islamic World, p. 118</ref><ref>[[Evliya \u00c7elebi]], ''Narrative of Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa in the Seventeenth Century'', p. 19</ref>\n\n== Chinese Khagans ==\n{{Main|Khan of Heaven}}\n{{Main list|List of emperors of the Tang dynasty|List of emperors of the Yuan dynasty|List of emperors of the Qing dynasty}}\n\n[[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] was crowned [[Tian Kehan]], or \"heavenly Khagan\" after defeating the [[Tujue]] ([[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]]).<ref>Liu, pp.&nbsp;81&ndash;83.</ref><ref>{{cite book |access-date = 2012-02-08 |title = The Chinese, their history and culture |volume = 1&ndash;2 |first = Kenneth |last = Scott Latourette |quote = territories within his empire.

In Bulgarian, the title became known as \"Kan\" (as in the \"Nominalia of the Bulgarian Kans\"), while in modern Turkic, the title became ''Khaan'' with the 'g' sound becoming almost silent or non-existent (i.e. a very light [[voiceless velar fricative]]); the ''\u011f'' in modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Ka\u011fan'' is also silent. Since the [[division of the Mongol Empire]], emperors of the [[Yuan dynasty]] held the title of Khagan and their successors in Mongolia continued to have the title. ''Ka\u011fan'' and ''Kaan'' are common [[Turkish names]] in [[Turkey]].\n\nThe common western rendering as '''Great Khan''' (or Grand Khan), notably in the case of the [[Mongol Empire]], is a translation of ''Yekhe Khagan'' (Great Emperor or \u0418\u0445 \u0425\u0430\u0430\u043d).\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term is of unknown origin and possibly a loanword from the [[Ruanruan language]].<ref>Vovin, Alexander (2010). \"Once Again on the Ruan-ruan language.\" ''\u00d6t\u00fcken'den \u0130stanbul'a T\u00fcrk\u00e7enin 1290 Y\u0131l\u0131 (720\u20132010) Sempozyumu / From \u00d6t\u00fcken to Istanbul, 1290 Years of Turkish (720\u20132010).'' 3\u20135 Aral\u0131k 2010, \u0130stanbul / 3\u20135 December 2010, \u0130stanbul, pp. 1\u201310.</ref>.

While Sinor believes ''qa\u03b3an'' or ''qap\u03b3an'' is an intensification of ''qan'' just as ''qap-qara'' is an intensification of ''qara'' \"black\", in Turkic (with the eventual loss of the ''p''), Shiratori rejects a Turkic etymology, instead supporting a Mongolic origin for both ''qan'' and the female form ''qatun''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shiratori|first=Kurakichi|date=1926|title=On the Titles KHAN and KAGHAN|journal=Proceedings of the Imperial Academy|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=241\u2013244|doi=10.2183/pjab1912.2.241|issn=0369-9846|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=KRADER|first=LAWRENCE|date=1955|title=QAN-QA\u03b3AN AND THE BEGINNINGS OF MONGOL KINGSHIP|journal=Central Asiatic Journal|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17\u201335|issn=0008-9192|jstor=41926298}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Vovin, the word ''*qa-qan'' \"great-qan\" (''*qa-'' for \"great\" or \"supreme\") is of non-Altaic origin, but instead linked to [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] ''*q\u03b5\u0294 ~ qa\u0294'' \"big, great\". The origin of ''qan'' itself is harder according to Vovin. He says that the origin for the word ''qan'' is not found in any reconstructed proto-language and was used widely by Turkic, Mongolic, Chinese and Korean people with variations from ''kan, qan, han and hwan.'' A relation exists possibly to the Yeniseian words ''*q\u028c:j'' or ''*\u03c7\u028c:j'' meaning \"ruler\". \n\nIt may be impossible to prove the ultimate origin of the title, but Vovin says: \"Thus, it seems to be quite likely that the ultimate source of both ''qa\u03b3an'' and ''qan'' can be traced back to Xiong-nu and Yeniseian\".<ref name=Vovin_2007 />\n\n==History==\nThe title was first seen in a speech between 283 and 289, when the [[Xianbei]] chief [[Tuyuhun]] tried to escape from his younger stepbrother [[Murong Hui]], and began his route from the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] to the areas of [[Ordos Desert]]. In the speech one of Murong's generals, Yinalou, addressed him as ''kehan'' ({{zh|c=\u53ef\u5bd2}}, later {{zh|c=\u53ef\u6c57}}); some sources suggests that Tuyuhun might also have used the title after settling at [[Qinghai Lake]] in the 3rd century.<ref>Zhou 1985, p. 3-6</ref>\n\nThe [[Rouran Khaganate]] (330\u2013555) was the first people to use the titles Khagan and Khan for their emperors, replacing the [[Chanyu]] of the [[Xiongnu]], whom Grousset and others assume to be [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]].<ref>Grousset (1970), pp. 61, 585, n. 92.</ref> The Rouran are assumed to be [[proto-Mongols]] or a \"non-Altaic\" group.<ref>Art, Iranian-Bulletin of the Asia Institute, volume 17, p. 122</ref><ref>Nihon Gakushiin-Proceedings of the Japan Academy, volume 2, p. 241</ref><ref>Teikoku Gakushiin (Japan)-Proceedings of the Imperial Academy, volume 2, p. 241</ref><ref>Vovin, Alexander. 2010.

The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] invaded [[Europe]], and for over a century ruled the Carpathian region.

Only the [[Ilkhanate]] truly recognized the Yuan's overlordship as allies (though it was effectively autonomous).

For example, the Ilkhans' coins carried the Khagan's name up until the early 14th century. It was also once said that Khagan is \"the blessing of the creator\" at the court of the Golden Horde during the reign of [[Ozbek Khan]] (1313\u201341).}}\n\nAfter the breakdown of Mongol Empire and the fall of the Yuan dynasty in the mid-14th century, the Mongols turned into a political turmoil. [[Dayan Khan]] (1464\u20131517/1543) once revived Emperor's authority and recovered its reputation in Mongolia, but with the distribution of his empire among his sons and relatives as fiefs it again caused decentralized rule. The last Khagan of the [[Chahars]], [[Ligdan Khan]], died in 1634 while fighting the [[Qing dynasty]] founded by the [[Manchu people]]. In contemporary [[Mongolian language]] the words \"Khaan\" and \"Khan\" have different meanings, while [[English language]] usually does not differentiate between them. The title is also used as a generic term for a king or emperor (as \u044d\u0437\u044d\u043d \u0445\u0430\u0430\u043d, ''ezen khaan''), as in \"\u0418\u0441\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439\u043d \u0445\u0430\u0430\u043d \u0425\u0443\u0430\u043d \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0441\" (''Ispaniin khaan Khuan Karlos'', \"king/khaan of Spain Juan Carlos\").\n\nThe early Khagans of the [[Mongol Empire]] were:\n# [[Genghis Khan]] (1206\u20131227) (21 years)\n# [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] (1229\u20131241) (12 years)\n# [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan]] (1246\u20131248) (2 years)\n# [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] (1251\u20131259) (8 years)\n\n== Among Turkic peoples ==\n{{see also|G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk family tree}}\nThe title became associated with the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] ruling clan of the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]] and their dynastic successors among such peoples as the [[Khazars]] (cf. the compound military title [[Khagan Bek]]). Minor rulers were rather relegated to the lower title of khan.\n\nBoth Khagan as such and the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] form Hakan, with the specification in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-Barrayn wa al-Bahrayn'' (meaning literally \"of both lands and both seas\"), or rather fully in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] ''Hakan \u00fcl-Berreyn vel-Bahreyn'', were among the titles in the official full style of the Great Sultan (and later Caliph) of the [[Ottoman Empire]], reflecting the historical legitimation of the dynasty's rule as political successor to various conquered (often Islamised) states. (The title began: Sultan H\u00e2n N.N., [[Padishah]], ''H\u00fcnkar'', Sovereign of the House of Osman, [[Sultan of Sultans]], Khan of Khans, Commander of the Faithful and Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe; next followed a series of specifically 'regional' titles, starting with Protector of the Holy Cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem.)\n\n\"Khagan\" is the second title of [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] shahs (kings) of Iran. For example, Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar, Fath Ali Shah and other Qajar shahs used this title. The nickname of Shah Ismail and other Safavid shahs is ''Kagan-i Suleyman shan'' (Khagan with the glory of Solomon).\n\n=== Ottoman Empire ===\nOttoman rulers, after the 14th century, used only two titles \"shah\" and \"khan\" untill end of the empire.<ref>H\u00fcseyin Y\u0131lmaz, (2018), ''Caliphate Redefined: The Mystical Turn in Ottoman Political Thought'', p. 124</ref> Sultans like [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] and [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] used the title \"Khagan of the two seas\".<ref>Cihan Y\u00fcksel Muslu, (2014), The Ottomans and the Mamluks: Imperial Diplomacy and Warfare in the Islamic World, p. 118</ref><ref>[[Evliya \u00c7elebi]], ''Narrative of Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa in the Seventeenth Century'', p. 19</ref>\n\n== Chinese Khagans ==\n{{Main|Khan of Heaven}}\n{{Main list|List of emperors of the Tang dynasty|List of emperors of the Yuan dynasty|List of emperors of the Qing dynasty}}\n\n[[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] was crowned [[Tian Kehan]], or \"heavenly Khagan\" after defeating the [[Tujue]] ([[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]]).<ref>Liu, pp.&nbsp;81&ndash;83.</ref><ref>{{cite book |access-date = 2012-02-08 |title = The Chinese, their history and culture |volume = 1&ndash;2 |first = Kenneth |last = Scott Latourette |quote = territories within his empire.
