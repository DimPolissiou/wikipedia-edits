All Macedonian language printing stopped and the language was no longer taught in Bulgaria.\n\nThe existence of a Macedonian language and Macedonian ethnos is highly disputed in Bulgaria. Most Bulgarians do not recognize the Macedonian language as a separate language and assert that it is a dialect of Bulgarian. There are two dialects in Bulgaria which are considered Macedonian in North Macedonia: the [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect|Male\u0161evo-Pirin]] (widely spoken in most of [[Blagoevgrad Province]] in Bulgaria and [[Del\u010devo]] region in the Republic of Macedonia) and the [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect|Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop]] ones. Some linguists consider these dialects to be transitional between modern Bulgarian and Macedonian.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nAccording to the 2011 Bulgarian census, 1404 persons in Bulgaria (561 of them in [[Blagoevgrad Province]]) declared Macedonian as their native language.<ref>[https://censusresults.nsi.bg/Census/Reports/2/2/R8.aspx Population and housing census 2011: Population by residence, age and mother tongue]</ref><ref>[https://censusresults.nsi.bg/Census/Reports/2/2/R8.aspx?OBL=BLG Population and housing census 2011: Population by residence, age and mother tongue (Province: Blagoevgrad)]</ref>\n\n==Greece==\n{{see|Slavic dialects of Greece}}\n\nThe Macedonian language is spoken in the [[Greek Macedonia|Greek region of Macedonia]].

Prior to the election, the student Election Board had approved the applications of all candidates for president, certifying that they met the academic requirements among other things. Days after the election, the USAC members who had endorsed Monserratt's opponents voted to overrule the Election Board, applying their own eligibility criteria retroactively. They were accused by many of subverting student [[democracy]] and taking through [[legislation]] what they had failed to win in the student [[vote]].\n\nAfter USAC [[ex post facto]] declared Monserratt ineligible, the Third World Coalition sought to put forth a new candidate in his place.

At age 9 his father brought him along to protest the opening of the [[El Cid]] [[Sex shop|adult bookstore]] on [[Main Street]] in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] city of [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]]. The store was eventually forced to close by the continuing presence of the protestors led by the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] from the local parish.<ref name=\"eulogy\">{{cite news|url= |publisher= Crown Cable Community TV Alhambra, CA, 818-796-9129|title=Broadcast Eulogy | date= 2003-01-16}}</ref>\n\n==Student leadership at UCLA==\n\nDuring his years at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], Monserratt was extensively involved with the [[University of California, Los Angeles#Student life|Undergraduate Student Association Council]] (USAC). Leading a coalition of [[minority group|minority]] [[students]], he was elected president of USAC in 1988. The 1988 campaign pitted the coalition of minority students, the ''[[Third World]] [[Coalition]]'', against the candidates put forth by members of [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek system]] (this antagonism continues today).<ref name=\"Bruin Commentary\">{{cite news | first= Thomas | last= Soteros-Mcnamara | url= http://dailybruin.com/2002/04/17/ballot-online-voting-have-pros/ | title= Ballot, online voting have pros, cons | publisher= Daily Bruin | date= April 18, 2002 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[election]], he was declared ineligible due to a dispute over his academic [[wikt:qualification|qualifications]] and denied office. Prior to the election, the student Election Board had approved the applications of all candidates for president, certifying that they met the academic requirements among other things. Days after the election, the USAC members who had endorsed Monserratt's opponents voted to overrule the Election Board, applying their own eligibility criteria retroactively. They were accused by many of subverting student [[democracy]] and taking through [[legislation]] what they had failed to win in the student [[vote]].\n\nAfter USAC [[ex post facto]] declared Monserratt ineligible, the Third World Coalition sought to put forth a new candidate in his place. However, this was not permitted by the USAC. Thus, the election to replace Monserratt was between Mike Meehan and Mike Soules (who had already lost in the primary and endorsed Mike Meehan), with Meehan eventually winning.<ref name=\"LA Times body guards\">{{cite news | first= Larry | last= Gordon | url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-06-02-me-5739-story.html | title= Bodyguards Assigned To UCLA Activists for Vote | section = Part 2 | page = 1 | work= [[Los Angeles Times]] | date= 1988-06-02}}</ref>\n\nSome students viewed the move as [[Racism|racially motivated]], and a group of about 200, most of them members of minority groups, marched on the [[Polling station|polling places]] after a heated [[Demonstration (people)|rally]] protesting the disqualification.<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite news | first= Report | last= AP | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/29/us/ucla-protesters-disrupt-voting-for-student-president.html| title= U.C.L.A.

Possibly originating in [[Scandinavia]], the Heruli are first mentioned by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors as one of several \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" groups raiding Roman provinces in the Balkans and Aegean, attacking by land, and notably also by sea. During this time they reportedly lived near the [[Sea of Azov]]. \n\nFrom the 4th century AD the Heruli were one of the peoples dominated by the empire of [[Attila]] the Hun. After the death of [[Attila]] in 454, they established their own kingdom on the [[Middle Danube]], and participated in successive conquests of [[Italy]] by [[Odoacer]], [[Theoderic the Great]], [[Narses]] and probably also the [[Lombards]]. Their independent kingdom was however destroyed by the [[Lombards]] in the early 6th century AD. A part of this population subsequently became established inside the Roman empire near [[Belgrade]], and continued contributing fighting men to the [[Eastern Roman empire]], and participating in Balkan and Italian conflicts.\n\nWith their last kingdom eventually dominated by Rome, and smaller groups integrated into larger political entities, the Heruli disappeared from history around the time of the conquest of Italy by the Lombards.\n\n==Name==\nThe name of the Heruli is sometimes spelled as Heruls, Herules, Herulians or Eruli.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=388}}\n\nThe name Heruli was often written in Greek and Latin with no \"h\", and is sometimes thought to be Germanic and related to the English word ''[[earl]]'' (see [[erilaz]]) implying that it was an honorific military title.{{sfn|Neumann|1999|p=468}} There is even speculation that the Heruli were not a normal tribal group but a brotherhood of mobile warriors, though there is no consensus for this old proposal, which is based only on the name etymology and the reputation of Heruli as soldiers.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=359-360}}\n\n==Language==\nThe Heruli are believed to have been [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking.<ref name=\"Heather_Germanic-speaking\">{{harvnb|Heather|2007|p=469}}. \"Heruli \u2013 Germanic-speaking group originally from north central Europe, some of whom migrated to regions north of the Black Sea in company with Goths and others in the third century.\"</ref> Personal names provide important evidence on the language of the Heruli.{{sfn|Taylor|1999|pp=468-469}} A large number of Heruli names are attested, and many of these are certainly [[Germanic name|Germanic]],<ref name=\"Maenchen-Helfen_837\">{{harvnb|Maenchen-Helfen|1947|pp=837-838}}. \"[[:de:Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld|Sch\u00f6nfeld]]... offers Germanic etymologies not only for Faras and Alvith but also for Fanotheus, Filimuth, Hariso, Sindval, Svartva, Uligangus, and Visandus.

The reliability of Jordanes is however disputed.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|pp=205-209}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=148-152}} His contemporary, [[Procopius]] recounted a migration of a contemporary group of Heruli noblemen to [[Thule]] (which for him, but not Jordanes, was the same as Scandinavia), from the Middle Danube.<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XV\"/> This account has been seen as implying an old and continuous connection between the Heruli and Scandinavia, although some recent scholars are skeptical of this interpretation.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=148-152}}{{sfn|Goffart|2006|pp=205-209}}\n\n===On the Pontic steppe===\nThe Heruli are believed to have migrated towards the region north of the [[Black Sea]] in the 3rd century AD. Other Germanic peoples, such as the [[Rugii]] and the Goths, are believed to have carried out a similar migration at this time. These peoples replaced the [[Sarmatians]] as the dominant power north of the Black Sea. The Sarmatians had in the 1st century AD replaced the [[Bastarnae]], who are believed to have been a Germanic people. The arrival of the Heruli has been seen as part of a bigger cultural shift in this region, involving the migration from the northwest of Germanic peoples, who replaced the Sarmatians as the dominant power in the region.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=116}}\n\nThe first relatively clear mention of the Heruli by Graeco-Roman writers concerns two major campaigns into the Balkans of 267/268 and 269/270.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=124}} Goths, Heruli (sometimes referred to as \"Eluri\", \u1f1c\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, in this context), and other \"Scythian\" peoples from the region of the Sea of Azov, took control of [[Black Sea]] Greek cities, and gained a fleet that they used to launch raids along the northern [[Black Sea]] and as far as Greece and [[Asia Minor]]. These invasions began in the reign of [[Gallienus]] (260-268 AD), and continued until at least 269 during the reign of [[Claudius Gothicus|Marcus Aurelius Claudius]], who subsequently took up the title \"Gothicus\" due to his victory.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=55-66}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=322-327}}\n\nIn 267, Heruli (\u0391\u1f34\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9) commanded a naval attack from the Sea of Azov, past the Danube delta, and into the straits of the [[Bosphorus]] where they took control of [[Byzantion]] and [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Chrysopolis]], both near Constantinople itself. They then retreated to the Black sea, before returning, raiding [[Cyzicus]] and then entering the Aegean sea where they troubled [[Lemnos]], [[Skyros]] and [[Imbros]], before landing near [[Sparta]] and plundering the [[Peloponnese]], including not only Sparta, but also [[Corinth]], [[Argos]], and the sanctuary of Zeus at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Still within 267 they reached [[Athens]], where local militias had to defend the city. It seems to have been the Heruli specifically who [[Sack of Athens (267 AD)|sacked]] Athens despite the construction of a new wall, during [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]]\u2019s reign only a generation earlier. This was the occasion for a famous defense made by [[Dexippus]], whose writings were a source for later historians.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=58-60}}\n\nFurther north, in 268, Gallienus defeated Heruli at the [[Nestos (river)|river Nestos]] using a new mobile cavalry, but as part of the surrender a Herulian chief named Naulobatus became the first barbarian known from written records to receive [[imperial insignia]] from the Romans, gaining the rank of a [[Roman consul]]. It is highly likely that these defeated Heruli were then made part of the Roman military.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=324}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=62}}\n\nRecent researchers such as Steinacher now have increased confidence that there was a distinct second campaign which began in 269, and ended in 270.<ref>Also see {{harvtxt|Zahariade|2010}}.</ref> Later Roman writers reported that thousands of ships left from the mouth of the [[Dnieper]], manned by a large force of various different Scythian peoples, including [[Peucini|Peuci]], [[Greutungi]], [[Ostrogoths|Austrogothi]], [[Tervingi]], [[Vesi]], [[Gepids]], [[Celts]], and Heruli. These forces divided into two parts in the [[Hellespont]]. One force attacked [[Thessaloniki]], and against this group the Romans, led by Claudius now, had a major victory at the [[Battle of Naissus]] ([[Ni\u0161]], [[Serbia]]) in 269. This was apparently a distinct battle from that at the Nessos. A Herulian chieftain named Andonnoballus is said to have switched to the Roman side, and this was once again a case where Heruli appear to have joined the Roman military. The second group sailed south and raided [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], and [[Cyprus]] and many Goths and Heruli managed to return safely to harbor in the [[Crimea]]. Lesser attacks continued until 276.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=63-65}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=326-327}}\n\nThe Heruli are believed to have formed part of the [[Chernyakhov culture]],{{sfn|Green|2000|p=1}} which, although dominated the Goths and other Germanic peoples,<ref name=\"Heather_Chernyakhov\">{{harvnb|Heather|1994|p=87}}. \"[S]ome of the territory covered by the S\u00eentana de Mure\u015f\u2013\u010cernjachov culture may have been controlled not by Goths but by related Germanic peoples, such as the Heruli.\"</ref> also included [[Bastarnae]], [[Dacians]] and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=137}} The Heruli are thus archaeologically indistinguishable from the Goths.{{sfn|Green|2000|p=1}}{{sfn|Heather|1994|p=87}}\n\nJordanes reports that the Heruli in the late 4th century AD were conquered by [[Ermanaric]], king of the [[Greuthungi]]an Goths.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=77-80}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|331-333}}{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (116)}} Ermanaric's realm may also have included [[Baltic Finns|Finns]], [[Slavs]], [[Alans]] and [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=137}} Before being conquered by Ermanaric, Jordanes says that the Heruli were lead by their king Alaric.{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (116)}} [[Herwig Wolfram]] has suggested that the future [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]] may have been named after this Herulian king.{{sfn|Heather|1994|p=33}}\n\n===The \"western\" Heruli, soldiers and pirates===\n\n[[File:Heruli seniores shield pattern.svg|right|thumb|The shield pattern of the ''[[Heruli seniores]]'', a [[Late Roman military]] unit composed of Heruli.]]\nThe proposal that there may have been a Western kingdom of Heruli has posed a problem for scholars. This question arises because of the evidence of Heruli activity in the western Roman empire. The existence of this western kingdom is increasingly doubted.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=328}} \n\nHeruli were already seen in western Europe before the empire of Attila, at the time of their first ambitious campaigns in the east. In 268 [[Claudius Mamertinus]] reported the victory of [[Maximian]] over a group of Heruli and Chaibones (known only from this one report{{efn|The Chaibones may have been [[Aviones]], according to Neumann, ''Namenstudien zum Altgermanischen'', p. 316.}}) attacking Gaul. \n\nIt is believed that it was from this time that the Romans instituted a Herulian auxiliary unit, the ''Heruli seniores'', who were stationed in northern Italy. This ''numerus Erulorum'' was a lightly-equipped unit often associated with the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an ''Batavi seniores''. In 366 the Batavians and Heruli fought against [[Alamanni]] near the Rhine, under the leadership of [[Charietto]] who died in the battle, and then against [[Picts]] and [[Scoti]] in Britain. They were subsequently sent to fight [[Parthia]]ns in the east.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=67}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=326-327}}\n\nIn 405 or 406, a large number of barbarian groups [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed the Rhine]], entering the Roman empire, and the Heruli appear in the list of peoples given by the historian [[Jerome]]. However this list is sometimes thought to have drawn on historical lists for literary effect. \n\nLater mentions of Heruli in western incidents where they were not clearly connected to the Roman military include two sea raids in northern Spain in the 450s, and the presence of Heruli at the Visigothic court of [[Euric]] in about 475.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}} The raids were reported by [[Hydatius]]. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] mentions Heruli at the Visigothic court in 476, although this is in a poetic letter (.}} Recent scholars such as Steinacher and Halsall have pointed out that this type of evidence is consistent with the internal military conflicts that were happening in the Roman empire during this period. Halsall for example writes that it \"must at least be a possibility that their raid constituted part of a Romano-Visigothic offensive against the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Sueves]]\" who had been part of an invasion of the same area.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=260}} Steinacher demonstrates using examples from the period, including Charietto's life story, that barbarian soldiers could switch from being Roman soldier, to pirate, and back to soldier.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=69-73}} \n\nThe Greek poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] specifically imagined the Heruli he saw at Euric's court as Oceanic sea-farers, but Steinacher argues that this raiding by sea was simply a logical strategy for Visigothic campaigns against the Iberian Suevi, and difficult to use as a proof that the Heruli had a coastal kingdom somewhere in the north.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=74}}<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/sidonius_letters_08book8.htm Letters 8.9]</ref>\n{{quote|In reality, there is nothing special about attacks from the sea: various marauders employed such tactics at various points in history. It is just easier and not too dangerous.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=330}}}}\nGiven the writing style of Sidonius this reference could also be \"nothing more than a bookish reference to third-century accounts of Herules attacking from the sea\".{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=329}}\n\n===Kingdom on the Middle Danube===\n[[File:Huns450.png|thumb|upright=1|Territory under Hunnic control in 450 AD]]\n\nIn the early 5th century AD, large groups of peoples left the [[Middle Danube]] region, including the groups who crossed the Rhine in 405, many of eventually reached Iberia, and also the forces of [[Radagaisus]] who invaded Italy. During this period, the Huns and their allies begin to be found in this same area instead, having crossed the [[Carpathians]] from the east.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=Ch.5}} By 450 AD, the Heruli were firmly part of the Hunnic empire of [[Attila]]. The Gepids, Rugi, [[Scirii]] and many Goths, Alans and Sarmatians were also part of Attila's empire.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=208}}\n\nAfter the death of Attila, his sons and their Ostrogoth allies lost power over the various peoples of his empire at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454. The centre of this alliance was now settled upon the Roman border north of the [[Middle Danube]]. Heruli on the winning side with the [[Gepids]] were subsequently among the several peoples now able to form a kingdom in that area. The losing Ostrogothic forces moved into the Balkans, under Byzantine influence.\n\nCompared to other Middle Danubian kingdoms in this period, Peter Heather has described this Heruli kingdom as \"middle-sized\", similar to the [[Rugii|Rugian]] one, but \"clearly not as militarily powerful, say, as the Gothic, Lombard, or Gepid confederations which generated much longer-lived political entities, and into which elements of the Rugi and Heruli were eventually absorbed\".{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=242}}\n\nThe Herulian kingdom, apparently under a king named [[Rodulf_(petty_king)#King_of_the_Heruls|Rodulph]], was established north of modern [[Vienna]] and [[Bratislava]], near the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] river, and possibly extending as far east as the [[Little Carpathians]]. They ruled over a mixed population including Suevi, Huns and Alans. From this region they pushed westwards, on one occasion attacking [[Passau]], and eventually established control on the Roman (south) side of the Danube, north of [[Lake Balaton]] in modern Hungary. They do not appear in early lists of Odoacer's allies after Nedao, but they were apparently able to take over the kingdoms of the Suevi and Scirii, who had been under pressure from the Ostrogoths, who continued to press their old allies from the Balkans. [[Odoacer]], the commander of the Imperial [[foederati]] troops who deposed the last [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]] in 476 AD came to be seen as king over several of the Danubian peoples including the Heruli, and the Heruli were strongly associated with his Italian kingdom. The Heruli on the Danube took control of the Rugian territories, who had become competitors to Odoacer and been defeated by him in 488. However Heruli suffered badly in Italy, as loyalists of Odoacer when he was defeated by the Ostrogoth [[Theoderic]]. By 500 the Herulian kingdom on the Danube had made peace with Theoderic and become his allies.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=338-345}} [[Paul the Deacon]] also mentions Heruli living in Italy under Ostrogothic rule.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=347}} Peter Heather estimates that the Herulian kingdom could muster an army of 5,000-10,000 men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=251}}\n\n[[File:Southeastern Europe in 520, showing the Byzantine Empire under Justin I and the Ostrogothic kingdom.png|thumb|Polities in southeastern Europe c.520 AD before the Lombard destruction of the Herulian 'kingdom']]\nTheoderic's efforts to build a system of alliances in Western Europe were made difficult both by counter diplomacy, for example between [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] [[Franks]] and the [[Byzantine empire]], and also the arrival of a new Germanic people into the Danubian region, the [[Lombards]]. The Herulian king Rodulph lost his kingdom to the Lombards at some point between 494 and 508.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=366}}\n\n===Later history===\nAfter the Middle Danubian Herulian kingdom was destroyed by the [[Lombards]] in or before 508, Herulian fortunes waned. According to [[Procopius]], in 512 a group including royalty went north and settled in [[Thule]], which for Procopius meant Scandinavia.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|pp=205-209}} Procopius noted that these Heruli first traversed the lands of the [[Slavs]], then empty lands, and then the lands of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], until finally settling down nearby the [[Geats]].{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=430}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book VI#XV|Book VI, XV]]</ref> Peter Heather considers this account to be \"entirely plausible\" although he notes that others have labelled it a \"fairy story\", and given that it only appears in one source it is possible to deny its validity.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=242}} \n\nAnother Heruli group were assigned civil and military offices by [[Theoderic the Great]] in [[Pavia]] in north Italy.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=144}}\n\nWhat happened to the main part of the Danubian Heruli has been difficult to reconstruct from Procopius, but according to Steinacher they first moved downstream on the Danube to an area where the Rugii had sought refuge in 488. Here they suffered famine. They sought refuge among the Gepids, but wanting to avoid being mistreated by them crossed the Danube came under East Roman authority.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=350}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=144-145}} \n\n[[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius Caesar]] allowed them to resettle depopulated \"lands and cities\" in the empire in 512. Modern scholars debate whether they were moved then to [[Singidunum]] (modern [[Belgrade]]), or first to [[Bassianae]], and to Singidunum some decades later, by Justinian.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=369}} This area had been re-acquired by the empire from the Goths, who now ruled Italy from Ravenna.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=350-351}} Justinian integrated them into the empire as a buffer between the Romans and the more independent Lombards and Gepids to the north. Under his encouragement, the Herule king Grepes converted to Orthodox Christianity in 528 together with some nobles and twelve relatives.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=351-352}} Procopius who felt that this made them somewhat gentler, also showed in his account of the wars against the African Vandals, that some of them were [[Arianism|Arian]] christians.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}}\n\nThe Heruli were often mentioned during the times of [[Justinian]], who used them in his extensive military campaigns in many countries including [[Italy]], [[Syria]], and North [[Africa]]. [[Pharas the Herulian|Pharas]] was a notable Herulian commander during this period. Several thousand Heruli served in the personal guard of [[Belisarius]] throughout the campaigns, and [[Narses]] also recruited from them. They were a participant in the [[Byzantine-Sasanian wars]], such as the [[Battle of Anglon]].\n\nGrepes and most of his family had apparently died by the early 540s, possibly in the [[Plague of Justinian]] (541-542).{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=147}} [[Procopius]] related that in the 540s the Heruli who had been settled in the Roman Balkans killed their own king Ochus and, not wanting the one assigned by the emperor, Suartuas, they made contact with the Heruli who had gone to Thule decades earlier, seeking a new king. Their request was granted, and a new king Datius arrived with his brother Aordus and 200 young men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=225}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}} The Heruli who were sent against Suartuas defected with him and were supported by the empire. The supporters of Datius, two thirds of the Heruli, submitted to the Gepids.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}} This period of rebellion against Rome lasted approximately 545-548, the period immediately before conflict between their larger neighbours the Gepids and Lombards broke out, but this rebellion was repressed by Justinian.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|pp=393-397}}\n \nIn 549, when the Gepids fought the Romans, and Heruli fought on both sides.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=394}} In any case after one generation in the Belgrade area, the Herulian federate polity in the Balkans disappears from the surviving historical records, apparently replaced by the incoming [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]].{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}}\n\nPeter Heather has written that: \n{{quote|by c.540 being a Herule had ceased to be the main determinant of individual behaviour; the Heruli had ceased to operate together on the basis of that shared heritage, and different Heruli were adopting different strategies for survival in the new political conditions which even caused them to fight on opposing sides. After c.540, we still find small groups called Heruli fighting for the East Romans in Italy, and it is noticeable that the Roman commanders were careful to appoint for them leaders of their own race. Thus some sense of identity probably remained. That said, we are clearly dealing with a few fragments of the original group, and, in the prevailing circumstances, Herule identity had no future.{{sfn|Heather|1998|p=109}}}}\n\nSarantis however shows that the Belgrade-region Heruli continued to be recruited, and to play a role in local conflicts involving the Gepids and Lombards, into the 550s. Suartas, a Herule general for the Romans, led Herule forces against the Gepids in 552 for example.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=385}} However it appears that by this period the semi-independent Heruli near Belgrade became Roman provincials.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=402}}\n\nIn 566, Sinduald, a Herule military leader under Narses, was declared a king of Heruli in [[Trentino]] in northern Italy, but he was executed by Narses. Sinduald was said to be a descendant of the Herules who had already entered Italy under Odoacer.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=355}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=159}}\n\n[[Paul the Deacon]] writes that many Heruli joined the Lombard king [[Alboin]] in their eventual conquest of Italy from the empire in the late 6th century AD.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=240}}\n\nAlong with the Rugii and Scirii, the Heruli may have contributed to the formation of the [[Bavarii]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=321}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Religion===\nThe early religion of the Heruli is vividly described by Procopius in his ''[[:wikisource:History of the Wars|History of the Wars]]''. He describes them as a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] society known to practice [[human sacrifice]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book VI#XIV|Book VI, XIV]]</ref> The Heruli appears to have been worshippers of [[Odin]], and might have been responsible for the spread of such worship to [[Northern Europe]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}} \n\nBy the time of Justinian, Procopius reports that many Heruli had become [[Arian]] Christians. In any case, Justinian appears to have pursued a policy of attempting to convert them to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]].{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}} \n\n===Society===\nProcopius writes that the Heruli practiced a form of [[senicide]], having a non-relative kill the sick and elderly and burning the remains on a wooden [[pyre]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> Following the death of their husbands, Herulian women were expected to commit suicide by hanging.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> \n\nProcopius also claims that the Heruli practiced [[homosexuality]].<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/>{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} It appears that Procopius disliked the Heruli and wanted to present them in an as negative light as possible. His description of homosexuality among the Heruli might therefore be untrue.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}}\n\n===Warfare===\nDescribed the Heruli were famous for the quality of their infantry, who were recruited as mercenaries by all other peoples.{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (117-118)}} They were known particularly for their speed, and were perhaps used for the stabbing cavalry.{{sfn|Speidel|2004|p=136}} Procopius described the Heruli in battle against Persians, carrying no protective armor save a shield and thick jacket.{{sfn|Steinacher|p=353}}{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_II_XXV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book II#XXV|Book II, XXV]]</ref> This form of warfare has been compared to that of the [[berserker]]s of the [[Viking Age]].{{sfn|Speidel|2004|pp=58-61}}\n\nHerulian slaves are known to have accompanied them into combat. Slaves were forbidden from donning a shield until having proven themselves brave on the battlefield. This practice might be a relic of ancient [[Indo-European culture|Indo-European]] tradition.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} Steinacher has pointed out, that while this remark has reasonably been seen as evidence of an \"initiation rite\", initiation rites are so common that caution is required:\n{{quote|It is of course far from clear exactly what Procopius had in mind when writing about Herul 'slaves'. But he surely provided plenty of evidence that any gens was open to newcomers. As in any other human community, both in the past and in the present, such newcomers had to prove themselves worthy before receiving full membership in that community. This must have been even truer for a community geared towards warfare.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=360}}}}\n\n===Material culture===\nThe [[tumuli]] of the Heruli on the Middle Danube in the early 6th century are very similar to contemporary tumuli built in southern [[Sweden]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}} At this time, the Heruli appears to have had close trade relations with peoples living near the [[Baltic Sea]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}}\n\n===Possible connection to Runic===\nThe Heruli have sometimes been credited with inventing the [[Runic]] script.{{sfn|Murdoch|Read|2004|p=138}} It has been suggested that the Heruli brought the Runic script to Northern Europe.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\nIn ''[[Getica]]'', Jordanes writes that the Heruli claimed to be the [[human height|tallest]] people of [[Scandza]]. Jordanes further writes that all the peoples of Scandza \"surpassed the Germans in size and spirit\".{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=III (23)}} [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] wrote that the Heruli had [[blue eyes|blue]]-[[grey eyes|grey]] eyes.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=423}}\n\n==The negative excursus of Procopius==\nScholars remark that the historian Procopius had a notable fascination with the Herules, which colors his descriptions of them. As Steinacher remarks \"Procopius's Herul excursus [...] is full of stereotypes and negative attitudes towards this primitive people and its archaic conventions\".{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=349}} This means that caution is required when using his descriptions as evidence. In the words of [[Walter Goffart]]:\n{{quote|Though appreciative of their military qualities, he goes out of his way to blacken their character - \"they are the basest of all men and utterly abandoned rascals,\" \"no men in the world are less bound by convention or more unstable.\" His low opinion may result from the \"special relationship\" the Herules appear to have had with Justinian's eunuch general, [[Narses]], who Procopius disliked.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|pp=206-207}}</ref>}}\nAlthough Procopius praised the Herule named Pharas who brought about the surrender of the north African Vandal king [[Gelimer]], he noted that ''despite'' being born a Herule, he did not drink excessively and was not unreliable.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=168}}\n{{quote|Procopius was not mollified. The Herules were part of the panorama of an entire \"West\" that, owing to Justinian's neglect, had come into the possession of the barbarians by the late 540s. [...] The crowning irony, in the historian's view, was that, because some Herules served as Roman ''foederati'', they both plundered Roman subjects and collected pay from the Roman emperor.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=208}}</ref>}}\n\n==Cities sacked by the Heruli==\n*[[Athens]]\n*[[Byzantium]]\n*[[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]]\n*[[Lemnos]]\n*[[Skyros]]\n*[[Sparta]]\n*[[Corinth]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[J\u00e4rsberg Runestone]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Ancient sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Jordanes |author-link=Jordanes |translator-last1=Mierow |translator-first1=Charles C. |translator-link1=Charles Christopher Mierow |year=1908 |chapter= |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |title=The Origins and Deeds of the Goths |url=https://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html |series= |language= |volume= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |page= |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |subscription= |quote= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Procopius |author-link=Procopius |translator-last1=Dewing |translator-first1=Henry Bronson |translator-link1= |year=1914 |chapter= |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |title=History of the Wars |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Wars |series= |language= |volume= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] |page= |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |subscription= |quote= |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Modern sources==\n{{Refbegin|3}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Angelov |first1=Alexander |author-link1= |date=2018 |year= |orig-year= |chapter=Heruli |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001/acref-9780198662778-e-2225 |editor1-last=Nicholson |editor1-first=Oliver |editor1-link= |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A09WDwAAQBAJ |url-status= |format= |type= |series= |language= |volume= |issue= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=678 |pages= |doi=10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001 |isbn=9780191744457 |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=January 25, 2020 |via= |subscription= |quote= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bremmer |first=Jan |author-link=Jan N.

Possibly originating in [[Scandinavia]], the Heruli are first mentioned by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors as one of several \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" groups raiding Roman provinces in the Balkans and Aegean, attacking by land, and notably also by sea. During this time they reportedly lived near the [[Sea of Azov]]. \n\nFrom the 4th century AD the Heruli were one of the peoples dominated by the empire of [[Attila]] the Hun. After the death of [[Attila]] in 454, they established their own kingdom on the [[Middle Danube]], and participated in successive conquests of [[Italy]] by [[Odoacer]], [[Theoderic the Great]], [[Narses]] and probably also the [[Lombards]]. Their independent kingdom was however destroyed by the [[Lombards]] in the early 6th century AD. A part of this population subsequently became established inside the Roman empire near [[Belgrade]], and continued contributing fighting men to the [[Eastern Roman empire]], and participating in Balkan and Italian conflicts.\n\nWith their last kingdom eventually dominated by Rome, and smaller groups integrated into larger political entities, the Heruli disappeared from history around the time of the conquest of Italy by the Lombards.\n\n==Name==\nThe name of the Heruli is sometimes spelled as Heruls, Herules, Herulians or Eruli.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=388}}\n\nThe name Heruli was often written in Greek and Latin with no \"h\", and is sometimes thought to be Germanic and related to the English word ''[[earl]]'' (see [[erilaz]]) implying that it was an honorific military title.{{sfn|Neumann|1999|p=468}} There is even speculation that the Heruli were not a normal tribal group but a brotherhood of mobile warriors, though there is no consensus for this old proposal, which is based only on the name etymology and the reputation of Heruli as soldiers.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=359-360}}\n\n==Language==\nThe Heruli are believed to have been [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking.<ref name=\"Heather_Germanic-speaking\">{{harvnb|Heather|2007|p=469}}. \"Heruli \u2013 Germanic-speaking group originally from north central Europe, some of whom migrated to regions north of the Black Sea in company with Goths and others in the third century.\"</ref> Personal names provide important evidence on the language of the Heruli.{{sfn|Taylor|1999|pp=468-469}} A large number of Heruli names are attested, and many of these are certainly [[Germanic name|Germanic]],<ref name=\"Maenchen-Helfen_837\">{{harvnb|Maenchen-Helfen|1947|pp=837-838}}. \"[[:de:Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld|Sch\u00f6nfeld]]... offers Germanic etymologies not only for Faras and Alvith but also for Fanotheus, Filimuth, Hariso, Sindval, Svartva, Uligangus, and Visandus.

Other Germanic peoples, such as the [[Rugii]] and the Goths, are believed to have carried out a similar migration at this time. These peoples replaced the [[Sarmatians]] as the dominant power north of the Black Sea. The Sarmatians had in the 1st century AD replaced the [[Bastarnae]], who are believed to have been a Germanic people. The arrival of the Heruli has been seen as part of a bigger cultural shift in this region, involving the migration from the northwest of Germanic peoples, who replaced the Sarmatians as the dominant power in the region.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=116}}\n\nThe first relatively clear mention of the Heruli by Graeco-Roman writers concerns two major campaigns into the Balkans of 267/268 and 269/270.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=124}} Goths, Heruli (sometimes referred to as \"Eluri\", \u1f1c\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, in this context), and other \"Scythian\" peoples from the region of the Sea of Azov, took control of [[Black Sea]] Greek cities, and gained a fleet that they used to launch raids along the northern [[Black Sea]] and as far as Greece and [[Asia Minor]]. These invasions began in the reign of [[Gallienus]] (260-268 AD), and continued until at least 269 during the reign of [[Claudius Gothicus|Marcus Aurelius Claudius]], who subsequently took up the title \"Gothicus\" due to his victory.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=55-66}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=322-327}}\n\nIn 267, Heruli (\u0391\u1f34\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9) commanded a naval attack from the Sea of Azov, past the Danube delta, and into the straits of the [[Bosphorus]] where they took control of [[Byzantion]] and [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Chrysopolis]], both near Constantinople itself. They then retreated to the Black sea, before returning, raiding [[Cyzicus]] and then entering the Aegean sea where they troubled [[Lemnos]], [[Skyros]] and [[Imbros]], before landing near [[Sparta]] and plundering the [[Peloponnese]], including not only Sparta, but also [[Corinth]], [[Argos]], and the sanctuary of Zeus at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Still within 267 they reached [[Athens]], where local militias had to defend the city. It seems to have been the Heruli specifically who [[Sack of Athens (267 AD)|sacked]] Athens despite the construction of a new wall, during [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]]\u2019s reign only a generation earlier. This was the occasion for a famous defense made by [[Dexippus]], whose writings were a source for later historians.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=58-60}}\n\nFurther north, in 268, Gallienus defeated Heruli at the [[Nestos (river)|river Nestos]] using a new mobile cavalry, but as part of the surrender a Herulian chief named Naulobatus became the first barbarian known from written records to receive [[imperial insignia]] from the Romans, gaining the rank of a [[Roman consul]]. It is highly likely that these defeated Heruli were then made part of the Roman military.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=324}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=62}}\n\nRecent researchers such as Steinacher now have increased confidence that there was a distinct second campaign which began in 269, and ended in 270.<ref>Also see {{harvtxt|Zahariade|2010}}.</ref> Later Roman writers reported that thousands of ships left from the mouth of the [[Dnieper]], manned by a large force of various different Scythian peoples, including [[Peucini|Peuci]], [[Greutungi]], [[Ostrogoths|Austrogothi]], [[Tervingi]], [[Vesi]], [[Gepids]], [[Celts]], and Heruli. These forces divided into two parts in the [[Hellespont]]. One force attacked [[Thessaloniki]], and against this group the Romans, led by Claudius now, had a major victory at the [[Battle of Naissus]] ([[Ni\u0161]], [[Serbia]]) in 269. This was apparently a distinct battle from that at the Nessos. A Herulian chieftain named Andonnoballus is said to have switched to the Roman side, and this was once again a case where Heruli appear to have joined the Roman military. The second group sailed south and raided [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], and [[Cyprus]] and many Goths and Heruli managed to return safely to harbor in the [[Crimea]]. Lesser attacks continued until 276.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=63-65}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=326-327}}\n\nThe Heruli are believed to have formed part of the [[Chernyakhov culture]],{{sfn|Green|2000|p=1}} which, although dominated the Goths and other Germanic peoples,<ref name=\"Heather_Chernyakhov\">{{harvnb|Heather|1994|p=87}}. \"[S]ome of the territory covered by the S\u00eentana de Mure\u015f\u2013\u010cernjachov culture may have been controlled not by Goths but by related Germanic peoples, such as the Heruli.\"</ref> also included [[Bastarnae]], [[Dacians]] and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=137}} The Heruli are thus archaeologically indistinguishable from the Goths.{{sfn|Green|2000|p=1}}{{sfn|Heather|1994|p=87}}\n\nJordanes reports that the Heruli in the late 4th century AD were conquered by [[Ermanaric]], king of the [[Greuthungi]]an Goths.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=77-80}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|331-333}}{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (116)}} Ermanaric's realm may also have included [[Baltic Finns|Finns]], [[Slavs]], [[Alans]] and [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=137}} Before being conquered by Ermanaric, Jordanes says that the Heruli were lead by their king Alaric.{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (116)}} [[Herwig Wolfram]] has suggested that the future [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]] may have been named after this Herulian king.{{sfn|Heather|1994|p=33}}\n\n===The \"western\" Heruli, soldiers and pirates===\n\n[[File:Heruli seniores shield pattern.svg|right|thumb|The shield pattern of the ''[[Heruli seniores]]'', a [[Late Roman military]] unit composed of Heruli.]]\nThe proposal that there may have been a Western kingdom of Heruli has posed a problem for scholars. This question arises because of the evidence of Heruli activity in the western Roman empire. The existence of this western kingdom is increasingly doubted.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=328}} \n\nHeruli were already seen in western Europe before the empire of Attila, at the time of their first ambitious campaigns in the east. In 268 [[Claudius Mamertinus]] reported the victory of [[Maximian]] over a group of Heruli and Chaibones (known only from this one report{{efn|The Chaibones may have been [[Aviones]], according to Neumann, ''Namenstudien zum Altgermanischen'', p. 316.}}) attacking Gaul. \n\nIt is believed that it was from this time that the Romans instituted a Herulian auxiliary unit, the ''Heruli seniores'', who were stationed in northern Italy. This ''numerus Erulorum'' was a lightly-equipped unit often associated with the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an ''Batavi seniores''. In 366 the Batavians and Heruli fought against [[Alamanni]] near the Rhine, under the leadership of [[Charietto]] who died in the battle, and then against [[Picts]] and [[Scoti]] in Britain. They were subsequently sent to fight [[Parthia]]ns in the east.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=67}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=326-327}}\n\nIn 405 or 406, a large number of barbarian groups [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed the Rhine]], entering the Roman empire, and the Heruli appear in the list of peoples given by the historian [[Jerome]]. However this list is sometimes thought to have drawn on historical lists for literary effect. \n\nLater mentions of Heruli in western incidents where they were not clearly connected to the Roman military include two sea raids in northern Spain in the 450s, and the presence of Heruli at the Visigothic court of [[Euric]] in about 475.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}} The raids were reported by [[Hydatius]]. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] mentions Heruli at the Visigothic court in 476, although this is in a poetic letter (.}} Recent scholars such as Steinacher and Halsall have pointed out that this type of evidence is consistent with the internal military conflicts that were happening in the Roman empire during this period. Halsall for example writes that it \"must at least be a possibility that their raid constituted part of a Romano-Visigothic offensive against the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Sueves]]\" who had been part of an invasion of the same area.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=260}} Steinacher demonstrates using examples from the period, including Charietto's life story, that barbarian soldiers could switch from being Roman soldier, to pirate, and back to soldier.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=69-73}} \n\nThe Greek poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] specifically imagined the Heruli he saw at Euric's court as Oceanic sea-farers, but Steinacher argues that this raiding by sea was simply a logical strategy for Visigothic campaigns against the Iberian Suevi, and difficult to use as a proof that the Heruli had a coastal kingdom somewhere in the north.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=74}}<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/sidonius_letters_08book8.htm Letters 8.9]</ref>\n{{quote|In reality, there is nothing special about attacks from the sea: various marauders employed such tactics at various points in history. It is just easier and not too dangerous.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=330}}}}\nGiven the writing style of Sidonius this reference could also be \"nothing more than a bookish reference to third-century accounts of Herules attacking from the sea\".{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=329}}\n\n===Kingdom on the Middle Danube===\n[[File:Huns450.png|thumb|upright=1|Territory under Hunnic control in 450 AD]]\n\nIn the early 5th century AD, large groups of peoples left the [[Middle Danube]] region, including the groups who crossed the Rhine in 405, many of eventually reached Iberia, and also the forces of [[Radagaisus]] who invaded Italy. During this period, the Huns and their allies begin to be found in this same area instead, having crossed the [[Carpathians]] from the east.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=Ch.5}} By 450 AD, the Heruli were firmly part of the Hunnic empire of [[Attila]]. The Gepids, Rugi, [[Scirii]] and many Goths, Alans and Sarmatians were also part of Attila's empire.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=208}}\n\nAfter the death of Attila, his sons and their Ostrogoth allies lost power over the various peoples of his empire at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454. The centre of this alliance was now settled upon the Roman border north of the [[Middle Danube]]. Heruli on the winning side with the [[Gepids]] were subsequently among the several peoples now able to form a kingdom in that area. The losing Ostrogothic forces moved into the Balkans, under Byzantine influence.\n\nCompared to other Middle Danubian kingdoms in this period, Peter Heather has described this Heruli kingdom as \"middle-sized\", similar to the [[Rugii|Rugian]] one, but \"clearly not as militarily powerful, say, as the Gothic, Lombard, or Gepid confederations which generated much longer-lived political entities, and into which elements of the Rugi and Heruli were eventually absorbed\".{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=242}}\n\nThe Herulian kingdom, apparently under a king named [[Rodulf_(petty_king)#King_of_the_Heruls|Rodulph]], was established north of modern [[Vienna]] and [[Bratislava]], near the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] river, and possibly extending as far east as the [[Little Carpathians]]. They ruled over a mixed population including Suevi, Huns and Alans. From this region they pushed westwards, on one occasion attacking [[Passau]], and eventually established control on the Roman (south) side of the Danube, north of [[Lake Balaton]] in modern Hungary. They do not appear in early lists of Odoacer's allies after Nedao, but they were apparently able to take over the kingdoms of the Suevi and Scirii, who had been under pressure from the Ostrogoths, who continued to press their old allies from the Balkans. [[Odoacer]], the commander of the Imperial [[foederati]] troops who deposed the last [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]] in 476 AD came to be seen as king over several of the Danubian peoples including the Heruli, and the Heruli were strongly associated with his Italian kingdom. The Heruli on the Danube took control of the Rugian territories, who had become competitors to Odoacer and been defeated by him in 488. However Heruli suffered badly in Italy, as loyalists of Odoacer when he was defeated by the Ostrogoth [[Theoderic]]. By 500 the Herulian kingdom on the Danube had made peace with Theoderic and become his allies.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=338-345}} [[Paul the Deacon]] also mentions Heruli living in Italy under Ostrogothic rule.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=347}} Peter Heather estimates that the Herulian kingdom could muster an army of 5,000-10,000 men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=251}}\n\n[[File:Southeastern Europe in 520, showing the Byzantine Empire under Justin I and the Ostrogothic kingdom.png|thumb|Polities in southeastern Europe c.520 AD before the Lombard destruction of the Herulian 'kingdom']]\nTheoderic's efforts to build a system of alliances in Western Europe were made difficult both by counter diplomacy, for example between [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] [[Franks]] and the [[Byzantine empire]], and also the arrival of a new Germanic people into the Danubian region, the [[Lombards]]. The Herulian king Rodulph lost his kingdom to the Lombards at some point between 494 and 508.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=366}}\n\n===Later history===\nAfter the Middle Danubian Herulian kingdom was destroyed by the [[Lombards]] in or before 508, Herulian fortunes waned. According to [[Procopius]], in 512 a group including royalty went north and settled in [[Thule]], which for Procopius meant Scandinavia.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|pp=205-209}} Procopius noted that these Heruli first traversed the lands of the [[Slavs]], then empty lands, and then the lands of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], until finally settling down nearby the [[Geats]].{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=430}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book VI#XV|Book VI, XV]]</ref> Peter Heather considers this account to be \"entirely plausible\" although he notes that others have labelled it a \"fairy story\", and given that it only appears in one source it is possible to deny its validity.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=242}} \n\nAnother Heruli group were assigned civil and military offices by [[Theoderic the Great]] in [[Pavia]] in north Italy.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=144}}\n\nWhat happened to the main part of the Danubian Heruli has been difficult to reconstruct from Procopius, but according to Steinacher they first moved downstream on the Danube to an area where the Rugii had sought refuge in 488, where they suffered famine. They sought refuge among the Gepids, but wanting to avoid being mistreated by them crossed the Danube came under East Roman authority.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=350}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=144-145}} \n\n[[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius Caesar]] allowed them to resettle depopulated \"lands and cities\" in the empire in 512. Modern scholars debate whether they were moved then to [[Singidunum]] (modern [[Belgrade]]), or first to [[Bassianae]], and to Singidunum some decades later, by Justinian.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=369}} This area had been re-acquired by the empire from the Goths, who now ruled Italy from Ravenna.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=350-351}} Justinian integrated them into the empire as a buffer between the Romans and the more independent Lombards and Gepids to the north. Under his encouragement, the Herule king Grepes converted to Orthodox Christianity in 528 together with some nobles and twelve relatives.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=351-352}} Procopius who felt that this made them somewhat gentler, also showed in his account of the wars against the African Vandals, that some of them were [[Arianism|Arian]] christians.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}}\n\nThe Heruli were often mentioned during the times of [[Justinian]], who used them in his extensive military campaigns in many countries including [[Italy]], [[Syria]], and North [[Africa]]. [[Pharas the Herulian|Pharas]] was a notable Herulian commander during this period. Several thousand Heruli served in the personal guard of [[Belisarius]] throughout the campaigns, and [[Narses]] also recruited from them. They were a participant in the [[Byzantine-Sasanian wars]], such as the [[Battle of Anglon]].\n\nGrepes and most of his family had apparently died by the early 540s, possibly in the [[Plague of Justinian]] (541-542).{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=147}} [[Procopius]] related that in the 540s the Heruli who had been settled in the Roman Balkans killed their own king Ochus and, not wanting the one assigned by the emperor, Suartuas, they made contact with the Heruli who had gone to Thule decades earlier, seeking a new king. Their request was granted, and a new king Datius arrived with his brother Aordus and 200 young men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=225}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}} The Heruli who were sent against Suartuas defected with him and were supported by the empire. The supporters of Datius, two thirds of the Heruli, submitted to the Gepids.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}} This period of rebellion against Rome lasted approximately 545-548, the period immediately before conflict between their larger neighbours the Gepids and Lombards broke out, but this rebellion was repressed by Justinian.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|pp=393-397}}\n \nIn 549, when the Gepids fought the Romans, and Heruli fought on both sides.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=394}} In any case after one generation in the Belgrade area, the Herulian federate polity in the Balkans disappears from the surviving historical records, apparently replaced by the incoming [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]].{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}}\n\nPeter Heather has written that: \n{{quote|by c.540 being a Herule had ceased to be the main determinant of individual behaviour; the Heruli had ceased to operate together on the basis of that shared heritage, and different Heruli were adopting different strategies for survival in the new political conditions which even caused them to fight on opposing sides. After c.540, we still find small groups called Heruli fighting for the East Romans in Italy, and it is noticeable that the Roman commanders were careful to appoint for them leaders of their own race. Thus some sense of identity probably remained. That said, we are clearly dealing with a few fragments of the original group, and, in the prevailing circumstances, Herule identity had no future.{{sfn|Heather|1998|p=109}}}}\n\nSarantis however shows that the Belgrade-region Heruli continued to be recruited, and to play a role in local conflicts involving the Gepids and Lombards, into the 550s. Suartas, a Herule general for the Romans, led Herule forces against the Gepids in 552 for example.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=385}} However it appears that by this period the semi-independent Heruli near Belgrade became Roman provincials.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=402}}\n\nIn 566, Sinduald, a Herule military leader under Narses, was declared a king of Heruli in [[Trentino]] in northern Italy, but he was executed by Narses. Sinduald was said to be a descendant of the Herules who had already entered Italy under Odoacer.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=355}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=159}}\n\n[[Paul the Deacon]] writes that many Heruli joined the Lombard king [[Alboin]] in their eventual conquest of Italy from the empire in the late 6th century AD.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=240}}\n\nAlong with the Rugii and Scirii, the Heruli may have contributed to the formation of the [[Bavarii]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=321}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Religion===\nThe early religion of the Heruli is vividly described by Procopius in his ''[[:wikisource:History of the Wars|History of the Wars]]''. He describes them as a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] society known to practice [[human sacrifice]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book VI#XIV|Book VI, XIV]]</ref> The Heruli appears to have been worshippers of [[Odin]], and might have been responsible for the spread of such worship to [[Northern Europe]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}} \n\nBy the time of Justinian, Procopius reports that many Heruli had become [[Arian]] Christians. In any case, Justinian appears to have pursued a policy of attempting to convert them to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]].{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}} \n\n===Society===\nProcopius writes that the Heruli practiced a form of [[senicide]], having a non-relative kill the sick and elderly and burning the remains on a wooden [[pyre]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> Following the death of their husbands, Herulian women were expected to commit suicide by hanging.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> \n\nProcopius also claims that the Heruli practiced [[homosexuality]].<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/>{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} It appears that Procopius disliked the Heruli and wanted to present them in an as negative light as possible. His description of homosexuality among the Heruli might therefore be untrue.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}}\n\n===Warfare===\nDescribed the Heruli were famous for the quality of their infantry, who were recruited as mercenaries by all other peoples.{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (117-118)}} They were known particularly for their speed, and were perhaps used for the stabbing cavalry.{{sfn|Speidel|2004|p=136}} Procopius described the Heruli in battle against Persians, carrying no protective armor save a shield and thick jacket.{{sfn|Steinacher|p=353}}{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_II_XXV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book II#XXV|Book II, XXV]]</ref> This form of warfare has been compared to that of the [[berserker]]s of the [[Viking Age]].{{sfn|Speidel|2004|pp=58-61}}\n\nHerulian slaves are known to have accompanied them into combat. Slaves were forbidden from donning a shield until having proven themselves brave on the battlefield. This practice might be a relic of ancient [[Indo-European culture|Indo-European]] tradition.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} Steinacher has pointed out, that while this remark has reasonably been seen as evidence of an \"initiation rite\", initiation rites are so common that caution is required:\n{{quote|It is of course far from clear exactly what Procopius had in mind when writing about Herul 'slaves'. But he surely provided plenty of evidence that any gens was open to newcomers. As in any other human community, both in the past and in the present, such newcomers had to prove themselves worthy before receiving full membership in that community. This must have been even truer for a community geared towards warfare.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=360}}}}\n\n===Material culture===\nThe [[tumuli]] of the Heruli on the Middle Danube in the early 6th century are very similar to contemporary tumuli built in southern [[Sweden]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}} At this time, the Heruli appears to have had close trade relations with peoples living near the [[Baltic Sea]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}}\n\n===Possible connection to Runic===\nThe Heruli have sometimes been credited with inventing the [[Runic]] script.{{sfn|Murdoch|Read|2004|p=138}} It has been suggested that the Heruli brought the Runic script to Northern Europe.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\nIn ''[[Getica]]'', Jordanes writes that the Heruli claimed to be the [[human height|tallest]] people of [[Scandza]]. Jordanes further writes that all the peoples of Scandza \"surpassed the Germans in size and spirit\".{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=III (23)}} [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] wrote that the Heruli had [[blue eyes|blue]]-[[grey eyes|grey]] eyes.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=423}}\n\n==The negative excursus of Procopius==\nScholars remark that the historian Procopius had a notable fascination with the Herules, which colors his descriptions of them. As Steinacher remarks \"Procopius's Herul excursus [...] is full of stereotypes and negative attitudes towards this primitive people and its archaic conventions\".{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=349}} This means that caution is required when using his descriptions as evidence. In the words of [[Walter Goffart]]:\n{{quote|Though appreciative of their military qualities, he goes out of his way to blacken their character - \"they are the basest of all men and utterly abandoned rascals,\" \"no men in the world are less bound by convention or more unstable.\" His low opinion may result from the \"special relationship\" the Herules appear to have had with Justinian's eunuch general, [[Narses]], who Procopius disliked.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|pp=206-207}}</ref>}}\nAlthough Procopius praised the Herule named Pharas who brought about the surrender of the north African Vandal king [[Gelimer]], he noted that ''despite'' being born a Herule, he did not drink excessively and was not unreliable.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=168}}\n{{quote|Procopius was not mollified. The Herules were part of the panorama of an entire \"West\" that, owing to Justinian's neglect, had come into the possession of the barbarians by the late 540s.

Israel was able to enter the contest as the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA) was an active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU), which is responsible for the event. Israel has won the contest four times, and has hosted the contest in [[Jerusalem]] twice in {{escyr|1979}} and {{escyr|1999}}. Israel hosted the contest for the third time in [[Tel Aviv]] in {{Escyr|2019}}.\n\nIsrael's first appearance at the contest in 1973 was successful, with [[Ilanit]] finishing fourth. Israel then achieved victories in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979]], with wins for [[Izhar Cohen]] and the [[Alphabeta]], with the song \"[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]\", and [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]], with \"[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]\". In {{escyr|1980}}, the IBA declined to host the contest<ref name=\"Eurovision1980\">[https://eurovision.tv/event/the-hague-1980 1980 Eurovision], eurovision.tv</ref> for the second successive year for financial reasons, and as the date for the contest in [[The Hague]] conflicted with [[Yom Hazikaron]] \u2013 Israeli Memorial Day \u2013 Israel did not participate. This is the only time that the winning country did not compete the following year. The country's best results in the 1980s were the second-place finishes for [[Avi Toledano]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] and [[Ofra Haza]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]. Former winner Izhar Cohen returned to place fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985]], before [[Duo Datz]] finished third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]]. Israel achieved its third victory in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]], with [[Dana International]] and \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]\". [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] then finished fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]]. As of 2019, Israel has the record for most participations and most wins in the contest without ever coming last, but it has placed second to last in the final three times, in {{escyr|1986}}, {{escyr|1993}} and {{escyr|2006}}.\n\nSince the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, Israel has failed to reach the final six times. In {{escyr|2005}}, [[Shiri Maimon]] gave the country its tenth top five result, finishing fourth. Having failed to qualify for the final for four consecutive years (2011\u201314), Israel reached the final for the first time in five years, with [[Nadav Guedj]] finishing ninth in {{escyr|2015}}, and the country has participated in the final every year since. Israel's fourth victory came when [[Netta Barzilai|Netta]] won the {{escyr|2018}} contest in [[Lisbon]], with the song \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\".\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Victories===\nTo date there have been four Israeli victories in the contest. [[Izhar Cohen]] and [[Alphabeta]] won in Paris in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] with the uptempo ''[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]''. On home ground in [[Jerusalem]] the following year, Israel won again, this time with the anthemic ''[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]'' performed by [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]]. Unusually, Israel did not defend the title in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]]<ref name=\"Eurovision1980\" /> (''see below''). The third victory came almost 20 years later in [[Birmingham]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]]. Singer [[Dana International]] took top honours with the song ''[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]'', setting off widespread celebrations in Israel. Twenty years later, Israel earned their fourth victory at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018 contest]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. The song was \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\" by [[Netta Barzilai]], which earned Israel their highest-ever score of 529 points.\n\n===Other performances===\nIsrael's earliest selections were picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]. The first singer to represent the country in 1973 was [[Ilanit]], who finished 4th. Criticism increased after she was sent again four years later, leading to a rule that the winner of the already established Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival would also represent Israel at the contest. The Eurovision Song Contest winners of 1978 and 1979 were selected by this method. From 1981 the selection process was handled by the [[Kdam Eurovision]] with the exceptions of 1990, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002\u20132004, 2006\u20132007 and 2010 where the selections were again picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]].\n\nAfter winning the contest in 1978 and 1979, the IBA was financially and logistically unable to organise the event for the second consecutive year. The organization of the festival was subsequently handed over to the Netherlands who finally agreed to stage it. Because much time had already passed, it was difficult to find a suitable date for the Song Contest. The date chosen coincided with a [[Yom Hazikaron|memorial day]] in Israel, and the country was forced to withdraw. This made Israel the only country to date unable to defend its title. The 1980 Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival therefore did not double as a national final that year unlike the last two years, and the winning song \"Pizmon Chozer\" by the band [[The Brothers & the Sisters]] was never given the chance to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 1984 Israel once again refrained from participating due to the same date conflict.\n\nApart from its victories, Israel's entries have had a mixed reception at the contest. [[Avi Toledano]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]]) and [[Ofra Haza]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]) scored well with big revivalist numbers, but the all-singing, all-dancing style became less popular later in the decade and Israel's 1986 entry, [[Yavo Yom]] by Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel, came in 19th, the country's worst showing yet.\n\nIn 1987 Israel finished 8th with [[Shir Habatlanim]] by the satiric duo Lazy Bums. Due to its satiric nature, it prompted then Israeli Minister of Culture, [[Yitzhak Navon]], to threaten to resign, if the song went on to represent Israel on the night of the contest. However, he didn't.\n\nIn 1990 [[Rita Kleinstein|Rita's]] sensuous [[ballad]] was not well received, but in 1991, Orna and Moshe Datz finished third, Israel's best result since 1983. Israel's third victory occurred in 1998, when [[Dana International]] won the crown with her song \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]].\" Israel also had a 5th-place finish by [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] when it hosted the 1999 contest. However, [[PingPong (band)|Ping-Pong]]'s [[disco]] effort in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] failed badly, though the group was noted for their largely optimistic lyrics and message of reconciliation and peace in Western Asia. They went as far as waving [[Syria]]n flags at the end of their performance, angering some Israelis.\n\nIn 2004 [[David D'Or]] came in 11th in the semifinal with the song \"[[Leha'amin]]\" (\u05dc\u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05df), leaving Israel out of the finals for the first time since 1997. [[Shiri Maymon]]'s performance in Kiev in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] brought Israel back to the top five, and ensured a place in the Athens [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 final]]. In 2006, Israel was represented by singer [[Eddie Butler (singer)|Eddie Butler]], who had finished 5th as part of Eden in 1999; however, his performance of the song \"Together We Are One\" finished 23rd, with just four points.\n\n[[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]]'s Eurovision committee chose the band [[Teapacks]] to represent Israel in the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Final in Helsinki.  Their humorous entry \"Push the Button\" did not fare well, finishing in 24th place out of a semifinal field of 28 and failing to reach the final. Israel had to compete in the semi-final in Belgrade 2008, from which it passed on to the final; [[Boaz Mauda|Boaz]] finished ninth. At the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], an Arab citizen of Israel represented the country for the first time, as [[Mira Awad]] performed along with Jewish-Israeli singer [[Achinoam Nini|Noa]] in Moscow. Israel was represented in 2010 by [[Harel Skaat]], who came in 14th in the final.\n\nIsrael's participations from 2011 to 2014 were less successful, as former Eurovision winner [[Dana International]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the band [[Izabo]] in [[Baku]], [[Moran Mazor]] in [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[Mei Finegold]] in [[Copenhagen]], all failed to qualify for the final. However, 16-year-old [[Nadav Guedj]] qualified with Golden Boy in 2015, the first Israeli song without a [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]] lyric. Prior to their fourth win, they also managed to qualify in 2016 with [[Hovi Star]] and \"[[Made of Stars]]\" (which finished 14th) and in 2017 with [[Imri Ziv]] and \"[[I Feel Alive]]\" (which finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2006). In 2019 as host country Israel was pre-qualified for the final, however, they eventually finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2017), making it the fourth time since 2015 that the host country ranked in the bottom five.\n\nIn early 2020, it was confirmed that the 2020 season of ''HaKokhav HaBa'' would be the last time it would be used to select the Israeli entrant, with a separate national final to select the winning artist's Eurovision entry. Beginning in 2021, a new national final hosted by [[Lucy Ayoub]] is planned to select the Israeli entry.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Table

When it became apparent during the later stages of the voting sequence that Israel was going to win the contest, JRTV abruptly ended the transmission.<ref name=\"50yrs\">{{cite book|last = O'Connor|first = John Kennedy|year = 2005|title = The Eurovision Song Contest 50 Years The Official History|publisher=Carlton Books Limited|location = London|isbn = 1-84442-586-X}}</ref> Afterwards, the Jordanian news media refused to acknowledge the fact that Israel had won, and announced that the winner was Belgium (which had actually come in second).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=esctoday.com|year=2005|url=http://www.esctoday.com/annual/1978/participants.php|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1978|accessdate=8 May 2007}}</ref> By coincidence, Israel did not broadcast the victory either, as the IBA did not buy enough broadcasting time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The victory was broadcast the next day.\n\nAt the time, Israeli Television was in its infancy and broadcasting in black & white. Many/most Israelis therefore watched international events in colour, using the signal from neighbouring Jordan. As Jordan did not broadcast the Israeli entry and the IBA did not broadcast the results part of the event, the win only became known as a result of radio broadcasts.\n\nBecause of Israel's participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], many [[Arab]] states that are eligible to participate do not do so. [[Tunisia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Tunisia]], [[Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Morocco]], and [[Lebanon in the Eurovision Song Contest|Lebanon]] are cases in point.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for Morocco and Tunisia not participating due to Israel|date=October 2013}} Tunisia was about to participate in 1977, but decided not to do so in the end; Lebanon was just about to participate in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] when it withdrew (incurring a fine by the EBU) because Lebanese law does not allow recognition of Israel, and consequently Lebanese television would not transmit any Israeli material \u2013 which would have been a violation of the EBU's rules.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]]|date=18 March 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4362373.stm|title=Lebanon withdraws from Eurovision|accessdate=15 July 2006}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Music of Israel]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Israel in Eurovision}}\n{{Eurovision Song Contest}}\n{{Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits}}\n\n[[Category:Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest| ]]\n[[Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox song contest country\n| Name = Israel\n| Member station = [[Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation|Kan]]\n{{Collapsible list\n | title = '''Former members''' \n | '''1973\u20132017:''' [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]]\n}}\n| National selection event = \n{{Collapsible list\n | title = '''Internal selection'''\n | 1973\u20131977\n | 1988 (artist)\n | 1990\n | 1998\u20132000\n | 2002\u20132004\n | 2007\n | 2012\n | 2015 (song)\n | 2017\u20132019 (song)\n | 2021\n}}\n{{Collapsible list\n | title = '''National final'''\n | '''Israel Song Festival'''\n | 1978\u20131979\n | '''[[Kdam Eurovision]]'''\n | 1981\u20131983\n | 1985\u20131987\n | 1988 (song)\n | 1989\n | 1991\u20131993\n | 1995\u20131996\n | 2001\n | 2005\u20132006\n | 2008\u20132011\n | 2013\u20132014\n | '''[[HaKokhav HaBa]]'''\n | 2015 (artist)\n | 2016\n | 2017-2019 (artist)\n}}\n| ESC apps = 42 (36 finals)\n| ESC first = {{Escyr|1973}}\n| ESC best = 1st: {{Escyr|1978}}, {{Escyr|1979}}, {{Escyr|1998}}, {{Escyr|2018}}\n| ESC worst = 24th {{small|SF}}: {{Escyr|2007}}\n| Website = [https://www.kan.org.il/page.aspx?landingpageId=7 Kan page]\n| EBU page = https://eurovision.tv/country/israel\n| Current = 2019\n}}\n\n'''[[Israel]]''' has participated in the '''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]''' 42 times since making its debut in {{Escyr|1973}}. Israel was able to enter the contest as the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA) was an active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU), which is responsible for the event. Israel has won the contest four times, and has hosted the contest in [[Jerusalem]] twice in {{escyr|1979}} and {{escyr|1999}}. Israel hosted the contest for the third time in [[Tel Aviv]] in {{Escyr|2019}}.\n\nIsrael's first appearance at the contest in 1973 was successful, with [[Ilanit]] finishing fourth. Israel then achieved victories in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979]], with wins for [[Izhar Cohen]] and the [[Alphabeta]], with the song \"[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]\", and [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]], with \"[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]\". In {{escyr|1980}}, the IBA declined to host the contest for the second successive year for financial reasons, and as the date for the contest in [[The Hague]] conflicted with [[Yom Hazikaron]] \u2013 Israeli Memorial Day \u2013 Israel did not participate. This is the only time that the winning country did not compete the following year. The country's best results in the 1980s were the second-place finishes for [[Avi Toledano]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] and [[Ofra Haza]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]. Former winner Izhar Cohen returned to place fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985]], before [[Duo Datz]] finished third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]]. Israel achieved its third victory in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]], with [[Dana International]] and \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]\". [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] then finished fifth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]]. As of 2019, Israel has the record for most participations and most wins in the contest without ever coming last, but it has placed second to last in the final three times, in {{escyr|1986}}, {{escyr|1993}} and {{escyr|2006}}.\n\nSince the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, Israel has failed to reach the final six times. In {{escyr|2005}}, [[Shiri Maimon]] gave the country its tenth top five result, finishing fourth. Having failed to qualify for the final for four consecutive years (2011\u201314), Israel reached the final for the first time in five years, with [[Nadav Guedj]] finishing ninth in {{escyr|2015}}, and the country has participated in the final every year since. Israel's fourth victory came when [[Netta Barzilai|Netta]] won the {{escyr|2018}} contest in [[Lisbon]], with the song \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\".\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Victories===\nTo date there have been four Israeli victories in the contest. [[Izhar Cohen]] and [[Alphabeta]] won in Paris in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] with the uptempo ''[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]''. On home ground in [[Jerusalem]] the following year, Israel won again, this time with the anthemic ''[[Hallelujah (Milk and Honey song)|Hallelujah]]'' performed by [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]]. Unusually, Israel did not defend the title in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]] (''see below''). The third victory came almost 20 years later in [[Birmingham]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]]. Singer [[Dana International]] took top honours with the song ''[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]'', setting off widespread celebrations in Israel. Twenty years later, Israel earned their fourth victory at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018 contest]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. The song was \"[[Toy (song)|Toy]]\" by [[Netta Barzilai]], which earned Israel their highest-ever score of 529 points.\n\n===Other performances===\nIsrael's earliest selections were picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]. The first singer to represent the country in 1973 was [[Ilanit]], who finished 4th. Criticism increased after she was sent again four years later, leading to a rule that the winner of the already established Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival would also represent Israel at the contest. The Eurovision Song Contest winners of 1978 and 1979 were selected by this method. From 1981 the selection process was handled by the [[Kdam Eurovision]] with the exceptions of 1990, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002\u20132004, 2006\u20132007 and 2010 where the selections were again picked by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]].\n\nAfter winning the contest in 1978 and 1979, the IBA was financially and logistically unable to organise the event for the second consecutive year. The organization of the festival was subsequently handed over to the Netherlands who finally agreed to stage it. Because much time had already passed, it was difficult to find a suitable date for the Song Contest. The date chosen coincided with a [[Yom Hazikaron|memorial day]] in Israel, and the country was forced to withdraw. This made Israel the only country to date unable to defend its title. The 1980 Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival therefore did not double as a national final that year unlike the last two years, and the winning song \"Pizmon Chozer\" by the band [[The Brothers & the Sisters]] was never given the chance to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 1984 Israel once again refrained from participating due to the same date conflict.\n\nApart from its victories, Israel's entries have had a mixed reception at the contest. [[Avi Toledano]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]]) and [[Ofra Haza]] ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]]) scored well with big revivalist numbers, but the all-singing, all-dancing style became less popular later in the decade and Israel's 1986 entry, [[Yavo Yom]] by Moti Giladi & Sarai Tzuriel, came in 19th, the country's worst showing yet.\n\nIn 1987 Israel finished 8th with [[Shir Habatlanim]] by the satiric duo Lazy Bums. Due to its satiric nature, it prompted then Israeli Minister of Culture, [[Yitzhak Navon]], to threaten to resign, if the song went on to represent Israel on the night of the contest. However, he didn't.\n\nIn 1990 [[Rita Kleinstein|Rita's]] sensuous [[ballad]] was not well received, but in 1991, Orna and Moshe Datz finished third, Israel's best result since 1983. Israel's third victory occurred in 1998, when [[Dana International]] won the crown with her song \"[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]].\" Israel also had a 5th-place finish by [[Eden (Israeli band)|Eden]] when it hosted the 1999 contest. However, [[PingPong (band)|Ping-Pong]]'s [[disco]] effort in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] failed badly, though the group was noted for their largely optimistic lyrics and message of reconciliation and peace in Western Asia. They went as far as waving [[Syria]]n flags at the end of their performance, angering some Israelis.\n\nIn 2004 [[David D'Or]] came in 11th in the semifinal with the song \"[[Leha'amin]]\" (\u05dc\u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05df), leaving Israel out of the finals for the first time since 1997. [[Shiri Maymon]]'s performance in Kiev in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] brought Israel back to the top five, and ensured a place in the Athens [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 final]]. In 2006, Israel was represented by singer [[Eddie Butler (singer)|Eddie Butler]], who had finished 5th as part of Eden in 1999; however, his performance of the song \"Together We Are One\" finished 23rd, with just four points.\n\n[[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]]'s Eurovision committee chose the band [[Teapacks]] to represent Israel in the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Final in Helsinki.  Their humorous entry \"Push the Button\" did not fare well, finishing in 24th place out of a semifinal field of 28 and failing to reach the final. Israel had to compete in the semi-final in Belgrade 2008, from which it passed on to the final; [[Boaz Mauda|Boaz]] finished ninth. At the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], an Arab citizen of Israel represented the country for the first time, as [[Mira Awad]] performed along with Jewish-Israeli singer [[Achinoam Nini|Noa]] in Moscow. Israel was represented in 2010 by [[Harel Skaat]], who came in 14th in the final.\n\nIsrael's participations from 2011 to 2014 were less successful, as former Eurovision winner [[Dana International]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the band [[Izabo]] in [[Baku]], [[Moran Mazor]] in [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[Mei Finegold]] in [[Copenhagen]], all failed to qualify for the final. However, 16-year-old [[Nadav Guedj]] qualified with Golden Boy in 2015, the first Israeli song without a [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]] lyric. Prior to their fourth win, they also managed to qualify in 2016 with [[Hovi Star]] and \"[[Made of Stars]]\" (which finished 14th) and in 2017 with [[Imri Ziv]] and \"[[I Feel Alive]]\" (which finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2006). In 2019 as host country Israel was pre-qualified for the final, however, they eventually finished 23rd, Israel's lowest score in a Eurovision final since 2017), making it the fourth time since 2015 that the host country ranked in the bottom five.\n\nIn early 2020, it was confirmed that the 2020 season of ''HaKokhav HaBa'' would be the last time it would be used to select the Israeli entrant, with a separate national final to select the winning artist's Eurovision entry. Beginning in 2021, a new national final hosted by [[Lucy Ayoub]] is planned to select the Israeli entry.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Table

The primary [[arteries]] (the [[aorta]] and the [[pulmonary artery]]) are [[wiktionary:transpose|transpose]]d.\n\nIt is called a [[cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic]] [[congenital]] [[congenital heart defect|heart defect]] ('''CHD''') because the newborn infant turns blue from lack of oxygen. In [[segmental analysis (biology)|segmental analysis]], this condition is described as '''[[wiktionary:ventriculoarterial|ventriculoarterial]] [[wiktionary:discordant|discordance]] with [[wiktionary:atrioventricular|atrioventricular]] [[wiktionary:concordance|concordance]]''', or just '''ventriculoarterial discordance'''. d-TGA is often referred to simply as '''[[transposition of the great arteries]]''' ('''TGA'''); however, TGA is a more general term which may also refer to '''[[levo-transposition of the great arteries]]''' ('''l-TGA''').Another term commonly used to refer to both d-TGA and l-TGA is '''[[transposition of the great vessels]]''' ('''TGV'''), although this term might have an even broader meaning than TGA.\n\n[[wiktionary:Prenatal|Prenatal]]ly, a [[baby]] with d-TGA experiences no [[symptoms]] as the lungs will not be used until after [[childbirth|birth]], and oxygen is provided by the [[mother]] via the [[placenta]] and [[umbilical cord]]; in order for the red blood to bypass the lungs [[in utero]], the [[fetal]] heart has two shunts that begin to close when the [[newborn]] starts [[breath]]ing; these are the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] and the [[ductus arteriosus]]. The foramen ovale is a hole in the atrial septum which allows blood from the [[right atrium]] to flow into the [[left atrium]]; after birth, the left atrium will be filled with blood returning from the lungs and the foramen ovale will close. The ductus arteriosus is a small, artery-like structure which allows blood to flow from the trunk of the pulmonary artery into the aorta; after birth, the blood in the pulmonary artery will flow into the lungs and the ductus arteriosus will close. Sometimes these shunts will fail to close after birth; these defects are called [[atrial septal defect#Patent foramen ovale|patent foramen ovale]] and [[patent ductus arteriosus]], and either may occur independently, or in combination with one another, or with d-TGA or other heart and/or general defects.\n\n==Symptoms and signs==\n[[Image:cyanotic neonate.jpg|thumb|right|cyanotic d-TGA + VSD neonate (unpalliated and pre-operative).]]\nDue to the low [[oxygen saturation]] of the blood, [[cyanosis]] will appear in [[wiktionary:peripheral|peripheral]] areas: around the mouth and lips, fingertips, and toes; these areas are furthest from the heart, and since the circulated blood is not fully oxygenated to begin with, very little oxygen reaches the [[peripheral arteries]]. A d-TGA baby will exhibit indrawing beneath the [[ribcage]] and \"comfortable [[tachypnea]]\" (rapid breathing); this is likely a [[homeostatic]] [[reflex]] of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in response to [[hypoxic hypoxia]]. The infant will be easily [[fatigue (physical)|fatigued]] and may experience weakness, particularly during feeding or playing; this interruption to feeding combined with hypoxia can cause [[failure to thrive]]. If d-TGA is not [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]]d and corrected early on, the infant may eventually experience [[fainting|syncopic episodes]] and develop [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the fingers and toes.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nd-TGA can sometimes be diagnosed in utero with an [[ultrasound]] after 18 weeks [[gestation]]. However, if it is not diagnosed in utero, cyanosis of the newborn ([[blue baby]]) should immediately indicate that there is a problem with the [[cardiovascular]] system. Normally, the lungs are examined first, then the heart is examined if there are no apparent problems with the lungs. These examinations are typically performed using ultrasound, known as an [[echocardiogram]] when performed on the heart. [[Chest x-ray]]s and [[electrocardiogram]]s ('''EKG''') may also be used in reaching or confirming a diagnosis; however, an [[x-ray]] may appear normal immediately following birth. If d-TGA is accompanied by both a VSD and pulmonary [[stenosis]], a [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] [[heart murmur|murmur]] will be present.\n\nOn the rare occasion (when there is a large [[Ventricular septal defect|VSD]] with no significant left [[ventricular outflow tract obstruction]]), initial symptoms may go unnoticed, resulting in the infant being discharged without treatment in the event of a [[Obstetrics|hospital]] or [[birthing center]] birth, or a delay in bringing the infant for diagnosis in the event of a [[home birth]]. On these occasions, a layperson is likely not to recognize symptoms until the infant is experiencing moderate to serious [[congestive heart failure]] ('''CHF''') as a result of the heart working harder in a [[wiktionary: futile|futile]] attempt to increase oxygen flow to the body; this overworking of the heart muscle eventually leads to [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] and may result in [[cardiac arrest]] if left untreated.\n\n[[Image:d-TGA.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Normal heart anatomy compared to d-TGA]]\n\n===Description===\nIn a normal [[heart]], [[oxygen]]-depleted (\"blue\") blood is pumped from the [[right heart|right side of the heart]], through the pulmonary artery, to the [[lung]]s where it is oxygenated.

The aorta and pulmonary artery can also be side by side, with aorta on either side. This is a less common variant, and with this arrangement, an unusual [[coronary artery]] pattern is common. There are also some cases with aorta to the right and posterior to the pulmonary artery.<ref>'''Valdes-Cruz LM and Cayre RO''': Chapter 24 in ''Echocardiographic diagnosis of congenital heart disease''. Philadelphia 1998.</ref>\n\n====Simple and complex d-TGA====\nd-TGA is often accompanied by other heart defects, the most common type being [[wiktionary:intracardiac|intracardiac]] [[shunt (medical)|shunts]] such as [[atrial septal defect]] ('''ASD''') including [[atrial septal defect#Patent foramen ovale|patent foramen ovale]] ('''PFO'''), [[ventricular septal defect]] ('''VSD'''), and [[patent ductus arteriosus]] ('''PDA'''). [[Stenosis]] of [[heart valve|valves]] or [[blood vessel|vessels]] may also be present.\n\nWhen no other heart defects are present it is called 'simple' d-TGA; when other defects are present it is called 'complex' d-TGA.\n\nAlthough it may seem counterintuitive, complex d-TGA presents better chance of survival and less [[child development|developmental]] risks than simple d-TGA, as well as usually requiring fewer invasive [[palliative]] procedures. This is because the left-to-right and bidirectional [[Cardiac shunt|shunting]] caused by the defects common to complex d-TGA allow a higher amount of oxygen-rich blood to enter the [[systemic circulation]]. However, complex d-TGA may cause a very slight increase to length and risk of the corrective [[surgery]], as most or all other heart defects will normally be repaired at the same time, and the heart becomes \"[[irritation|irritated]]\" the more it is manipulated.\n\n==Treatment==\n{{cleanup |section |reason=this section is poorly formatted and disorganised.

However, if a sternotomy is required for a different procedure, in most cases all procedures that are immediately required will be performed at the same time.\n\n====Monitoring and maintenance====\n[[Image:Palliated neonate.jpg|thumb|right|Palliated pre-operative d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\n*[[Nasogastric tube]] ('''NG tube''' or simply '''NG''')\n*[[Intubation]], [[oxygen mask]], or [[nasal cannula]]\n*[[Intravenous drip]] ('''IV''')\n*[[Arterial line]]\n*[[Central venous catheter]]\n*[[Fingerprick]]\n*[[Sphygmomanometer]]\n*[[Pulse oximeter]]\n*[[electrocardiogram|EKG]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nAn NG tube is used to deliver [[nourishment]], and occasionally [[medication]], to the patient. Since the tube extends right into the [[stomach]], it can also be used to monitor how well the patient is [[digestion|digesting]] their \"food\". [[Paediatric]] units normally provide facilities and equipment for mothers of infant patients to [[breast pump|pump]] their [[breastmilk]], which can then be fed to the infant through the NG tube, and/or stored for later use.\n\n[[Oxygen therapy]] is commonplace for hospitalized d-TGA patients. This may range from an oxygen mask resting on the bed nearby their head to intubation. In some cases, patients are intubated as a precaution; the machine can monitor [[Control of respiration|breathing]] and supplement the patient as much or as little as they need.\n\nIV's are used to deliver medication, blood products, or other fluids to the patient. Arterial lines provide a constant monitor of [[blood pressure]], as well as a method of obtaining samples for [[blood gas]] tests; central lines can also monitor blood pressure and provide blood samples, as well as provide a means to deliver medication and nourishment; fingerpricks (or heelpricks on small babies) are used to obtain blood samples for certain tests.\n\nA sphygmomanometer may be used for intermittent blood pressure monitoring even if a patient is being otherwise monitored using a central or arterial line.\n\nA pulse oximeter is attached to a finger or toe and provides constant or intermittent monitoring of the blood's oxygen saturation level.\n\nAn EKG creates a visual readout of how well the heart rhythm is functioning.\n\n====Medication====\n*[[Prostaglandin]] ('''PGE''')\n*[[Antibiotics]]\n*[[Diuretics]]\n*[[Analgesics]]\n*[[Cardiac glycoside]]s\n*[[Sedatives]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nWhen PGE is administered to a newborn, it prevents the ductus arteriosus from closing, therefore providing an additional shunt through which to provide the systemic circulation with a higher level of oxygen.\n\nAntibiotics may be administered preventatively. However, due to the physical strain caused by uncorrected d-TGA, as well as the potential for introduction of bacteria via arterial and central lines, infection is not uncommon in pre-operative patients.\n\nDiuretics aid in flushing excess fluid from the body, thereby easing strain on the heart.\n\nAnalgesics normally are not used pre-operatively, but they may be used in certain cases. They are occasionally used partially for their sedative effects.\n\nCardiac glycosides are used to maintain proper heart rhythm while increasing the strength of each [[muscle contraction|contraction]].\n\nSedatives may be used palliatively to prevent a young child from thrashing about or pulling out any of their lines.\n\n===Corrective===\n\n====Nikaidoh====\nIt was Bex who introduced in 1980 the possibility of aortic translocation. But Nikaidoh has put the procedure in practice in 1984. It results in an anatomical normal heart, even better than with an ASO, because also the cones are switched instead of only the arteries as with an ASO. \nThe procedure is contra-indicated by certain coronary anomalies.\n\nIn 1984, Nikaidoh introduced a surgical approach for the management of TGA, VSD, and pulmonary stenosis (PS), which he called \u201caortic translocation and biventricular outflow tract reconstruction.\u201d The repair consisted of harvesting the aortic root from the right ventricle, with or without the coronary arteries attached, and relieving the LVOTO by dividing the outlet septum and pulmonary valve annulus. The LVOT is then restored by posteriorly\ntranslocating the aortic root and closing the VSD. Finally, the right ventricular outflow tract is reconstructed with a pericardial patch.\nThis is a technically challenging procedure, but results in a more \u201cnormal\u201d anatomic repair. The main thing is the repositioning of the native aortic root over to the LV cavity, avoiding the creation of a long tortuous intraventricular tunnel. This technique appears to prevent the development of LVOTO, which is a frequent complication of the Rastelli repair. The addition of the Lecompte maneuver may prevent branch pulmonary artery stenosis that may occur secondary to compression of the PA by the posteriorly displaced, translocated aortic root. It creates a direct RV to PA anastomosis and avoiding the use of a conduit, which should decrease the incidence of RVOT reinterventions.\n\n====Lecompte====\nSince 1981 LeCompte has put his [[LeCompte manoeuvre]] in use. This is used with the REV (R\u00e9paration \u00e0 l'Etage Ventriculaire). This surgery is like the Rastelli procedure, but with the use of the pulmonary artery without a conduit.\n\n====Rastelli====\nWhen an arterials switch operation (ASO) is not possible e.g. in case of LVOTO an option is the Rastelli procedure. The pulmonal artery is shifted with help of  conduit to the right ventricle. It has been used since 1960s. It has a disadvantage that the conduit does not grow, so re-operation is necessary.\n\n====Arterial switch====\n[[File:Blausen_0046_ArterialSwitchOperation_01.png|thumb|150px|left|Arterial switch procedure.]]\n[[Image:Postop Jatene neonate.jpg|thumb|right|Immediate post-operative (Jatene procedure) d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\nThe '''[[Jatene procedure]]''' surgery is the preferred, and most frequently used, method of correcting d-TGA; ideally, it is performed on an infant between 8\u201314 days old.\n\nThe heart and vessels are accessed via median sternotomy, and a [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] machine is used; as this machine needs its \"circulation\" to be filled with blood, a child will require a [[blood transfusion]] for this surgery. The procedure involves [[wiktionary:transect|transect]]ing both the aorta and pulmonary artery; the coronary arteries are then detached from the aorta and reattached to the [[neo-]]aorta, before \"swapping\" the upper portion of the aorta and pulmonary artery to the opposite arterial [[root]]. Including the [[anaesthesia]] and immediate [[post operative]] recovery, this surgery takes an average of approximately six to eight hours to complete.\n\nSome arterial switch recipients may present with post-operative pulmonary stenosis, which would then be repaired with angioplasty, pulmonary [[stent]]ing via heart cath or median sternotomy, and/or [[xenograft]].\n[[Image:Postop Jatene neonate2.jpg|thumb|right|One day post-operative (Jatene procedure) d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\n\n====Atrial switch====\nIn some cases, it is not possible to perform an arterial switch, either because of late diagnosis, [[sepsis]], or a [[contraindication|contraindicative]] coronary artery pattern. In the case of sepsis or late diagnosis, a delayed Arterial Switch can sometimes be made possible by PAB, which may also require a concomitant construction of an aortic-to-pulmonary artery shunt.\n\nWhen an arterial switch is impossible, an atrial switch will be attempted using either the '''[[Senning procedure|Senning]]''' or '''[[Mustard procedure|Mustard]]''' procedure. Both methods involve creating a [[Baffle (medical)|baffle]] to redirect red and blue blood flow to the appropriate artery. Since the late 1970s the Mustard procedure has been preferred.\n\n===Post-operative===\nFollowing corrective surgery but prior to cessation of anaesthesia, two small incisions are made immediately below the sternotomy incision which provide exit points for [[chest tube]]s used to drain fluid from the thoracic cavity, with one tube placed at the front and another at the rear of the heart.\n\nThe patient returns to the ICU post-operatively for recovery, maintenance, and close observation; recovery time may vary, but tends to average approximately two weeks, after which the patient may be transferred to a [[Transitional Care Unit]] ('''TCU'''), and eventually to a [[cardiac ward]].\n\nPost-operative care is very similar to the palliative care received, with the exception that the patient no longer requires PGE or the surgical palliation procedures. Additionally, the patient is kept on a cooling blanket for a period of time to prevent [[fever]], which could cause [[brain damage]]. The sternum is not closed immediately which allows extra space in the [[thoracic cavity]], preventing excess pressure on the heart, which [[Edema|swells]] considerably following the surgery; the sternum and incision are closed after a few days, when swelling is sufficiently reduced.\n\n===Follow-up===\nThe infant will continue to see a [[cardiologist]] on a regular basis. Although these appointments are required less frequently as time goes on, they will continue throughout the lifetime of the individual, and may increase in the event of complications or as the individual approaches [[middle age]].\n\nThe cardiology exam may include an echocardiogram, EKG, and/or [[cardiac stress test]] in addition to consultation.\n\nAdditionally, some individuals may require ongoing medication therapy at home, which may include diuretics (such as [[furosemide]] or [[spironolactone]]), analgesics (such as [[paracetamol]]), cardiac glycosides (such as [[digoxin]]), [[anticoagulant]]s (such as [[heparin]] or [[aspirin]]), or other medications. If the individual has undergone stenting, an anticoagulant will be a necessity to prevent build-up around the stent(s), as the body will perceive the foreign body as a wound and attempt to heal it.\n\nSome patients who had alternate corrective surgery, such as the Mustard or Senning procedure, may have issues with SA and VA nodal transmissions in later life. Typical symptoms include palpitations and problems with low heart rates. This is commonly solved with a Pacemaker unit, providing scar tissue from the original operation does not block its functionality.\n\nMore recently, ACE inhibitors have been prescribed to patients in the hope of relieving stress on the heart.\n==Prognosis==\nWith simple d-TGA, if the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus are allowed to close naturally, the newborn will likely not survive long enough to receive corrective surgery. With complex d-TGA, the infant will fail to thrive and is unlikely to survive longer than a year if corrective surgery is not performed. In most cases, the patient's condition will deteriorate to the point of inoperability  if the defect is not corrected in the first year.\n\nWhile the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus are open after birth, some mixing of red and blue blood occurs allowing a small amount of oxygen to be delivered to the body; if ASD, VSD, PFO, and/or PDA are present, this will allow a higher amount of the red and blue blood to be mixed, therefore delivering more oxygen to the body, but can complicate and lengthen the corrective surgery and/or be [[symptomatic]].\n\nModern repair procedures within the ideal timeframe and without additional complications have a very high success rate.\n\n==Epidemiology==\n*Heart defects are the most common [[congenital disorder|birth defect]], occurring in approximately 1% of live births\n*Approximately one million people worldwide are currently living with a CHD\n*Having a child with a CHD increases an individual\u2019s chances of having another child with a CHD from 1% to 3%. Subsequent children born with a CHD increase that individual\u2019s chances further.\n{{Dynamic list}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[levo-Transposition of the great arteries]]\n*[[Transposition of the great vessels]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{eMedicine|ped|2548}}\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     =  \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|Q|20|3|q|20}}  \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|745.10}} \n|  ICDO           =  \n|  OMIM           = 608808 \n|  MedlinePlus    =  \n|  eMedicineSubj  =  \n|  eMedicineTopic =  \n|  MeshID         = \n}}\n\n\n\n{{Congenital malformations and deformations of circulatory system}}\n\n[[Category:Congenital heart defects]]\n", "text_old": "{{MOS|date=June 2018|reason=not using MEDMOS}}\n{{one source|date=November 2013}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Dextro-Transposition of the great arteries\n| synonyms        = '''Complete transposition of the great arteries'''\n| image           = D-tga-575px.jpg\n| caption         = Dextro-Transposition of the great arteries\n| pronounce       = \n| field           = \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n{{lowercase|title=dextro-Transposition of the great arteries}}\n'''[[wiktionary:dexter|dextro]]-Transposition of the great arteries''' ('''d-Transposition of the great arteries''', '''dextro-TGA''', or '''d-TGA'''), is a birth defect in the large arteries of the heart. The primary [[arteries]] (the [[aorta]] and the [[pulmonary artery]]) are [[wiktionary:transpose|transpose]]d.\n\nIt is called a [[cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic]] [[congenital]] [[congenital heart defect|heart defect]] ('''CHD''') because the newborn infant turns blue from lack of oxygen. In [[segmental analysis (biology)|segmental analysis]], this condition is described as '''[[wiktionary:ventriculoarterial|ventriculoarterial]] [[wiktionary:discordant|discordance]] with [[wiktionary:atrioventricular|atrioventricular]] [[wiktionary:concordance|concordance]]''', or just '''ventriculoarterial discordance'''.d-TGA is often referred to simply as '''[[transposition of the great arteries]]''' ('''TGA'''); however, TGA is a more general term which may also refer to '''[[levo-transposition of the great arteries]]''' ('''l-TGA''').Another term commonly used to refer to both d-TGA and l-TGA is '''[[transposition of the great vessels]]''' ('''TGV'''), although this term might have an even broader meaning than TGA.\n\n[[wiktionary:Prenatal|Prenatal]]ly, a [[baby]] with d-TGA experiences no [[symptoms]] as the lungs will not be used until after [[childbirth|birth]], and oxygen is provided by the [[mother]] via the [[placenta]] and [[umbilical cord]]; in order for the red blood to bypass the lungs [[in utero]], the [[fetal]] heart has two shunts that begin to close when the [[newborn]] starts [[breath]]ing; these are the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] and the [[ductus arteriosus]]. The foramen ovale is a hole in the atrial septum which allows blood from the [[right atrium]] to flow into the [[left atrium]]; after birth, the left atrium will be filled with blood returning from the lungs and the foramen ovale will close. The ductus arteriosus is a small, artery-like structure which allows blood to flow from the trunk of the pulmonary artery into the aorta; after birth, the blood in the pulmonary artery will flow into the lungs and the ductus arteriosus will close. Sometimes these shunts will fail to close after birth; these defects are called [[atrial septal defect#Patent foramen ovale|patent foramen ovale]] and [[patent ductus arteriosus]], and either may occur independently, or in combination with one another, or with d-TGA or other heart and/or general defects.\n\n==Symptoms and signs==\n[[Image:cyanotic neonate.jpg|thumb|right|cyanotic d-TGA + VSD neonate (unpalliated and pre-operative).]]\nDue to the low [[oxygen saturation]] of the blood, [[cyanosis]] will appear in [[wiktionary:peripheral|peripheral]] areas: around the mouth and lips, fingertips, and toes; these areas are furthest from the heart, and since the circulated blood is not fully oxygenated to begin with, very little oxygen reaches the [[peripheral arteries]]. A d-TGA baby will exhibit indrawing beneath the [[ribcage]] and \"comfortable [[tachypnea]]\" (rapid breathing); this is likely a [[homeostatic]] [[reflex]] of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in response to [[hypoxic hypoxia]]. The infant will be easily [[fatigue (physical)|fatigued]] and may experience weakness, particularly during feeding or playing; this interruption to feeding combined with hypoxia can cause [[failure to thrive]]. If d-TGA is not [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]]d and corrected early on, the infant may eventually experience [[fainting|syncopic episodes]] and develop [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the fingers and toes.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nd-TGA can sometimes be diagnosed in utero with an [[ultrasound]] after 18 weeks [[gestation]]. However, if it is not diagnosed in utero, cyanosis of the newborn ([[blue baby]]) should immediately indicate that there is a problem with the [[cardiovascular]] system. Normally, the lungs are examined first, then the heart is examined if there are no apparent problems with the lungs. These examinations are typically performed using ultrasound, known as an [[echocardiogram]] when performed on the heart. [[Chest x-ray]]s and [[electrocardiogram]]s ('''EKG''') may also be used in reaching or confirming a diagnosis; however, an [[x-ray]] may appear normal immediately following birth. If d-TGA is accompanied by both a VSD and pulmonary [[stenosis]], a [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] [[heart murmur|murmur]] will be present.\n\nOn the rare occasion (when there is a large [[Ventricular septal defect|VSD]] with no significant left [[ventricular outflow tract obstruction]]), initial symptoms may go unnoticed, resulting in the infant being discharged without treatment in the event of a [[Obstetrics|hospital]] or [[birthing center]] birth, or a delay in bringing the infant for diagnosis in the event of a [[home birth]].

Treatment may include any combination of:\n\n====Surgery====\n\n=====Minor=====\n*[[Cardiac catheterization]]\n**[[Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy]]\n**[[Balloon angioplasty]]\n**[[Endovascular stent]]ing\n**[[Angiography]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nCardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure which provides a means of performing a number of other procedures.\n\nA balloon atrial septostomy is performed with a [[balloon catheter]], which is inserted into a [[patent foramen ovale]] ( PFO ), or [[atrial septal defect]] ( ASD )  and inflated to enlarge the opening in the atrial septum; this creates a shunt which allows a larger amount of oxygenated (\"red\") blood to enter the systemic circulation.\n\nAngioplasty also requires a balloon catheter, which is used to stretch open a [[stenosis|stenotic]] vessel; this relieves restricted blood flow, which could otherwise lead to [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF).\n\nAn endovascular stent is sometimes placed in a stenotic vessel immediately following a balloon angioplasty to maintain the widened passage.\n\nAngiography involves using the catheter to release a [[contrast medium]] into the [[heart chamber|chambers]] and/or vessels of the heart; this process facilitates examining the flow of blood through the chambers during an echocardiogram, or shows the vessels clearly on a chest x-ray, MRI, or CT scan - this is of particular importance, as the coronary arteries must be carefully examined and \"mapped out\" prior to the corrective surgery.\n\nIt is commonplace for any of these palliations to be performed on a d-TGA patient.\n\n=====Moderate=====\n*[[Left anterior thoracotomy]]\n**Isolated [[pulmonary artery banding]] ('''PAB''')\n*[[Left lateral thoracotomy]]\n**PAB (when coarctation or aortic arch repair also required)\n*[[Right lateral thoracotomy]]\n**[[Blalock-Hanlon atrial septectomy]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nEach of these procedures is performed through an [[Surgical incision|incision]] between the [[ribs]] and visualized by echocardiogram; these are far less common than heart cath procedures.\n\nPulmonary artery banding is used in a small number of cases of d-TGA, usually when the corrective surgery needs to be delayed, to create an artificial stenosis in order to control pulmonary [[blood pressure]]; PAB involves placing a band around the [[pulmonary trunk]], this band can then be quickly and easily adjusted when necessary.\n\nAn atrial septectomy is the surgical removal of the atrial septum; this is performed when a [[patent foramen ovale]] ( PFO ), or [[atrial septal defect]] ( ASD ) are not present and additional shunting is required to raise the oxygen saturation of the blood flowing eventually into the [[aorta]].\n\n=====Major=====\n*[[Median sternotomy]]\n**PAB (when intracardiac procedures also required)\n**Concomitant atrial septectomy\n{{Dynamic list}}\nIn recent years, it is quite rare for palliative procedures to be done via median sternotomy. However, if a sternotomy is required for a different procedure, in most cases all procedures that are immediately required will be performed at the same time.\n\n====Monitoring and maintenance====\n[[Image:Palliated neonate.jpg|thumb|right|Palliated pre-operative d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\n*[[Nasogastric tube]] ('''NG tube''' or simply '''NG''')\n*[[Intubation]], [[oxygen mask]], or [[nasal cannula]]\n*[[Intravenous drip]] ('''IV''')\n*[[Arterial line]]\n*[[Central venous catheter]]\n*[[Fingerprick]]\n*[[Sphygmomanometer]]\n*[[Pulse oximeter]]\n*[[electrocardiogram|EKG]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nAn NG tube is used to deliver [[nourishment]], and occasionally [[medication]], to the patient. Since the tube extends right into the [[stomach]], it can also be used to monitor how well the patient is [[digestion|digesting]] their \"food\". [[Paediatric]] units normally provide facilities and equipment for mothers of infant patients to [[breast pump|pump]] their [[breastmilk]], which can then be fed to the infant through the NG tube, and/or stored for later use.\n\n[[Oxygen therapy]] is commonplace for hospitalized d-TGA patients. This may range from an oxygen mask resting on the bed nearby their head to intubation. In some cases, patients are intubated as a precaution; the machine can monitor [[Control of respiration|breathing]] and supplement the patient as much or as little as they need.\n\nIV's are used to deliver medication, blood products, or other fluids to the patient. Arterial lines provide a constant monitor of [[blood pressure]], as well as a method of obtaining samples for [[blood gas]] tests; central lines can also monitor blood pressure and provide blood samples, as well as provide a means to deliver medication and nourishment; fingerpricks (or heelpricks on small babies) are used to obtain blood samples for certain tests.\n\nA sphygmomanometer may be used for intermittent blood pressure monitoring even if a patient is being otherwise monitored using a central or arterial line.\n\nA pulse oximeter is attached to a finger or toe and provides constant or intermittent monitoring of the blood's oxygen saturation level.\n\nAn EKG creates a visual readout of how well the heart rhythm is functioning.\n\n====Medication====\n*[[Prostaglandin]] ('''PGE''')\n*[[Antibiotics]]\n*[[Diuretics]]\n*[[Analgesics]]\n*[[Cardiac glycoside]]s\n*[[Sedatives]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nWhen PGE is administered to a newborn, it prevents the ductus arteriosus from closing, therefore providing an additional shunt through which to provide the systemic circulation with a higher level of oxygen.\n\nAntibiotics may be administered preventatively. However, due to the physical strain caused by uncorrected d-TGA, as well as the potential for introduction of bacteria via arterial and central lines, infection is not uncommon in pre-operative patients.\n\nDiuretics aid in flushing excess fluid from the body, thereby easing strain on the heart.\n\nAnalgesics normally are not used pre-operatively, but they may be used in certain cases. They are occasionally used partially for their sedative effects.\n\nCardiac glycosides are used to maintain proper heart rhythm while increasing the strength of each [[muscle contraction|contraction]].\n\nSedatives may be used palliatively to prevent a young child from thrashing about or pulling out any of their lines.\n\n===Corrective===\n\n====Nikaidoh====\nIt was Bex who introduced in 1980 the possibility of aortic translocation. But Nikaidoh has put the procedure in practice in 1984. It results in an anatomical normal heart, even better than with an ASO, because also the cones are switched instead of only the arteries as with an ASO. \nThe procedure is contra-indicated by certain coronary anomalies.\n\nIn 1984, Nikaidoh introduced a surgical approach for the management of TGA, VSD, and pulmonary stenosis (PS), which he called \u201caortic translocation and biventricular outflow tract reconstruction.\u201d The repair consisted of harvesting the aortic root from the right ventricle, with or without the coronary arteries attached, and relieving the LVOTO by dividing the outlet septum and pulmonary valve annulus. The LVOT is then restored by posteriorly\ntranslocating the aortic root and closing the VSD. Finally, the right ventricular outflow tract is reconstructed with a pericardial patch.\nThis is a technically challenging procedure, but results in a more \u201cnormal\u201d anatomic repair. The main thing is the repositioning of the native aortic root over to the LV cavity, avoiding the creation of a long tortuous intraventricular tunnel. This technique appears to prevent the development of LVOTO, which is a frequent complication of the Rastelli repair. The addition of the Lecompte maneuver may prevent branch pulmonary artery stenosis that may occur secondary to compression of the PA by the posteriorly displaced, translocated aortic root. It creates a direct RV to PA anastomosis and avoiding the use of a conduit, which should decrease the incidence of RVOT reinterventions.\n\n====Lecompte====\nSince 1981 LeCompte has put his [[LeCompte manoeuvre]] in use. This is used with the REV (R\u00e9paration \u00e0 l'Etage Ventriculaire). This surgery is like the Rastelli procedure, but with the use of the pulmonary artery without a conduit.\n\n====Rastelli====\nWhen an arterials switch operation (ASO) is not possible e.g. in case of LVOTO an option is the Rastelli procedure. The pulmonal artery is shifted with help of  conduit to the right ventricle. It has been used since 1960s. It has a disadvantage that the conduit does not grow, so re-operation is necessary.\n\n====Arterial switch====\n[[File:Blausen_0046_ArterialSwitchOperation_01.png|thumb|150px|left|Arterial switch procedure.]]\n[[Image:Postop Jatene neonate.jpg|thumb|right|Immediate post-operative (Jatene procedure) d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\nThe '''[[Jatene procedure]]''' surgery is the preferred, and most frequently used, method of correcting d-TGA; ideally, it is performed on an infant between 8\u201314 days old.\n\nThe heart and vessels are accessed via median sternotomy, and a [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] machine is used; as this machine needs its \"circulation\" to be filled with blood, a child will require a [[blood transfusion]] for this surgery. The procedure involves [[wiktionary:transect|transect]]ing both the aorta and pulmonary artery; the coronary arteries are then detached from the aorta and reattached to the [[neo-]]aorta, before \"swapping\" the upper portion of the aorta and pulmonary artery to the opposite arterial [[root]]. Including the [[anaesthesia]] and immediate [[post operative]] recovery, this surgery takes an average of approximately six to eight hours to complete.\n\nSome arterial switch recipients may present with post-operative pulmonary stenosis, which would then be repaired with angioplasty, pulmonary [[stent]]ing via heart cath or median sternotomy, and/or [[xenograft]].\n[[Image:Postop Jatene neonate2.jpg|thumb|right|One day post-operative (Jatene procedure) d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\n\n====Atrial switch====\nIn some cases, it is not possible to perform an arterial switch, either because of late diagnosis, [[sepsis]], or a [[contraindication|contraindicative]] coronary artery pattern. In the case of sepsis or late diagnosis, a delayed Arterial Switch can sometimes be made possible by PAB, which may also require a concomitant construction of an aortic-to-pulmonary artery shunt.\n\nWhen an arterial switch is impossible, an atrial switch will be attempted using either the '''[[Senning procedure|Senning]]''' or '''[[Mustard procedure|Mustard]]''' procedure. Both methods involve creating a [[Baffle (medical)|baffle]] to redirect red and blue blood flow to the appropriate artery. Since the late 1970s the Mustard procedure has been preferred.\n\n===Post-operative===\nFollowing corrective surgery but prior to cessation of anaesthesia, two small incisions are made immediately below the sternotomy incision which provide exit points for [[chest tube]]s used to drain fluid from the thoracic cavity, with one tube placed at the front and another at the rear of the heart.\n\nThe patient returns to the ICU post-operatively for recovery, maintenance, and close observation; recovery time may vary, but tends to average approximately two weeks, after which the patient may be transferred to a [[Transitional Care Unit]] ('''TCU'''), and eventually to a [[cardiac ward]].\n\nPost-operative care is very similar to the palliative care received, with the exception that the patient no longer requires PGE or the surgical palliation procedures. Additionally, the patient is kept on a cooling blanket for a period of time to prevent [[fever]], which could cause [[brain damage]]. The sternum is not closed immediately which allows extra space in the [[thoracic cavity]], preventing excess pressure on the heart, which [[Edema|swells]] considerably following the surgery; the sternum and incision are closed after a few days, when swelling is sufficiently reduced.\n\n===Follow-up===\nThe infant will continue to see a [[cardiologist]] on a regular basis. Although these appointments are required less frequently as time goes on, they will continue throughout the lifetime of the individual, and may increase in the event of complications or as the individual approaches [[middle age]].\n\nThe cardiology exam may include an echocardiogram, EKG, and/or [[cardiac stress test]] in addition to consultation.\n\nAdditionally, some individuals may require ongoing medication therapy at home, which may include diuretics (such as [[furosemide]] or [[spironolactone]]), analgesics (such as [[paracetamol]]), cardiac glycosides (such as [[digoxin]]), [[anticoagulant]]s (such as [[heparin]] or [[aspirin]]), or other medications. If the individual has undergone stenting, an anticoagulant will be a necessity to prevent build-up around the stent(s), as the body will perceive the foreign body as a wound and attempt to heal it.\n\nSome patients who had alternate corrective surgery, such as the Mustard or Senning procedure, may have issues with SA and VA nodal transmissions in later life. Typical symptoms include palpitations and problems with low heart rates. This is commonly solved with a Pacemaker unit, providing scar tissue from the original operation does not block its functionality.\n\nMore recently, ACE inhibitors have been prescribed to patients in the hope of relieving stress on the heart.\n==Prognosis==\nWith simple d-TGA, if the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus are allowed to close naturally, the newborn will likely not survive long enough to receive corrective surgery. With complex d-TGA, the infant will fail to thrive and is unlikely to survive longer than a year if corrective surgery is not performed. In most cases, the patient's condition will deteriorate to the point of inoperability  if the defect is not corrected in the first year.\n\nWhile the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus are open after birth, some mixing of red and blue blood occurs allowing a small amount of oxygen to be delivered to the body; if ASD, VSD, PFO, and/or PDA are present, this will allow a higher amount of the red and blue blood to be mixed, therefore delivering more oxygen to the body, but can complicate and lengthen the corrective surgery and/or be [[symptomatic]].\n\nModern repair procedures within the ideal timeframe and without additional complications have a very high success rate.\n\n==Epidemiology==\n*Heart defects are the most common [[congenital disorder|birth defect]], occurring in approximately 1% of live births\n*Approximately one million people worldwide are currently living with a CHD\n*Having a child with a CHD increases an individual\u2019s chances of having another child with a CHD from 1% to 3%. Subsequent children born with a CHD increase that individual\u2019s chances further.\n{{Dynamic list}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[levo-Transposition of the great arteries]]\n*[[Transposition of the great vessels]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{eMedicine|ped|2548}}\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     =  \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|Q|20|3|q|20}}  \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|745.10}} \n|  ICDO           =  \n|  OMIM           = 608808 \n|  MedlinePlus    =  \n|  eMedicineSubj  =  \n|  eMedicineTopic =  \n|  MeshID         = \n}}\n\n\n\n{{Congenital malformations and deformations of circulatory system}}\n\n[[Category:Congenital heart defects]]\n", "name_user": "LouisTheFox1997", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextro-Transposition_of_the_great_arteries"}
