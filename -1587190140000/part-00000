The orientation of the 3.4 V8 engine block is unique in ''Mondial t'' models. Mirroring the two-seater Ferrari V8 vehicles, all 3.0 and 3.2 l engines sit across the car with their crankshaft and [[Cylinder bank|cylinder planes]] [[Transverse engine|transverse]] to the main vehicle axis. The 3.4 l engine in the ''Mondial t'' (and 348 GTB cousin) is rotated ninety degrees to a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinal]] orientation with respect to the car.<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nIn the Mondial 8 the V8 employs two valves-per-cylinder, and this increases to [[Multi-valve|four valves-per-cylinder]] for the ''Quattrovalvole'' QV and all later models.<ref name=\"Ferrari-QV\"/> All models feature a cast-alloy intake housing nestled centrally above the engine \"vee\" with [[Inlet manifold|manifold tubing]] running directly to each cylinder.

Instead of the conventional \"H\" [[Gear stick#Shift pattern|shift pattern]], this arrangement (also known as a \"reverse h-gate\") has 1st gear situated to the far left and back, behind reverse. This pattern has been popular with racing gearboxes, as it allows quicker, more direct shifts between 2nd and 3rd, and 4th and 5th, gears. Output from the final drive to the rear wheels is via a pair of short, solid [[drive shaft]]s fitted with [[constant-velocity joint]]s at each end to allow for suspension articulation.\n\nFor these models, clutch actuation is hydraulic, unlike their two-seater cousins' cable systems, and transmission selection is via a rod which extends through the centre chassis tunnel and passes through the engine sump into the transmission housing.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}\n\nFor the Mondial t, the engine and transmission were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the transmission input shafts parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined [[transaxle]] arrangement fitted to the rear of the engine block, using a design originally derived from [[Ferrari 312T|Ferrari's 312T]] [[Formula 1]] car. Drive from the single-plate clutch enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by [[bevel gear]]s to the main transmission shafts which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel [[Differential (mechanical device)|crownwheel]] with integral [[Limited-slip differential|limited-slip]] action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is hydraulically-actuated, and gear selection is via cable operation.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nAn \"auto-clutch\" option was available on the Mondial t, developed by French supplier [[Valeo]]. Essentially turning the transmission from a conventional manual to an automated manual, this system retained the conventional manual transmission mechanicals but replaced the normal clutch mechanism with an electrohydraulic one without a foot-operated clutch pedal. Clutch engagement and disengagement on the Valeo unit is triggered by movement of the gear-lever, although the electronic control unit combines data from sources including engine, road-speed and gear selection to warn against, or over-ride, attempted selections outside the specified operating limits.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\n===Suspension and running gear===\n\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial Wheels.png|thumb|Mondial '''8''' and '''QV''' wheel (left)<br/>Mondial '''3.2''' and '''t''' wheel (right)]]\nAlthough based on the two-seater vehicle designs, Mondials are slightly larger overall including having appreciably wider front and rear [[Axle track|track]] dimensions.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|38, 60}} Suspension systems are [[Independent suspension|fully independent]] all-round, comprising unequal-length [[Double wishbone suspension|upper and lower wishbones]], coil-over [[Shock absorber|damper]] units and [[anti-roll bar]]s at each end of the vehicle.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|77\u201378}} Mondial t vehicles include a driver-adjustable selector to set the electronically controlled damper units, providing three choices of [[Ride quality|ride-stiffness]] adjustment.<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nSteering is a [[rack-and-pinion]] mechanism sitting ahead of the front wheels, unpowered on all 8, QV and 3.2 models. Hydraulic power-assistance was standard on the subsequent Mondial t model. Braking is via four-wheel [[Disc brake|ventilated disks]] with split-circuit vacuum assistance on all vehicles. [[Anti-lock braking]] (ABS) was available as an option in 1987, and it was fitted as standard from 1988.<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nWheels on all vehicles are of a five-spoke alloy design in a clear-lacquered finish. Two distinct patterns were used: the Mondial 8 and QV models have wheels with a flat centre and pronounced edges to the five spokes, whereas the 3.2 and t models' wheels have a [[Convex curve|convex]] centre and smoother, angled spokes. All wheels feature a yellow circular centre cap bearing Ferrari's black ''[[Cavallino Rampante]]'' rearing-horse logo.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|78\u201389}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-3.2\"/>\n\nMondials until the late 1980s, including all 8 and QV models and many 3.2s, were originally fitted with [[Michelin TRX]] tyres of size 220/55 VR 390 front and 240/55 VR390 rear. TRX tyres require wheels with the proprietary TRX [[Rim (wheel)|rim profile]], meaning all vehicles fitted with such wheels could only utilise TRX-style tyres. Later 3.2 vehicles and the Mondial t reverted to industry-standard wheel designs of size 7x16 front and 8x16 rear, enabling a far wider range of tyre choices to suit the 205/55 VR16 front and 225/55 VR16 rear tyre specifications.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|78\u201379}}\n\n===Interior===\n\n[[File:Ferrari-Mondial-3.2-interior-rear.jpg|thumb|Ferrari 3.2 Coupe interior]]\nThe seats and interior of all Mondial variants are fully trimmed in [[Connolly Leather|Connolly hide]] with the exception of the use of black vinyl for the [[dashboard]] top and upper door linings. Paint, upholstery and carpet colours generally match those available on Ferrari's concurrent two-seater models, with the commonest choices being Rosso Corsa or Rosso Dino (reds), Azzurro (blue) and Nero (black), in combination with beige, tan or black leather. All seats including those in the rear are strongly [[Bucket seat|bucket-shaped]], and fitted with [[Seat belt|inertia-reel seatbelts]].<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|66\u201371}}\n\nA central tunnel for the chassis structure is prominent in both front and rear footwells, and is straddled by a large front [[Center console (automobile)|centre console]] with a polished open-gated gear selector and electronic warning-light panel. Electric windows (the front panes only are opening) and air-conditioning are standard fitments, with their controls on the central console. The [[parking brake|handbrake]] is located outside the driver's seat beside the inner sill, and is a \"drop-down\" design to assist ingress and egress. A three-spoked leather steering wheel is mounted to a [[steering column]] adjustable for reach and rake, behind which is a \"pod-style\" instrument binnacle holding six gauges: speedometer, tachometer, fuel level, water temperature, oil pressure and oil temperature. The Mondial instrumentation is completed with a comprehensive set of warning lights and electronic check panels.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|66\u201373}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe Mondial was, at the time, one of Ferrari's most commercially successful models, with over 6,000 examples produced over its thirteen-year run. The Mondial underwent many updates throughout its production with four distinct variants produced: the Mondial 8, Mondial QV, Mondial 3.2, and Mondial t. All but the Mondial 8 were released in both coup\u00e9 and cabriolet (convertible) body form.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}\n\nStarting with the Mondial 8 [[coup\u00e9]] launched in 1980, the vehicle which served as sole V8-engined [[Grand Touring]] or \"GT\" vehicle within the Ferrari range proved to be a disappointment to some Ferrari enthusiasts. With a body that was larger, heavier and less [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamically efficient]] than the equivalent two-seater models, combined with the introduction of tougher [[emission standards]] which significantly dropped power outputs, overall vehicle performance inevitably decreased. In addition, Ferrari responded to new safety requirements, especially in the U.S., with large, black, over-dominant bumpers which were considered to have negatively affected the external design. The fact that the Mondial 8 was a significantly more expensive vehicle than its better-performing two-seater [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi|308 GTBi]] sister somewhat compounded the situation.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-8\"/>\n\nFerrari acted quickly just two years later in 1982 to address the straight-line performance issues, by upgrading the engine with a new [[Multi-valve|four-valve head]]. This model, the Mondial Quattrovalvole or QV, shared its engine with the contemporary two-seaters [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTB/GTS QV]]. A new [[cabriolet]] version was also introduced at this time, a body style which would be carried forward through all subsequent Mondial models.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-QV\"/>\n\nThe next evolution was the Mondial 3.2 produced from 1985, which saw the engine grow in [[Displacement (engine)|displacement]] and power, and both the internal and external styling significantly refreshed.

The introduction of the Cabriolet saw the popularity of the Mondial rise, particularly in the American market, where a convertible option was highly desirable. The Cabriolet has the added distinction of being the only four-seat, [[RMR layout|mid-rear engine]], convertible automobile ever manufactured in [[Production car|regular production]]. 629 units were produced between 1983 and 1985, making this the rarest version of the Mondial.\n\nMondial QV Cabriolet\nProduction started: 1983.\nProduction ended: 1985.\nTotal production: 629 (27 Right Hand Drive) \u2013 282 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 47247.\nLast serial number: 59163.\n[[File:1983 or 84 Ferrari Mondial qv rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of Mondial Quattrovalvole]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Mondial 3.2==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Ferrari]] -->\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial 3.2\n| image = Ferrari-Mondial-3.2-side.jpg\n| production = 1985&ndash;1988\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]<br/> 2+2 [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]]\n| layout = [[Transverse engine|Transverse]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,535|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,795|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,235|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br/>{{Convert|1,265|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (Cabriolet)\n| weight = {{Convert|1,540|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}<br/> {{Convert|1,607|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (Cabriolet)\n| engine = 3.2&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F105C]]'' [[multivalve|4v]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n}}\nLike the new [[Ferrari 328]], the Mondial's engine grew in both bore and stroke to 3.2&nbsp;L (3,185&nbsp;cc) in 1985.

Fuel injection remained the primarily mechanical Bosch K-Jetronic (CIS) with an O<sub>2</sub> sensor in the exhaust providing feedback to a simple computer for mixture trimming via a pulse modulated frequency valve that regulated control fuel pressure. The ignition system was Marelli Microplex, with electronic advance control and one distributor per bank of the [[V8 engine|V8]]. The 1988 Mondial 3.2 would be the final model year that retained the relatively low maintenance costs of the 308/328 drivetrain, allowing major service items like timing belt and clutch replacement performed with the engine/transmission package still in the car.\n\n3.2 Mondial Coupe\nProduction started: 1985.\nProduction ended: 1988.\nTotal production: 987 (91 Right Hand Drive) \u2013 87 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 59165.\nLast serial number: 79671.\n\n3.2 Mondial Cabriolet\nProduction started: 1985.\nProduction ended: 1988.\nTotal production: 810, (57 Right Hand Drive) \u2013 449 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 59393.\nLast serial number: 78895.\n\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial 3.2 Cabriolet in NJ.jpg|thumb|left|Ferrari Mondial 3.2 Cabriolet]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Mondial t==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial t\n| image = Mondial_t_1.jpg\n| production = 1988&ndash;1993 (MY 1989-1993) Coupe: 858 (45 RHD)<br>43 Imported to USA/Canada <BR>Cabriolet: 1,017 (51 RHD)<br>379 Imported to USA\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]<br/> 2+2 [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]]\n| layout = [[Longitudinal engine|Longitudinal]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| engine = 3.4&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F119D/G]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />Valeo&nbsp;[[Semi-automatic transmission|auto-manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,535|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,810|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,235|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{Convert|1,560|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}<br/> {{Convert|1,570|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (Cabriolet)\n}}\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial t 002.JPG|thumb|right|Mondial t coupe]]\n\nThe final Mondial evolution was 1989's '''Mondial t''' (Coupe and Cabriolet). It was a substantially changed model, \"spearhead of a new generation of V8 Ferraris\", according to ''[[Road & Track]]'' magazine. It was visually different from preceding Mondial models, the most recognizable being the redesign of the air intakes to a smaller rectangular shape. Additionally, the door-handles were of a visually different design, as were the front and rear bumpers which became body colored. New front and rear wings cover wider tracks and are re-profiled to a fuller shape compared to previous models, which feature a rolled lip.\n\nThe 't' called attention to the car's new engine/transmission layout: the previously transverse engine mounted [[longitudinal engine|longitudinal]]ly while the gearbox remained transverse, thus forming a 't'. The 't' suffix was also homage to the first use of a transverse transmission by Ferrari in the highly successful [[Ferrari 312T]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topspeed.com/cars/ferrari/1989-1993-ferrari-mondial-t-ar79488.html|title=1989 - 1993 Ferrari Mondial T Review @ Top Speed|website=Top Speed|language=en|access-date=2017-08-21}}</ref> driven by [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|F1 World Champion]] [[Niki Lauda]]. By adopting this layout, a longer engine could be mounted lower in the chassis, improving handling dramatically. The 't' configuration was used by Ferrari's [[Formula One]] cars of the 1980s, and would be the standard for the marque's future mid-engined V8 cars, beginning with the [[Ferrari 348|348]], introduced later in the year. The transverse manual gearbox fitted with a [[Limited Slip Differential]] with a twin-plate clutch design with bevel gears driving the wheels. Later in production, an [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| electromechanical manual transmission]] termed \"Valeo\" was available as an option; while shifting was using a traditional gearshift, the clutch was automatically actuated without a clutch pedal.\n\nThe new layout saw the engine and transmission mounted on a removable subframe; the assembly removed from the underside of the vehicle for maintenance. This process is necessary for timing belt replacement, making this a costly procedure for the owner who does not have a lift. On the other hand, the clutch was now located at the very rear of the drive train. This arrangement makes clutch replacement and service a simple, inexpensive, and readily owner-doable proposition.\n\nThe engine was up to 3.4&nbsp;L (3405&nbsp;cc) and 300&nbsp;hp (224&nbsp;kW). The engine controlled by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic|Motronic DME 2.5]] (later DME 2.7) electronic engine management that integrated [[Fuel injection|EFI]] and ignition control into a single computer unit. Two of these used in the car: one for each bank of the engine. Engine lubrication upgraded to a dry-sump system.\n\nThe \"t\" was home to other Ferrari firsts: It used power assisted steering for the first time and had a 3-position electronically controlled suspension for a variable tradeoff between ride quality and road holding. It also had standard [[antilock braking system]].\n\nThe Mondial t represented the most substantial upgrade to the Mondial model line in performance and handling since its introduction in 1980. The \"t\" offered greater performance while retaining a mid-engined layout and a practical packaging layout, and was once again, favorably received.\n\nThe Mondial's chassis would underpin a new generation of 2-seat Ferraris, right up to the [[Ferrari 360]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mondialt.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/autocar0509_large.jpg|title=Steve Cropley}}</ref>, but the 2+2 Mondial would end production just four and a half years later in 1993. However, the \"t\" layout of the engine and transaxle, adapted from Ferrari's Formula One cars, continues to be used in mid-engined V8 model Ferraris to date, albeit with a more sophisticated chassis.\n\nThe company has not produced a mid-engined 2+2 car since then, leaving the 2+2 configuration to the more classic front-engined design starting with the [[Ferrari 456|456]] in 1992.  As of 2018, the V12 [[Ferrari GTC4Lusso|GTC4Lusso]] and both the twin-turbocharged V8 [[Ferrari GTC4Lusso T |GTC4Lusso T]] and [[Ferrari Portofino|Portofino]] are the company's only 4-seat vehicle offerings, but both of these are front engined, leaving the Mondial t as the most modern 4-seat, mid-engined, Ferrari yet produced in 25 years.\n\nMondial t Coupe:\n*Production started: 1988.\n*Production ended: 1993.\n*Total production: 858  (45 Right Hand Drive) - 43 Imported to US/CA\n*First serial number: 79596.\n*Last serial number: 97698.\n\nMondial t Cabriolet:\n*Production started: 1989.\n*Production ended: 1993.\n*Total production: 1,017 (51 Right Hand Drive) - 379 Imported to US/CA\n*First serial number: 80399.\n*Last serial number: 97733.\n\n===PPG Indy Pace Car===\nA Mondial-t was manufactured exclusively by Ferrari for [[PPG Industries]] to use as a [[safety car|pace car]] for the [[Champ Car|PPG Indy Car World Series]].

Historical negative commentary fall under four categories: performance, reliability, price and aesthetics.\n\nIn regards to performance, there was a question of the straight line speed for only the first model, the United States variant (which had additional performance-inhibiting emissions control equipment) of the Mondial 8 (80-82).  The United States variant of the Mondial 8 represents only 147 (or 2%) of the over 6,000 examples produced during the vehicle's lifetime.  There were three formal road tests for the United States variant of the Mondial 8 in 1980.  Two trials (Car and Driver/Road & Track) lamented straight line speed, one (Motor Trend) test applauded it.<ref name=\"MotorTrend\" />  Handling is universally praised by the press at the time for all models (including the Mondial 8) and straight-line performance on par with other exotics for all subsequent iterations.  \n\nReliability is another common critique.  The Mondial 8, QV, and 3.2 lines shares the exact powertrain and many parts as the 308/328, both regarded as the more reliable Ferrari.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/c12-0606-buyers-guide-1975-1989-ferrari-308-302-gtb-gts/|title=308/328 Buyer's Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Mondial is often described as the 'entry-level' Ferrari.  The reality is the Mondial was substantially more expensive than the 308/328 when new.\n\nThe view of the Mondial's aesthetics has always been a matter of debate.  Given the subjective nature of visual design, it is the one criticism that has merit based only on personal judgment.\n\n''I think it's Ferrari's most elegant car...the Mondial's shape is perfect...In short, the Mondial is the one Ferrari that causes heads to turn in appreciation rather than shock.''\n\n-John Phillips III of Automobile 1987<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alexachua.com/1987_auto.pdf|title=Automobile Mondial 3.2 Review|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n''The styling of the Ferrari Mondial Coupe indeed of most Ferraris is best described as timeless; the Pininfarina penned lines still look fresh after eleven years and have influenced the design of sports cars from Detroit to Tokyo''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJohn Davis\n\n-MotorWeek\n\n''\"At its launch in 1980, the Mondial 8 was criticized for its styling, weight and lacklustre performance, but time has been kind to the eight-cylinder Fezza.

Instead of the conventional \"H\" [[Gear stick#Shift pattern|shift pattern]], this arrangement (also known as a \"reverse h-gate\") has 1st gear situated to the far left and back, behind reverse. This pattern has been popular with racing gearboxes, as it allows quicker, more direct shifts between 2nd and 3rd, and 4th and 5th, gears. Output from the final drive to the rear wheels is via a pair of short, solid [[drive shaft]]s fitted with [[constant-velocity joint]]s at each end to allow for suspension articulation.\n\nFor these models, clutch actuation is hydraulic, unlike their two-seater cousins' cable systems, and transmission selection is via a rod which extends through the centre chassis tunnel and passes through the engine sump into the transmission housing.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}\n\nFor the Mondial t, the engine and transmission were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the transmission input shafts parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined [[transaxle]] arrangement fitted to the rear of the engine block, using a design originally derived from [[Ferrari 312T|Ferrari's 312T]] [[Formula 1]] car. Drive from the single-plate clutch enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by [[bevel gear]]s to the main transmission shafts which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel [[Differential (mechanical device)|crownwheel]] with integral [[Limited-slip differential|limited-slip]] action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is hydraulically-actuated, and gear selection is via cable operation.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nAn \"auto-clutch\" option was available on the Mondial t, developed by French supplier [[Valeo]]. Essentially turning the transmission from a conventional manual to an automated manual, this system retained the conventional manual transmission mechanicals but replaced the normal clutch mechanism with an electrohydraulic one without a foot-operated clutch pedal. Clutch engagement and disengagement on the Valeo unit is triggered by movement of the gear-lever, although the electronic control unit combines data from sources including engine, road-speed and gear selection to warn against, or over-ride, attempted selections outside the specified operating limits.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\n===Suspension and running gear===\n\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial Wheels.png|thumb|Mondial '''8''' and '''QV''' wheel (left)<br/>Mondial '''3.2''' and '''t''' wheel (right)]]\nAlthough based on the two-seater vehicle designs, Mondials are slightly larger overall including having appreciably wider front and rear [[Axle track|track]] dimensions.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|38, 60}} Suspension systems are [[Independent suspension|fully independent]] all-round, comprising unequal-length [[Double wishbone suspension|upper and lower wishbones]], coil-over [[Shock absorber|damper]] units and [[anti-roll bar]]s at each end of the vehicle.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|77\u201378}} Mondial t vehicles include a driver-adjustable selector to set the electronically controlled damper units, providing three choices of [[Ride quality|ride-stiffness]] adjustment.<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nSteering is a [[rack-and-pinion]] mechanism sitting ahead of the front wheels, unpowered on all 8, QV and 3.2 models. Hydraulic power-assistance was standard on the subsequent Mondial t model. Braking is via four-wheel [[Disc brake|ventilated disks]] with split-circuit vacuum assistance on all vehicles. [[Anti-lock braking]] (ABS) was available as an option in 1987, and it was fitted as standard from 1988.<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nWheels on all vehicles are of a five-spoke alloy design in a clear-lacquered finish. Two distinct patterns were used: the Mondial 8 and QV models have wheels with a flat centre and pronounced edges to the five spokes, whereas the 3.2 and t models' wheels have a [[Convex curve|convex]] centre and smoother, angled spokes. All wheels feature a yellow circular centre cap bearing Ferrari's black ''[[Cavallino Rampante]]'' rearing-horse logo.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|78\u201389}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-3.2\"/>\n\nMondials until the late 1980s, including all 8 and QV models and many 3.2s, were originally fitted with [[Michelin TRX]] tyres of size 220/55 VR 390 front and 240/55 VR390 rear. TRX tyres require wheels with the proprietary TRX [[Rim (wheel)|rim profile]], meaning all vehicles fitted with such wheels could only utilise TRX-style tyres. Later 3.2 vehicles and the Mondial t reverted to industry-standard wheel designs of size 7x16 front and 8x16 rear, enabling a far wider range of tyre choices to suit the 205/55 VR16 front and 225/55 VR16 rear tyre specifications.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|78\u201379}}\n\n===Interior===\n\n[[File:Ferrari-Mondial-3.2-interior-rear.jpg|thumb|Ferrari 3.2 Coupe interior]]\nThe seats and interior of all Mondial variants are fully trimmed in [[Connolly Leather|Connolly hide]] with the exception of the use of black vinyl for the [[dashboard]] top and upper door linings. Paint, upholstery and carpet colours generally match those available on Ferrari's concurrent two-seater models, with the commonest choices being Rosso Corsa or Rosso Dino (reds), Azzurro (blue) and Nero (black), in combination with beige, tan or black leather. All seats including those in the rear are strongly [[Bucket seat|bucket-shaped]], and fitted with [[Seat belt|inertia-reel seatbelts]].<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|66\u201371}}\n\nA central tunnel for the chassis structure is prominent in both front and rear footwells, and is straddled by a large front [[Center console (automobile)|centre console]] with a polished open-gated gear selector and electronic warning-light panel. Electric windows (the front panes only are opening) and air-conditioning are standard fitments, with their controls on the central console. The [[parking brake|handbrake]] is located outside the driver's seat beside the inner sill, and is a \"drop-down\" design to assist ingress and egress. A three-spoked leather steering wheel is mounted to a [[steering column]] adjustable for reach and rake, behind which is a \"pod-style\" instrument binnacle holding six gauges: speedometer, tachometer, fuel level, water temperature, oil pressure and oil temperature. The Mondial instrumentation is completed with a comprehensive set of warning lights and electronic check panels.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|66\u201373}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe Mondial was, at the time, one of Ferrari's most commercially successful models, with over 6,000 examples produced over its thirteen-year run. The Mondial underwent many updates throughout its production with four distinct variants produced: the Mondial 8, Mondial QV, Mondial 3.2, and Mondial t. All but the Mondial 8 were released in both coup\u00e9 and cabriolet (convertible) body form.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}\n\nStarting with the Mondial 8 [[coup\u00e9]] launched in 1980, the vehicle which served as sole V8-engined [[Grand Touring]] or \"GT\" vehicle within the Ferrari range proved to be a disappointment to some Ferrari enthusiasts. With a body that was larger, heavier and less [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamically efficient]] than the equivalent two-seater models, combined with the introduction of tougher [[emission standards]] which significantly dropped power outputs, overall vehicle performance inevitably decreased. In addition, Ferrari responded to new safety requirements, especially in the U.S., with large, black, over-dominant bumpers which were considered to have negatively affected the external design. The fact that the Mondial 8 was a significantly more expensive vehicle than its better-performing two-seater [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi|308 GTBi]] sister somewhat compounded the situation.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-8\"/>\n\nFerrari acted quickly just two years later in 1982 to address the straight-line performance issues, by upgrading the engine with a new [[Multi-valve|four-valve head]]. This model, the Mondial Quattrovalvole or QV, shared its engine with the contemporary two-seaters [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTB/GTS QV]]. A new [[cabriolet]] version was also introduced at this time, a body style which would be carried forward through all subsequent Mondial models.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-QV\"/>\n\nThe next evolution was the Mondial 3.2 produced from 1985, which saw the engine grow in [[Displacement (engine)|displacement]] and power, and both the internal and external styling significantly refreshed. This car has enjoyed strong popularity within the Mondial range due to it being a good all-round performer and one of the last Ferraris to have the relatively straightforward maintenance provided by the [[Ferrari 328]] engine and transmission configuration.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-3.2\"/>\n\nThe final Mondial variant was the Mondial t, released in 1989. This contained some of the biggest changes in the Mondial history, with an even-larger {{convert|3.4|l|cuin|abbr=on}} engine, a substantial update to the exterior styling and interior [[ergonomics]], and with an entirely new, albeit more complex to service,  [[powertrain]]. Overall the Mondial t is considered the best vehicle in the range regarding overall performance and refinement, although it is often noted that this comes at the cost of greater maintenance.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nProduction of the Mondial ceased in 1993, with a total of 6,149 vehicles from all variants having been manufactured.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|79}}\n\n==Mondial 8==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ferrari]] -->\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial 8\n| image = Ferrari Mondial 8 in Vlaams-Brabant.JPG\n| production = 1980&ndash;1982\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]\n| layout = [[Transverse engine|Transverse]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,580|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,790|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,250|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{Convert|1,569|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F106B]]'' [[fuel injection|FI]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n}}\nThe first Mondial iteration introduced as the '''Mondial 8''' at the [[Geneva Auto Salon#1980|1980 Geneva Auto Salon]].<ref name=\"affordable\">{{cite book|last=Bluemel|first=Keith|title=Mondial The Affordable Ferrari?|type= Magazine scan|publisher     =Unique Motor Books | isbn= 978-1-84155-584-3| page= 54}}</ref> It was the first Ferrari to depart from the company's simple 3-digit naming scheme, and some reviews found it relatively mild, compared to other Ferraris, regarding performance, drawing criticism from some in the motoring press.<ref name=\"affordable\" /> It used a [[MR layout|mid/rear-mounted]] [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Jetronic|K-Jetronic]] fuel injection [[V8 engine|V8]], shared with the [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTBi/GTSi]], mounted [[transverse engine|transversely]]. The engine used in the 1973 [[Ferrari Dino#Dino 308 GT4|''Dino'' 308 GT4]]. The K-Jetronic system is mechanical, with a high-pressure pump which streams fuel continuously to the injectors; it does not have a computer, just a few relays to handle the cold start sequence etc.\nThe chassis was also based on the [[Ferrari GT4|308 GT4]], but with a {{convert|100|mm|in|adj=mid|-longer|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase at {{convert|2650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The suspension was the classic layout of unequal-length [[double wishbone]]s and Koni dampers all around.\n\nToday, the Mondial 8 is considered one of the marque's most \"practical\" vehicles, due to its 214&nbsp;hp (160&nbsp;kW), proven drivetrain, four seats, and relatively low cost of maintenance (major services  performed without removing the entire engine/transmission subframe). 703 examples made.  At the time of release, the base price was $64,000 (1981) (or $167,530 in 2015 dollars.)\n\nThe Mondial 8 is often the target of negative perceptions due to what many considered unworthy performance for the marque.\nTwo of the three major US automotive publications (''Road & Track'', ''Car and Driver'') yielded negative performance results that found the Mondial much slower than the [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTBi/GTSi]]\n\n''[[Road & Track]]'' November 1981<ref name=\"roadandtrack.com\"/>*(Reported faulty shifter)\n0\u201360: 9.4s\n1/4 Mile: 17.1s\n\n''[[Car and Driver]]'' November 1981<ref name=\"caranddriver.com\"/>*(Pre-production model)\n0\u201360: 9.3s\n1/4 Mile: 16.9s\n\nIn contradistinction, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' yielded better performance numbers nearing the [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTBi/GTSi]]: ''Motor Trend'' November 1981<ref name=\"MotorTrend\">{{cite web|url=http://alexachua.com/1981_mt.pdf |title=Ferrari Mondial 8 Review |publisher=motortrend.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}</ref>\n0\u201360: 8.2\n1/4 Mile: 16.3\n\nMondial 8\nProduction started: 1980.\nProduction ended: 1982.\nTotal production: 703 (145 Right Hand Drive) \u2013 147 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 31075.\nLast serial number: 41727.\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial 8 RB.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of Mondial 8]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Mondial Quattrovalvole==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ferrari]] -->\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial QV (''Quattrovalvole'')\n| image = Lancia Motor Club Goodwood Track Day 2010 IMG 9907 - Flickr - tonylanciabeta.jpg\n| production = 1982&ndash;1985\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]<br/> 2+2 [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]]\n| layout = [[Transverse engine|Transverse]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| engine = 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F105A]]'' [[Multi-valve|32V]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,580|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,790|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,260|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{Convert|1,555|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}<br/> {{Convert|1,607|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (Cabriolet)\n}}\nThe first Mondial engine, although a [[DOHC]] design, used just two valves per cylinder.

Fuel injection remained the primarily mechanical Bosch K-Jetronic (CIS) with an O<sub>2</sub> sensor in the exhaust providing feedback to a simple computer for mixture trimming via a pulse modulated frequency valve that regulated control fuel pressure.

The 1988 Mondial 3.2 would be the final model year that retained the relatively low maintenance costs of the 308/328 drivetrain, allowing major service items like timing belt and clutch replacement performed with the engine/transmission package still in the car.\n\n3.2 Mondial Coupe\nProduction started: 1985.\nProduction ended: 1988.\nTotal production: 987 (91 Right Hand Drive) - 87 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 59165.\nLast serial number: 79671.\n\n3.2 Mondial Cabriolet\nProduction started: 1985.\nProduction ended: 1988.\nTotal production: 810, (57 Right Hand Drive) - 449 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 59393.\nLast serial number: 78895.\n\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial 3.2 Cabriolet in NJ.jpg|thumb|left|Ferrari Mondial 3.2 Cabriolet]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Mondial t==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial t\n| image = Mondial_t_1.jpg\n| production = 1988&ndash;1993 (MY 1989-1993) Coupe: 858 (45 RHD)<br>43 Imported to USA/Canada <BR>Cabriolet: 1,017 (51 RHD)<br>379 Imported to USA\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]<br/> 2+2 [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]]\n| layout = [[Longitudinal engine|Longitudinal]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| engine = 3.4&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F119D/G]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />Valeo&nbsp;[[Semi-automatic transmission|auto-manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,535|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,810|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,235|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{Convert|1,560|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}<br/> {{Convert|1,570|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (Cabriolet)\n}}\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial t 002.JPG|thumb|right|Mondial t coupe]]\n\nThe final Mondial evolution was 1989's '''Mondial t''' (Coupe and Cabriolet). It was a substantially changed model, \"spearhead of a new generation of V8 Ferraris\", according to ''[[Road & Track]]'' magazine. It was visually different from preceding Mondial models, the most recognizable being the redesign of the air intakes to a smaller rectangular shape. Additionally, the door-handles were of a visually different design, as were the front and rear bumpers which became body colored. New front and rear wings cover wider tracks and are re-profiled to a fuller shape compared to previous models, which feature a rolled lip.\n\nThe 't' called attention to the car's new engine/transmission layout: the previously transverse engine mounted [[longitudinal engine|longitudinal]]ly while the gearbox remained transverse, thus forming a 't'. The 't' suffix was also homage to the first use of a transverse transmission by Ferrari in the highly successful [[Ferrari 312T]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topspeed.com/cars/ferrari/1989-1993-ferrari-mondial-t-ar79488.html|title=1989 - 1993 Ferrari Mondial T Review @ Top Speed|website=Top Speed|language=en|access-date=2017-08-21}}</ref> driven by [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|F1 World Champion]] [[Niki Lauda]]. By adopting this layout, a longer engine could be mounted lower in the chassis, improving handling dramatically. The 't' configuration was used by Ferrari's [[Formula One]] cars of the 1980s, and would be the standard for the marque's future mid-engined V8 cars, beginning with the [[Ferrari 348|348]], introduced later in the year. The transverse manual gearbox fitted with a [[Limited Slip Differential]] with a twin-plate clutch design with bevel gears driving the wheels. Later in production, an [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| electromechanical manual transmission]] termed \"Valeo\" was available as an option; while shifting was using a traditional gearshift, the clutch was automatically actuated without a clutch pedal.\n\nThe new layout saw the engine and transmission mounted on a removable subframe; the assembly removed from the underside of the vehicle for maintenance. This process is necessary for timing belt replacement, making this a costly procedure for the owner who does not have a lift. On the other hand, the clutch was now located at the very rear of the drive train. This arrangement makes clutch replacement and service a simple, inexpensive, and readily owner-doable proposition.\n\nThe engine was up to 3.4&nbsp;L (3405&nbsp;cc) and 300&nbsp;hp (224&nbsp;kW). The engine controlled by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic|Motronic DME 2.5]] (later DME 2.7) electronic engine management that integrated [[Fuel injection|EFI]] and ignition control into a single computer unit. Two of these used in the car: one for each bank of the engine. Engine lubrication upgraded to a dry-sump system.\n\nThe \"t\" was home to other Ferrari firsts: It used power assisted steering for the first time and had a 3-position electronically controlled suspension for a variable tradeoff between ride quality and road holding. It also had standard [[antilock braking system]].\n\nThe Mondial t represented the most substantial upgrade to the Mondial model line in performance and handling since its introduction in 1980. The \"t\" offered greater performance while retaining a mid-engined layout and a practical packaging layout, and was once again, favorably received.\n\nThe Mondial's chassis would underpin a new generation of 2-seat Ferraris, right up to the [[Ferrari 360]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mondialt.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/autocar0509_large.jpg|title=Steve Cropley}}</ref>, but the 2+2 Mondial would end production just four and a half years later in 1993. However, the \"t\" layout of the engine and transaxle, adapted from Ferrari's Formula One cars, continues to be used in mid-engined V8 model Ferraris to date, albeit with a more sophisticated chassis.\n\nThe company has not produced a mid-engined 2+2 car since then, leaving the 2+2 configuration to the more classic front-engined design starting with the [[Ferrari 456|456]] in 1992.  As of 2018, the V12 [[Ferrari GTC4Lusso|GTC4Lusso]] and both the twin-turbocharged V8 [[Ferrari GTC4Lusso T |GTC4Lusso T]] and [[Ferrari Portofino|Portofino]] are the company's only 4-seat vehicle offerings, but both of these are front engined, leaving the Mondial t as the most modern 4-seat, mid-engined, Ferrari yet produced in 25 years.\n\nMondial t Coupe:\n*Production started: 1988.\n*Production ended: 1993.\n*Total production: 858  (45 Right Hand Drive) - 43 Imported to US/CA\n*First serial number: 79596.\n*Last serial number: 97698.\n\nMondial t Cabriolet:\n*Production started: 1989.\n*Production ended: 1993.\n*Total production: 1,017 (51 Right Hand Drive) - 379 Imported to US/CA\n*First serial number: 80399.\n*Last serial number: 97733.\n\n===PPG Indy Pace Car===\nA Mondial-t was manufactured exclusively by Ferrari for [[PPG Industries]] to use as a [[safety car|pace car]] for the [[Champ Car|PPG Indy Car World Series]].

Historical negative commentary fall under four categories: performance, reliability, price and aesthetics.\n\nIn regards to performance, there was a question of the straight line speed for only the first model, the United States variant (which had additional performance-inhibiting emissions control equipment) of the Mondial 8 (80-82).  The United States variant of the Mondial 8 represents only 147 (or 2%) of the over 6,000 examples produced during the vehicle's lifetime.  There were three formal road tests for the United States variant of the Mondial 8 in 1980.  Two trials (Car and Driver/Road & Track) lamented straight line speed, one (Motor Trend) test applauded it.<ref name=\"MotorTrend\" />  Handling is universally praised by the press at the time for all models (including the Mondial 8) and straight-line performance on par with other exotics for all subsequent iterations.  \n\nReliability is another common critique.  The Mondial 8, QV, and 3.2 lines shares the exact powertrain and many parts as the 308/328, both regarded as the more reliable Ferrari.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/c12-0606-buyers-guide-1975-1989-ferrari-308-302-gtb-gts/|title=308/328 Buyer's Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Mondial is often described as the 'entry-level' Ferrari.  The reality is the Mondial was substantially more expensive than the 308/328 when new.\n\nThe view of the Mondial's aesthetics has always been a matter of debate.  Given the subjective nature of visual design, it is the one criticism that has merit based only on personal judgment.\n\n''I think it's Ferrari's most elegant car...the Mondial's shape is perfect...In short, the Mondial is the one Ferrari that causes heads to turn in appreciation rather than shock.''\n\n-John Phillips III of Automobile 1987<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alexachua.com/1987_auto.pdf|title=Automobile Mondial 3.2 Review|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n''The styling of the Ferrari Mondial Coupe indeed of most Ferraris is best described as timeless; the Pininfarina penned lines still look fresh after eleven years and have influenced the design of sports cars from Detroit to Tokyo''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJohn Davis\n\n-MotorWeek\n\n''\"At its launch in 1980, the Mondial 8 was criticized for its styling, weight and lacklustre performance, but time has been kind to the eight-cylinder Fezza. In fact, the restrained styling is central to its appeal.''\"\n\n-Motoring Research 2016\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Ferrari Mondial}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite book|author1=Buckley, Martin|author2=Rees, Chris|title=World Encyclopedia of Cars|location=London|publisher=Anness Publishing|year=1998|isbn=1-84038-083-7}}\n\n{{Ferrari car timeline 1970s-1990s}}\n{{Ferrari}}\n\n[[Category:Ferrari vehicles|Mondial]]\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1980]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n", "name_user": "Srich32977", "label": "safe", "comment": "copy edits", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_Mondial"}
