{"title_page": "Social security in Germany", "text_new": "{{short description|Includes all statutory insurance in Germany}}\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2015}}\n'''Social security in Germany''' is codified on the ''Sozialgesetzbuch'' (SGB), or the \"Social Code\", contains 12 main parts, including the following,\n\n*[[Unemployment insurance]] and [[public employment agencies]] (SGB II and III)\n*[[Health insurance]] (SGB V)\n*Old age, widow's/widower's, orphans and disability [[pension insurance]] (SGB VI)\n*[[Invalidity insurance]] (SGB VII and IX)\n*[[Child support]] (SGB VIII)\n*[[Social care]] (SGB XI)\n\n==Unemployment==\n{{main|Unemployment benefits#Germany}}\n=== Unemployment benefit I ===\n\nThe ''unemployment benefit I'' in [[Germany]] is also known as the unemployment insurance. The insurance is administered by the [[Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit]] (Federal Employment Agency, BA) and funded by employee and employer contributions. This in stark contrast to FUTA in the US and other systems; where only employers make contributions. Participation (and thus contributions) are generally mandatory for both employee and employer. All workers with a regular employment contract, except freelancers and certain civil servants, contribute to the system. Since 2006, certain previously excluded workers have been able to opt into the system on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe system is financed by contributions from employees and employers. Employees pay 1.5% of their gross salary below the social security threshold and employers pay 1.5% contribution on top of the salary paid to the employee.

It is viewed as a public problem shared by multiple roles of the society: parents, regional and local governments, non-profit organizations (usually churches) etc. Germany offers a wide range of child care programs for parents: [[Day care|day care centers]] (Krippe) for children up to age 3,  preschool programs ([[Kindergarten]]) for children from age 3 to 6, primary schools (Hort) for school-age children. Around ninety-eight per cent of German daycare is [[Nonprofit organization|non-for-profit]] and is heavily funded by the government. Ninety per cent of the costs are paid by state, regional and local governments through public taxes while the rest of the cost is paid by the parents.<ref>{{Cite book|jstor=10.3138/9781442672178.10|title=Canadian Family Policies|date=1995|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802077868|editor-last=BAKER|editor-first=MAUREEN|series=Cross-National Comparisons|pages=189\u2013235|last1=Baker|first1=Maureen|chapter=Child care delivery and support}}</ref> In western Germany, regulations of day care are enforced by state youth office (Landesjugendamt) in each Land, which distributes funds to day care centers according to a certain amount. Even though the enforcement is in a relatively decentralized form, there is still high conformity on regulatory requirements of the day care centers among different Land. For example, child/staff ratios vary from 17/1 to 25/1; group sizes of 25 in kindergartens; and training requirements for teachers. German child care system values highly of the quality of teaching staffs. In every German Land, a teacher must complete four to five years of training requirements, usually composed of one to two years of [[Prakticum|praktikum]], two years of college, and one year of additional praktikum (berufspraktikum).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gormley|first=William T.|last2=Peters|first2=B.

And the high barrier to enter the market set by the government becomes one of the hinders.\n\nAlthough general condition of the child care system can be applied to most of the cases and regions in Germany, there are noticeably big regional differences, especially between west and east Germany. The regional variations in child care supply reflect the fact that regulations are being made at the local community level. According to Tietze, Rossbach & Roitsch survey in 1994, there are variations in the supply of day care services between rural and urban areas, with rural areas being at a disadvantage. In east Germany, there are much larger number of day care slots than in west Germany and higher rate of child care provision, as an inheritance from its former socialist [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. The opening hours of the day-care centers vary as well. In west Germany the opening hours of Kindergarten are short, only for half of the day; while in east Germany 97% of the kindergarten offers all-day care including lunch.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kreyenfeld|first=Michaela|last2=Hank|first2=Karsten|date=2000|title=Does the Availability of Child Care Influence the Employment of Mothers?

Even for women who have jobs, they usually stop working at the birth of the child because mothers are seen as the best child care providers. 3-year period of [[parental leave]] is provided by the government, with low cash benefits paid under the terms of health insurance. Women tend to stay as housewives when kids are young and return to part-time works after their children grow older.

As high as 85 per cent of adult women, including those with young kids, participate in labor market. For working mothers, there are several informal child care arrangements they could have. Usually they have their children to be cared for by grandparents or other close relatives. Others send their kids to day care centers. 60% of east German children under age 3 are cared for by the day centers and over 90% of children aged 3 to 6 attend full-day preschool program.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kamerman|first=Sheila B.|last2=Kahn|first2=Alfred J.|date=1979|title=Comparative analysis in family policy: a case study|jstor=23713548|journal=Social Work|volume=24|issue=6|pages=506\u2013512|doi=10.1093/sw/24.6.506}}</ref>\n\nApart from maternity leave, parents are also entitled to a paid leave if their children are ill at home.\n\n==Funding==\nThe social security system in Germany is funded through contributions paid by employees and employers.

It is viewed as a public problem shared by multiple roles of the society: parents, regional and local governments, non-profit organizations (usually churches) etc. Germany offers a wide range of child care programs for parents: [[Day care|day care centers]] (Krippe) for children up to age 3,  preschool programs ([[Kindergarten]]) for children from age 3 to 6, primary schools (Hort) for school-age children. Around ninety-eight per cent of German daycare is [[Nonprofit organization|non-for-profit]] and is heavily funded by the government. Ninety per cent of the costs are paid by state, regional and local governments through public taxes while the rest of the cost is paid by the parents.<ref>{{Cite book|jstor=10.3138/9781442672178.10|title=Canadian Family Policies|date=1995|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802077868|editor-last=BAKER|editor-first=MAUREEN|series=Cross-National Comparisons|pages=189\u2013235|last1=Baker|first1=Maureen|chapter=Child care delivery and support}}</ref> In western Germany, regulations of day care are enforced by state youth office (Landesjugendamt) in each Land, which distributes funds to day care centers according to a certain amount. Even though the enforcement is in a relatively decentralized form, there is still high conformity on regulatory requirements of the day care centers among different Land. For example, child/staff ratios vary from 17/1 to 25/1; group sizes of 25 in kindergartens; and training requirements for teachers. German child care system values highly of the quality of teaching staffs. In every German Land, a teacher must complete four to five years of training requirements, usually composed of one to two years of [[Prakticum|praktikum]], two years of college, and one year of additional praktikum (berufspraktikum).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gormley|first=William T.|last2=Peters|first2=B.

There is no big market for private day care in Germany. Only 4% to 10% of mothers employ [[Nanny|child minders]] (Tagespflege) in 1995.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kreyenfeld|first=Michaela|last2=Hank|first2=Karsten|date=2000|title=Does the Availability of Child Care Influence the Employment of Mothers?

And the high barrier to enter the market set by the government becomes one of the hinders.\n\nAlthough general condition of the child care system can be applied to most of the cases and regions in Germany, there are noticeably big regional differences, especially between west and east Germany. The regional variations in child care supply reflect the fact that regulations are being made at the local community level. According to Tietze, Rossbach & Roitsch survey in 1994, there are variations in the supply of day care services between rural and urban areas, with rural areas being at a disadvantage. In east Germany, there are much larger number of day care slots than in west Germany and higher rate of child care provision, as an inheritance from its former socialist [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. The opening hours of the day-care centers vary as well. In west Germany the opening hours of Kindergarten are short, only for half of the day; while in east Germany 97% of the kindergarten offers all-day care including lunch.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kreyenfeld|first=Michaela|last2=Hank|first2=Karsten|date=2000|title=Does the Availability of Child Care Influence the Employment of Mothers?

Thus it explains the fact that Germany aims to provide high-quality early education for children but set the opening hours of day care centers to be short and not convenient to the working parents.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ondrich|first=Jan|last2=Spiess|first2=C.

Having one of the lowest fertility rate among European countries, Germany has on average 1.38 children per woman in 2008 and it keeps on having high level of childlessness among parents.

Even for women who have jobs, they usually stop working at the birth of the child because mothers are seen as the best child care providers. 3-year period of [[parental leave]] is provided by the government, with low cash benefits paid under the terms of health insurance. Women tend to stay as housewives when kids are young and return to part-time works after their children grow older. Full-time employment rates are even lower.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hank|first=Karsten|last2=Kreyenfeld|first2=Michaela|date=2003|title=A Multilevel Analysis of Child Care and Women's Fertility Decisions in Western Germany|jstor=3600025|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=65|issue=3|pages=584\u2013596|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00584.x|url=https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-hsog/frontdoor/index/index/docId/978}}</ref> In east Germany, however, it witnesses one of the highest female labor participation rate among European countries. As high as 85 per cent of adult women, including those with young kids, participate in labor market. For working mothers, there are several informal child care arrangements they could have. Usually they have their children to be cared for by grandparents or other close relatives. Others send their kids to day care centers. 60% of east German children under age 3 are cared for by the day centers and over 90% of children aged 3 to 6 attend full-day preschool program.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kamerman|first=Sheila B.|last2=Kahn|first2=Alfred J.|date=1979|title=Comparative analysis in family policy: a case study|jstor=23713548|journal=Social Work|volume=24|issue=6|pages=506\u2013512|doi=10.1093/sw/24.6.506}}</ref>\n\nApart from maternity leave, parents are also entitled to a paid leave if their children are ill at home.\n\n==Funding==\nThe social security system in Germany is funded through contributions paid by employees and employers.

The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.

The song mentions reading a newspaper as well as seeing two women, one who enters the diner and one who stands outside in the rain. The ringing of bells at a nearby cathedral causes the narrator to reminisce about an unnamed companion and a midnight picnic. At the end of the song, the narrator leaves the diner to catch the train after the coffee is finished.\n\nVega wrote the song based on a comment by her friend Brian Rose, a photographer, who mentioned that in his work, he sometimes felt as if \"he saw his whole life through a pane of glass, and <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> like he was the witness to a lot of things, but was never really involved in them.\" She attempted to think and write in this fashion (including a male perspective<ref name=\"Rustedpipe\"/>) while sitting at Tom's Restaurant. The \"bells of the cathedral\" that she remarks hearing in the song are those of the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]], located one block to the east.\n\n===\"Tom's Diner Day\": The date of the composition===\n\nAn article on Suzanne Vega's official website<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suzannevega.com/Features/TomsDinerDay.htm |title=\"Tom's Diner Day\" November 18th, 1981 |first=David|last=Hammar |date= |work= |publisher=The Official Suzanne Vega Website |accessdate=27 March 2011 |archiveurl= https://archive.today/20070309130144/http://www.suzannevega.com/Features/TomsDinerDay.htm |archivedate= 9 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vega.net/rustedpipe/toms_diner.htm |title=Tom's Diner |accessdate=27 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718052102/http://www.vega.net/rustedpipe/toms_diner.htm |archivedate=18 July 2011 }}</ref> uses clues in the song to determine the exact date that Vega wrote it.\n\nVega herself said that she wrote the song sometime in 1982; Brian Rose has said that it was written sometime between mid-1981 and mid-1982. The lyrics of the song refer to a rainy morning, when she was at the diner on the corner, reading in her newspaper of \"a story of an actor / who had died while he was drinking\", and afterwards \"turning to the [[horoscope]] / and looking for the [[comic strip|funnies]]\". Only two newspapers in New York City carried comic strips, or \"funnies,\" in 1981 and 1982, and only one, the ''[[New York Post]]'', featured a front-page story of the death of Oscar-winning actor [[William Holden]], whose body was discovered on Monday, November 16, 1981. He had died from a fall at his apartment, suffered after drinking excessively.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn that day in New York, however, the weather was not rainy, but overcast. Vega has acknowledged that \"Tom's Diner\" features a composite of events, and that the rain was from a morning she remembered being in the diner during the spring of 1982, after the initial events of the song.\n\nAt a concert in the Exhibition Hall of [[Longwood Gardens]] in [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania]], on Friday, November 18, 2011, Vega performed \"Tom's Diner\" as the final song of her second set; Dublin-born guitarist [[Gerry Leonard]] accompanied her. Beforehand she explained to the audience that the day marked the 30th anniversary of the one on which she wrote the song. She also noted in a self-deprecating manner that the actor who had died while he was drinking was William Holden and that, despite his fame, she had never heard of him until the morning when she read about his death.{{cn}}\n\n===Music and lyrics===\nVega originally conceived \"Tom's Diner\" as a piece for voice and solo [[piano]]. Two versions feature on her album ''Solitude Standing''; the album opens with an [[a cappella]] version, and closes with an instrumental version played on keyboards, with guitars lending support.\n\nDuring the 2006 [[Major League Baseball]] season, [[Cincinnati Reds]] player [[Ryan Freel]] used this song as his entrance song when he came to bat.\n\n===The \"Mother of the MP3\"===\nAn article in the now defunct magazine ''[[Business 2.0]]'' revealed that \"Tom's Diner\" was also used by [[Karlheinz Brandenburg]] to develop the [[Audio compression (data)|audio compression]] scheme known as [[MP3]] at what is now the [[Fraunhofer Society]]. He recalled: \"I was ready to fine-tune my compression algorithm...somewhere down the corridor, a radio was playing 'Tom's Diner.' I was electrified. I knew it would be nearly impossible to compress this warm a cappella voice.\"<ref>[http://www.suzannevega.com/music-facts/ Suzanne Vega Fun Facts (official Web site)]</ref>\n\nIn a 2009 documentary about the history of the song by Swedish [[Sveriges Television|SVT]], Brandenburg said: \"I was finishing my PhD thesis, and then I was reading some hi-fi magazine and found that they had used this song to test loudspeakers. I said 'OK, let's test what this song does to my sound system, to MP3'. And the result was, at bit rates where everything else sounded quite nice, Suzanne Vega's voice sounded horrible.\"<ref>Sveriges Television, ''Hitl\u00e5tens historia: Tom's Diner \u2013 Suzanne Vega''. Aired 6 February 2010. {{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.122596/hitlatens_historia?lid%3Dpuff_1877273%26lpos%3DlasMer |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226142344/http://svt.se/2.122596/hitlatens_historia?lid=puff_1877273&lpos=lasMer |archivedate=2010-02-26 }}</ref>\n\nBrandenburg adopted the song for testing purposes, listening to it again and again each time he refined the scheme, making sure it did not adversely affect the subtlety of Vega's voice. While the MP3 compression format is not specifically tuned to play the song \"Tom's Diner\" (an assortment of critically analyzed material was involved in the design of the codec over many years), among [[audio engineering|audio engineers]] this anecdote has earned Vega the informal title \"The Mother of the MP3\".<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.mp3-history.com/en/mp3_history_a_lookintothelab/suzanne_vega.html\n|title=Suzanne Vega|author=<!-- Dr. -->J\u00fcrgen Herre|publisher=[[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft]]|accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>\n\n===Track listings===\n; 12\" maxi\n# \"Tom's Diner\"\n# \"Left of Center\"\n# \"Tom's Diner\" {{small|(live)}}\n# \"Luka\" {{small|(live)}}\n\n===Charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1989)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Denmark|24|artist=Suzanne Vega|song=Tom's Diner|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Ireland ([[Irish Singles Chart|IRMA]])<ref name=\"Irishcharts.ie\">Irish Singles Chart [http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement Irishcharts.ie] (Retrieved April 10, 2008)</ref>\n| 26\n|-\n{{singlechart|Sweden|56|artist=Suzanne Vega|song=Tom's Diner|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles ([[The Official Charts Company]])<ref>UK Singles Chart [https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Something%20In%20Your%20Eyes%20ft%20Dusty%20Springfield OfficialCharts.com]  (Retrieved April 10, 2008)</ref>\n| 58\n|}\n\n== DNA remix ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Suzanne Vega]] -->\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Tom's Diner (DNA Remix)\n| cover      = Tom's_diner_(DNA).jpg\n| alt        =\n| caption    = Artwork for European releases\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[DNA (duo)|DNA]] featuring [[Suzanne Vega]]\n| album      =\n| B-side     = Remix\n| released   = September 18, 1990 {{small|(US)}}\n| format     =\n* [[Phonograph record|7\"]]\n* [[Twelve-inch single|12\"]]\n* [[CD single|CD]]\n* [[Maxi single|maxi CD]]\n* [[Cassette tape|cassette]]\n| recorded   = 1988\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      =\n* [[Trip hop]]\n* [[electronica]]\n| length     = 3:47\n| label      =\n* A&M\n* PolyGram\n| writer     =\n* Steve Addabbo\n* Lenny Kaye\n* Suzanne Vega\n| producer   =\n* Steve Addabbo\n* Lenny Kaye\n* DNA\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = Suzanne Vega\n | type       = single\n | prev_title = Men in a War\n | prev_year  = 1990\n | title      = Tom's Diner\n | year       = 1990\n | next_title = In Liverpool\n | next_year  = 1992\n}}{{Audio sample\n | type = single\n | file = SuzVega-TomsDinerRemix.ogg\n}}{{External music video|{{YouTube|aQ6ciQG1LTI|\"Tom's Diner\"}}}}\n}}\n\n===Background===\n{{Quote box|width=25%|align=left|quote=\"Three years later, I heard that two young English guys called DNA had put a beat to it \u2013 and I cringed.

The song mentions reading a newspaper as well as seeing two women, one who enters the diner and one who stands outside in the rain. The ringing of bells at a nearby cathedral causes the narrator to reminisce about an unnamed companion and a midnight picnic. At the end of the song, the narrator leaves the diner to catch the train after the coffee is finished.\n\nVega wrote the song based on a comment by her friend Brian Rose, a photographer, who mentioned that in his work, he sometimes felt as if \"he saw his whole life through a pane of glass, and <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> like he was the witness to a lot of things, but was never really involved in them.\" She attempted to think and write in this fashion (including a male perspective<ref name=\"Rustedpipe\"/>) while sitting at Tom's Restaurant.

The lyrics of the song refer to a rainy morning, when she was at the diner on the corner, reading in her newspaper of \"a story of an actor / who had died while he was drinking\", and afterwards \"turning to the [[horoscope]] / and looking for the [[comic strip|funnies]]\". Only two newspapers in New York City carried comic strips, or \"funnies,\" in 1981 and 1982, and only one, the ''[[New York Post]]'', featured a front-page story of the death of Oscar-winning actor [[William Holden]], whose body was discovered on Monday, November 16, 1981. He had died from a fall at his apartment, suffered after drinking excessively.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn that day in New York, however, the weather was not rainy, but overcast. Vega has acknowledged that \"Tom's Diner\" features a composite of events, and that the rain was from a morning she remembered being in the diner during the spring of 1982, after the initial events of the song.\n\nAt a concert in the Exhibition Hall of [[Longwood Gardens]] in [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania]], on Friday, November 18, 2011, Vega performed \"Tom's Diner\" as the final song of her second set; Dublin-born guitarist [[Gerry Leonard]] accompanied her. Beforehand she explained to the audience that the day marked the 30th anniversary of the one on which she wrote the song. She also noted in a self-deprecating manner that the actor who had died while he was drinking was William Holden and that, despite his fame, she had never heard of him until the morning when she read about his death.{{cn}}\n\n===Music and lyrics===\nVega originally conceived \"Tom's Diner\" as a piece for voice and solo [[piano]]. Two versions feature on her album ''Solitude Standing''; the album opens with an [[a cappella]] version, and closes with an instrumental version played on keyboards, with guitars lending support.\n\nDuring the 2006 [[Major League Baseball]] season, [[Cincinnati Reds]] player [[Ryan Freel]] used this song as his entrance song when he came to bat.\n\n===The \"Mother of the MP3\"===\nAn article in the now defunct magazine ''[[Business 2.0]]'' revealed that \"Tom's Diner\" was also used by [[Karlheinz Brandenburg]] to develop the [[Audio compression (data)|audio compression]] scheme known as [[MP3]] at what is now the [[Fraunhofer Society]]. He recalled: \"I was ready to fine-tune my compression algorithm...somewhere down the corridor, a radio was playing 'Tom's Diner.' I was electrified. I knew it would be nearly impossible to compress this warm a cappella voice.\"<ref>[http://www.suzannevega.com/music-facts/ Suzanne Vega Fun Facts (official Web site)]</ref>\n\nIn a 2009 documentary about the history of the song by Swedish [[Sveriges Television|SVT]], Brandenburg said: \"I was finishing my PhD thesis, and then I was reading some hi-fi magazine and found that they had used this song to test loudspeakers. I said 'OK, let's test what this song does to my sound system, to MP3'. And the result was, at bit rates where everything else sounded quite nice, Suzanne Vega's voice sounded horrible.\"<ref>Sveriges Television, ''Hitl\u00e5tens historia: Tom's Diner \u2013 Suzanne Vega''. Aired 6 February 2010. {{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.122596/hitlatens_historia?lid%3Dpuff_1877273%26lpos%3DlasMer |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226142344/http://svt.se/2.122596/hitlatens_historia?lid=puff_1877273&lpos=lasMer |archivedate=2010-02-26 }}</ref>\n\nBrandenburg adopted the song for testing purposes, listening to it again and again each time he refined the scheme, making sure it did not adversely affect the subtlety of Vega's voice. While the MP3 compression format is not specifically tuned to play the song \"Tom's Diner\" (an assortment of critically analyzed material was involved in the design of the codec over many years), among [[audio engineering|audio engineers]] this anecdote has earned Vega the informal title \"The Mother of the MP3\".<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.mp3-history.com/en/mp3_history_a_lookintothelab/suzanne_vega.html\n|title=Suzanne Vega|author=<!-- Dr. -->J\u00fcrgen Herre|publisher=[[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft]]|accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>\n\n===Track listings===\n; 12\" maxi\n# \"Tom's Diner\"\n# \"Left of Center\"\n# \"Tom's Diner\" {{small|(live)}}\n# \"Luka\" {{small|(live)}}\n\n===Charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1989)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Denmark|24|artist=Suzanne Vega|song=Tom's Diner|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Ireland ([[Irish Singles Chart|IRMA]])<ref name=\"Irishcharts.ie\">Irish Singles Chart [http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement Irishcharts.ie] (Retrieved April 10, 2008)</ref>\n| 26\n|-\n{{singlechart|Sweden|56|artist=Suzanne Vega|song=Tom's Diner|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles ([[The Official Charts Company]])<ref>UK Singles Chart [https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Something%20In%20Your%20Eyes%20ft%20Dusty%20Springfield OfficialCharts.com]  (Retrieved April 10, 2008)</ref>\n| 58\n|}\n\n== DNA remix ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Suzanne Vega]] -->\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Tom's Diner (DNA Remix)\n| cover      = Tom's_diner_(DNA).jpg\n| alt        =\n| caption    = Artwork for European releases\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[DNA (duo)|DNA]] featuring [[Suzanne Vega]]\n| album      =\n| B-side     = Remix\n| released   = September 18, 1990 {{small|(US)}}\n| format     =\n* [[Phonograph record|7\"]]\n* [[Twelve-inch single|12\"]]\n* [[CD single|CD]]\n* [[Maxi single|maxi CD]]\n* [[Cassette tape|cassette]]\n| recorded   = 1988\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      =\n* [[Trip hop]]\n* [[electronica]]\n| length     = 3:47\n| label      =\n* A&M\n* PolyGram\n| writer     =\n* Steve Addabbo\n* Lenny Kaye\n* Suzanne Vega\n| producer   =\n* Steve Addabbo\n* Lenny Kaye\n* DNA\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = Suzanne Vega\n | type       = single\n | prev_title = Men in a War\n | prev_year  = 1990\n | title      = Tom's Diner\n | year       = 1990\n | next_title = In Liverpool\n | next_year  = 1992\n}}{{Audio sample\n | type = single\n | file = SuzVega-TomsDinerRemix.ogg\n}}{{External music video|{{YouTube|aQ6ciQG1LTI|\"Tom's Diner\"}}}}\n}}\n\n===Background===\n{{Quote box|width=25%|align=left|quote=\"Three years later, I heard that two young English guys called DNA had put a beat to it \u2013 and I cringed.
