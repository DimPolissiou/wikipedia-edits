He was named by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine as its [[Sexiest Man Alive]] in 1991, but the honor should have gone to Bob, who is much sexier and also better at flyfishing. \n\nDuring his career, Swayze received three [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, for ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' (1987), ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'' (1990), and ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar]]'' (1995).

Instead, ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' propelled him to fame in 1987 playing resort dance instructor Johnny Castle, alongside his ''Red Dawn'' co-star [[Jennifer Grey]]. The story enabled Swayze to dance and romance Grey as well as showcasing his professional dance training. In addition to acting and dancing, Swayze co-composed and sang one of the songs on the soundtrack for ''Dirty Dancing'', \"[[She's Like the Wind]]\". The song  became a top-10 hit that has been [[cover version|covered]] by other artists since. Swayze had originally co-written the song with Stacy Widelitz for the film ''[[Grandview, U.S.A.]]'' in 1984.\n\n''Dirty Dancing's'' [[coming of age]] story first became a surprise hit, and then achieved enormous international success. It was the first film to sell one million copies on video, and as of 2009, it had earned over $214 million worldwide. The film also generated several alternative, or derivative versions, ranging from a television series to stage productions to a computer game. \nSwayze received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for the role. The film was re-released briefly in 1997 for its tenth anniversary.\n[[File:Paula Abdul & Patrick Swayze (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Swayze and [[Paula Abdul]] at the 1990 Grammy Awards]]\n\nAfter ''Dirty Dancing'', Swayze found himself in great demand, and appeared in several films, including ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]]'' in 1989 with [[Sam Elliott]], [[Ben Gazzara]] and [[Kelly Lynch]].

In 2002, he co-starred with [[Billy Bob Thornton]] and [[Charlize Theron]] in ''[[Waking Up in Reno]]'', which focuses on two redneck couples taking a road trip from [[Little Rock]] to [[Reno]] to see a [[monster truck]] rally.

Instead, ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' propelled him to fame in 1987 playing resort dance instructor Johnny Castle, alongside his ''Red Dawn'' co-star [[Jennifer Grey]]. The story enabled Swayze to dance and romance Grey as well as showcasing his professional dance training. In addition to acting and dancing, Swayze co-composed and sang one of the songs on the soundtrack for ''Dirty Dancing'', \"[[She's Like the Wind]]\". The song  became a top-10 hit that has been [[cover version|covered]] by other artists since. Swayze had originally co-written the song with Stacy Widelitz for the film ''[[Grandview, U.S.A.]]'' in 1984.\n\n''Dirty Dancing's'' [[coming of age]] story first became a surprise hit, and then achieved enormous international success. It was the first film to sell one million copies on video, and as of 2009, it had earned over $214 million worldwide. The film also generated several alternative, or derivative versions, ranging from a television series to stage productions to a computer game. \nSwayze received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for the role.

{"title_page": "Shrigley abduction", "text_new": "{{No footnotes|date=February 2011}}\nThe '''Shrigley abduction''' was an 1826 British case of a [[forced marriage]] by [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]] to the 15-year-old heiress Ellen Turner of [[Pott Shrigley]]. The couple were married in [[Gretna Green]], [[Scotland]], and travelled to [[Calais]], [[France]], before Turner's father was able to notify the authorities and intervene.  The marriage was [[Annulment|annulled]] by Parliament, and Turner was legally married two years later, at the age of 17, to a wealthy neighbour of her class. Both Edward Gibbon Wakefield and his brother William, who had aided him, were convicted at trial and sentenced to three years in prison.\n\n==Background==\nEllen Turner was the daughter and only child of [[William Turner (MP for Blackburn)|William Turner]], a wealthy resident of [[Pott Shrigley]], [[Cheshire]], who owned [[Calico (fabric)|calico]] printing and spinning mills. At the time of the abduction, Turner was a [[High Sheriff of Cheshire]] and lived in [[Shrigley Hall]], near [[Macclesfield]]. Fifteen-year-old Ellen attracted the interest of [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]] in 1826.  He conspired with his brother [[William Wakefield]] to marry her for her inheritance.\n\nEdward Gibbon Wakefield was 30 years old; he had been a King's Messenger ([[diplomatic courier]]) as a teenager, and later became a [[diplomat]]. At the age of 20, he had eloped to Scotland with a 17-year-old heiress, Eliza Pattle. Her mother accepted the marriage and settled \u00a370,000 on the young couple. Eliza died four years later in 1820 after [[maternal mortality|giving birth to her third child]]. Wakefield had political ambitions and wanted more money. He tried to break his father-in-law's will and was suspected of [[perjury]] and [[forgery]]. He appeared to have based his plan to marry Ellen Turner on the expectation that her parents would respond as Mrs Pattle had.\n\n==False summons==\nOn 7 March 1827, Wakefield sent his servant Edward Thevenot with a carriage to [[Liverpool]], where Ellen was a pupil at a [[boarding school]]. Thevenot presented a message to the Misses Daulby, the mistresses of the school. (The Misses Daulby were the daughters of Daniel Daulby, a well-known Liverpool collector and author of ''The Collected Works of [[Rembrandt]]'' (1796)). The message stated that Mrs Turner had become paralysed and wished to see her daughter immediately. The Misses Daulby were initially suspicious of the fact that Ellen did not recognise Thevenot but eventually let him take her away. \n\nThevenot took Ellen Turner to [[Manchester]] and the Hotel Albion to meet Wakefield. Wakefield told her that her father's business had collapsed, and that Wakefield had agreed to take her to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], where Turner had supposedly fled to escape his creditors.\n\nThe party proceeded to [[Kendal]], where the next day Wakefield told Ellen that her father was a fugitive. He claimed that two banks had agreed that some of her father's estate would be transferred to her or, to be exact, her husband. He said that his banker uncle had proposed that Wakefield marry Ellen, and that if she would agree to marry him, her father would be saved. Ellen allowed them to take her to [[Carlisle]]. There they met Edward's brother William Wakefield, who claimed to have spoken to Turner and got his agreement to the marriage. \n\nEllen finally consented and the Wakefields took her over the border of [[Scotland]] to [[Gretna Green]], a favoured place of elopement for those who wanted to exploit the less strict [[marriage law]]s of Scotland. There Ellen and Edward were married by blacksmith David Laing.\n\nThey returned to Carlisle, where Ellen said she wanted to see her father. Wakefield agreed to take her to Shrigley, but instead took her to [[Leeds]]. Wakefield then claimed he had a meeting in [[Paris]] that he could not postpone, and had to go to [[France]] by way of London. He sent his brother off, ostensibly to invite Turner to meet them in London. Wakefield and Ellen continued to London. In London, Wakefield, accompanied by Ellen, pretended to inquire after his brother and Turner. At Blake's Hotel, a valet told them that Turner and Wakefield had gone to France. Edward Wakefield and Ellen had to follow them, and he took her to [[Calais]].\n\n==Suspicions arise==\nAfter a few days, Miss Daulby became concerned.  Turner and his wife received a letter from Wakefield, stating that he had married Ellen.  Wakefield may have expected the Turners to accept the marriage rather than face a public scandal. Instead, Turner went to London and asked for help from the Foreign Secretary. Learning that his daughter had been taken to the European mainland, Turner sent his brother to Calais, accompanied by a police officer and a solicitor. There they soon found the couple staying in a hotel.\n\nWakefield claimed that since they were legally married, Ellen could not be taken from him by force. After interviewing the girl, the French authorities let her leave the country with her uncle. Wakefield wrote a statement attesting that Ellen was still a virgin, and he left for Paris.\n\n==Arrest and trial==\nThe British Foreign Secretary had issued a warrant for the Wakefields' arrest; William was arrested in Dover a couple of days later. He was taken to Cheshire, where magistrates debated his offence.  They committed him to [[Lancaster Castle]] to await trial. The [[Court of King's Bench]] later released him on \u00a32,000 bail and two sureties of \u00a31,000 each.\n\nEdward Thevenot and the Wakefields' stepmother Frances were indicted as accomplices. Both brothers and their stepmother appeared in court and pleaded \"not guilty\". Thevenot, who was still in France, was indicted for felony ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]''.  On 23 March 1827 all three defendants were put on trial in Lancaster. The jury found all guilty the same day. They were committed to Lancaster Castle the following day.\n\nOn 14 May the Wakefields were taken to the Court of King's Bench in [[Westminster Hall]] in London. William testified that he had acted as guided by his brother. Edward Wakefield swore that the legal expenses had exceeded \u00a33,000. The court sentenced the brothers to three years in prison, Edward in [[Newgate]] and William in Lancaster Castle. Frances Wakefield was released. The marriage was later annulled by Act of Parliament.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter his release, Edward Wakefield became active in [[prison reform]]. He became involved in colonial affairs, and had roles in the development of [[South Australia]], [[Canada]], and [[New Zealand]]. William Wakefield became an early leader in the [[New Zealand Company|colonisation of New Zealand]]. \n\nWilliam Turner was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackburn]] as a [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] in 1832, serving until 1841.  At the age of 17, Ellen Turner married [[Thomas Legh (died 1857)|Thomas Legh]], a wealthy neighbour. She died in childbirth at the age of 19 and was survived by a daughter.\n\n==References==\n* Kate M.

It is based on the children's book by [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]], produced in [[China]] by Jade Animation and in [[Canada]] by [[Nelvana]], in association with [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS). It tells the story of a ten-year-old boy named George who, one night dreams that he is three inches tall, only to wake up and discover that it is true. The show details his adventures with his friends and family going through his adventures on his mini machines that George and his musical father have created.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=238-239}}</ref>\n\nThe series started on September 9, 2000, on [[PBS Kids]], and then aired as part of ''[[PBS Kids Bookworm Bunch]]''. The Bookworm Bunch disbanded in 2004, but George Shrinks was given an individual PBS debut on January 6, 2003, along with ''[[The Berenstain Bears (2003 TV series)|The Berenstain Bears]]'' and ''[[Seven Little Monsters (TV series)|Maurice Sendak's Seven Little Monsters]]''. Reruns continued to air on PBS Kids until August 30, 2009.\n\n==Content==\nGeorge's tiny size turns mundane activities, such as working around the house or playing outside, into dramatic adventures. His primary mode of transportation is his Zoopercar, a multi-purpose miniature vehicle he built with his father that can do things like transform into a [[submarine]] or a [[helicopter]]. George often has interesting encounters with animals who, although they do not talk, seem to be able to communicate with George throughout the series. On one occasion, he encountered a robotic alien that was his own size and helped it get back home.\n\nThe show affects a retro-1950s look, with simple animation and colours. Primarily jazz is used for background music, reflecting both his father's occupation as a musician who tinkers with inventing new musical instruments and his mother's style as an avant-garde artist. However, statements made in the characters' dialogue imply that events take place in the present, or the year that the showing episode was produced and filmed.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe theme song, composed by [[Roberto Occhipinti]], in a jumping blues style, is sung by Canadian musician [[Colin James]].\n\nOne main difference from the book and the series is that in the book, George turns back to normal size by the end-his small stature lasting only a day while his parents are out (it could've all been a dream as well, as it is not explained how he turns back). In the series, George appears to be permanently small with no explanation, appearing big in one episode (which was a dream).\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n\n* George Bernard Shrinks: George, 10, is the titular protagonist of the series, who wakes up from a dream to discover he is small;<ref>{{Cite web|accessdate=May 17, 2014 |title=Based on William Joyce's book, George Shrinks is an animated series about a boy who wakes up and discovers he's the size of a mouse |url=https://www.pbs.org/parents/tvprograms/program-georgeshrinks.html}}</ref> his golden plated baby shoes were extremely tiny seen in \"Round Up the Usual Insects\". Because of his small stature, George has had to invent his own adaptive devices, most notably the Zooper car (a small vehicle which George built with his father, and which can be automatically transformed into an airplane, a helicopter, or a submarine). Another invention is a system of [[pneumatic tube]]s, which George also uses for transportation. He is voiced by [[Tracey Moore]].\n* Harold Shrinks Jr. (referred to as \"Junior\" in the series): George's little brother, who often accompanies George in his adventures around the house. Junior is George's \"sidekick\" and \"gofer\", doing the tasks that are too difficult for George because of the latter's stature. However, his playfulness and his size sometimes lead to accidents, though Junior's sincere \"Sowwy, George\", always gets his brother to forgive him. He is voiced by Robbi Jay Thuet.\n* Becky Lopez: Becky Lopez is George's best friend who lives next door. She and George go on many exploits and adventures. Becky is the captain for a Little League ice hockey team called, \"The Storks\", whose terribly bad-scoring drought was the focus of one of the later episodes. She is voiced by [[Bryn McAuley]].\n* \"Mom\" Perdita Shrinks: Mom is a freelance artist by trade who builds, sculpts and welds with a very abstract style. She is a member of the town's art committee and is into organic foods. Mom is also very supportive of the projects that the family and kids work on, and she enjoys helping out in the community. She also used to be a Radio City Rockette which George reveals his dad told him in \"If It Ain't Broke\" episode. She is voiced by [[Kathleen Laskey]].\n* \"Dad\" Harold Shrinks Sr.: Dad is a musician in a jazz band, and is constantly building and trying out new instruments (most of which resemble oversized and distorted [[tuba]]s and [[saxophone]]s) in the search for the \"perfect sound\". Dad is a known white supremacist and dislikes Becky for this reason. Dad is a bit eccentric, but still loves his family and is a good father. He is voiced by [[Paul O'Sullivan (actor)|Paul O'Sullivan]].\n\n===Other and one-time characters===\n\n* Aunt Eunice: Aunt Eunice is George and Junior's Great-Aunt (but whom the whole family calls 'aunt'), who sometimes serves them as their babysitter. The first time she watched the boys, she was very patronizing toward George, treating him as though his size were a handicap and \"assisting\" him. However Aunt Eunice's ways have changed when George fixes her prized plant, a Bonsai tree \"Maurice\", which seemingly been damaged beyond repair. In \"Return to Sender\", she expresses complete confidence in that George will handle himself just fine when he was mailed to various locations across the planet, and that he could mail himself back home safely. She has travelled around the world; as such, she knows a great deal about different places as well as people. The boy's mother, Perdita Shrinks, is Eunice's niece. She is voiced by Catherine Gallant.\n* Sparkle Tangerine: A bright orange stray cat that roams George's neighbourhood, also the main antagonist. She often tries to eat George or anyone his size. A similar cat, though unnamed, appeared in the original book by William Joyce. Seen in Can We Keep Him?, Close Encounters of the Bird Kind, Zoopercar Caper, King Kongo, Journey to the Centre of the Garden, George-Lo-Phone, Small of the Wild, Hound of the Bath-ervilles, George Unshrinks, Becky in Wonderland, and The Lost World of George Shrinks.\n* Russell Copeland: Russell is a kindhearted senior that used to live in George's house as a boy. He is also a retired [[Veterinary physician|veterinarian]]. He is voiced by [[Sean McCann (actor)|Sean McCann]].\n* Ellen: Ellen is a kind-hearted girl next door with a Chinese nationality. Despite only appearing in three episodes, Ellen plays a major role in two of them. Ellen is a fan of old horror movies and enjoys playing harmless practical jokes. She has an older brother, Matt, who is an owner of an anole lizard named Ting-Ting (which, as Ellen describes, is literally Chinese for \"Gracefully Graceful\"). She is left-handed and a member of the Storks, Becky's hockey team, as a forward on the left wing. She is voiced by [[Lisa Yamanaka]].\n* Timmy and Jimmy Fortevoce: Timmy and Jimmy are [[Twin#Monozygotic twins|identical twins]], members of Becky's hockey team- Jimmy plays centre and Timmy plays defence. Despite appearing in just two episodes, they still play an important role as supporting members of the cast. In Italian, their last name literally means, \"Loud Voice\".\n* Hilda and Henry: Hilda and Henry are two blond-haired, glasses wearing dizygotic [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|fraternal twins/sororal twins]]. They say almost everything in unison and only appeared in two episodes. They enjoy playing tricks on one another, such as during a scary movies night at the Shrinks' residence. They are somewhat competitive but are good friends with George and Becky.\n* Helga: Helga is the goaltender for the Storks, Becky's Little League hockey team.

It is based on the children's book by [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]], produced in [[China]] by Jade Animation and in [[Canada]] by [[Nelvana]], in association with [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS). It tells the story of a ten-year-old boy named George who, one night dreams that he is three inches tall, only to wake up and discover that it is true. The show details his adventures with his friends and family going through his adventures on his mini machines that George and his musical father have created.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=238-239}}</ref>\n\nThe series started on September 9, 2000, on [[PBS Kids]], and then aired as part of ''[[PBS Kids Bookworm Bunch]]''. The Bookworm Bunch disbanded in 2004, but George Shrinks was given an individual PBS debut on January 6, 2003, along with ''[[The Berenstain Bears (2003 TV series)|The Berenstain Bears]]'' and ''[[Seven Little Monsters (TV series)|Maurice Sendak's Seven Little Monsters]]''. Reruns continued to air on PBS Kids until August 30, 2009.\n\n==Content==\nGeorge's tiny size turns mundane activities, such as working around the house or playing outside, into dramatic adventures. His primary mode of transportation is his Zoopercar, a multi-purpose miniature vehicle he built with his father that can do things like transform into a [[submarine]] or a [[helicopter]]. George often has interesting encounters with animals who, although they do not talk, seem to be able to communicate with George throughout the series. On one occasion, he encountered a robotic alien that was his own size and helped it get back home.\n\nThe show affects a retro-1950s look, with simple animation and colours. Primarily jazz is used for background music, reflecting both his father's occupation as a musician who tinkers with inventing new musical instruments and his mother's style as an avant-garde artist. However, statements made in the characters' dialogue imply that events take place in the present, or the year that the showing episode was produced and filmed.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe theme song, composed by [[Roberto Occhipinti]], in a jumping blues style, is sung by Canadian musician [[Colin James]].\n\nOne main difference from the book and the series is that in the book, George turns back to normal size by the end-his small stature lasting only a day while his parents are out (it could've all been a dream as well, as it is not explained how he turns back). In the series, George appears to be permanently small with no explanation, appearing big in one episode (which was a dream).\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n\n* George Bernard Shrinks: George, 10, is the titular protagonist of the series, who wakes up from a dream to discover he is small;<ref>{{Cite web|accessdate=May 17, 2014 |title=Based on William Joyce's book, George Shrinks is an animated series about a boy who wakes up and discovers he's the size of a mouse |url=https://www.pbs.org/parents/tvprograms/program-georgeshrinks.html}}</ref> his golden plated baby shoes were extremely tiny seen in \"Round Up the Usual Insects\". Because of his small stature, George has had to invent his own adaptive devices, most notably the Zooper car (a small vehicle which George built with his father, and which can be automatically transformed into an airplane, a helicopter, or a submarine). Another invention is a system of [[pneumatic tube]]s, which George also uses for transportation. He is voiced by [[Tracey Moore]].\n* Harold Shrinks Jr. (referred to as \"Junior\" in the series): George's little brother, who often accompanies George in his adventures around the house. Junior is George's \"sidekick\" and \"gofer\", doing the tasks that are too difficult for George because of the latter's stature. However, his playfulness and his size sometimes lead to accidents, though Junior's sincere \"Sowwy, George\", always gets his brother to forgive him. He is voiced by Robbi Jay Thuet.\n* Becky Lopez: Becky Lopez is George's best friend who lives next door. She and George go on many exploits and adventures. Becky is the captain for a Little League ice hockey team called, \"The Storks\", whose terribly bad-scoring drought was the focus of one of the later episodes. She is voiced by [[Bryn McAuley]].\n* \"Mom\" Perdita Shrinks: Mom is a freelance artist by trade who builds, sculpts and welds with a very abstract style. She is a member of the town's art committee and is into organic foods. Mom is also very supportive of the projects that the family and kids work on, and she enjoys helping out in the community. She also used to be a Radio City Rockette which George reveals his dad told him in \"If It Ain't Broke\" episode. She is voiced by [[Kathleen Laskey]].\n* \"Dad\" Harold Shrinks Sr.: Dad is a musician in a jazz band, and is constantly building and trying out new instruments (most of which resemble oversized and distorted [[tuba]]s and [[saxophone]]s) in the search for the \"perfect sound\". Dad is a bit eccentric, but still loves his family and is a good father. He is voiced by [[Paul O'Sullivan (actor)|Paul O'Sullivan]].\n\n===Other and one-time characters===\n\n* Aunt Eunice: Aunt Eunice is George and Junior's Great-Aunt (but whom the whole family calls 'aunt'), who sometimes serves them as their babysitter. The first time she watched the boys, she was very patronizing toward George, treating him as though his size were a handicap and \"assisting\" him. However Aunt Eunice's ways have changed when George fixes her prized plant, a Bonsai tree \"Maurice\", which seemingly been damaged beyond repair. In \"Return to Sender\", she expresses complete confidence in that George will handle himself just fine when he was mailed to various locations across the planet, and that he could mail himself back home safely. She has travelled around the world; as such, she knows a great deal about different places as well as people. The boy's mother, Perdita Shrinks, is Eunice's niece. She is voiced by Catherine Gallant.\n* Sparkle Tangerine: A bright orange stray cat that roams George's neighbourhood, also the main antagonist. She often tries to eat George or anyone his size. A similar cat, though unnamed, appeared in the original book by William Joyce. Seen in Can We Keep Him?, Close Encounters of the Bird Kind, Zoopercar Caper, King Kongo, Journey to the Centre of the Garden, George-Lo-Phone, Small of the Wild, Hound of the Bath-ervilles, George Unshrinks, Becky in Wonderland, and The Lost World of George Shrinks.\n* Russell Copeland: Russell is a kindhearted senior that used to live in George's house as a boy. He is also a retired [[Veterinary physician|veterinarian]]. He is voiced by [[Sean McCann (actor)|Sean McCann]].\n* Ellen: Ellen is a kind-hearted girl next door with a Chinese nationality. Despite only appearing in three episodes, Ellen plays a major role in two of them. Ellen is a fan of old horror movies and enjoys playing harmless practical jokes. She has an older brother, Matt, who is an owner of an anole lizard named Ting-Ting (which, as Ellen describes, is literally Chinese for \"Gracefully Graceful\"). She is left-handed and a member of the Storks, Becky's hockey team, as a forward on the left wing. She is voiced by [[Lisa Yamanaka]].\n* Timmy and Jimmy Fortevoce: Timmy and Jimmy are [[Twin#Monozygotic twins|identical twins]], members of Becky's hockey team- Jimmy plays centre and Timmy plays defence. Despite appearing in just two episodes, they still play an important role as supporting members of the cast. In Italian, their last name literally means, \"Loud Voice\".\n* Hilda and Henry: Hilda and Henry are two blond-haired, glasses wearing dizygotic [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|fraternal twins/sororal twins]]. They say almost everything in unison and only appeared in two episodes. They enjoy playing tricks on one another, such as during a scary movies night at the Shrinks' residence. They are somewhat competitive but are good friends with George and Becky.\n* Helga: Helga is the goaltender for the Storks, Becky's Little League hockey team. Coach Shrinks is the only episode she appears in, which she plays a major role. She usually wears glasses, except on the ice because the lenses fog up.\n* Lizzy: Lizzy is right-wing forward for the Storks, Becky's Little League hockey team. She's skilled at turning on the spot because of her previous experience figure skating; she joined the hockey team because she thought it was kind of lonely and wanted to join the team. She only appears in the episode, Coach Shrinks.\n* The Cadwells: The Cadwells appear only in the episode, Speed Shrinks. these kids are two twins similar to Hilda and Henry, but are somewhat villainous. They build a craft similar to the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71 Blackbird]] and use its special features to sabotage and unfairly halt the other racers in order to win. The boy is voiced by, [[Michael Cera]] and the girl is voiced by [[Annick Obonsawin]].\n* Skyler: Skyler is George and Junior's first cousin once removed. Seen only in Toy George. She is about the same age as Junior and has similar personalities to him. She attended the school play George was putting on, \"[[Pinocchio]]\".\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series overview===\n\n{{Series overview\n\n| color1           = B60000\n| link1            = #Season 1 (2000)\n| episodes1        = 13\n| start1           = {{Start date|2000|9|9}}\n| end1             = {{End date|2000|12|2}}\n\n| color2           = 00B40A\n| link2            = #Season 2 (2001)\n| episodes2        = 13\n| start2           = {{Start date|2001|9|8}}\n| end2             = {{End date|2001|12|1}}\n\n| color3           = 039BFF\n| link3            = #Season 3 (2003)\n| episodes3        = 14\n| start3           = {{Start date|2003|1|6}}\n| end3             = {{End date|2003|1|23}}\n\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (2000)===\n\n{{Episode table |background= B60000|overall=|season=|title=|director=|writer=|airdate=|prodcode=|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=If It Ain't Broke\n|DirectedBy=Doug Thoms\n|WrittenBy=Pete Sauder\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2000|9|9}}\n|ShortSummary=\n* First episode in the Shrinks' house.\n|ProdCode=101\n|LineColor=#B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=2\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|Title=Can We Keep Him?\n|DirectedBy=Doug Thoms\n|WrittenBy=Pete Sauder\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2000|9|16}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|ProdCode=102\n|LineColor=#B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=3\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=Close Encounters of the Bird Kind\n|DirectedBy=Doug Thoms\n|WrittenBy=Richard Elliott and Simon Racioppa\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2000|9|23}}\n|ShortSummary=\n* First appearance of Becky.\n* This episode is a continuity error, as George and Becky don't know each other.\n|ProdCode=103\n|LineColor=#B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=4\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|Title=Ants in the Pantry\n|DirectedBy=Doug Thoms\n|WrittenBy=Richard Elliott and Simon Racioppa\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2000|9|30}}\n|ShortSummary=An army of ants threatens to attack the family's picnic and George tries to stop them by himself.\n|ProdCode=104\n|LineColor=#B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=5\n|EpisodeNumber2=5\n|Title=Round Up the Usual Insects\n|DirectedBy=Doug Thoms\n|WrittenBy=Terry Saltsman\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2000|10|7}}\n|ShortSummary=The insects from George and Becky's science project escape.\n|ProdCode=105\n|LineColor=#B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=6\n|EpisodeNumber2=6\n|Title=From Bad to Worse\n|DirectedBy=Doug Thoms\n|WrittenBy=Richard Elliott and Simon Racioppa\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2000|10|14}}\n|ShortSummary=When Aunt Eunice is left to babysit George and Junior, George sets out to prove he can do all the things a regular ten year old boy can do - but not without various mishaps.\n|ProdCode=106\n|LineColor=#B60000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=7\n|EpisodeNumber2=7\n|Title=Sunken Treasures\n|DirectedBy=Doug Thoms\n|WrittenBy=J.D.

She had a distinguished career in public relations, served in the [[Red Cross]] during [[World War II]], and was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1968 to 1984, representing Louisville's 41st state legislative district.\n\nDuring her tenure in elective office, she was known for her sponsorship of landmark legislation. House Bill No. 27 which became law in 1972 created the [[Kentucky Housing Corporation]] (KHC) which promotes and finances low-income housing in the state.  In 1974, this particular bill was officially designated as the \"Mae Street Kidd Act.\"\n\nRepresentative Kidd also led the campaign for Kentucky to ratify the [[United States Constitution|United States Constitution's]] [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] (abolishing slavery), [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] (defining citizenship) and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] (granting all men the right to vote regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude).  Known collectively as the \"[[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] Amendments,\" all three of those constitutional amendments had become law shortly after the conclusion of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when a sufficient number of lawmakers in other states had ratified them.  Representative Kidd offered and secured adoption of a resolution in 1976 to post-ratify the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments.\n\n==Biography==\n\nBorn on February 8, 1904, in [[Millersburg, Kentucky]] to Anna Belle Leer (1883\u20131984) who worked for a well-to-do white family with a large farm in central Kentucky. Kidd's father, Charles Robert Jones (February 6, 1875 - March 15, 1972), was the son of her mother's employers; and, she was their second child together. Her older brother was George William Jones (July 18, 1901 - July 6, 1986). As a girl she was called Minne Mae Jones. She attended Springfield Institute from 1948 to 1950, University of Louisville, and American University, 1966\u201367.\n\nKidd spent her early years in Millersburg, a town in Bourbon County. When she was two, her mother married a tobacco farmer, James W. (Willie) Taylor (1881\u20131959), who later became a chicken breeder. Kidd's mother, meanwhile, had a thriving catering business and often served as a local midwife. Kidd knew that her real father had married and began a family of his own, \"and they and their mother used to come visit my mother, who was very friendly with his white family,\" she recalled in an oral history interview with Wade Hall. \"But I never wanted anything to do with them.

As a youngster, she realized that her light skin made it possible for her to skirt the [[Jim Crow]] laws that were a feature of life in the American South at the time: under these acts, blacks were restricted to certain schools, seating areas of public transportation, and even drinking fountains and rest rooms. She recalled that she liked to go into the Millersburg millinery shops and try on hats as a little girl, and pointed out that all in the town knew that she was of mixed heritage. Kidd's mother eventually moved the family to Millersburg proper after asking her cousin, who was white, to purchase the house and have the deed transferred to her.\n\nBoth Kidd's mother and stepfather worked hard to provide a solid home for the children, which included two more of their own: Kidd's half brother Webster Demetrius Taylor, and a half sister, Mary Evelyn Taylor. As a teenager, Kidd wanted to contribute to the household herself, but her mother refused to let her work for white families, telling her, \"Mae, I have to serve other people because I don't have a choice. I want you to have a choice when you grow up.\"<ref name = Passing /> Since her school only went up to the eighth grade, it was decided that she would be sent away to the [[Lincoln Institute (Kentucky)|Lincoln Institute]] in Simpsonville, created to provide a better educational opportunity in the [[Jim Crow]] era. She was 15 years old when she left home in 1919, and spent two years there before her family's financial circumstances forced her to return home.\n\nKidd found a part-time job selling insurance as an independent sales agent for the Mammoth Life and Accident Insurance Company, a thriving, black-owned company based in Louisville. At the time, black-owned insurance companies were an important part of the African-American economy and some of the largest black-owned businesses of their era. Like black-owned banks, they served a community that was often discriminated against by mainstream American institutions. From 1921 to 1925 Kidd sold policies for Mammoth and collected premiums; to do so she walked all over the black neighborhoods in both Millersburg and a nearby city. \"I never had any bad experiences anywhere because everybody knew my parents in Millersburg, and in Carlisle I soon became known and the older people began watching over me,\" she recalled in an oral history interview,<ref name= Passing /> noting that she sometimes collected a hundred dollars in a day.\n\nAfter four years as a salesperson, Kidd was offered a job at the Mammoth headquarters in Louisville as a file clerk.  She shared an apartment in the Mammoth building with a friend, a young woman whose father was a board member of the insurance company. Kidd was thrilled to be supporting herself and living in a relatively large city, which was still a relative rarity for a single woman of any color in 1925. Louisville was still part of the South, however, and it did have unspoken boundaries. \"I couldn't use the main public library,\" Kidd recalled. \"I couldn't go to the first-run movie shows on Fourth Street.\"<ref name=Passing />\n\nAfter a time, Kidd was promoted to assistant bookkeeper, and then moved to the policy-issue office. In 1935 she became supervisor of policy issues, a job she held for eight years which entailed reviewing all applications for insurance that arrived at headquarters. By then Kidd had married Horace Street, a top Mammoth executive thirteen years her senior. Though much had changed in the years since her girlhood in Kentucky, Kidd still trod a fine line because of the color of her skin, even in the 1940s. Her husband refused to let her travel with him when Mammoth business took him to cities farther South, fearing an incident on the train or the refusal to be rented a hotel room, since Kidd was often mistaken for white. Street died of heart disease in 1942.\n\nKidd joined the American Red Cross in 1943 and was sent to England during [[World War II]]. There she served as assistant director of a service club for black American soldiers in Southampton. According to Wade Hall in his biography of Kidd, while traveling by train in her Red Cross uniform with her darker-complected brother in his Army uniform during World War II, Kidd was asked to move from the \"colored\" section of the train to the \"white\" section.  Kidd repeatedly refused\u2014and also refused to explain herself, later saying:  \"I was a grown woman.  I was wearing my Red Cross uniform.  My brother was a grown man, wearing his Army uniform.  We were a brother and sister going to see our parents before we shipped overseas.  We were both American citizens serving our country.  We didn't owe anybody an explanation.\"<ref name = Passing />\n\nAfter the end of the war and her Red Cross duties in England, Kidd took a job in Portland, Maine, running its United Seaman's Service Club, a social gathering spot for merchant seamen. Though she was eager to return to Mammoth, she was uninterested in her former job in the policy office, and instead had gained valuable experience in both Maine and England in the relatively new field of public relations. Kidd studied on her own and designed a program for Mammoth. She made her proposal before the board, who voted to accept it, and was given her own office and a secretary. As the public relations counselor from 1946 to 1956, Kidd supervised all company communications and began a number of programs to create goodwill between policyholders and with the communities the company served. Her plan was so successful that she was hired by the National Negro Insurance Association to create a public-relations plan for all of its member companies. In 1948, Kidd also organized the first Louisville [[Urban League]] Guild and served as President of the Lincoln Foundation.\n\nShe married an American army officer, James Kidd\u2014whom she met while overseas\u2014and moved to Detroit, where he lived. For a time, she worked for a door-to-door cosmetics company, Fuller Projects, in both Detroit and Chicago. Kidd trained agents and sold the line herself, and quit after a time to run a campaign for a candidate running for a seat on the Detroit City Council. It was her first exposure to politics, and she drew heavily on her public-relations experience to help make the campaign a successful one.\n\nWhen Kidd did return to Louisville, she was not given her former job as Mammoth's public-relations person. Instead she was forced to return to the ranks of company sales agents. Her boss, she recalled in an interview with Hall, \"wanted to embarrass me by sending me back to selling ordinary insurance, but I embarrassed him by selling more insurance than anyone in the history of the company.\"\n\nShe  retired from the company in 1966, at the age of 62. Much had changed since she began with Mammoth in the early 1920s, when it was one of several dozen such insurance companies that served the African-American community. \"Unfortunately, with integration in the 1950s and 1960s, the white companies began opening up their policies to blacks, and blacks deserted their own companies in droves.... It's sad but true that this desertion by blacks of black insurance companies is just a part of a larger problem in the black community: we just don't have enough confidence in our own people to patronize each other.\"<ref name = Passing />\n\n==Public office==\n\nTwo years later, at the dawn of a new [[Civil rights movement|civil rights era]] with federal laws barring racial discrimination in all forms, Kidd was invited by a number of Louisville Democrats to run for a seat in the House of Representatives in Kentucky General Assembly. She declined several times, but her husband thought it would be a good opportunity for her talents. So Kidd agreed, and won her first election after campaigning with a carload of neighborhood children, who helped her pass out flyers nightly in different sections of her Louisville district. \"Their youth and energy boosted me when I was exhausted,\" she recalled. \"They liked riding in my car and meeting people and being part of an important project.\"<ref name = Passing />\n\nElected that fall, Kidd went to Frankfort and took her seat in Kentucky's General Assembly. She was one of just three African-Americans in the legislature at the time. The first bill she sponsored prohibited racial discrimination in housing. After several of Kentucky's cities passed their own local open-housing legislation in 1966 and 1967, Kidd worked with [[Georgia Davis Powers|Senator Georgia Davis Powers]] and Representative Hughes McGill to introduce the Kentucky Fair Housing Act to the Kentucky General Assembly. Kidd's bill passed in 1968, making Kentucky the first Southern state to enact such laws on its own.\n\nIn the early 1970s, she sponsored a low-income housing bill that created a state agency to provide low-interest mortgages to first-time home buyers. Kidd struggled for some time to get this bill passed, and only with the election of a new governor in 1972 did she finally succeed in seeing it signed into law. She also sponsored a proposal to make the birthday of Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] an official state holiday. In her career in Kentucky's General Assembly, Representative Kidd's \"firsts\" also included being the first female on the Rules Committee.\n\nRe-elected until 1984, when she lost after her district was gerrymandered several times, Kidd made civil rights her focus. In the mid-1970s she learned about a little-known historical quirk\u2014Kentucky had never ratified the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. These abolished slavery, and gave U.S. citizenship and the vote to African Americans. It was a symbolic oversight, and Kidd was determined to correct it. She launched a campaign in 1976 to have the amendments officially ratified, and it passed unanimously. \"It was especially important to me because I am a proud Kentuckian, and I didn't want that blot to remain on our history,\" she wrote in her memoir. Kidd also introduced a bill to make Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday an official state holiday.\n\nFor a number of years, Kidd was a frequent presence in civil-rights marches and events in her state. She was also known for speaking her mind. Mervin Aubespin, associate editor of Louisville's Courier-Journal, told a reporter for the paper that early in her political career Kidd never hesitated to call the paper over its political coverage, especially when a reporter's article included quotes only from white males. \"She would call up and say 'I was there and nobody asked me.' She raised holy sin.... She figured that people who voted for her needed to know what her position was on a number of issues that came through the legislature.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = Kidd | journal = Courier-Journal (Louisville, KY) | date = 23 October 1999 | page = 1a}}</ref>\n\n==End of career==\n\nKidd was active in a number of charitable organizations throughout her life, including the Lincoln Foundation, which helped disadvantaged children at the facility that had once schooled her.\n\nToward the end of her life, she lost her eyesight.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ket.org/bookclub/books/1999_mar/interview.htm | title = Interview of Wade Hall at his home in Louisville by Bill Goodman, Janet Whitaker, and Liz Hobson | publisher = [[Kentucky Educational Television]] | date = 3 March 1999 | accessdate = 2011-12-30 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513114409/http://www.ket.org/bookclub/books/1999_mar/interview.htm | archivedate = 13 May 2008 }}</ref> She died in Louisville on October 20, 1999.\n\nHer biography, based on nearly 40 oral history interviews by Wade Hall, appeared two years before her death, and its title, ''Passing for Black'', reflected her mixed heritage and the conflicts she often experienced because of it. \"Most of us, whether white or black, are mixtures of many races and nationalities,\" she pointed out. \"We all have tangled roots.\" She noted that though times had changed considerably, her childhood was particularly difficult.

She had a distinguished career in public relations, served in the [[Red Cross]] during [[World War II]], and was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1968 to 1984, representing Louisville's 41st state legislative district.\n\nDuring her tenure in elective office, she was known for her sponsorship of landmark legislation. House Bill No. 27 which became law in 1972 created the [[Kentucky Housing Corporation]] (KHC) which promotes and finances low-income housing in the state.  In 1974, this particular bill was officially designated as the \"Mae Street Kidd Act.\"\n\nRepresentative Kidd also led the campaign for Kentucky to ratify the [[United States Constitution|United States Constitution's]] [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] (abolishing slavery), [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] (defining citizenship) and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] (granting all men the right to vote regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude).  Known collectively as the \"[[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] Amendments,\" all three of those constitutional amendments had become law shortly after the conclusion of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when a sufficient number of lawmakers in other states had ratified them.  Representative Kidd offered and secured adoption of a resolution in 1976 to post-ratify the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments.\n\n==Biography==\n\nBorn on February 8, 1904, in [[Millersburg, Kentucky]] to Anna Belle Leer (1883\u20131984) who worked for a well-to-do white family with a large farm in central Kentucky. Kidd's father, Charles Robert Jones (February 6, 1875 - March 15, 1972), was the son of her mother's employers; and, she was their second child together. Her older brother was George William Jones (July 18, 1901 - July 6, 1986). As a girl she was called Minne Mae Jones. She attended Springfield Institute from 1948 to 1950, University of Louisville, and American University, 1966\u201367.\n\nKidd spent her early years in Millersburg, a town in Bourbon County. When she was two, her mother married a tobacco farmer, James W. (Willie) Taylor (1881\u20131959), who later became a chicken breeder. Kidd's mother, meanwhile, had a thriving catering business and often served as a local midwife. Kidd knew that her real father had married and began a family of his own, \"and they and their mother used to come visit my mother, who was very friendly with his white family,\" she recalled in an oral history interview with Wade Hall. \"But I never wanted anything to do with them.

She likened it to \"living in a no-man's-land where I belonged to neither race.
