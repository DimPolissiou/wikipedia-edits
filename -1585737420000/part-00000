{"title_page": "Visual short-term memory", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=March 2019}}\nIn the study of [[visual perception|vision]], '''visual short-term memory''' ('''VSTM''') is one of three broad memory systems including [[iconic memory]] and [[long-term memory]]. VSTM is a type of [[short-term memory]], but one limited to information within the visual domain.\n\nThe term VSTM refers in a theory-neutral manner to the non-permanent storage of visual information over an extended period of time. The [[visuospatial sketchpad]] is a VSTM subcomponent within the theoretical model of [[working memory]] proposed by Alan Baddeley. Whereas iconic memories are fragile, decay rapidly, and are unable to be actively maintained, visual short-term memories are robust to subsequent stimuli and last over many seconds. VSTM is distinguished from long-term memory, on the other hand, primarily by its very limited capacity.\n\n==Overview== \n\nThe introduction of [[stimulation|stimuli]] which were hard to verbalize, and unlikely to be held in [[long-term memory]], revolutionized the study of VSTM in the early  1970s<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3758/BF03329095|title=Short-term recognition memory for complex free-form figures|journal=Psychonomic Science|volume=25|issue=4|pages=209\u2013211|year=1971|last1=Cermak|first1=Gregory W.}}</ref> (Phillips, 1974; Phillips & Baddeley, 1971).

The finding that observers were able to report that a change had occurred, at levels significantly above chance, indicated that they were able to encode   aspect of the first stimulus in a purely visual store, at least for the period until the presentation of the second stimulus. However, as the stimuli used were complex, and the nature of the change relatively uncontrolled, these experiments left open various questions, such as: (1) whether only a subset of the perceptual dimensions comprising a visual stimulus are stored (e.g., spatial frequency, luminance, or contrast); (2) whether   perceptual dimensions are maintained in VSTM with greater fidelity than others; and (3) the nature by which these dimensions are encoded (i.e., are perceptual dimensions encoded within separate, parallel channels, or are all perceptual dimensions stored as a single bound entity within VSTM?).\n\n==Set-size effects==\nMuch effort has been dedicated to investigating the capacity limits of VSTM. In a typical change-detection task, observers are presented with two arrays, composed of a number of stimuli. The two arrays are separated by a short temporal interval, and the task of observers is to decide if the first and second arrays are identical, or whether one item differs across the two displays (e.g., Luck & Vogel, 1997). Performance is critically dependent on the number of items in the array. While performance is generally almost perfect for arrays of one or two items, correct responses invariably decline in a monotonic fashion as more items are added. Different theoretical models have been put forward to explain limits on VSTM storage, and distinguishing between them remains an active area of research.\n\n==Models of capacity limits==\n\n===Slot models===\nA prominent class of model proposes that observers are limited by the total number of items which can be encoded, either because the capacity of VSTM itself is limited (e.g., Cowan, 2001; Luck & Vogel, 1997; Pashler, 1988). This type of model has obvious similarities to urn models used in probability theory (see, for example, Mendenhall, 1967). In essence, an urn model assumes that VSTM is restricted in storage capacity to only a few items, ''k'' (often estimated to lie in the range of three-to-five in adults, though fewer in children (Riggs, McTaggart & Simpson, 2006)). The probability that a suprathreshold change will be detected is simply the probability that the change element is encoded in VSTM (i.e., ''k''/''N''). This capacity limit has been linked to the posterior parietal cortex, the activity of which initially increases with the number of stimuli in the arrays, but saturates at higher set-sizes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature02466|pmid=15085133|title=Capacity limit of visual short-term memory in human posterior parietal cortex|journal=Nature|volume=428|issue=6984|pages=751\u2013754|year=2004|last1=Todd|first1=J. Jay|last2=Marois|first2=Ren\u00e9}}</ref> Although urn models are used commonly to describe performance limitations in VSTM (e.g., Luck & Vogel, 1997; Pashler, 1988; Sperling, 1960), it is only recently that the actual structure of items stored has been considered. Luck and colleagues have reported a series of experiments designed specifically to elucidate the structure of information held in VSTM (Luck & Vogel, 1997). This work provides evidence that items stored in VSTM are coherent objects, and not the more elementary features of which those objects are composed.\n\n===Noise models===\nAn alternative framework has more been put forward by [[Patrick Wilken|Wilken]] and Ma (2004) who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a monotonic decline in the quality of the internal representations stored (i.e., monotonic increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number of things that can be encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, spatial frequency, and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a signal detection theory approach (see also the closely related work by Palmer, 1990). The participants were asked to report differences between the visual stimuli presented to them in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was [[neuronal noise]] (which is a function of visual set-size).\n\nUnder this framework, the key limiting factor on working memory performance is the precision with which visual information can be stored, not the number of items that can be remembered. Further evidence for this theory was obtained by Bays and Husain (2008) using a discrimination task. They showed that, unlike a \"slot\" model of VSTM, a signal-detection model could account both for discrimination performance in their study and previous results from change detection tasks (e.g. Luck and Vogel, 1997). These authors proposed that VSTM is a flexible resource, shared out between elements of a visual scene\u2014items that receive more resource are stored with greater precision. In support of this, they showed that increasing the salience of one item in a memory array led to that item being recalled with increased resolution, but at the cost of reducing resolution of storage for the other items in the display.\n\n==Psychophysical models==\nPsychophysical experiments suggest that information is encoded in VSTM across multiple parallel channels, each channel associated with a particular perceptual attribute (Magnussen, 2000). Within this framework, a decrease in an observer's ability to detect a change with increasing set-size can be attributed to two different processes: (1) if decisions are made across different channels, decreases in performance are typically small, and consistent with decreases expected when making multiple independent decisions (Greenlee & Thomas, 1993; Vincent & Regan, 1995); (2) if multiple decisions are made within the same channel, the decrease in performance is much greater than expected on the basis of increased decision-noise alone, and is attributed to interference caused by multiple decisions within the same perceptual channel (Magnussen & Greenlee, 1997).\n\nHowever, the Greenlee-Thomas model (Greenlee & Thomas, 1993) suffers from two failings as a model for the effects of set-size in VSTM. First, it has only been empirically tested with displays composed of one or two elements. It has been shown repeatedly in various experimental paradigms that set-size effects differ for displays composed of a relatively small number of elements (i.e., 4 items or less), and those associated with larger displays (i.e., more than 4 items). The Greenlee-Thomas (1993) model offers no explanation for why this might be so. Second, while Magnussen, Greenlee, and Thomas (1997) are able to use this model to predict that greater interference will be found when dual decisions are made within the same perceptual dimension, rather than across different perceptual dimensions, this prediction lacks quantitative rigor, and is unable to accurately anticipate the size of the threshold increase, or give a detailed explanation of its underlying causes.\n\nIn addition to the Greenlee-Thomas model (Greenlee & Thomas, 1993), there are two other prominent approaches for describing set-size effects in VSTM. These two approaches can be referred to as sample size models (Palmer, 1990), and urn models (e.g., Pashler, 1988). They differ from the Greenlee-Thomas (1993) model by: (1) ascribing the root cause of set-size effects to a stage prior to decision making; and (2) making no theoretical distinction between decisions made in the same, or across different, perceptual dimensions.\n\n==Intermediate visual store==\nThere is some evidence of an [[intermediate visual store]] with characteristics of both iconic memory and VSTM.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Are There Multiple Visual Short-Term Memory Stores? |journal=PLOS One|volume=3|issue=2|pages=e1699|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001699|pmid=18301775|pmc=2246033|year=2008|last1=Sligte|first1=Ilja G.|last2=Scholte|first2=H. Steven|last3=Lamme|first3=Victor A. F.}}</ref> This intermediate store is proposed to have high capacity (up to 15 items) and prolonged memory trace duration (up to 4 seconds). It coexists with VSTM but unlike it visual stimuli can overwrite the contents of its visual store (Pinto et al., 2013). Further research suggests an involvement of [[visual area V4]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0784-09.2009|pmid=19515911|pmc=6665414|title=V4 Activity Predicts the Strength of Visual Short-Term Memory Representations|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=29|issue=23|pages=7432\u20137438|year=2009|last1=Sligte|first1=I.

F.}}</ref>\n\n==The function of visual short-term memory representations==\nVSTM is thought{{by whom|date=March 2019}} to be the visual component of the working memory system, and as such it is used as a buffer for temporary information storage during the process of naturally occurring tasks. But what naturally occurring tasks actually require VSTM? Most work on this issue has focused on the role of VSTM in bridging the sensory gaps caused by saccadic eye movements. These sudden shift of gaze typically occur 2\u20134 times per second, and vision is briefly suppressed while the eyes are moving. Thus, the visual input consists of a series of spatially shifted snapshots of the overall scene, separated by brief gaps. Over time, a rich and detailed long-term memory representation is constructed from these brief glimpses of the input, and VSTM is thought{{by whom|date=March 2019}} to bridge the gaps between these glimpses and to allow the relevant portions of one glimpse to be aligned with the relevant portions of the next glimpse. Both spatial and object VSTM systems may play important roles in the integration of information across eye movements. Eye movements are also affected by VSTM representations. The constructed representations held in VSTM can affect eye movements even when the task does not explicitly require eye movements: the direction of small [[microsaccade|microsaccades]] point towards the location of objects in VSTM.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martinez-Conde |first1=S |last2=Alexander |first2=R |title=A gaze bias in the mind's eye |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |date=2019 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=424\u2013425 |doi=10.1038/s41562-019-0546-1 |pmid=31089295 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Attention]]\n* [[Attention versus memory in prefrontal cortex]]\n* [[Change blindness]]\n* [[Memory]]\n* [[Perception]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bays | first1 = P.M. | last2 = Husain | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Dynamic shifts of limited working memory resources in human vision | url = | journal = Science | volume = 321 | issue = | pages = 851\u2013854 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Cortese | first2 = F. | year = 1996 | title = Masking of spatial frequency in visual memory depends on distal, not retinal, frequency | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 233\u2013238 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Blakemore | first1 = C. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = F.W. | year = 1969 | title = On the existence of neurons in the human visual system selectively sensitive to the orientation and size of retinal images | url = | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 203 | issue = | pages = 237\u2013260 }}\n* Breitmeyer, B.

Second, while Magnussen, Greenlee, and Thomas (1997) are able to use this model to predict that greater interference will be found when dual decisions are made within the same perceptual dimension, rather than across different perceptual dimensions, this prediction lacks quantitative rigor, and is unable to accurately anticipate the size of the threshold increase, or give a detailed explanation of its underlying causes.\n\nIn addition to the Greenlee-Thomas model (Greenlee & Thomas, 1993), there are two other prominent approaches for describing set-size effects in VSTM. These two approaches can be referred to as sample size models (Palmer, 1990), and urn models (e.g., Pashler, 1988). They differ from the Greenlee-Thomas (1993) model by: (1) ascribing the root cause of set-size effects to a stage prior to decision making; and (2) making no theoretical distinction between decisions made in the same, or across different, perceptual dimensions.\n\n==Intermediate visual store==\nThere is some evidence of an [[intermediate visual store]] with characteristics of both iconic memory and VSTM.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Are There Multiple Visual Short-Term Memory Stores? |journal=PLOS One|volume=3|issue=2|pages=e1699|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001699|pmid=18301775|pmc=2246033|year=2008|last1=Sligte|first1=Ilja G.|last2=Scholte|first2=H.

But what naturally occurring tasks actually require VSTM? Most work on this issue has focused on the role of VSTM in bridging the sensory gaps caused by saccadic eye movements. These sudden shift of gaze typically occur 2\u20134 times per second, and vision is briefly suppressed while the eyes are moving. Thus, the visual input consists of a series of spatially shifted snapshots of the overall scene, separated by brief gaps. Over time, a rich and detailed long-term memory representation is constructed from these brief glimpses of the input, and VSTM is thought{{by whom|date=March 2019}} to bridge the gaps between these glimpses and to allow the relevant portions of one glimpse to be aligned with the relevant portions of the next glimpse. Both spatial and object VSTM systems may play important roles in the integration of information across eye movements. Eye movements are also affected by VSTM representations. The constructed representations held in VSTM can affect eye movements even when the task does not explicitly require eye movements: the direction of small [[microsaccade|microsaccades]] point towards the location of objects in VSTM.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martinez-Conde |first1=S |last2=Alexander |first2=R |title=A gaze bias in the mind's eye |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |date=2019 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=424\u2013425 |doi=10.1038/s41562-019-0546-1 |pmid=31089295 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Attention]]\n* [[Attention versus memory in prefrontal cortex]]\n* [[Change blindness]]\n* [[Memory]]\n* [[Perception]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Bays, P.M. & Husain M.

The trials have on several occasions been called a farce.<ref>John Molony, \"Eureka\", Ringwood 1989</ref> Rede himself was quietly removed from the camps and reassigned to an insignificant position in rural Victoria.\n\n=== Commission of Enquiry ===\nWhen Hotham's Royal Commission report, initiated before the conflict, was finally handed down it was scathing in its assessment of all aspects of the administration of the gold fields, and particularly the Eureka Stockade affair. According to Blainey, \"It was perhaps the most generous concession offered by a governor to a major opponent in the history of Australia up to that time. The members of the commission were appointed before Eureka...they were men who were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers.\"\n\nThe report made several major recommendations, one of which was to restrict Chinese immigration. Its recommendations were only put into effect after the Stockade. The [[Miner's Licence|gold licences]] were then abolished, and replaced by an annual [[Miner's Right|miner's right]] and an export fee based on the value of the gold. Mining wardens replaced the gold commissioners, and police numbers were cut drastically. The Legislative Council was expanded to allow representation to the major goldfields. Peter Lalor and John Basson Humffray were elected for Ballarat, although there were property qualifications with regards to eligibility to vote in upper house elections in Victoria until the 1950s. After 12 months, all but one of the demands of the Ballarat Reform League had been granted. Lalor and Humffray both enjoyed distinguished careers as politicians, with Lalor later elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria.\n\n=== Peter Lalor ===\n{{Main|Peter Lalor}}\n[[File:Peter Lalor as Speaker.jpg|thumb|upright|Eureka leader [[Peter Lalor]] in later life as Speaker of the House in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. Only his right arm is visible, as his left arm was amputated as a result of the battle at Eureka.]]\nFollowing the battle, rebel leader, [[Irish Australian]] Peter Lalor, wrote in a statement to the colonists of Victoria, \"There are two things connected with the late outbreak (Eureka) which I deeply regret. The first is, that we shouldn't have been forced to take up arms at all; and the second is, that when we were compelled to take the field in our own defence, we were unable (through want of arms, ammunition and a little organisation) to inflict on the real authors of the outbreak the punishment they so richly deserved.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Lalor\n |first       = Peter\n |authorlink  = Peter Lalor\n |title       = Peter Lalor's Narrative\n |work        = Eureka on Trial\n |publisher   = Public Record Office Victoria, (2003)\n |year        = 1855\n |url         = http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/lalors_letter.htm\n |accessdate  = 21 February 2007\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070409140744/http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/lalors_letter.htm\n |archivedate = 9 April 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nLalor stood for [[Electoral district of Ballaarat|{{Notatypo|Ballaarat}}]] in the 1855 elections and was elected unopposed.\n\nDuring a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, \"I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat.\"\n\n==Political legacy==\nThe actual significance of Eureka upon Australia's politics is not decisive. It has been variously interpreted as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation, of labour against a privileged ruling class, or as an expression of [[Republicanism in Australia|republicanism]].

Sculpted in stone from the [[Barrabool Hills]] by James Leggatt in Geelong it features a pillar bearing the names of the deceased miners and bearing the inscription \"Sacred to the memory of those who fell on the memorable 3rd of December, 1854, in resisting the unconstitutional proceedings of the Victorian Government.\"\n\nA soldiers' memorial was erected many years later in 1876 and is an obelisk constructed of limestone sourced from [[Waurn Ponds]] with the words \"Victoria\" and \"Duty\" carved in its north and south faces respectively.

Other scenes in the lost reels of the film were believed to have included gold seekers leaving London, issuing of licences, licence hunting, diggers chained to logs and rescued by mates, diggers burning Bentley's Hotel, the Rebellion, building the stockade, troops storming the stockade and the stockade in ruins.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Eureka Stockade (1907)\n|publisher=[[National Film and Sound Archive]]\n|url=http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;page=0;parentid=;query=Eureka%20Stockade%20Media%3A%22FILM%20%22%20%7C%20Media%3A%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;resCount=10\n|accessdate=28 June 2013\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106185246/http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;page=0;parentid=;query=Eureka%20Stockade%20Media%3A%22FILM%20%22%20%7C%20Media%3A%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;resCount=10\n|archive-date=6 November 2018\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Loyal Rebel]]'', also known as ''Eureka Stockade'', is an Australian silent film made in 1915.

Seekamp was arrested in his newspaper office on 4 December 1854, for a series of articles that appeared in the ''Ballarat Times''. Many of these articles were written by George Lang, the son of the prominent republican and Presbyterian Minister of Sydney, the Reverend [[John Dunmore Lang]]. He was tried and convicted of seditious libel by a Melbourne jury on 23 January 1855 and, after a series of appeals, sentenced to six months imprisonment on 23 March. He was released from prison on 28 June 1855, precisely three months early.

According to Blainey, \"It was perhaps the most generous concession offered by a governor to a major opponent in the history of Australia up to that time. The members of the commission were appointed before Eureka...they were men who were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers.\"\n\nThe report made several major recommendations, one of which was to restrict Chinese immigration. Its recommendations were only put into effect after the Stockade. The [[Miner's Licence|gold licences]] were then abolished, and replaced by an annual [[Miner's Right|miner's right]] and an export fee based on the value of the gold. Mining wardens replaced the gold commissioners, and police numbers were cut drastically. The Legislative Council was expanded to allow representation to the major goldfields. Peter Lalor and John Basson Humffray were elected for Ballarat, although there were property qualifications with regards to eligibility to vote in upper house elections in Victoria until the 1950s. After 12 months, all but one of the demands of the Ballarat Reform League had been granted. Lalor and Humffray both enjoyed distinguished careers as politicians, with Lalor later elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria.\n\n=== Peter Lalor ===\n{{Main|Peter Lalor}}\n[[File:Peter Lalor as Speaker.jpg|thumb|upright|Eureka leader [[Peter Lalor]] in later life as Speaker of the House in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. Only his right arm is visible, as his left arm was amputated as a result of the battle at Eureka.]]\nFollowing the battle, rebel leader, [[Irish Australian]] Peter Lalor, wrote in a statement to the colonists of Victoria, \"There are two things connected with the late outbreak (Eureka) which I deeply regret. The first is, that we shouldn't have been forced to take up arms at all; and the second is, that when we were compelled to take the field in our own defence, we were unable (through want of arms, ammunition and a little organisation) to inflict on the real authors of the outbreak the punishment they so richly deserved.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Lalor\n |first       = Peter\n |authorlink  = Peter Lalor\n |title       = Peter Lalor's Narrative\n |work        = Eureka on Trial\n |publisher   = Public Record Office Victoria, (2003)\n |year        = 1855\n |url         = http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/lalors_letter.htm\n |accessdate  = 21 February 2007\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070409140744/http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/lalors_letter.htm\n |archivedate = 9 April 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nLalor stood for [[Electoral district of Ballaarat|{{Notatypo|Ballaarat}}]] in the 1855 elections and was elected unopposed.\n\nDuring a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, \"I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat.\"\n\n==Political legacy==\nThe actual significance of Eureka upon Australia's politics is not decisive. It has been variously interpreted as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation, of labour against a privileged ruling class, or as an expression of [[Republicanism in Australia|republicanism]]. In his 1897 travel book ''[[Following the Equator]]'', American writer [[Mark Twain]] wrote of the Eureka Rebellion:<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Twain\n |first       = Mark\n |authorlink  = Mark Twain\n |title       = Chapter XXIV\n |work        = Following The Equator\n |publisher   = Classical Bookshelf\n |year        = 1897\n |url         = http://www.classicbookshelf.com/library/mark_twain/following_the_equator/23/\n |accessdate  = 28 December 2006\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20061102031818/http://www.classicbookshelf.com/library/mark_twain/following_the_equator/23/\n |archivedate = 2 November 2006\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n{{quote|...

You Look'' booklet says M.A.D.E will be 'an online platform and immersive museum with a refreshing approach to culture, civics, history and citizenship. M.A.D.E puts the past into a contemporary context, celebrates Australia's achievements and inspires new ways of thinking about issues like equality, freedom of speech, parliamentary representation and the rule of law'. The museum 'will ignite debate about what it means to be an effective Australian in the 21st Century'.\n\n== Publications ==\n* ''Deaths at Eureka'' by Dorothy Wickham,<ref name=balthert>[http://www.ballaratheritage.com.au/bookstore/alpha1.html \"Ballarat Heritage Services-Bookstore\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219033539/http://www.ballaratheritage.com.au/bookstore/alpha1.html |date=19 February 2011 }} ''[[Ballarat Heritage Services]]''</ref>\n* ''The Eureka Encyclopaedia'' by Justin Corfield, Clare Gervasoni and Dorothy Wickham<ref name=balthert/>\n* ''The Eureka Flag: Our Starry Banner'' by Dorothy Wickham, Clare Gervasoni, Val D\u2019Angri.<ref name=balthert/>\n* ''History of Ballarat & Some Ballarat Reminiscences'', by W.D.

In sociology, a sense of emptiness is associated with [[social alienation]] of the individual. This sense of alienation may be suppressed while working, due to the routine nature of work tasks, but during leisure hours or during the weekend, people may feel a sense of \"existential vacuum\" and emptiness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mindnc.com/psyall/Existentialism_A_Brief_Overview.pdf |website=Mind NC |date=2012-02-16 |title=Existentialism A Brief Overview |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005043502/http://www.mindnc.com/psyall/Existentialism_A_Brief_Overview.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-05 }}</ref>\n\nIn political philosophy, emptiness is associated with [[nihilism]].

In his 1919 lectures he argued that European culture became \"empty of spirit\" and \"ignorant of the needs, the conditions, that are essential for the life of the spirit\". People experienced a \"spiritual emptiness\"  and their thinking became marked by a \"lazy passivity\" due to the \"absence of will from the life of thought\".

Muschamp states that \"along with the commercial interests that exploit this interest, it is the major factor now shaping attitudes toward public spaces, urban spaces, and even suburban sprawl.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ho.html |title=ArtLex's Ho-Hz page |publisher=Artlex.com |accessdate=2012-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429031635/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ho.html |archive-date=2012-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFilms that depict nothingness, shadows and vagueness, either in a visual sense or a moral sense are appreciated in genres such as [[film noir]]. As well, travellers and artists are often intrigued by and attracted to vast empty spaces, such as open deserts, barren wastelands or salt flats, and the open sea.\n\nIn visual arts emptiness and absence were recognized as phenomena that characterize not only particular works of [[art]] (e.g. [[Yves Klein]]) but also as a more general tendency within the history of [[modern art]] and [[aesthetics]]. Following [[Davor D\u017ealto]]'s argument on the modern concept of art, the gradual elimination of particular elements that traditionally characterized [[visual arts]], which results in emptiness, is the most important phenomenon within the history and [[theory of art]] over the past two hundred years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://instifdt.bg.ac.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Davor-Dzalto.pdf |title=Art: A Brief History of Absence (From the Conception and Birth, Life and Death, to the Living Deadness of Art) |publisher=Davor D\u017ealto |date= |accessdate=2015-11-03}}</ref>\n\n==In Eastern cultures==\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{Main|\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101}}\nThe Buddhist term ''emptiness'' (Skt. ''[[\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101]]'') refers specifically to the idea that everything is [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da|dependently originated]], including the causes and conditions themselves, and even the principle of causality itself.  It is not [[nihilism]], nor is it meditating on nothingness.<ref name=lamazopa>Interview on Emptiness by Lama Zopa Rinpoche.

[[Buddhapalita]] says:\n{{cquote |What is the reality of things just as it is? It is the absence of essence.

Available at: http://www.lamayeshe.com/otherteachers/hhdl/survey.shtml</ref> In [[Buddhist philosophy]], attaining a realization of emptiness of inherent existence is key to the permanent cessation of [[suffering]], i.e. [[nirvana|liberation]].\n\n{{cquote|Even while an ordinary being, if upon hearing of emptiness great joy arises within again and again, the eyes moisten with tears of great joy, and the hairs of the body stand on end, such a person has the seed of the mind of a complete Buddha; He is a vessel for teachings on [[tattva|thatness]], and ultimate truth should be taught to him.

As well, emptiness is \"linked to the creative Void, meaning that it is a state of complete receptivity and perfect enlightenment\", the merging of the \"ego with its own essence\", which Buddhists call the \"clear light\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plotinus.com/spiritual%20emptiness_copy.htm |title=About Spiritual Emptiness or the Void |publisher=Plotinus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>\n\nIn Ven. Thubten Chodron's 2005 interview with Lama Zopa Rinpoche, the lama noted that we \"...ordinary beings who haven't realized emptiness don't see things as similar to illusions\", and we do not \"realize that things are merely labeled by mind and exist by mere name\".<ref name=lamazopa/> He argues that \"when we meditate on emptiness, we drop an atom bomb on this [sense of a] truly existent I\" and we realize that \"what appears true... isn't true\". By this, the lama is claiming that what we think is real\u2014our thoughts and feelings about people and things\u2014\"exists by being merely labeled\". He argues that meditators who attain knowledge of a state of emptiness are able to realize that their thoughts are merely illusions from labelling by the mind.<ref name=lamazopa/>\n\n===Taoism===\nIn [[Taoism]], attaining a state of emptiness is viewed as a state of stillness and placidity which is the \"mirror of the universe\" and the \"pure mind\".<ref name=taopage>{{cite web|url=http://www.taopage.org/emptiness.html |title=Taoism - Wu - Emptiness |publisher=Taopage.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> The [[Tao Te Ching]] claims that emptiness is related to the \"Tao, the Great Principle, the Creator and Sustainer of everything in the universe\". It is argued that it is the \"state of mind of the Taoist disciple who follows the Tao\", who has successfully emptied the mind \"of all wishes and ideas not fitted with the Tao's Movement\". For a person who attains a state of emptiness, the \"still mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the glass of all things\", a state of \"vacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and non-action\" which is the \"perfection of the Tao and its characteristics, the \"mirror of the universe\" and the \"pure mind\".<ref name=taopage/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Boredom]]\n* [[Empty nest syndrome]]\n* [[Nihilism]]\n* [[Physiology]]\n* [[Soul]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Moss, Robert.
