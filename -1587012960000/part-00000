The DH may only be used for the pitcher (and not any other [[position player]]), as stated in Rule 5.11.<ref name=\"baseball rules (5.11 and otherwise)\" /> Use of the DH is optional, but must be determined before the start of the game. If a team does not begin a game with a DH, the pitcher (or a [[pinch hitter]]) must bat for the entire game.<ref name=\"MLB DH glossary\">{{Cite web |url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/rules/designated-hitter-rule |title=What is a Designated Hitter Rule? &#124; Glossary |website=Major League Baseball |language=en-US |access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\nThe designated hitter may be replaced as DH only by a player who has not entered the game. If a [[pinch hitter]] bats for, or a [[pinch runner]] runs for, the DH, that pinch-hitter or pinch-runner becomes the DH.<ref name=\"MLB DH glossary\" />\n\nThe designated hitter can be moved to a fielding position during the game. If the DH is moved to another position, his team forfeits the role of the designated hitter,<ref name=\"MLB DH glossary\" /> and the pitcher or another player (the latter possible only in case of a multiple substitution) would bat in the spot of the position player replaced by the former DH. If the designated hitter is moved to pitcher, any subsequent pitcher (or pinch-hitter thereof) would bat should that spot in the batting order come up again (except for a further multiple substitution). Likewise, if a pinch-hitter bats for a non-pitcher, and then remains in the game as the pitcher, the team would forfeit the use of the DH for the remainder of the game, and the player who was DH would become a position player (or exit the game).\n\nUnlike other positions, the DH is \"locked\" into the batting order. No multiple substitution may be made to alter the batting rotation of the DH. In other words, a [[Double switch (baseball)|double switch]] involving the DH and a position player is not legal. For example, if the DH is batting fourth and the catcher is batting eighth, the manager cannot replace both players so as to have the new catcher bat fourth and the new DH bat eighth. Once a team loses its DH under any of the scenarios discussed in the previous paragraph, the double switch becomes fully available, and may well be used via necessity, should the former DH be replaced in the lineup.\n\n===Interleague play and exhibitions===\n{{See also|Home advantage#Causes}}\nIn Major League Baseball, during [[interleague play]], the application of the DH rule is determined by the identity of the home team, with the rules of the home team's league applying to both teams. If the game is played in an American League park, the designated hitter may be used; in a National League park, the pitcher must bat or else be replaced with a pinch-hitter. On June 12, 1997, [[San Francisco Giants]] outfielder [[Glenallen Hill]] became the first [[National League]] player to DH in a regular-season game, when the Giants met the American League's [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington|The Ballpark in Arlington]] in interleague play.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TEX/TEX199706120.shtml |title=June 12, 1997 San Francisco Giants at Texas Rangers Box Score and Play by Play |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date=1997-06-12 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref>\n\nAt first, the DH rule was not applied to the [[World Series]].

Occasionally National League teams opt to use the designated hitter, usually when a player is recovering from an injury.\n\n==Background and history==\nThe rationale for the designated hitter rule arose comparatively early in the history of professional baseball. It was observed that, with a few exceptions\u2014most notably [[Babe Ruth]], who began his career as a pitcher with the [[Boston Red Sox]]\u2014pitchers are usually selected for the quality of their pitching, not their hitting, and that most pitchers were weak hitters who had to be batted ninth in the batting order and pinch-hit for late in games when their team was trailing. The designated hitter idea was raised by [[Philadelphia Athletics]] manager [[Connie Mack]] in 1906,<ref name=\"SI Wulf\">{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/flashback/1993/distinguished_history|title=Distinguished History|author=Wulf, Steve|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=1993-04-05|accessdate=2008-03-31|quote=The following excerpt is from the article \"Why the Pitcher Ought to Bat\", which first appeared in the ''Philadelphia North American'' and was reprinted in the Feb. 3, 1906, edition of ''Sporting Life'': The suggestion, often made, that the pitcher be denied a chance to bat, and a substitute player sent up to hit every time, has been brought to life again, and will come up for consideration when the American and National League Committees on rules get together. This time Connie Mack is credited with having made the suggestion.}}</ref> though he was not the first to propose it. The rumors were that he grew weary of watching [[Eddie Plank]] and [[Charles Bender]] flail at pitches when at bat. Mack's proposal received little support and was even lambasted by the press as \"wrong theoretically\".{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The notion did not die. In the late 1920s, [[National League]] president [[John Heydler]] made a number of attempts to introduce a 10th-man designated hitter as a way to speed up the game, and almost convinced National League clubs to agree to try it during spring training in 1929.<ref name=\"SI Wulf\"/>\n\nHowever, momentum to implement the DH did not pick up until the pitching dominance of the late 1960s. In 1968, [[Denny McLain]] won 31 games and [[Bob Gibson]] had a 1.12 [[earned run average|ERA]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gibsobo01.shtml |title=Bob Gibson Stats |website=Baseball-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> while [[Carl Yastrzemski]] led the [[American League]] in hitting with only a .301 average.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/y/yastrca01.shtml |title=Carl Yastrzemski Stats |website=Baseball-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> After the season, the rules were changed to lower the mound from 15 to 10&nbsp;inches and change the upper limit of the strike zone from the top of a batter's shoulders to his armpits.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mlb.com/cut4/why-was-the-mound-lowered-in-1968 |title=Why was the mound lowered in 1968 |last=Clair |first=Michael |date=2015-12-03 |website=MLB.com |language=en |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> In addition, in 1969 spring training, both the American League and National League agreed to try the designated pinch hitter (DPH), but they did not agree on the implementation. Most NL teams chose not to participate. However, a four-year trial in which the [[International League]] and four other minor leagues started using the DH for their games began that year.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://sabr.org/research/historical-evolution-designated-hitter-rule |title = The Historical Evolution of the Designated Hitter Rule &#124; Society for American Baseball Research}}</ref>\n\nLike other experimental baseball rule changes of the 1960s and 70s, the DH was embraced by Oakland A's owner [[Charlie O. Finley]]. On January 11, 1973, Finley and the other American League owners voted 8\u20134 to approve the designated hitter for a three-year trial run.<ref name=\"SI Wulf\"/> On April 6, 1973, [[Ron Blomberg]] of the New York Yankees became the first designated hitter in Major League Baseball history, facing Boston Red Sox right-handed pitcher [[Luis Tiant]] in his first [[plate appearance]]. \"Boomer\" Blomberg was [[base on balls|walked]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS197304060.shtml |title=April 6, 1973 New York Yankees at Boston Red Sox Box Score and Play by Play |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date=1973-04-06 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> The result of the first season of the DH was that the American League posted a higher batting average than the National League, something that has remained consistent to this day.\n\nIn response to increases in American League attendance because of the designated hitter,<ref name=\"DH attendance\">{{Cite paper |last=Domazlicky |first=Bruce R. |last2=Kerr |first2=Peter M. |date=1990 |title=Baseball Attendance and the Designated Hitter |journal=The American Economist |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=62\u201368 |issn=0569-4345|jstor=25603837 |doi=10.1177/056943459003400107 }}</ref> the National League held a yes/no vote on August 13, 1980, to determine whether or not the league would adopt the designated hitter.

Unable to contact Carpenter, who was on a fishing trip, Giles was forced to abstain from voting.<ref name=\"phillies abstain DH vote\" /> Prior to the meeting, Harding Peterson, general manager for the Pittsburgh Pirates, was told to side with the Phillies however they voted. The final tally was four teams voting for the DH (Atlanta Braves, New York Mets, St. Louis Cardinals, and San Diego Padres), five votes against (Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers, Montreal Expos, and San Francisco Giants), and three abstentions (Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Houston Astros). Five days after that meeting, the Cardinals fired their general manager, John Clairborne, who was the leading proponent for the adoption of the DH rule, and the National League has not held another vote on the issue.<ref>ESPN Baseball Tonight, airdate Friday, 12am, July 12, 2013</ref>\n\nAs time passed, the designated hitter rule has enabled American League managers to consider multiple strategic options in setting their teams' lineups: they can rotate the DH role among part-time players (for example, using a left-handed batter against a right-handed pitcher and vice versa) or they can employ a full-time designated hitter against all pitchers. It also allows them to give a healthy everyday player a partial day off, or to give an injured player the opportunity to bat without exposing him to re-injury while playing in the field.\n\nIn recent years, full-time DHs have become less common, and the position has been used to give players a partial off-day, allowing them to bat but rest while the other team is batting. This option comes in very handy when a team's lineup includes several older players. The 2012 Yankees, for example, rotated five players through the DH spot during the season, all of them over 34 years old.<ref>Baseball Explained, by Phillip Mahony. McFarland Books, 2014.

On the other hand, there are also fans who enjoy the fact that the American and National Leagues use different rules. Two generations of fans of American League teams have grown up with the designated hitter rule being in place, so some may consider the designated hitter to be as much a traditional part of baseball as the pitcher taking his turn at bat is for fans of National League teams.\n\nCritics often argue that use of the designated hitter introduces an asymmetry to the game by separating players into classes, creating offensive and defensive specialization more akin to [[American football]].<ref name=\"NFL DH comparison\">{{Cite web |url=https://theweek.com/articles/552430/dont-bring-designated-hitter-national-league |title=Don't bring the designated hitter to the National League |last=Dougherty |first=Michael Brendan |date=2015-04-30 |website=theweek.com |access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref> Opponents of the rule believe it effectively separates pitchers, other fielders, and designated hitters into separate roles that never cross, possibly causing issues with promoting '[[batting cage]]' players whose scope of experience is extremely limited. However, when the pitcher bats alongside everyone else, all nine players must take turns at the plate and in the field, and the hybridization of roles requires that everyone knows other roles in addition to their own.\n\nThe designated hitter rule also changes managerial strategy in late innings. In the National League, a manager must decide when to let a pitcher bat or remove him, as well as with whom to pinch-hit and where or if that player should take the field afterward. When the decision to remove a pitcher is made, the manager may also elect to [[Double switch (baseball)|double switch]], delaying the new pitcher's turn at bat. A designated hitter reduces the need for late-inning [[pinch hitter]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Votano |first=Paul |year=2013 |title=Stand and Deliver: A History of Pinch-Hitting |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-1588-5 |oclc=52047315 |pages=172\u201373}}</ref>\n\nAdvocates of the designated hitter<ref name= USATODAYproscons>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2004-09-06-dh-pros-and-cons_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Renewing the DH debate | date=September 7, 2004 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name= ESPNproscons>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2003/0327/1530427.html |title=ESPN.com: MLB \u2013 Designated place in history |publisher=Static.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> point to the fact that it has extended many careers, and, in a few cases, ''created'' long, productive careers for players who are weak fielders or have a history of injuries, such as [[Edgar Mart\u00ednez]] and [[David Ortiz]].

In [[high school baseball in South Korea]], the rule has been adopted since 2004.

If the pitcher opts to bat for himself, he is treated as two separate positions \u2013 a pitcher and a designated hitter (abbreviated P/DH on the lineup card) \u2013 and may be substituted for as such (i.e. if he is removed as the pitcher, he may remain as the designated hitter and vice versa). However, if a player who starts a game as a P/DH is relieved as the starting pitcher, he may not return to the mound even if he remains in the game as the DH, and he may not play any other defensive position after being relieved as the pitcher unless he immediately moves to another defensive position, in which case the new pitcher must assume the spot in the batting order of the fielder the P/DH substituted for, and the DH is lost for the remainder of the game. Conversely, a player who begins the game as the DH, but not as the pitcher, may come into the game as a reliever and remain as the DH (in effect becoming a P/DH), be relieved on the mound later in the game but continue to bat as the DH.\n\nIn [[Little League Baseball]], the DH is not used.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://baseballcoaching.tips/little-league-baseball-everything-you-need-to-know-from-bats-drills-rules-field-dimensions-uniforms-bracket-sheets-down-to-the-pitch-count-scorebook/ |title=Everything you need to know about Little League Baseball- From Bats, Drills, Rules, Field Dimensions, Uniforms, Bracket Sheets Down to the Little League Pitch Count Baseball Scorebook |last=Dean |date=2011-06-07 |website=Baseball Coaching Tips |language=en-US |access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cantonlittleleague.org/Page.asp?n=18791 |title=Junior League Baseball &#124; Canton Little League |website=cantonlittleleague.org |access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rutherford-ll.info/rules.htm |title=Little League Rules |website=www.rutherford-ll.info |access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref> However, a league may adopt a rule which requires all players present and able to play to be listed in the batting order (such that the order contains more than nine players), and thus all players will have a turn to bat even when they are not assigned a fielding position.

The DH may only be used for the pitcher (and not any other [[position player]]), as stated in Rule 5.11.<ref name=\"baseball rules (5.11 and otherwise)\" /> Use of the DH is optional, but must be determined before the start of the game. If a team does not begin a game with a DH, the pitcher (or a [[pinch hitter]]) must bat for the entire game.<ref name=\"MLB DH glossary\">{{Cite web |url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/rules/designated-hitter-rule |title=What is a Designated Hitter Rule? &#124; Glossary |website=Major League Baseball |language=en-US |access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\nThe designated hitter may be replaced as DH only by a player who has not entered the game. If a [[pinch hitter]] bats for, or a [[pinch runner]] runs for, the DH, that pinch-hitter or pinch-runner becomes the DH.<ref name=\"MLB DH glossary\" />\n\nThe designated hitter can be moved to a fielding position during the game. If the DH is moved to another position, his team forfeits the role of the designated hitter,<ref name=\"MLB DH glossary\" /> and the pitcher or another player (the latter possible only in case of a multiple substitution) would bat in the spot of the position player replaced by the former DH. If the designated hitter is moved to pitcher, any subsequent pitcher (or pinch-hitter thereof) would bat should that spot in the batting order come up again (except for a further multiple substitution). Likewise, if a pinch-hitter bats for a non-pitcher, and then remains in the game as the pitcher, the team would forfeit the use of the DH for the remainder of the game, and the player who was DH would become a position player (or exit the game).\n\nUnlike other positions, the DH is \"locked\" into the batting order. No multiple substitution may be made to alter the batting rotation of the DH. In other words, a [[Double switch (baseball)|double switch]] involving the DH and a position player is not legal. For example, if the DH is batting fourth and the catcher is batting eighth, the manager cannot replace both players so as to have the new catcher bat fourth and the new DH bat eighth. Once a team loses its DH under any of the scenarios discussed in the previous paragraph, the double switch becomes fully available, and may well be used via necessity, should the former DH be replaced in the lineup.\n\n===Interleague play and exhibitions===\n{{See also|Home advantage#Causes}}\nIn Major League Baseball, during [[interleague play]], the application of the DH rule is determined by the identity of the home team, with the rules of the home team's league applying to both teams. If the game is played in an American League park, the designated hitter may be used; in a National League park, the pitcher must bat or else be replaced with a pinch-hitter.

Occasionally National League teams opt to use the designated hitter, usually when a player is recovering from an injury.\n\n==Background and history==\nThe rationale for the designated hitter rule arose comparatively early in the history of professional baseball. It was observed that, with a few exceptions\u2014most notably [[Babe Ruth]], who began his career as a pitcher with the [[Boston Red Sox]]\u2014pitchers are usually selected for the quality of their pitching, not their hitting, and that most pitchers were weak hitters who had to be batted ninth in the batting order and pinch-hit for late in games when their team was trailing. The designated hitter idea was raised by [[Philadelphia Athletics]] manager [[Connie Mack]] in 1906,<ref name=\"SI Wulf\">{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/flashback/1993/distinguished_history|title=Distinguished History|author=Wulf, Steve|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=1993-04-05|accessdate=2008-03-31|quote=The following excerpt is from the article \"Why the Pitcher Ought to Bat\", which first appeared in the ''Philadelphia North American'' and was reprinted in the Feb. 3, 1906, edition of ''Sporting Life'': The suggestion, often made, that the pitcher be denied a chance to bat, and a substitute player sent up to hit every time, has been brought to life again, and will come up for consideration when the American and National League Committees on rules get together. This time Connie Mack is credited with having made the suggestion.}}</ref> though he was not the first to propose it. The rumors were that he grew weary of watching [[Eddie Plank]] and [[Charles Bender]] flail at pitches when at bat. Mack's proposal received little support and was even lambasted by the press as \"wrong theoretically\".{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The notion did not die. In the late 1920s, [[National League]] president [[John Heydler]] made a number of attempts to introduce a 10th-man designated hitter as a way to speed up the game, and almost convinced National League clubs to agree to try it during spring training in 1929.<ref name=\"SI Wulf\"/>\n\nHowever, momentum to implement the DH did not pick up until the pitching dominance of the late 1960s. In 1968, [[Denny McLain]] won 31 games and [[Bob Gibson]] had a 1.12 [[earned run average|ERA]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gibsobo01.shtml |title=Bob Gibson Stats |website=Baseball-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> while [[Carl Yastrzemski]] led the [[American League]] in hitting with only a .301 average.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/y/yastrca01.shtml |title=Carl Yastrzemski Stats |website=Baseball-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> After the season, the rules were changed to lower the mound from 15 to 10&nbsp;inches and change the upper limit of the strike zone from the top of a batter's shoulders to his armpits.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mlb.com/cut4/why-was-the-mound-lowered-in-1968 |title=Why was the mound lowered in 1968 |last=Clair |first=Michael |date=2015-12-03 |website=MLB.com |language=en |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> In addition, in 1969 spring training, both the American League and National League agreed to try the designated pinch hitter (DPH), but they did not agree on the implementation. Most NL teams chose not to participate. However, a four-year trial in which the [[International League]] and four other minor leagues started using the DH for their games began that year.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://sabr.org/research/historical-evolution-designated-hitter-rule |title = The Historical Evolution of the Designated Hitter Rule &#124; Society for American Baseball Research}}</ref>\n\nLike other experimental baseball rule changes of the 1960s and 70s, the DH was embraced by Oakland A's owner [[Charlie O.

Unable to contact Carpenter, who was on a fishing trip, Giles was forced to abstain from voting.<ref name=\"phillies abstain DH vote\" /> Prior to the meeting, Harding Peterson, general manager for the Pittsburgh Pirates, was told to side with the Phillies however they voted. The final tally was four teams voting for the DH (Atlanta Braves, New York Mets, St. Louis Cardinals, and San Diego Padres), five votes against (Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers, Montreal Expos, and San Francisco Giants), and three abstentions (Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Houston Astros). Five days after that meeting, the Cardinals fired their general manager, John Clairborne, who was the leading proponent for the adoption of the DH rule, and the National League has not held another vote on the issue.<ref>ESPN Baseball Tonight, airdate Friday, 12am, July 12, 2013</ref>\n\nAs time passed, the designated hitter rule has enabled American League managers to consider multiple strategic options in setting their teams' lineups: they can rotate the DH role among part-time players (for example, using a left-handed batter against a right-handed pitcher and vice versa) or they can employ a full-time designated hitter against all pitchers. It also allows them to give a healthy everyday player a partial day off, or to give an injured player the opportunity to bat without exposing him to re-injury while playing in the field.\n\nIn recent years, full-time DHs have become less common, and the position has been used to give players a partial off-day, allowing them to bat but rest while the other team is batting. This option comes in very handy when a team's lineup includes several older players. The 2012 Yankees, for example, rotated five players through the DH spot during the season, all of them over 34 years old.<ref>Baseball Explained, by Phillip Mahony. McFarland Books, 2014.

On the other hand, there are also fans who enjoy the fact that the American and National Leagues use different rules. Two generations of fans of American League teams have grown up with the designated hitter rule being in place, so some may consider the designated hitter to be as much a traditional part of baseball as the pitcher taking his turn at bat is for fans of National League teams.\n\nCritics often argue that use of the designated hitter introduces an asymmetry to the game by separating players into classes, creating offensive and defensive specialization more akin to [[American football]].<ref name=\"NFL DH comparison\">{{Cite web |url=https://theweek.com/articles/552430/dont-bring-designated-hitter-national-league |title=Don't bring the designated hitter to the National League |last=Dougherty |first=Michael Brendan |date=2015-04-30 |website=theweek.com |access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref> Opponents of the rule believe it effectively separates pitchers, other fielders, and designated hitters into separate roles that never cross, possibly causing issues with promoting '[[batting cage]]' players whose scope of experience is extremely limited. However, when the pitcher bats alongside everyone else, all nine players must take turns at the plate and in the field, and the hybridization of roles requires that everyone knows other roles in addition to their own.\n\nThe designated hitter rule also changes managerial strategy in late innings. In the National League, a manager must decide when to let a pitcher bat or remove him, as well as with whom to pinch-hit and where or if that player should take the field afterward. When the decision to remove a pitcher is made, the manager may also elect to [[Double switch (baseball)|double switch]], delaying the new pitcher's turn at bat.

In amateur baseball, many pitchers are also good hitters and will often play another position (or even DH) when not pitching. [[High school baseball in Japan|Japanese high school baseball]] is one of the few amateur baseball leagues in the world that has never used the designated hitter rule at all. In [[high school baseball in South Korea]], the rule has been adopted since 2004. [[American Legion]] rules, on the other hand, allow the DH only to bat for the pitcher; prior to 1995, the use of the DH was not allowed in Legion baseball at all.\n\nIn [[college baseball]], [[NCAA]] rules<ref name=\"NCAA rules college baseball\">{{Cite book |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/BA20.pdf |title=2019 and 2020 Baseball Rules and Interpretations |publisher=NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION |year=2018 |editor-last=Brownlee |editor-first=Ben |location=Indianapolis |pages=63-65 |language=English |chapter=Rule 7\u2014Batting |format=PDF |issn=0736-5209 |oclc=557495128 |access-date=2019-05-13 |url-status=live}}</ref> state that the designated hitter must hit for the pitcher, but in many instances the pitcher is also a good hitter, and the coach may elect to let the pitcher bat in the lineup. If the pitcher opts to bat for himself, he is treated as two separate positions \u2013 a pitcher and a designated hitter (abbreviated P/DH on the lineup card) \u2013 and may be substituted for as such (i.e. if he is removed as the pitcher, he may remain as the designated hitter and vice versa). However, if a player who starts a game as a P/DH is relieved as the starting pitcher, he may not return to the mound even if he remains in the game as the DH, and he may not play any other defensive position after being relieved as the pitcher unless he immediately moves to another defensive position, in which case the new pitcher must assume the spot in the batting order of the fielder the P/DH substituted for, and the DH is lost for the remainder of the game. Conversely, a player who begins the game as the DH, but not as the pitcher, may come into the game as a reliever and remain as the DH (in effect becoming a P/DH), be relieved on the mound later in the game but continue to bat as the DH.\n\nIn [[Little League Baseball]], the DH is not used.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://baseballcoaching.tips/little-league-baseball-everything-you-need-to-know-from-bats-drills-rules-field-dimensions-uniforms-bracket-sheets-down-to-the-pitch-count-scorebook/ |title=Everything you need to know about Little League Baseball- From Bats, Drills, Rules, Field Dimensions, Uniforms, Bracket Sheets Down to the Little League Pitch Count Baseball Scorebook |last=Dean |date=2011-06-07 |website=Baseball Coaching Tips |language=en-US |access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cantonlittleleague.org/Page.asp?n=18791 |title=Junior League Baseball &#124; Canton Little League |website=cantonlittleleague.org |access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rutherford-ll.info/rules.htm |title=Little League Rules |website=www.rutherford-ll.info |access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref> However, a league may adopt a rule which requires all players present and able to play to be listed in the batting order (such that the order contains more than nine players), and thus all players will have a turn to bat even when they are not assigned a fielding position.

The band is known for [[musical improvisation]], extended [[Jam session#Rock|jams]], blending of [[Music genre|genres]], and a dedicated [[Fandom|fan base]]. The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.\n\nThe band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the quartet lineup has remained in place since then. Their lineup stable, Phish performed together for 15 years before beginning a two-year hiatus in October 2000. The band regrouped in late 2002, but disbanded in August 2004 after a farewell performance at their [[Phish festivals#Coventry|Coventry Festival]] in Vermont. They reunited in March 2009 for a series of three consecutive concerts at [[Hampton Coliseum]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], and have since resumed performing regularly.\n\nPhish's music blends elements of a wide variety of genres,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phish.net/faq/whatisphish|title= What Is Phish? |accessdate=2011-02-09 |work=FAQ Files|publisher=Phish.net}}</ref> including [[funk]], [[progressive rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[Pop music|pop]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/183259-phish-fuego/ | title=Phish - Fuego | magazine=[[PopMatters]] | date=July 1, 2014 | accessdate=September 3, 2015 | author=Conaton, Chris}}</ref> The band was part of a movement of improvisational rock groups, inspired by the [[Grateful Dead]] and colloquially known as \"[[jam band]]s\", which gained considerable popularity as touring concert acts in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |title=8 Bands Carrying on Jerry Garcia's Legacy |url=http://www.legacy.com/news/culture-and-trends/article/8-bands-carrying-on-jerry-garcias-legacy |website=Legacy.com |accessdate=14 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hyden |first1=Steven |title=Is Phish a Great Band? |url=http://grantland.com/features/after-30-years-consider-phish-great-band/ |website=Grantland |accessdate=14 December 2018 |date=6 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nPhish has developed a large and dedicated following by word of mouth, the exchange of live recordings, and selling over 8 million albums and DVDs in the United States.<ref name=\"news\">{{cite web | title = News Archives | url = http://phish.com/#/news/index.php?year=2009&hash=story460 |publisher=Phish.com | accessdate = 2011-01-28}}</ref> In 1998, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described Phish as \"the most important band of the '90s.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perella |first1=Dominic |title=Anastasio puts Phish behind him with strong solo effort |url=https://azdailysun.com/anastasio-puts-phish-behind-him-with-strong-solo-effort/article_2ef6ced0-1eb1-500c-85c4-35c5433b3c6e.html |website=Arizona Daily Sun |accessdate=25 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The magazine later wrote that the band helped to \"spawn a new wave of bands oriented around group improvisation and extended instrumental [[groove (music)|groove]]s\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/phish/biography|title=Phish|accessdate=2008-05-11|work=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414030730/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/phish/biography|archive-date=2009-04-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and ''The White Tape'': 1983\u20131986===\nPhish was formed at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) in 1983 by guitarists [[Trey Anastasio]] and [[Jeff Holdsworth]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], and drummer [[Jon Fishman]].

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s.

Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website. Legal [[field recording]]s produced by [[Taper (concert)|tapers]] with boom microphones from the audience in compliance with Phish's tape trading policy<ref name=\"taping\">{{cite web | title = Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 What is the Phish and Band Member Taping Policy? | publisher = Phish.com | url = http://phish.com/faq/#taping-guidelines | accessdate = 2018-10-03}}</ref> are frequently traded on any number of music message boards. Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]]. However, tapers are also required to purchase a general admission ticket for concerts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Phish Tickets Website |url=http://tickets.phish.com/information/ |website=tickets.phish.com |accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref> The band disallowed tapers from patching directly into Paul Languedoc's soundboard in 1990, after a fan unplugged some of his equipment during a concert that June.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAQ - Phish.net |url=https://phish.net/faq/recording-sources |website=phish.net |accessdate=24 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the band launched their own on-demand streaming service, LivePhish+.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish launch streaming subscription service LivePhish+ |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2014/10/phish-launch-streaming-subscription-service-livephish/ |website=Consequence of Sound |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=30 October 2014}}</ref> The platform features hundreds of soundboard recordings of the band's concerts for streaming, including all of their shows from 2002 onwards, as well as all of their studio albums.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gilmer |first1=Marcus |title=How Phish became the unlikely heroes of digital music streaming |url=https://mashable.com/article/phish-streaming-pioneers-band/#qPurm2UQ4PqL |website=Mashable |accessdate=16 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nPhish have hosted 10 festivals; the first was The Clifford Ball in [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh, New York]], in 1996; the most recent was Magnaball in 2015. Each festival has attracted upwards of 30,000 fans. Only one festival (Camp Oswego) featured performances by bands other than Phish.\n\n==In other media and popular culture==\n\n===Books and podcasts===\nSeveral books on Phish have been published, including two official publications: ''The Phish Book'', a 1998 [[coffee table book]] credited to the band members and journalist Richard Gehr which focused on the band's activities during 1996 and 1997,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Phish Book |url=https://ew.com/article/1998/11/27/phish-book/ |website=EW.com |accessdate=8 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref> and ''Phish: The Biography'', a semi-official biographical book written by music journalist and Phish fan Parke Puterbaugh, was published in 2009 and was based on interviews with the four band members, their friends and crew.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish: The Biography review |url=https://glidemagazine.com/14923/phish-the-biography/ |website=glidemagazine.com |accessdate=8 April 2019}}</ref> An installment of the [[33\u2153]] book series on ''[[A Live One]]'', written by Walter Holland, was published in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/phishs-a-live-one-9781628929386/|title=Phish's A Live One|website=Bloomsbury Publishing}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to books, there have been multiple podcasts which have focused on Phish, its music and fanbase as their central topics of discussion. Among the first was ''Analyze Phish'' which was hosted by comedians [[Harris Wittels]] and [[Scott Aukerman]] for the [[Earwolf]] podcast network, and ran for ten episodes posted between 2011 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish 101, episode #1 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/phish-101/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fuego, episode #10 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/fuego/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref> The podcast followed Wittels, a devoted fan of the band, in his humorous attempts to get Aukerman to enjoy their music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Harris Wittels: The Parks and Rec Writer Gets to \"Analyze Phish\" (Throwback) |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/harris-wittels-the-parks-and-rec-writer-gets-to-analyze-phish/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=26 February 2015}}</ref> Despite its truncated run, ''Analyze Phish'' inspired Phish lyricist Tom Marshall to start his own Phish podcast, ''Under the Scales'', in 2016.<ref name=\"osiris\">{{cite web |last1=Greenhaus |first1=Mike |title=Interview: Tom Marshall and RJ Bee on New Podcast Network Osiris |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/interview_tom_marshall_and_rj_bee_on_new_podcast_network_osiris/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=22 February 2018}}</ref> In 2018, Marshall co-founded the Osiris Podcasting Network, which hosts ''Under the Scales'' and other music podcasts, many of which are devoted to Phish or other jam bands.<ref name=\"osiris\"/> On 15 September 2019, C13Originals debuted ''Long May They Run'', a music documentary podcast series.

The band is known for [[musical improvisation]], extended [[Jam session#Rock|jams]], blending of [[Music genre|genres]], and a dedicated [[Fandom|fan base]]. The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.\n\nThe band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the quartet lineup has remained in place since then. Their lineup stable, Phish performed together for 15 years before beginning a two-year hiatus in October 2000. The band regrouped in late 2002, but disbanded in August 2004 after a farewell performance at their [[Phish festivals#Coventry|Coventry Festival]] in Vermont. They reunited in March 2009 for a series of three consecutive concerts at [[Hampton Coliseum]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], and have since resumed performing regularly.\n\nPhish's music blends elements of a wide variety of genres,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phish.net/faq/whatisphish|title= What Is Phish? |accessdate=2011-02-09 |work=FAQ Files|publisher=Phish.net}}</ref> including [[funk]], [[progressive rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[Pop music|pop]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/183259-phish-fuego/ | title=Phish - Fuego | magazine=[[PopMatters]] | date=July 1, 2014 | accessdate=September 3, 2015 | author=Conaton, Chris}}</ref> The band was part of a movement of improvisational rock groups, inspired by the [[Grateful Dead]] and colloquially known as \"[[jam band]]s\", which gained considerable popularity as touring concert acts in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |title=8 Bands Carrying on Jerry Garcia's Legacy |url=http://www.legacy.com/news/culture-and-trends/article/8-bands-carrying-on-jerry-garcias-legacy |website=Legacy.com |accessdate=14 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hyden |first1=Steven |title=Is Phish a Great Band? |url=http://grantland.com/features/after-30-years-consider-phish-great-band/ |website=Grantland |accessdate=14 December 2018 |date=6 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nPhish has developed a large and dedicated following by word of mouth, the exchange of live recordings, and selling over 8 million albums and DVDs in the United States.<ref name=\"news\">{{cite web | title = News Archives | url = http://phish.com/#/news/index.php?year=2009&hash=story460 |publisher=Phish.com | accessdate = 2011-01-28}}</ref> In 1998, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described Phish as \"the most important band of the '90s.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perella |first1=Dominic |title=Anastasio puts Phish behind him with strong solo effort |url=https://azdailysun.com/anastasio-puts-phish-behind-him-with-strong-solo-effort/article_2ef6ced0-1eb1-500c-85c4-35c5433b3c6e.html |website=Arizona Daily Sun |accessdate=25 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The magazine later wrote that the band helped to \"spawn a new wave of bands oriented around group improvisation and extended instrumental [[groove (music)|groove]]s\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/phish/biography|title=Phish|accessdate=2008-05-11|work=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414030730/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/phish/biography|archive-date=2009-04-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and ''The White Tape'': 1983\u20131986===\nPhish was formed at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) in 1983 by guitarists [[Trey Anastasio]] and [[Jeff Holdsworth]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], and drummer [[Jon Fishman]].

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s. Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" and \"Guyute\") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much like the music of one of their heroes, [[Frank Zappa]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from.

With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website. Legal [[field recording]]s produced by [[Taper (concert)|tapers]] with boom microphones from the audience in compliance with Phish's tape trading policy<ref name=\"taping\">{{cite web | title = Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 What is the Phish and Band Member Taping Policy? | publisher = Phish.com | url = http://phish.com/faq/#taping-guidelines | accessdate = 2018-10-03}}</ref> are frequently traded on any number of music message boards. Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]]. However, tapers are also required to purchase a general admission ticket for concerts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Phish Tickets Website |url=http://tickets.phish.com/information/ |website=tickets.phish.com |accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref> The band disallowed tapers from patching directly into Paul Languedoc's soundboard in 1990, after a fan unplugged some of his equipment during a concert that June.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAQ - Phish.net |url=https://phish.net/faq/recording-sources |website=phish.net |accessdate=24 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the band launched their own on-demand streaming service, LivePhish+.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish launch streaming subscription service LivePhish+ |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2014/10/phish-launch-streaming-subscription-service-livephish/ |website=Consequence of Sound |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=30 October 2014}}</ref> The platform features hundreds of soundboard recordings of the band's concerts for streaming, including all of their shows from 2002 onwards, as well as all of their studio albums.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gilmer |first1=Marcus |title=How Phish became the unlikely heroes of digital music streaming |url=https://mashable.com/article/phish-streaming-pioneers-band/#qPurm2UQ4PqL |website=Mashable |accessdate=16 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nPhish have hosted 10 festivals; the first was The Clifford Ball in [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh, New York]], in 1996; the most recent was Magnaball in 2015. Each festival has attracted upwards of 30,000 fans. Only one festival (Camp Oswego) featured performances by bands other than Phish.\n\n==In other media and popular culture==\n\n===Books and podcasts===\nSeveral books on Phish have been published, including two official publications: ''The Phish Book'', a 1998 [[coffee table book]] credited to the band members and journalist Richard Gehr which focused on the band's activities during 1996 and 1997,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Phish Book |url=https://ew.com/article/1998/11/27/phish-book/ |website=EW.com |accessdate=8 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref> and ''Phish: The Biography'', a semi-official biographical book written by music journalist and Phish fan Parke Puterbaugh, was published in 2009 and was based on interviews with the four band members, their friends and crew.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish: The Biography review |url=https://glidemagazine.com/14923/phish-the-biography/ |website=glidemagazine.com |accessdate=8 April 2019}}</ref> An installment of the [[33\u2153]] book series on ''[[A Live One]]'', written by Walter Holland, was published in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/phishs-a-live-one-9781628929386/|title=Phish's A Live One|website=Bloomsbury Publishing}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to books, there have been multiple podcasts which have focused on Phish, its music and fanbase as their central topics of discussion. Among the first was ''Analyze Phish'' which was hosted by comedians [[Harris Wittels]] and [[Scott Aukerman]] for the [[Earwolf]] podcast network, and ran for ten episodes posted between 2011 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish 101, episode #1 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/phish-101/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fuego, episode #10 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/fuego/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref> The podcast followed Wittels, a devoted fan of the band, in his humorous attempts to get Aukerman to enjoy their music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Harris Wittels: The Parks and Rec Writer Gets to \"Analyze Phish\" (Throwback) |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/harris-wittels-the-parks-and-rec-writer-gets-to-analyze-phish/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=26 February 2015}}</ref> Despite its truncated run, ''Analyze Phish'' inspired Phish lyricist Tom Marshall to start his own Phish podcast, ''Under the Scales'', in 2016.<ref name=\"osiris\">{{cite web |last1=Greenhaus |first1=Mike |title=Interview: Tom Marshall and RJ Bee on New Podcast Network Osiris |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/interview_tom_marshall_and_rj_bee_on_new_podcast_network_osiris/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=22 February 2018}}</ref> In 2018, Marshall co-founded the Osiris Podcasting Network, which hosts ''Under the Scales'' and other music podcasts, many of which are devoted to Phish or other jam bands.<ref name=\"osiris\"/> On 15 September 2019, C13Originals debuted ''Long May They Run'', a music documentary podcast series.

The bluish-green color of Ariel's mermaid tail was a hue specially mixed by the Disney paint lab; the color was named \"Ariel\" after the character. The choice of red as Ariel's hair color was the subject of dispute between the filmmakers and studio executives who wanted the character to have blonde hair. It was noted that red hair contrasted better with Ariel's green tail, red was easier to darken than yellow, and Disney's live-action branch [[Touchstone Pictures]] had recently released ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' that had a blonde mermaid; Ariel's red hair was ultimately kept.<ref name=\"MTLM\">{{cite video | title = Treasures Untold: The Making of Disney's The Little Mermaid | publisher = [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] |date = 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview, Jodi Benson stated that for ''Ariel's Beginning'', the writers revised the script multiple times to make sure Ariel retained her relevance in a more modern context.

She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they take to a seagull named [[Scuttle (The Little Mermaid)|Scuttle]] for appraisal. Ariel falls in love with a human prince named [[Prince Eric]] after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, [[Ursula (Disney)|Ursula]], who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric [[Romantic love|fall in love]] with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.\n\nUnknown to Ariel, this agreement is part of Ursula's bigger plan to trap Ariel's father, King Triton and steal his magical trident. After being transformed, Ariel found that she can no longer breathe, nor swim. Sebastian and Flounder take her to the surface. She is soon found by Eric and is taken back to his castle. Ariel almost manages to obtain the \"kiss of true love\", but is stopped by Ursula's underhanded tactics. On the third day, Ursula transforms herself into a human, calling herself \"Vanessa\" and using Ariel's voice, and bewitches Eric to make him marry her. After learning from Scuttle that the woman is Ursula in disguise, Ariel disrupts the wedding and regains her voice but the sun sets as Ariel and Prince Eric are about to kiss, transforming Ariel back into a mermaid. After transforming herself back into her true witch form, Ursula takes Ariel back into the ocean, where she is met by King Triton and Sebastian.\n\nTriton trades himself for Ariel, enabling Ursula to steal his crown and enabling her to claim his trident, a fascination which angers Ariel, who will not allow Ursula to destroy merfolk and humans. In the battle that follows, Ariel is trapped at the bottom of a whirlpool. Before Ursula can destroy her, Eric kills Ursula by ramming a derelict ship's splintered prow through her. After Ursula dies, her spell is broken, and King Triton and the merfolk are transformed back to normal merpeople. At the end of the film, after King Triton uses his magical trident to transform her into a human, Ariel leaves the sea to live in the human world, and she and Eric marry and live happily ever after.<ref name=\"mermaid\" />\n\n===Television series===\n{{main|The Little Mermaid (TV series)}}\nA prequel television series that originally aired from 1992 to 1994, depicts Ariel's life as a mermaid under the sea with Sebastian, Flounder, and her father. Ariel appears in all 31 episodes of the series, which is set an unspecified time before the first film. The series follows Ariel's adventures with her friends and family and sometimes has Ariel foiling the attempts of enemies that are intent on harming her or the kingdom of Atlantica.\n\nAriel's relationships with various characters from the film are highlighted and expanded, such as the love and occasional conflict between Ariel and her father, how Ariel met Flounder and Scuttle, the relationships between Ariel and her sisters, and Ariel's early fear and avoidance of Ursula the sea witch. Other recurring new characters are also introduced, such as orphaned merboy Urchin and mute mermaid Gabriella that become Ariel's friends, as well as the Evil Manta, Lobster Mobster and Da Shrimp, who are Ariel's enemies. Ariel's mother is absent, having already died prior to the events of the series, though she is occasionally mentioned in vague terms. In one episode Ariel comes across [[Hans Christian Andersen]], author of \"The Little Mermaid\", while he was traveling underwater in a primitive submarine. In the fictionalized encounter she saves Andersen's life, inspiring him to write the story.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Metal Fish|airdate=1993-11-06|number=22|season=2|series=[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]|network=Disney Channel}}</ref>\n\nSome episodes of the series are musical and feature original songs performed by the characters.

When Melody's safety is threatened by Ursula's sister Morgana after using her as a hostage to get Triton's trident, Ariel and her husband Eric decide they must keep Melody away from the sea. So they build a large wall to separate it from the castle.\n\nBut Melody's love of the sea proves too strong and she visits Morgana, who turns her into a mermaid temporarily. King Triton uses his trident to transform Ariel back into her own mermaid form to find and rescue Melody. Morgana tricks Melody into taking part in a plot to steal her grandfather King Triton's trident. Together with Tip the Penguin and Dash the Walrus she goes to Atlantica and succeeds in acquiring the trident. Ariel arrives as they return with it to Morgana, and tries to persuade Melody to give back the trident. Morgana captures Melody then seals her behind ice wall. Tip and Dash rescue Melody and Ariel saves Eric from Cloak and Dagger who tied him and pulled it into the depths. Morgana then uses the trident's magic to force everyone to bow before her.\n\nMelody manages to grab the trident and returns it to King Triton, who then punishes Morgana by sending her to the bottom of the ocean frozen in a block of ice. Triton returns Ariel to human form, the wall separating Eric's castle from the sea is torn down, and contact between humans and merfolk is restored.<ref name=\"mermaid2\" />\n\n===''The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning''===\n{{Main|The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning}}\nThe prologue of ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'' (2008) shows Ariel as a young mermaid, living happily with her father, King Triton, her mother, Queen Athena, and her six older sisters. As Ariel and her family relax in a lagoon, a pirate ship approaches and everyone flees except Athena, who returns to recover a music box Triton had given her and is killed when the ship crushes her. Afterwards, a devastated King Triton bans all music from Atlantica and throws the music box deep into the ocean. Ariel and her sisters grow up forgetting music and living under their father's strict rules, enforced by Marina del Rey, their governess.\n\nAriel meets Flounder and follows him to a secret underground club where Sebastian and his band play music. There she sings the song \"I Remember\", which reminds her of her distant past surrounded by love and music, and of her mother. Ariel introduces her sisters to the club, but eventually they are caught thanks to Marina, who had followed them. Sebastian and his band are imprisoned and the club is closed under Triton's orders. After arguing with Triton, Ariel breaks the band out of prison and escapes with them.\n\nWith Sebastian's assistance, Ariel finds her mother's music box, and they decide to return it to Triton. On their way back to Atlantica, they encounter Marina, and a struggle ensues in which Ariel is knocked unconscious, witnessed by Triton. Ariel makes a full recovery, and a remorseful Triton allows music back into Atlantica.<ref name=\"mermaid3\" />\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Tie-in music albums===\nIn addition to the [[The Little Mermaid (soundtrack)|film's official soundtrack]], two original music albums were released by [[Walt Disney Records]] for the franchise: ''[[Sebastian from The Little Mermaid]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Little Mermaid: Songs from the Sea]]'' (1992). The former is a cover album mainly focusing on [[Samuel E.

In this version, Ursula is Triton's sister and Ariel's aunt. In a new subplot, Grimsby holds a contest inviting all the princesses in the land for a singing competition for Eric to choose his bride; Ariel cannot sing, but she dances for Eric, and he chooses her. Ariel also has a more active role in the final battle, where she is the one who defeats Ursula by destroying her Nautilus shell that contains her power.\n\nIn addition to the songs in the film, Ariel has new songs by [[Alan Menken]] and lyrics by [[Glenn Slater]]. \"The World Above\" is Ariel's introductory song, where she expresses her admiration and curiosity with the human world, \"Beyond My Wildest Dreams\" is performed after Ariel has become human and given up her voice, and is used to express her thoughts about the human world and Eric, and \"If Only (quartet)\" is a quartet between Ariel, Eric, King Triton and Sebastian where all four express longing and sadness for their current situation: Ariel saddened that she only has one day left to get Eric to kiss her, Eric's confusion of falling for Ariel despite longing for the mysterious girl who saved his life, King Triton's regret at driving Ariel away, and Sebastian for his inability to help Ariel achieve her dreams.\n\n===Disney Parks===\nAriel makes regular appearances in the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], having a special location called [[Ariel's Grotto]] at most of them.

Ariel was to be portrayed by [[Marietta DePrima]], and she would interact with various puppet characters created by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]]. Two episodes of this series were filmed but not aired due to complications after Henson's death.<ref>{{cite web | last=Simpson | first=Wade | title=Jim Henson's The Little Mermaid Island | date=2010-05-05| accessdate=2013-09-29 | url=http://www.mouseplanet.com/9240/Jim_Hensons_The_Little_Mermaid_Island_ | publisher=Mouse Planet }}</ref>\n\nAriel appears in various video games based on the films, including the two adaptations of the first film (one for NES and Game Boy, known as ''[[The Little Mermaid (video game)|The Little Mermaid]]'', and one for Sega consoles called ''[[Ariel the Little Mermaid]]'') and the popular ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series.

She is seen in both her mermaid and human forms.\n\nOn November 24, 2013, Ariel made a brief appearance in a TV special ''Sofia the First: The Floating Palace'', which is part of the computer-animated television series ''[[Sofia the First]]''. In the special, Sofia is trying to help her mermaid friend, Oona, whose underwater kingdom is under threat.

The bluish-green color of Ariel's mermaid tail was a hue specially mixed by the Disney paint lab; the color was named \"Ariel\" after the character. The choice of red as Ariel's hair color was the subject of dispute between the filmmakers and studio executives who wanted the character to have blonde hair. It was noted that red hair contrasted better with Ariel's green tail, red was easier to darken than yellow, and Disney's live-action branch [[Touchstone Pictures]] had recently released ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' that had a blonde mermaid; Ariel's red hair was ultimately kept.<ref name=\"MTLM\">{{cite video | title = Treasures Untold: The Making of Disney's The Little Mermaid | publisher = [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] |date = 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview, Jodi Benson stated that for ''Ariel's Beginning'', the writers revised the script multiple times to make sure Ariel retained her relevance in a more modern context.

She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they take to a seagull named [[Scuttle (The Little Mermaid)|Scuttle]] for appraisal. Ariel falls in love with a human prince named [[Prince Eric]] after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, [[Ursula (Disney)|Ursula]], who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric [[Romantic love|fall in love]] with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.\n\nUnknown to Ariel, this agreement is part of Ursula's bigger plan to trap Ariel's father, King Triton and steal his magical trident. After being transformed, Ariel found that she can no longer breathe, nor swim. Sebastian and Flounder take her to the surface. She is soon found by Eric and is taken back to his castle. Ariel almost manages to obtain the \"kiss of true love\", but is stopped by Ursula's underhanded tactics. On the third day, Ursula transforms herself into a human, calling herself \"Vanessa\" and using Ariel's voice, and bewitches Eric to make him marry her. After learning from Scuttle that the woman is Ursula in disguise, Ariel disrupts the wedding and regains her voice but the sun sets as Ariel and Prince Eric are about to kiss, transforming Ariel back into a mermaid. After transforming herself back into her true witch form, Ursula takes Ariel back into the ocean, where she is met by King Triton and Sebastian.\n\nTriton trades himself for Ariel, enabling Ursula to steal his crown and enabling her to claim his trident, a fascination which angers Ariel, who will not allow Ursula to destroy merfolk and humans. In the battle that follows, Ariel is trapped at the bottom of a whirlpool. Before Ursula can destroy her, Eric kills Ursula by ramming a derelict ship's splintered prow through her. After Ursula dies, her spell is broken, and King Triton and the merfolk are transformed back to normal merpeople. At the end of the film, after King Triton uses his magical trident to transform her into a human, Ariel leaves the sea to live in the human world, and she and Eric marry and live happily ever after.<ref name=\"mermaid\" />\n\n===Television series===\n{{main|The Little Mermaid (TV series)}}\nA prequel television series that originally aired from 1992 to 1994, depicts Ariel's life as a mermaid under the sea with Sebastian, Flounder, and her father. Ariel appears in all 31 episodes of the series, which is set an unspecified time before the first film. The series follows Ariel's adventures with her friends and family and sometimes has Ariel foiling the attempts of enemies that are intent on harming her or the kingdom of Atlantica.\n\nAriel's relationships with various characters from the film are highlighted and expanded, such as the love and occasional conflict between Ariel and her father, how Ariel met Flounder and Scuttle, the relationships between Ariel and her sisters, and Ariel's early fear and avoidance of Ursula the sea witch. Other recurring new characters are also introduced, such as orphaned merboy Urchin and mute mermaid Gabriella that become Ariel's friends, as well as the Evil Manta, Lobster Mobster and Da Shrimp, who are Ariel's enemies. Ariel's mother is absent, having already died prior to the events of the series, though she is occasionally mentioned in vague terms. In one episode Ariel comes across [[Hans Christian Andersen]], author of \"The Little Mermaid\", while he was traveling underwater in a primitive submarine. In the fictionalized encounter she saves Andersen's life, inspiring him to write the story.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Metal Fish|airdate=1993-11-06|number=22|season=2|series=[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]|network=Disney Channel}}</ref>\n\nSome episodes of the series are musical and feature original songs performed by the characters.

When Melody's safety is threatened by Ursula's sister Morgana after using her as a hostage to get Triton's trident, Ariel and her husband Eric decide they must keep Melody away from the sea. So they build a large wall to separate it from the castle.\n\nBut Melody's love of the sea proves too strong and she visits Morgana, who turns her into a mermaid temporarily. King Triton uses his trident to transform Ariel back into her own mermaid form to find and rescue Melody. Morgana tricks Melody into taking part in a plot to steal her grandfather King Triton's trident. Together with Tip the Penguin and Dash the Walrus she goes to Atlantica and succeeds in acquiring the trident. Ariel arrives as they return with it to Morgana, and tries to persuade Melody to give back the trident. Morgana captures Melody then seals her behind ice wall. Tip and Dash rescue Melody and Ariel saves Eric from Cloak and Dagger who tied him and pulled it into the depths. Morgana then uses the trident's magic to force everyone to bow before her.\n\nMelody manages to grab the trident and returns it to King Triton, who then punishes Morgana by sending her to the bottom of the ocean frozen in a block of ice. Triton returns Ariel to human form, the wall separating Eric's castle from the sea is torn down, and contact between humans and merfolk is restored.<ref name=\"mermaid2\" />\n\n===''The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning''===\n{{Main|The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning}}\nThe prologue of ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'' (2008) shows Ariel as a young mermaid, living happily with her father, King Triton, her mother, Queen Athena, and her six older sisters. As Ariel and her family relax in a lagoon, a pirate ship approaches and everyone flees except Athena, who returns to recover a music box Triton had given her and is killed when the ship crushes her. Afterwards, a devastated King Triton bans all music from Atlantica and throws the music box deep into the ocean. Ariel and her sisters grow up forgetting music and living under their father's strict rules, enforced by Marina del Rey, their governess.\n\nAriel meets Flounder and follows him to a secret underground club where Sebastian and his band play music. There she sings the song \"I Remember\", which reminds her of her distant past surrounded by love and music, and of her mother. Ariel introduces her sisters to the club, but eventually they are caught thanks to Marina, who had followed them. Sebastian and his band are imprisoned and the club is closed under Triton's orders. After arguing with Triton, Ariel breaks the band out of prison and escapes with them.\n\nWith Sebastian's assistance, Ariel finds her mother's music box, and they decide to return it to Triton. On their way back to Atlantica, they encounter Marina, and a struggle ensues in which Ariel is knocked unconscious, witnessed by Triton. Ariel makes a full recovery, and a remorseful Triton allows music back into Atlantica.<ref name=\"mermaid3\" />\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Tie-in music albums===\nIn addition to the [[The Little Mermaid (soundtrack)|film's official soundtrack]], two original music albums were released by [[Walt Disney Records]] for the franchise: ''[[Sebastian from The Little Mermaid]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Little Mermaid: Songs from the Sea]]'' (1992).

Ariel also has a more active role in the final battle, where she is the one who defeats Ursula by destroying her Nautilus shell that contains her power.\n\nIn addition to the songs in the film, Ariel has new songs by [[Alan Menken]] and lyrics by [[Glenn Slater]]. \"The World Above\" is Ariel's introductory song, where she expresses her admiration and curiosity with the human world, \"Beyond My Wildest Dreams\" is performed after Ariel has become human and given up her voice, and is used to express her thoughts about the human world and Eric, and \"If Only (quartet)\" is a quartet between Ariel, Eric, King Triton and Sebastian where all four express longing and sadness for their current situation: Ariel saddened that she only has one day left to get Eric to kiss her, Eric's confusion of falling for Ariel despite longing for the mysterious girl who saved his life, King Triton's regret at driving Ariel away, and Sebastian for his inability to help Ariel achieve her dreams.\n\n===Disney Parks===\nAriel makes regular appearances in the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], having a special location called [[Ariel's Grotto]] at most of them.

P. Matthen ('''May 18th 1890\u2013June 2nd 1960)  was a Member of the Indian Parliament in the first Lok Sabha to be constituted in 1952 after India gained Independence from Britain. He represented the Thiruvalla constituency of Kerala. Matthen was appointed the Indian Ambassador to Sudan after his single term in the Lok Sabha. Before his entry into politics, Matthen was  businessman with interests in cashew, minerals, insurance, plantations and banking. He was responsible for starting the Alleppey Chamber of Commerce. He was Managing Director of  the Travancore National & Quilon (TN&Q) Bank when it suffered a run of unprecedented length that forced it to close. The bank run was said to have been escalated by Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, the Dewan of Travancore, in an attempt to reduce the power of the Christian Community who were agitating for fair representation in the governing council of this Princely State. C.P. Matthen was extradited from Madras and imprisoned in Trivandrum, allegedly for balance sheet irregularities. He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment but offered many chances to walk free if he would acknowledge guilt. C. P. Matthen refused these offers, maintaining his innocence for more than three years. He became something of a folk hero for his uncompromising stand. He was released on January 22nd 1942 without condition or explanation and returned to Madras.  \n\n== Early life ==\nCP Matthen was born into a landed Christian family in central Travancore, in [[Kavumbhagom]], Thiruvalla. It was unusual in that agricultural economy, even for landed families, to educate their children beyond high school, but Matthen went to Madras after high school and did his Bachelor Of History degree at Madras Christian College (MCC). He completed his education with a Bachelor of Law. \n\n== Insurance and Banking ==\nAt the age of 29, Matthen raised Rs 56,000 in capital and Rs 54,000 in deposits and started a bank that he called the Quilon Bank with its headquarters in Kollum (Quilon), The Quilon Bank headquarter building was then constructed and completed in 1935. In a relatively short space of 15 years, the bank\u2019s total working capital rose from Rs 156,000 to Rs 10,246,000.\n\nAnother leading Travancore businessman of that era was Mr [[K. C. Mammen Mappillai]], whose interests were not only in banking - his bank was called the Travancore National Bank - but also in journalism, newspaper publishing and politics, his heart was actually in journalism. He was the Chief Editor of a Travancore newspaper, [[Malayala Manorama]]. \n\nMammen and Matthen had started an insurance company together, and the commercial success of this new venture led them to amalgamate their respective banks in 1937. The registered office remained at the Quilon Bank headquarters in Travancore but the main business of the bank was conducted from its central office in Madras where its primary shareholders were based. Sir CP Ramaswami Iyer, encouraged this arrangement by offering to place Rs 7,000,000 of Travancore treasury money with the merged bank but this offer was never fulfilled.   \n\nThe TN&Q Bank was the fourth-largest bank in India and the largest in South India. It had 75 branches in British India, Travancore, Cochin, the Malabar, Coorg, Mysore and Ceylon:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Association|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.218123|title=The Calcutta Stock Exchange Offical Year Book 1938|date=1938}}</ref> Alleppey, Alwaye, Athirampuzha, Bangalore City, Bangalore Cantt.(South Parade Road), Bangalore Cantt.(Central Street), Bombay, Calcutta, Calicut, Changanacherry, Chirayinkil, Cochin, Coimbatore, Colombo, Coonoor, Cuddapah, Devicolam, Dindigul, Ernakulam, Erode, Galle, Hyderabad, Jaffna, Kandy, Karaikudi, Kayamkulam, Kottayam, Kumbakonam, Madras: Anderson Hall, G.T., Flower Bazaar, Mount Road, Triplicane, Mylapore, Vepery, Thyagarayanagar, Royapettah, Madura, Mangalore, Marthandorn, Mercara, Munnar, Mysore, Nagercoil, New Delhi, Ootacamund, Palghat, Parur, Perumpavoor, Pollachi, Poona, Pudukottah, Quilon, Quilon Sub Office, Rajapalayam, Salem, Secunderabad, Shertallai, Srirangam, Tellicherry, Tenkasi, Tinnevelly, Tinnevelly Junction, Tirupur, Thiruvella, Trichinopoly (25 Lascjar Street), Trichinopoly (Chinnakadai Teppakulam), Trichur, Trippunittura, Trivandrum (Main Road), Trivandrum (Chalai Bazaar), Tuticorin, Udumalpet, Vellore, Virudhunagar, Vizagapatam.  \n\n==Imprisonment==\nTN&Q Bank was established in 1937 with a new Quilon headquarters building which Matthen built at a cost of Rs. 140,000 (a very large sum of money at that time). To retain the business and deposits of the Travancore State, Matthen and Mammen had not only agreed to the headquarters in Travancore but that two of the bank\u2019s directors were the Dewan\u2019s appointees and also that the Bank\u2019s General Manager, a confidant of the Dewan named K. S. Ramanujam, was appointed at the specific recommendation of Sir CP. Despite this initial support from the Travancore Government, within a few months of amalgamation being completed, rumors started making its rounds that the bank was insolvent, and by 1938 there was a run on the bank\u2019s assets \u2013 this was instigated not only by the Dewan but was publicized by the Travancore State\u2019s Department of Publicity. The bank\u2019s financial run concluded with 88% of the public\u2019s deposits being returned by the bank, and the bank becoming insolvent. At this point the trap was sprung, by Sir CP\u2019s administration demanding the extradition of Matthen and Mammen from Madras Presidency to Travancore State to stand trial for defrauding the public. Sir CP also convinced the British Government in Madras that the bank and its directors had been financing the Congress party and the Independence movement, so appeals to the Madras High Court and the Privy Council in London to stay the extradition orders were rejected and 3 directors of the bank including Matthen, Mammen and Mammen\u2019s elder brother and Mammen\u2019s son, were transported in chains from Madras to Quilon to stand trial.\n\nAt the trial in Trivandrum, the erstwhile General Manager of the bank - K. S. Ramanujam, who was the nominee of the Maharaja's government - falsely testified that Mammen and Matthen had defrauded the bank and four directors (including Mammen\u2019s brother and son) were then awarded 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. The bank\u2019s remaining assets were liquidated by the State, and the bank\u2019s assets were distributed - mainly to confidants of Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyer, one of whom acquired the bank headquarters\u2019 building in Quilon for Rs 15,000 - approximately a tenth of what it had cost to build three years earlier. With the first year in jail, Mammen\u2019s imprisoned elder brother died a broken man. Soon afterwards, Sir CP, who had been an astute lawyer in the colonial administration, being keenly aware of the weaknesses in the Government\u2019s case \u2013 which depended on K. S. Ramanujam who vanished abroad after the trial - sent word to Mammen and Matthen that if they admitted their accused guilt and sought the Maharaja\u2019s mercy they could be pardoned. Mammen and his son, had other major family problems, so they agreed to sign the false declaration but Matthen continued to refuse. Sir CP initially declined to agree to the release without all of three of them admitting guilt, but finally released Mammen and his son on receiving their written \u201cconfessions\u201d. Matthen continued to hold out on his refusal to sign any false confession, despite heavy pressure brought on him through the Inspector General of Police, Mr Abdul Karim, visiting him regularly in jail and suggesting that he sign a letter \u2013 which the IG had drafted, requesting the Maharaja to pardon and release him.\nFinally, on 22nd January 1942, Mr. C. P. Matthen was unconditionally released by the Maharaja's Government without any written or verbal false admission of guilt. The IG, Mr. Abdul Karim, took Matthen in his official car from Travancore jail to his house where his family had waited patiently for his release from jail.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nMr. C. P. Matthen was a member of the First [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian Parliament) in 1952, representing [[Mavelikara]] Constituency of [[Kerala]].\n\n==Lok Sabha Member and Ambassador==\nHe was elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1953, from Mavelikera constitutioncy in Kerala by one of the largest majorities of that election.  \n\nAfter completing his term in the [[Lok Sabha]], in 1957, he was appointed as the Indian Ambassador to [[Sudan]]. He retired a year later due to health reasons caused by his years of imprisonment in Trivandrum.\n\n==Death==\nDied on 2 June 1960 in [[Paris]], \u00cele-de-France, France and buried at [[Thiruvalla]], Kerala, India.<ref name=\"geni\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Chalakuzhy-Poulose-Matthen-C-P-Matthen/6000000006434764012|title=Matthen (1890 - 1960) - Genealogy|publisher=geni.com|accessdate=2015-11-09}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Hard Copy==\n# N.M.Mathew, ''History of the Mar Thoma Church'', (Malayalam), Vol 3, 2008. page 75\n#''Chalakuzhy Kudumba Charitram'', Thomas Mathew (ed.) 1987.\n\n==External links==\n#{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/10/07/stories/2009100759851300.htm|title=C.P.

P. Matthen ('''May 18th 1890\u2013June 2nd 1960)  was a Member of the Indian Parliament in the first Lok Sabha to be constituted in 1952 after India gained Independence from Britain. He represented the Thiruvalla constituency of Kerala. Matthen was appointed the Indian Ambassador to Sudan after his single term in the Lok Sabha. Before his entry into politics, Matthen was  businessman with interests in cashew, minerals, insurance, plantations and banking. He was responsible for starting the Alleppey Chamber of Commerce. He was Managing Director of  the Travancore National & Quilon (TN&Q) Bank when it suffered a run of unprecedented length that forced it to close. The bank run was said to have been exacerbated by Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, the Dewan of Travancore, in an attempt to reduce the power of the Christian Community who were agitating for fair representation in the governing council of this Princely State. C.P. Matthen was extradited from Madras and imprisoned in Trivandrum, allegedly for balance sheet irregularities. He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment but offered many chances to walk free if he would acknowledge guilt. C. P. Matthen refused these offers, maintaining his innocence for more than three years. He became something of a folk hero for his uncompromising stand. He was released on January 22nd 1942 without condition or explanation and returned to Madras.  \n\n== Early life ==\nCP Matthen was born into a landed Christian family in central Travancore, in [[Kavumbhagom]], Thiruvalla. It was unusual in that agricultural economy, even for landed families, to educate their children beyond high school, but Matthen went to Madras after high school and did his Bachelor Of History degree at Madras Christian College (MCC). He completed his education with a Bachelor of Law. \n\n== Insurance and Banking ==\nAt the age of 29, Matthen raised Rs 56,000 in capital and Rs 54,000 in deposits and started a bank that he called the Quilon Bank with its headquarters in Kollum (Quilon), The Quilon Bank headquarter building was then constructed and completed in 1935. In a relatively short space of 15 years, the bank\u2019s total working capital rose from Rs 156,000 to Rs 10,246,000.\n\nAnother leading Travancore businessman of that era was Mr [[K. C. Mammen Mappillai]], whose interests were not only in banking - his bank was called the Travancore National Bank - but also in journalism, newspaper publishing and politics, his heart was actually in journalism. He was the Chief Editor of a Travancore newspaper, [[Malayala Manorama]]. \n\nMammen and Matthen had started an insurance company together, and the commercial success of this new venture led them to amalgamate their respective banks in 1937. The registered office remained at the Quilon Bank headquarters in Travancore but the main business of the bank was conducted from its central office in Madras where its primary shareholders were based. Sir CP Ramaswami Iyer, encouraged this arrangement by offering to place Rs 7,000,000 of Travancore treasury money with the merged bank but this offer was never fulfilled.   \n\nThe TN&Q Bank was the fourth-largest bank in India and the largest in South India. It had 75 branches in British India, Travancore, Cochin, the Malabar, Coorg, Mysore and Ceylon:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Association|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.218123|title=The Calcutta Stock Exchange Offical Year Book 1938|date=1938}}</ref> Alleppey, Alwaye, Athirampuzha, Bangalore City, Bangalore Cantt.(South Parade Road), Bangalore Cantt.(Central Street), Bombay, Calcutta, Calicut, Changanacherry, Chirayinkil, Cochin, Coimbatore, Colombo, Coonoor, Cuddapah, Devicolam, Dindigul, Ernakulam, Erode, Galle, Hyderabad, Jaffna, Kandy, Karaikudi, Kayamkulam, Kottayam, Kumbakonam, Madras: Anderson Hall, G.T., Flower Bazaar, Mount Road, Triplicane, Mylapore, Vepery, Thyagarayanagar, Royapettah, Madura, Mangalore, Marthandorn, Mercara, Munnar, Mysore, Nagercoil, New Delhi, Ootacamund, Palghat, Parur, Perumpavoor, Pollachi, Poona, Pudukottah, Quilon, Quilon Sub Office, Rajapalayam, Salem, Secunderabad, Shertallai, Srirangam, Tellicherry, Tenkasi, Tinnevelly, Tinnevelly Junction, Tirupur, Thiruvella, Trichinopoly (25 Lascjar Street), Trichinopoly (Chinnakadai Teppakulam), Trichur, Trippunittura, Trivandrum (Main Road), Trivandrum (Chalai Bazaar), Tuticorin, Udumalpet, Vellore, Virudhunagar, Vizagapatam.  \n\n==Imprisonment==\nTN&Q Bank was established in 1937 with a new Quilon headquarters building which Matthen built at a cost of Rs. 140,000 (a very large sum of money at that time).
