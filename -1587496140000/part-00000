He is also flanked by two trumpeting angels. The two panels are framed by a decorative Moorish-inspired bar, which gives it an aspect of illumination. What seems to be traces of an [[Heraldry|heraldic device]] can be seen on each side of the painting, probably the arms of the [[House of Braganza]] or the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|royal coat of arms]].<ref name=\"Gil2012\"/>\n\nThe lower scene is the representation of a trial scene with two judges: the \"Good Judge\" to the left, and the \"Bad Judge\" to the right, both seated on wooden and richly-crafted Gothic thrones. The Good Judge is seated facing the viewer directly, wearing robes of great sobriety (a white [[houppelande]] over a dark [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and matching cap), and holding steady the red staff of the old municipal courts;<ref name=\"MuseuDoFresco\"/> he seems to be acquitting dressed in white. The Bad Judge, wearing showy robes of orange and a red fur-lined cap and holding a broken red staff, is depicted as having [[Hypocrisy|two faces]] and is approached by two men in the act of [[bribery]]: the man to the right (a ''[[Fidalgo|rico homem]]'') takes gold coins from a [[Coin purse|purse]], and the man to the left (a [[villein]]) offers the judge a pair of [[partridge]]s.<ref name=\"MuseuDoFresco\"/>\n\nWhile the Bad Judge's conduct is influenced by the Devil, who seems to be whispering in his ear and rests his claw on top of his shoulder, the Good Judge is being crowned by two angelic figures, Justice and Mercy, according to the medieval symbolism.<ref name=\"MuseuDoFresco\"/> The scene is flanked by two ''[[corregedor]]es'', each beside each of the judges, and in matching clothes.<ref name=\"MuseuDoFresco\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe old Town Hall and Courthouse (the medieval ''domus municipalis'') of the town of [[Monsaraz]] was first built around the second quarter of the 14th century, sometime during the reigns of [[Denis of Portugal|King Dinis]] and [[Afonso IV of Portugal|Afonso IV]]. It was built as a result of the administrative and economic development of the village after it had been granted its first [[Foral|Charter]] in 1276. Until it was built, public acts were conducted in the [[churchyard]] of the Gothic [[pt:Igreja Matriz de Santa Maria da Lagoa|Church of Santa Maria da Lagoa]] (demolished and later rebuilt in the 16th century).<ref name=\"MuseuDoFresco\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | width     = \n   | header    =\n   | align     = right\n   | image1    = Mau Juiz, pormenor2 (cropped).png\n   | width1    = 238\n   | image2    = Hans Holbein - The Dance of Death- The Canon or Prebendary; The Judge - 1922.505 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg\n   | width2    = 175\n   | footer    = The corrupt judge being bribed is represented in a similar fashion in [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'s famous [[Danse Macabre#Hans Holbein's woodcuts|woodcut designs]] for his ''Danse Macabre'' series (1526).<ref name=\"Amado2017\"/>\n  }}\nThe old Town Hall seems to have been rebuilt several times since its initial construction, although several original medieval elements can still be identified, such as the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]] on the entrance, the twinned arch windows, and the [[Rib vault|ribbed vaults]].

{"title_page": "ChIP sequencing", "text_new": "'''ChIP-sequencing''', also known as '''ChIP-seq''', is a method used to analyze [[protein]] interactions with [[DNA]]. ChIP-seq combines [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] (ChIP) with massively parallel [[DNA sequencing]] to identify the [[binding site]]s of DNA-associated proteins. It can be used to map global binding sites precisely for any protein of interest. Previously, [[ChIP-on-chip]] was the most common technique utilized to study these protein\u2013DNA relations.\n\n==Uses==\nChIP-seq is primarily used to determine how [[transcription factors]] and other chromatin-associated proteins influence [[phenotype]]-affecting mechanisms. Determining how proteins interact with DNA to regulate [[gene expression]] is essential for fully understanding many biological processes and disease states. This [[epigenetic]] information is complementary to [[genotype]] and expression analysis. ChIP-seq technology is currently seen primarily as an alternative to [[ChIP-chip]] which requires a [[protein microarray|hybridization array]]. This introduces some bias, as an array is restricted to a fixed number of probes. Sequencing, by contrast, is thought to have less bias, although the sequencing bias of different sequencing technologies is not yet fully understood.\n\nSpecific DNA sites in direct physical interaction with transcription factors and other proteins can be isolated by [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]]. ChIP produces a library of target DNA sites bound to a protein of interest ''[[in vivo]]''. Massively parallel sequence analyses are used in conjunction with whole-genome sequence databases to analyze the interaction pattern of any protein with DNA,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson DS, Mortazavi A, Myers RM, Wold B | title = Genome-wide mapping of in vivo protein-DNA interactions | journal = Science | volume = 316 | issue = 5830 | pages = 1497\u2013502 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17540862 | doi = 10.1126/science.1141319 | url = https://authors.library.caltech.edu/51935/7/Johnson-SOM.revision1.pdf | bibcode = 2007Sci...316.1497J }}</ref> or the pattern of any epigenetic [[chromatin]] modifications.

However, the widespread use of this method has been limited by the lack of a sufficiently robust method to identify all of the enriched DNA sequences.The ChIP wet lab protocol contains ChIP and hybridization. There are essentially five parts to the ChIP protocol<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.abcam.com/epigenetics/studying-epigenetics-using-chip|title=ChIP guide: epigenetics applications {{!}} Abcam|website=www.abcam.com|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> that aid in better understanding the overall process of ChIP. In order to carry out the ChIP, the first step is cross-linking<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim TH, Dekker J | title = Formaldehyde Cross-Linking | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Protocols | volume = 2018 | issue = 4 | pages = pdb.prot082594 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29610357 | doi = 10.1101/pdb.prot082594 }}</ref> using formaldehyde and large batches of the DNA in order to obtain a useful amount. The cross-links are made between the protein and DNA, but also between RNA and other proteins. The second step is the process of chromatin fragmentation which breaks up the chromatin in order to get high quality DNA pieces for ChIP analysis in the end. These fragments should be cut to become under 500 base pairs<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim TH, Dekker J | title = Preparation of Cross-Linked Chromatin for ChIP | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Protocols | volume = 2018 | issue = 4 | pages = pdb.prot082602 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29610358 | doi = 10.1101/pdb.prot082602 }}</ref> each to have the best outcome for genome mapping. The third step is called chromatin immunoprecipitation,<ref name=\":0\" /> which is what ChIP is short for. The ChIP process enhance specific crosslinked DNA-protein complexes using an [[antibody]] against the protein of interest followed by incubation and centrifugation to obtain the immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitation step also allows for the removal of non-specific binding sites. The fourth step is DNA recovery and purification,<ref name=\":0\" /> taking place by the reversed effect on the cross-link between DNA and protein to separate them and cleaning DNA with an extraction. The fifth and final step is the analyzation step of the ChIP protocol by the process of qPCR, [[ChIP-on-chip]] (hybrid array) or ChIP sequencing. [[Oligonucleotide]] adaptors are then added to the small stretches of DNA that were bound to the protein of interest to enable massively parallel sequencing. Through the analysis, the sequences can then be identified and interpreted by the gene or region to where the protein was bound.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Sequencing===\nAfter size selection, all the resulting ChIP-DNA fragments are sequenced simultaneously using a genome sequencer. A single sequencing run can scan for genome-wide associations with high resolution, meaning that features can be located precisely on the chromosomes. ChIP-chip, by contrast, requires large sets of [[tiling array]]s for lower resolution.\n\nThere are many [[DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods|new sequencing methods]] used in this sequencing step. Some technologies that analyze the sequences can use [[cluster amplification]] of adapter-ligated ChIP DNA fragments on a solid [[flow cell]] substrate to create clusters of approximately 1000 clonal copies each. The resulting high density array of template clusters on the flow cell surface is sequenced by a Genome analyzing program. Each template cluster undergoes [[Pyrosequencing|sequencing-by-synthesis]] in parallel using novel fluorescently labelled reversible terminator nucleotides. Templates are sequenced base-by-base during each read. Then, the data collection and analysis software aligns sample sequences to a known genomic sequence to identify the ChIP-DNA fragments.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Sensitivity==\nSensitivity of this technology depends on the depth of the sequencing run (i.e. the number of mapped sequence tags), the size of the genome and the distribution of the target factor.\nThe sequencing depth is directly correlated with cost. If abundant binders in large genomes have to be mapped with high sensitivity, costs are high as an enormously high number of sequence tags will be required. This is in contrast to ChIP-chip in which the costs are not correlated with sensitivity.\n\nUnlike [[microarray]]-based ChIP methods, the precision of the ChIP-seq assay is not limited by the spacing of predetermined probes. By integrating a large number of short reads, highly precise binding site localization is obtained. Compared to ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq data can be used to locate the binding site within few tens of base pairs of the actual protein binding site. Tag densities at the binding sites are a good indicator of protein\u2013DNA binding affinity,<ref>Jothi et al.

ChIP-seq combines [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] (ChIP) with massively parallel [[DNA sequencing]] to identify the [[binding site]]s of DNA-associated proteins. It can be used to map global binding sites precisely for any protein of interest. Previously, [[ChIP-on-chip]] was the most common technique utilized to study these protein\u2013DNA relations.\n\n==Uses==\nChIP-seq is primarily used to determine how [[transcription factors]] and other chromatin-associated proteins influence [[phenotype]]-affecting mechanisms. Determining how proteins interact with DNA to regulate [[gene expression]] is essential for fully understanding many biological processes and disease states. This [[epigenetic]] information is complementary to [[genotype]] and expression analysis. ChIP-seq technology is currently seen primarily as an alternative to [[ChIP-chip]] which requires a [[protein microarray|hybridization array]]. This introduces some bias, as an array is restricted to a fixed number of probes. Sequencing, by contrast, is thought to have less bias, although the sequencing bias of different sequencing technologies is not yet fully understood.\n\nSpecific DNA sites in direct physical interaction with transcription factors and other proteins can be isolated by [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]]. ChIP produces a library of target DNA sites bound to a protein of interest ''[[in vivo]]''.

However, the widespread use of this method has been limited by the lack of a sufficiently robust method to identify all of the enriched DNA sequences.The ChIP wet lab protocol contains ChIP and hybridization. There are essentially five parts to the ChIP protocol<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.abcam.com/epigenetics/studying-epigenetics-using-chip|title=ChIP guide: epigenetics applications {{!}} Abcam|website=www.abcam.com|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> that aid in better understanding the overall process of ChIP. In order to carry out the ChIP, the first step is cross-linking<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim TH, Dekker J | title = Formaldehyde Cross-Linking | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Protocols | volume = 2018 | issue = 4 | pages = pdb.prot082594 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29610357 | doi = 10.1101/pdb.prot082594 }}</ref> using formaldehyde and large batches of the DNA in order to obtain a useful amount. The cross-links are made between the protein and DNA, but also between RNA and other proteins. The second step is the process of chromatin fragmentation which breaks up the chromatin in order to get high quality DNA pieces for ChIP analysis in the end. These fragments should be cut to become under 500 base pairs<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim TH, Dekker J | title = Preparation of Cross-Linked Chromatin for ChIP | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Protocols | volume = 2018 | issue = 4 | pages = pdb.prot082602 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29610358 | doi = 10.1101/pdb.prot082602 }}</ref> each to have the best outcome for genome mapping. The third step is called chromatin immunoprecipitation,<ref name=\":0\" /> which is what ChIP is short for. The ChIP process enhance specific crosslinked DNA-protein complexes using an [[antibody]] against the protein of interest followed by incubation and centrifugation to obtain the immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitation step also allows for the removal of non-specific binding sites. The fourth step is DNA recovery and purification,<ref name=\":0\" /> taking place by the reversed effect on the cross-link between DNA and protein to separate them and cleaning DNA with an extraction. The fifth and final step is the analyzation step of the ChIP protocol by the process of qPCR, [[ChIP-on-chip]] (hybrid array) or ChIP sequencing. [[Oligonucleotide]] adaptors are then added to the small stretches of DNA that were bound to the protein of interest to enable massively parallel sequencing. Through the analysis, the sequences can then be identified and interpreted by the gene or region to where the protein was bound.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Sequencing===\nAfter size selection, all the resulting ChIP-DNA fragments are sequenced simultaneously using a genome sequencer. A single sequencing run can scan for genome-wide associations with high resolution, meaning that features can be located precisely on the chromosomes. ChIP-chip, by contrast, requires large sets of [[tiling array]]s for lower resolution.\n\nThere are many [[DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods|new sequencing methods]] used in this sequencing step. Some technologies that analyze the sequences can use [[cluster amplification]] of adapter-ligated ChIP DNA fragments on a solid [[flow cell]] substrate to create clusters of approximately 1000 clonal copies each. The resulting high density array of template clusters on the flow cell surface is sequenced by a Genome analyzing program. Each template cluster undergoes [[Pyrosequencing|sequencing-by-synthesis]] in parallel using novel fluorescently labelled reversible terminator nucleotides. Templates are sequenced base-by-base during each read. Then, the data collection and analysis software aligns sample sequences to a known genomic sequence to identify the ChIP-DNA fragments.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Sensitivity==\nSensitivity of this technology depends on the depth of the sequencing run (i.e. the number of mapped sequence tags), the size of the genome and the distribution of the target factor.\nThe sequencing depth is directly correlated with cost. If abundant binders in large genomes have to be mapped with high sensitivity, costs are high as an enormously high number of sequence tags will be required. This is in contrast to ChIP-chip in which the costs are not correlated with sensitivity.\n\nUnlike [[microarray]]-based ChIP methods, the precision of the ChIP-seq assay is not limited by the spacing of predetermined probes. By integrating a large number of short reads, highly precise binding site localization is obtained. Compared to ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq data can be used to locate the binding site within few tens of base pairs of the actual protein binding site. Tag densities at the binding sites are a good indicator of protein\u2013DNA binding affinity,<ref>Jothi et al.

The traditional explanation of the pressure of sleds on the snow or ice producing a thin film of water and this enabling sleds to move on ice with little friction is incorrect. \n\nVarious types of sleds are pulled by animals such as [[reindeer]], horses, [[mule]]s, [[oxen]], or dogs.\n\n==History==\n[[File:NMA.0035032.jpg|thumb|left|Sleds as the normal form of winter transport near [[Stockholm]] c. 1800.]]\n[[File:Sanki.JPG|thumb|250px|A child's sledge (19th century), [[Radomysl Castle]]]]\n\nThe people of [[Ancient Egypt]] are thought to have used sledges extensively in the construction of their public works, in particular for the transportation of heavy [[obelisk]]s over sand.<ref>{{Cite news |last=McCoy |first=Terrence |date=2 May 2014 |title=The Surprisingly Simple Way Egyptians Moved Massive Pyramid Stones Without Modern Technology |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/05/02/the-surprisingly-simple-way-egyptians-moved-massive-pyramid-stones-without-modern-technology/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |language=en |access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nSleds and sledges were found in the [[Oseberg Ship|Oseberg \"Viking\" ship]] excavation.

One is visibility, which refers to the discovery of unexpected insights of the existing assets and/or processes and in this way transferring invisible knowledge to visible value. The other \"V\" is value.\n\n;Background: General \"Big Data\" analytics often focuses on the [[data mining|mining]] of relationships and capturing the phenomena. Yet \"Industrial Big Data\" analytics is more interested in finding the physical root cause behind features extracted from the phenomena. This means effective \"Industrial Big Data\" analytics will require more [[domain know-how]] than general \"Big Data\" analytics.\n;Broken: Compared to \"Big Data\" analytics, \"Industrial Big Data\" analytics favors the \"completeness\" of data over the \"volume\" of the data, which means that in order to construct an accurate data-driven analytical system, it is necessary to prepare data from different working conditions. Due to communication issues and multiple sources, data from the system might be discrete and un-synchronized. That is why pre-processing is an important procedure before actually analyzing the data to make sure that the data are complete, continuous and synchronized.\n;Bad-Quality: The focus of \"Big Data\" analytics is mining and discovering, which means that the volume of the data might compensate the low-quality of the data. However, for \"Industrial Big Data\", since variables usually possess clear physical meanings, data integrity is of vital importance to the development of the analytical system. Low-quality data or incorrect recordings will alter the relationship between different variables and will have a catastrophic impact on the estimation accuracy.\n\n== Technologies ==\n\n=== Data acquisition, storage and management ===\n\nAs data from automated industrial equipment are being generated at an extraordinary speed and volume, the infrastructure of storing and managing these data becomes the first challenge any industry will face.

One is visibility, which refers to the discovery of unexpected insights of the existing assets and/or processes and in this way transferring invisible knowledge to visible value. The other \"V\" is value.\n\n;Background: General \"Big Data\" analytics often focuses on the [[data mining|mining]] of relationships and capturing the phenomena. Yet \"Industrial Big Data\" analytics is more interested in finding the physical root cause behind features extracted from the phenomena. This means effective \"Industrial Big Data\" analytics will require more [[domain know-how]] than general \"Big Data\" analytics.\n;Broken: Compared to \"Big Data\" analytics, \"Industrial Big Data\" analytics favors the \"completeness\" of data over the \"volume\" of the data, which means that in order to construct an accurate data-driven analytical system, it is necessary to prepare data from different working conditions. Due to communication issues and multiple sources, data from the system might be discrete and un-synchronized. That is why pre-processing is an important procedure before actually analyzing the data to make sure that the data are complete, continuous and synchronized.\n;Bad-Quality: The focus of \"Big Data\" analytics is mining and discovering, which means that the volume of the data might compensate the low-quality of the data. However, for \"Industrial Big Data\", since variables usually possess clear physical meanings, data integrity is of vital importance to the development of the analytical system. Low-quality data or incorrect recordings will alter the relationship between different variables and will have a catastrophic impact on the estimation accuracy.\n\n== Technologies ==\n\n=== Data acquisition, storage and management ===\n\nAs data from automated industrial equipment are being generated at an extraordinary speed and volume, the infrastructure of storing and managing these data becomes the first challenge any industry will face.
