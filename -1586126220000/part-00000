One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.''\n|-\n|18\n|''Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance.

Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.''\n|-\n|20\n|''Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity.'' \n|-\n|21\n|\n|}\n\n== Music ==\nLyrics for various songs were written by Bhring Tupkari and music was composed by Vasu Rao.

Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.''\n|-\n|''15''\n|''King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.''\n|-\n|''16''\n|''Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.''\n|-\n|''17''\n|''Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage.

One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.''\n|-\n|18\n|''Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance.

The maritime route hypothesis, favored by [[Liang Qichao]] and [[Paul Pelliot]], proposed that Buddhism was originally practiced in southern China, the [[Yangtze River]] and [[Huai River]] region. On the other  hand, it must have entered from the northwest via the Kansu corridor to the Yellow River basin and the North China Plain in the course of the first century A.D. The scene becomes clearers from the middle of the second century onward, when the first known missionaries started their translation activities in the capital, Lo-yand. The ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' records that in 65 CE, prince [[Liu Ying (prince)|Liu Ying]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] (present day [[Jiangsu]]) \"delighted in the practices of [[Huang-Lao|Huang-Lao Daoism]]\" and had both Buddhist monks and laypeople at his court who presided over Buddhist ceremonies.<ref>Maspero 1981, pp. 401, 405.</ref> The overland route hypothesis, favored by Tang Yongtong, proposed that Buddhism disseminated through Central Asia \u2013 in particular, the [[Kushan Empire]], which was often known in ancient Chinese sources as [[Yuezhi|''Da Yuezhi'']] (\"Great Yuezhi\"), after the founding tribe. According to this hypothesis, Buddhism was first  practiced in China in the [[Western Regions]] and the Han capital [[Luoyang]] (present day [[Henan]]), where [[Emperor Ming of Han]] established the [[White Horse Temple]] in 68 CE.\n\nIn 2004, Rong Xinjiang, a history professor at [[Peking University]], reexamined the overland and maritime hypotheses through a multi-disciplinary review of recent discoveries and research, including the [[Gandh\u0101ran Buddhist Texts]], and concluded:\n{{quote|The view that Buddhism was transmitted to China by the sea route comparatively lacks convincing and supporting materials, and some arguments are not sufficiently rigorous. Based on the existing historical texts and the archaeological iconographic materials discovered since the 1980s, particularly the first-century Buddhist manuscripts recently found in Afghanistan, the commentator believes that the most plausible theory is that Buddhism reached China from the Greater Yuezhi of northwest India and took the land route to reach Han China. After entering into China, Buddhism blended with early Daoism and Chinese traditional esoteric arts and its iconography received blind worship.<ref>Rong Xinjiang, 2004, [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp144_han_dynasty_buddhism.pdf Land Route or Sea Route?

Hundreds and thousands of recipes are there for longevity through [[Bigu (grain avoidance)|abstention from cereals]]. I practised them, but without success; I saw them put to use, but without result. That is why I abandoned them.<ref>Maspero 1981, p. 406.</ref></blockquote>\nEarly Chinese Buddhism was conflated and mixed with Daoism, and it was within Daoist circles that it found its first adepts. Traces are evident in Han period Chinese translations of Buddhist scriptures, which hardly differentiated between [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Buddhist nirvana]] and [[Xian (Taoism)|Daoist immortality]]. ''[[Wu wei|Wuwei]]'', the Daoist concept of non-interference, was the normal term for translating [[Sanskrit]] ''nirvana'', which is [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transcribed]] as ''ni\u00e8p\u00e1n'' ({{lang|zh|\u6d85\u69c3}}) in modern Chinese usage.<ref>Maspero 1981, p. 409</ref>\n\n====Traditional accounts====\n[[File:WhiteHorseTemple.jpg|thumb|right|[[White Horse Temple]], traditionally held to be at the origin of Chinese Buddhism.]]\n\nA number of popular accounts in historical Chinese literature have led to the popularity of certain legends regarding the introduction of Buddhism into China. According to the most popular one, [[Emperor Ming of Han]] (28\u201375 CE) precipitated the  introduction of Buddhist teachings into China. The (early 3rd to early 5th century) ''[[Mouzi Lihuolun]]'' first records this legend:\n\n{{quote|In olden days Emperor Ming saw in a dream a god whose body had the brilliance of the sun and who flew before his palace; and he rejoiced exceedingly at this. The next day he asked his officials: \"What god is this?\" the scholar Fu Yi said: \"Your subject has heard it said that in [[India]] there is somebody who has attained the Dao and who is called Buddha; he flies in the air, his body had the brilliance of the sun; this must be that god.\"<ref>Tr. by Henri Maspero, 1981, ''Taoism and Chinese Religion'', tr. by Frank A. Kierman Jr., [[University of Massachusetts Press]], p. 402.</ref>}}\n\nThe emperor then sent an envoy to [[Tianzhu (India)|Tianzhu]] (Southern India) to inquire about the teachings of the Buddha.<ref>Hill (2009), p. 31.</ref> Buddhist scriptures were said to have been returned to China on the backs of white horses, after which [[White Horse Temple]] was named. Two Indian monks also returned with them, named [[Dharmaratna]] and [[Kasyapa Matanga|Ka\u015byapa M\u0101ta\u1e45ga]].\n\nAn 8th-century Chinese fresco at [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] in [[Gansu]] portrays [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141\u201387 BCE) worshiping statues of a golden man; \"golden men brought in 121 BCE by a great Han general in his campaigns against the nomads\". However, neither the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Shiji]]'' nor ''[[Book of Han]]'' histories of Emperor Wu mentions a golden Buddhist statue (compare Emperor Ming above).\n\n====The first translations====\n[[File:HanWudiBuddhas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Mogao Caves]] 8th-century mural depicting the legend of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] worshipping buddha statues]]\n\nThe first documented translation of Buddhist scriptures from various Indian languages into Chinese occurs in 148 CE with the arrival of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] prince-turned-monk [[An Shigao]] (Ch. {{lang|zh|\u5b89\u4e16\u9ad8}}). He worked to establish Buddhist temples in [[Luoyang]] and organized the translation of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese, testifying to the beginning of a wave of Central Asian Buddhist proselytism that was to last several centuries. An Shigao translated Buddhist texts on basic doctrines, [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], and [[abhidharma]]. [[An Xuan]] (Ch. {{lang|zh|\u5b89\u7384}}), a Parthian layman who worked alongside An Shigao, also translated an early Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist text on the [[bodhisattva]] path.\n\n[[Mahayana|Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] Buddhism was first widely propagated in China by the Kushan monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokak\u1e63ema]] (Ch. {{lang|zh|\u652f\u5a41\u8fe6\u8b96}}, active c. 164\u2013186 CE), who came from the ancient Buddhist kingdom of [[Gandh\u0101ra]]. Lokak\u1e63ema translated important [[Mahayana sutras|Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras]] such as the ''A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra'', as well as rare, early Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras on topics such as [[Sam\u0101dhi (Buddhism)|sam\u0101dhi]], and meditation on the buddha [[Akshobhya|Ak\u1e63obhya]]. These translations from Lokak\u1e63ema continue to give insight into the early period of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. This corpus of texts often includes emphasizes ascetic practices and forest dwelling, and absorption in states of meditative concentration:<ref>Williams, Paul. ''Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' 2008. p. 30</ref>\n\n{{quote|Paul Harrison has worked on some of the texts that are arguably the earliest versions we have of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras, those translated into Chinese in the last half of the second century CE by the Indo-Scythian translator Lokak\u1e63ema. Harrison points to the enthusiasm in the Lokak\u1e63ema s\u016btra corpus for the extra ascetic practices, for dwelling in the forest, and above all for states of meditative absorption (''sam\u0101dhi''). Meditation and meditative states seem to have occupied a central place in early Mah\u0101y\u0101na, certainly because of their spiritual efficacy but also because they may have given access to fresh revelations and inspiration.}}\n\n====Early Buddhist schools====\n[[File:MetMuseum - Hunping - P1090403.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jiangnan]] [[hunping|funerary jar]], ca. 250\u2013300 CE, [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], decorated with a row of Buddhas seated on lotus thrones.<ref>Label for item no. 1992.165.21 in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]</ref>]]\n\nDuring the early period of Chinese Buddhism, the Indian [[early Buddhist schools]] recognized as important, and whose texts were studied, were the [[Dharmaguptaka]]s, [[Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka]]s, [[K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya]]s, [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins]], and the [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika]]s.<ref>Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism.'' 2000. p. 281</ref>\n\nThe Dharmaguptakas made more efforts than any other sect to spread Buddhism outside India, to areas such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Central Asia]], and China, and they had great success in doing so.<ref>Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 278</ref> Therefore, most countries which adopted Buddhism from China, also adopted the Dharmaguptaka [[vinaya]] and ordination lineage for [[bhikkhu|bhik\u1e63u]]s and [[bhikkhuni|bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b]]s. According to [[A.K. Warder]], in some ways in those East Asian countries, the Dharmaguptaka sect can be considered to have survived to the present.<ref>Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 489</ref> Warder further writes that the Dharmaguptakas can be credited with effectively establishing Chinese Buddhism during the early period:<ref>Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism.'' 2000. pp. 280\u2013281</ref>\n\n{{quote|It was the Dharmaguptakas who were the first Buddhists to establish themselves in Central Asia. They appear to have carried out a vast circling movement along the trade routes from [[Aparanta|Apar\u0101nta]] north-west into [[Iran]] and at the same time into [[O\u1e0d\u1e0diy\u0101na]] (the [[Swat District|Suvastu valley]], north of [[Gandh\u0101ra]], which became one of their main centres). After establishing themselves as far west as [[Parthia]] they followed the \"silk route\", the east-west axis of Asia, eastwards across Central Asia and on into China, where they effectively established Buddhism in the second and third centuries A.D. The Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101sakas and K\u0101\u015byap\u012byas appear to have followed them across Asia into China. [...] For the earlier period of Chinese Buddhism it was the Dharmaguptakas who constituted the main and most influential school, and even later their ''Vinaya'' remained the basis of the discipline there.}}\n\n===Six Dynasties (220\u2013589)===\n{{See also|Six Dynasties}}\n\n====Early translation methods====\n[[File:Kumarajiva at Kizil Caves, Kuqa.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Kum\u0101raj\u012bva]] in front of the [[Kizil Caves]] in [[Kuqa County|Kuqa]], [[Xinjiang]] Autonomous region, [[China]]]]\n[[File:Korea-Haeinsa-Tripitaka Koreana-01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Tripitaka Koreana|Tripi\u1e6daka Koreana]], an edition of the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] carved and preserved in over 81,000 wood printing blocks]]\n\nInitially, Buddhism in China faced a number of difficulties in becoming established. The concept of [[monasticism]] and the aversion to social affairs seemed to contradict the long-established norms and standards established in Chinese society. Some even declared that Buddhism was harmful to the authority of the state, that Buddhist monasteries contributed nothing to the economic prosperity of China, that Buddhism was barbaric and undeserving of Chinese cultural traditions.<ref>Bentley, Jerry. ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' 1993. p. 82</ref> However, Buddhism was often associated with [[Taoism]] in its ascetic meditative tradition, and for this reason a concept-matching system was used by some early Indian translators, to adapt native Buddhist ideas onto Daoist ideas and terminology.<ref>Oh, Kang-nam (2000).

Gentry Buddhism was a medium of introduction for the beginning of Buddhism in China, it gained imperial and courtly support. By the early 5th century Buddhism was established in south China.<ref>Jerry Bentley \"''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times''\" (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 78.</ref>\nDuring this time, Indian monks continued to travel along the Silk Road to teach Buddhism, and translation work was primarily done by foreign monks rather than Chinese.\n\n====The arrival of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva (334\u2013413 CE)====\nWhen the famous monk [[Kum\u0101raj\u012bva]] was captured during the Chinese conquest of the Buddhist kingdom of [[Kucha]], he was imprisoned for many years. When he was released in AD 401, he immediately took a high place in Chinese Buddhism and was appraised as a great master from the West. He was especially valued by Emperor [[Yao Xing]] of the state of [[Later Qin]], who gave him an honorific title and treated him like a god. Kum\u0101raj\u012bva revolutionized Chinese Buddhism with his high quality translations (from AD 402\u2013413), which are still praised for their flowing smoothness, clarity of meaning, subtlety, and literary skill. Due to the efforts of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva, Buddhism in China became not only recognized for its practice methods, but also as high philosophy and religion. The arrival of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva also set a standard for Chinese translations of Buddhist texts, effectively doing away with previous concept-matching systems.\n\nThe translations of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva have often remained more popular than those of other translators. Among the most well-known are his translations of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', the ''[[Amitabha Sutra]]'', the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra|Vimalak\u012brti Nirde\u015ba S\u016btra]]'', the ''[[M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101]]'', and the ''[[Prajnaparamita|A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra]]''.\n\n====A completed S\u016btra Pi\u1e6daka====\nAround the time of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva, the four major Sanskrit [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|\u0101gamas]] were also translated into Chinese. Each of the \u0101gamas was translated independently by a different Indian monk. These \u0101gamas comprise the only other complete surviving [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|S\u016btra Pi\u1e6daka]], which is generally comparable to the [[Pali]] [[Sutta Pitaka]] of [[Theravada]] Buddhism. The teachings of the S\u016btra Pi\u1e6daka are usually considered to be one of the earliest teachings on Buddhism and a core text of the [[Early Buddhist Schools]] in China. It is noteworthy that before the modern period, these \u0101gama were seldom if ever used by Buddhist communities, due to their [[H\u012bnay\u0101na]] attribution, as Chinese Buddhism was already avowedly [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] in persuasion.\n\n====Early Chinese Buddhist traditions====\nDue to the wide proliferation of Buddhist texts available in Chinese and the large number of foreign monks who came to teach Buddhism in China, much like new branches growing from a main tree trunk, various specific focus traditions emerged. Among the most influential of these was the practice of [[Pure Land Buddhism]] established by [[Huiyuan (Buddhist)|Hui Yuan]], which focused on [[Amit\u0101bha]] Buddha and his western [[pure land]] of [[Sukhavati|Sukh\u0101vat\u012b]]. Other early traditions were the [[Tiantai]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]]  and the [[Vinaya school]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shengyen.org/e_content/content/about/about_04_06.aspx |script-title=zh:\u6cd5\u9f13\u5c71\u8056\u56b4\u6cd5\u5e2b\u6578\u4f4d\u5178\u85cf |accessdate=2013-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528023559/http://www.shengyen.org/e_content/content/about/about_04_06.aspx |archivedate=2013-05-28 }}</ref> Such schools were based upon the primacy of the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus S\u016btra]]'', the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra]]'', and the ''Dharmaguptaka Vinaya'', respectively, along with supplementary s\u016btras and commentaries. The Tiantai founder [[Zhiyi]] wrote several works that became important and widely read meditation manuals in China such as the \"Concise samatha-vipasyana\", and the \"[[Mohe Zhiguan|Great samatha-vipasyana]].\"\n\n====Daily life of nuns====\nAn important aspect of a nun was the practice of a vegetarian as it was heavily emphasized in the Buddhist religion to not harm any living creature for the purpose of them to consume. There were also some nuns who did not eat regularly, as an attempt of fasting. Another dietary practice of nuns was their practice of consuming fragrant oil or incense as a \u201cpreparation for self- immolation by fire.\u201d<ref>Kathryn Ann Tsai, Lives Of The Nuns.

During his travels he visited holy sites, learned the lore of his faith, and studied with many famous Buddhist masters, especially at the famous center of Buddhist learning at [[Nalanda|N\u0101landa University]]. When he returned, he brought with him some 657 [[Sanskrit]] texts. Xuanzang also returned with relics, statues, and Buddhist paraphernalia loaded onto twenty-two horses.<ref>Jerry Bentley, \"''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times''\" (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 81.</ref> With the emperor's support, he set up a large translation bureau in [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]), drawing students and collaborators from all over [[East Asia]]. He is credited with the translation of some 1,330 fascicles of scriptures into Chinese. His strongest personal interest in Buddhism was in the field of [[Yog\u0101c\u0101ra]], or \"Consciousness-only\".\n\nThe force of his own study, translation and commentary of the texts of these traditions initiated the development of the [[Faxiang]] school in East Asia. Although the school itself did not thrive for a long time, its theories regarding [[perception]], [[consciousness]], [[karma]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], etc. found their way into the doctrines of other more successful schools. Xuanzang's closest and most eminent student was [[Kuiji]] who became recognized as the first patriarch of the Faxiang school. Xuanzang's logic, as described by Kuiji, was often misunderstood by scholars of Chinese Buddhism because they lack the necessary background in [[Indian logic]].<ref>See Eli Franco, \"Xuanzang's proof of idealism.\" Horin 11 (2004): 199\u2013212.</ref>  Another important disciple was the Korean monk [[Woncheuk]].\n\nXuanzang's translations were especially important for the transmission of Indian texts related to the [[Yogacara|Yog\u0101c\u0101ra]] school. He translated central Yog\u0101c\u0101ra texts such as the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana S\u016btra]]'' and the ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi \u015a\u0101stra]]'', as well as important texts such as the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra]]'' and the ''[[Bhaisajyaguru|Bhai\u1e63ajyaguruvaid\u016bryaprabhar\u0101ja S\u016btra]]'' (Medicine Buddha S\u016btra). He is credited with writing or compiling the ''[[Cheng Weishi Lun]]'' (''Vij\u00f1aptim\u0101trat\u0101siddhi \u015a\u0101stra'') as composed from multiple commentaries on [[Vasubandhu]]'s ''[[Tri\u1e43\u015bik\u0101-vij\u00f1aptim\u0101trat\u0101]]''. His translation of the ''[[Heart Sutra|Heart S\u016btra]]'' became and remains the standard in all East Asian Buddhist sects. The proliferation of these texts expanded the Chinese Buddhist canon significantly with high quality translations of some of the most important Indian Buddhist texts.\n\n====Caves, art, and technology====\n[[File:Longmen-lu-she-na-1.jpg|thumb|right|Massive [[Tang dynasty]] statues of a [[bodhisattva]] [[Guanyin]], an [[arhat]] [[Kshitigarbha]], and [[Vairocana]] [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. [[Longmen Grottoes]], [[Henan]] province, [[China]]]]\n\nThe popularization of Buddhism in this period is evident in the many scripture-filled caves and structures surviving from this period. The [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] and the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] are the most renowned examples from the [[Northern Dynasties|Northern]], [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasties]]. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.\n\nMonks and pious laymen spread Buddhist concepts through story-telling and preaching from sutra texts. These oral presentations were written down as [[Bianwen (transformation texts)|bianwen]] (transformation stories) which influenced the writing of fiction by their new ways of telling stories  [[Prosimetrum|combining prose and poetry]]. Popular legends in this style included [[Mulian Rescues His Mother]], in which a monk descends into hell in a show of [[filial piety in Buddhism|filial piety]].\n\nMaking duplications of Buddhist texts was considered to bring meritorious [[karma]]. [[Printing]] from individually carved wooden blocks and from clay or metal movable type proved much more efficient than hand copying and eventually eclipsed it. The ''Diamond S\u016btra'' (''Vajracchedik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra'') of 868 CE, a Buddhist scripture discovered in 1907 inside the Mogao Caves, is the first dated example of block printing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/collections/treasures/diamond.html |title=Diamond Sutra |accessdate=2008-09-12 |work=Landmarks in Printing |publisher=The British Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306001443/http://www.bl.uk/collections/treasures/diamond.html |archivedate=2005-03-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Arrival of Esoteric Buddhism====\n[[File:Pratisara Mantra1.png|thumb|right|Chinese use of the [[Siddha\u1e43 script]] for the Pratisara [[Mantra]], from the [[Later Tang]]. 927 CE]]\n\nThe Kaiyuan's Three Great Enlightened Masters, [[Subhakarasimha|\u015aubhakarasi\u1e43ha]], [[Vajrabodhi]], and [[Amoghavajra]], established Esoteric Buddhism in China from AD 716 to 720 during the reign of emperor [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]]. They came to Daxing Shansi ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u5174\u5584\u5bfa}}, ''Great Propagating Goodness Temple''), which was the predecessor of Temple of the Great Enlightener [[Mahavairocana]]. Daxing Shansi was established in the ancient capital Chang'an, today's Xi'an, and became one of the four great centers of scripture translation supported by the imperial court. They had translated many Buddhist scriptures, sutra and tantra, from Sanskrit to Chinese. They had also assimilated the prevailing teachings of China: Daoism and Confucianism, with Buddhism, and had further evolved the practice of the Esoteric school.\n\nThey brought to the Chinese a mysterious, dynamic, and magical teaching, which included mantra formula and detailed rituals to protect a person or an empire, to affect a person's fate after death, and, particularly popular, to bring rain in times of drought. It is not surprising, then, that all three masters were well received by the emperor Tang Xuanzong, and their teachings were quickly taken up at the Tang court and among the elite. Mantrayana altars were installed in temples in the capital, and by the time of emperor [[Emperor Daizong of Tang|Tang Daizong]] (r. 762\u2013779) its influence among the upper classes outstripped that of Daoism. However, relations between Amoghavajra and Daizong were especially good. In life the emperor favored Amoghavajra with titles and gifts, and when the master died in 774, he honored his memory with a stupa, or funeral monument. The Esoteric Buddhist lineage of China (and almost all of Buddhism in China at the time) was nearly wiped out by the Emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Tang Wuzong]], leading to the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]]. Historically, the Hanmi Chinese Esoteric School of Buddhism was also thought to have been lost when Emperor Tang Wuzong banned the teaching. Master [[Huiguo]], the last known disciple of Amoghavajra, foresaw this. He was happy to see the arrival of Japanese student monk [[K\u016bkai]] and tried to teach him every details in Esoteric Buddhism at that time, consisting of two major divisions, the Womb Realm and the Diamond Realm. Master Kukai went back to Japan to establish the Japanese Esoteric school of Buddhism, later known as [[Shingon Buddhism]]. Huiguo died shortly after his meeting with Kukai and not long before Emperor Wuzong's persecution.\n\nThe Esoteric Buddhist lineages transmitted to [[Japan]] under the auspices of the monks [[K\u016bkai]] and [[Saicho]],  later formulated the teachings transmitted to them to create the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon sect]] and the [[Tendai|Tendai sect]].\n\n====Tang state repression of 845====\n{{See also|Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|}}\n[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|thumb|Blue-eyed [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asian monk]] teaching East-Asian monk, [[Bezeklik]], [[Turpan]], eastern [[Tarim Basin]], China, 9th century; the monk on the left is possibly [[Tocharians|Tocharian]],<ref>[[Albert von Le Coq|von Le Coq, Albert]].

One factor is the foreign origins of Buddhism, unlike [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. [[Han Yu]] wrote, ''\"Buddha was a man of the barbarians who did not speak the language of China and wore clothes of a different fashion. His sayings did not concern the ways of our ancient kings, nor did his manner of dress conform to their laws. He understood neither the duties that bind sovereign and subject, nor the affections of father and son.\"''\n\nOther components included the Buddhists' withdrawal from society, since the Chinese believed that Chinese people should be involved with family life. Wealth, tax-exemption status and power of the Buddhist temples and monasteries also annoyed many critics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palumbo|first=Antonello|date=2017|title=Exemption Not Granted: The Confrontation between Buddhism and the Chinese State in Late Antiquity and the \u203aFirst Great Divergence\u2039 Between China and Western Eurasia|url=http://hw.oeaw.ac.at/?arp=0x00372f23|journal=Medieval Worlds|language=en|volume=medieval worlds|issue=Volume 6. 2017|pages=118\u2013155|doi=10.1553/medievalworlds_no6_2017s118|issn=2412-3196}}</ref>\n\nAs mentioned earlier, persecution came during the reign of [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] in the Tang dynasty. Wuzong was said to hate the sight of Buddhist monks, who he thought were tax-evaders. In 845, he ordered the destruction of 4,600 Buddhist monasteries and 40,000 temples. More than 400,000 Buddhist monks and nuns then became peasants liable to the Two Taxes (grain and cloth).<ref name=\"Gernet\">Gernet, Jacques. Verellen, Franciscus. ''Buddhism in Chinese Society.'' 1998. pp. 318-319</ref> Wuzong cited that Buddhism was an alien religion, which is the reason he also persecuted the [[Christians]] in China.

British Museum..jpg|thumb|[[Vaishravana]] riding across the waters, [[Dunhuang]], [[Mogao Caves]], Cave 17, 10th century, [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms|Five Dyasties era]], [[British Museum]]]]\n\nThe [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u4e94\u4ee3\u5341\u570b|s=\u4e94\u4ee3\u5341\u56fd|p=W\u01d4d\u00e0i Sh\u00edgu\u00f3}}) was an era of political upheaval in [[China]], between the fall of the [[Tang dynasty]] and the founding of the [[Song dynasty]]. During this period, five dynasties quickly succeeded one another in the north, and more than 12 independent states were established, mainly in the south. However, only ten are traditionally listed, hence the era's name, \"Ten Kingdoms\". Some historians, such as [[Bo Yang]], count eleven, including [[Yan (Ten Kingdoms)|Yan]] and [[Qi (Five Dynasties)|Qi]], but not [[Northern Han]], viewing it as simply a continuation of Later Han. This era also led to the founding of the [[Liao dynasty]].\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Tang dynasty]], China was without effective central control during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. China was divided into several autonomous regions. Support for Buddhism was limited to a few areas. The Hua-yen and T'ien-t'ai schools suffered from the changing circumstances, since they had depended on imperial support. The collapse of T'ang society also deprived the aristocratic classes of wealth and influence, which meant a further drawback for Buddhism. Shenxiu's Northern Ch\u00e1n School and Henshui's Southern Ch\u00e1n School didn't survive the changing circumstances. Nevertheless, Ch\u00e1n emerged as the dominant stream within Chinese Buddhism, but with various schools developing various emphasises in their teachings, due to the regional orientation of the period. The [[Fayan school]], named after Fa-yen Wen-i (885\u2013958) became the dominant school in the southern kingdoms of Nan-T'ang ([[Jiangxi]], Chiang-hsi) and [[Wuyue]] (Che-chiang).{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Song Dynasty (960\u20131279)===\n[[File:Guanyin 00.jpg|thumb|Seated [[Bodhisattva]] Avalokitesvara ([[Guanyin]]), wood and pigment, 11th century, Chinese [[Northern Song dynasty]], [[St. Louis Art Museum]]]]\n\nThe [[Song dynasty]] is divided into two distinct periods: the Northern Song and Southern Song. During the Northern Song ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u5317\u5b8b}}, 960\u20131127), the Song capital was in the northern city of Bianjing (now [[Kaifeng]]) and the dynasty controlled most of [[China Proper|inner China]]. The Southern Song ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u5357\u5b8b}}, 1127\u20131279) refers to the period after the Song lost control of [[Northern and southern China|northern China]] to the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]]. During this time, the Song court retreated south of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and established their capital at Lin'an (now [[Hangzhou]]). Although the Song Dynasty had lost control of the traditional birthplace of Chinese civilization along the [[Yellow River]], the Song economy was not in ruins, as the Southern Song Empire contained 60 percent of China's population  and a majority of the most productive agricultural land.{{sfn|Ebrey|2006|p=167}}\n\nDuring the Song dynasty, Ch\u00e1n ({{lang|zh|\u79aa}}) was used by the government to strengthen its control over the country, and Ch\u00e1n grew to become the largest sect in Chinese Buddhism. An ideal picture of the Ch\u00e1n of the Tang period was produced, which served the legacy of this newly acquired status.{{sfn|McRae|1993|p=119\u2013120}}\n\nIn the early Song dynasty \"Ch\u00e1n-Pure Land syncretism became a dominant movement.\"<ref>Heng-Ching Shih (1987).

Various Confucian scholars of the [[Song dynasty]], including [[Zhu Xi]] ([[Wade-Giles|wg:]] [[Chu Hsi]]), sought to redefine Confucianism as [[Neo-Confucianism]].\n\nDuring the Song dynasty, in 1021 CE, it is recorded that there were 458,855 Buddhist monks and nuns actively living in monasteries.<ref name=\"Gernet\"/> The total number of monks was 397,615, while the total number of nuns was recorded as 61,240.<ref name=\"Gernet\"/>\n\n===Mongol Yuan rule (1279\u20131368)===\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty|Mongol Yuan]] domination, the [[Mongolia|Mongol]] emperors made Esoteric Buddhism an official religion of their empire which China was a part of, and Tibetan lamas were given patronage at the court.<ref name=\"Nan Huaijin 1997. p. 99\">Nan Huai-Chin.

By devoting themselves to religion, they received less social criticism from society because during the Ming time women were expected to remain faithful to their husband. An example of this is Xia Shuji.

For most of these women, a convent was seen as a haven to escape their family or an unwanted marriage. Such difficulties were due to the social expectation of the women as it was considered unfilial to leave their duty as a wife, daughter, mother or daughter in law.<ref>Beata Grant., and Wilt Idema, \u201cEmpresses, Nuns, and Actresses.

The maritime route hypothesis, favored by [[Liang Qichao]] and [[Paul Pelliot]], proposed that Buddhism was originally practiced in southern China, the [[Yangtze River]] and [[Huai River]] region. On the other  hand, it must have entered from the northwest via the Kansu corridor to the Yellow River basin and the North China Plain in the course of the first century A.D. The scene becomes clearers from the middle of the second century onward, when the first known missionaries started their translation activities in the capital, Lo-yand. The ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' records that in 65 CE, prince [[Liu Ying (prince)|Liu Ying]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] (present day [[Jiangsu]]) \"delighted in the practices of [[Huang-Lao|Huang-Lao Daoism]]\" and had both Buddhist monks and laypeople at his court who presided over Buddhist ceremonies.<ref>Maspero 1981, pp. 401, 405.</ref> The overland route hypothesis, favored by Tang Yongtong, proposed that Buddhism disseminated through Central Asia \u2013 in particular, the [[Kushan Empire]], which was often known in ancient Chinese sources as [[Yuezhi|''Da Yuezhi'']] (\"Great Yuezhi\"), after the founding tribe. According to this hypothesis, Buddhism was first  practiced in China in the [[Western Regions]] and the Han capital [[Luoyang]] (present day [[Henan]]), where [[Emperor Ming of Han]] established the [[White Horse Temple]] in 68 CE.\n\nIn 2004, Rong Xinjiang, a history professor at [[Peking University]], reexamined the overland and maritime hypotheses through a multi-disciplinary review of recent discoveries and research, including the [[Gandh\u0101ran Buddhist Texts]], and concluded:\n{{quote|The view that Buddhism was transmitted to China by the sea route comparatively lacks convincing and supporting materials, and some arguments are not sufficiently rigorous. Based on the existing historical texts and the archaeological iconographic materials discovered since the 1980s, particularly the first-century Buddhist manuscripts recently found in Afghanistan, the commentator believes that the most plausible theory is that Buddhism reached China from the Greater Yuezhi of northwest India and took the land route to reach Han China. After entering into China, Buddhism blended with early Daoism and Chinese traditional esoteric arts and its iconography received blind worship.<ref>Rong Xinjiang, 2004, [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp144_han_dynasty_buddhism.pdf Land Route or Sea Route? Commentary on the Study of the Paths of Transmission and Areas in which Buddhism Was Disseminated during the Han Period], tr. by Xiuqin Zhou, ''[[Sino-Platonic Papers]]'' 144, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>}}\n\nThe French sinologist [[Henri Maspero]] says it is a \"very curious fact\" that, throughout the entire Han dynasty, Daoism and Buddhism were \"constantly confused and appeared as single religion\".<ref>Maspero 1981, p. 405.</ref> A century after prince Liu Ying's court supported both Daoists and Buddhists, in 166 [[Emperor Huan of Han]] made offerings to the Buddha and sacrifices to the Huang-Lao gods [[Yellow Emperor]] and [[Laozi]]. <ref>Maspero 1981, p. 406.</ref> The first Chinese [[apologist]] for Buddhism, a late 2nd-century layman named [[Mouzi Lihuolun|Mouzi]], said it was through Daoism that he was led to Buddhism\u2014which he calls ''d\u00e0d\u00e0o'' ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u9053}}, the \"Great Dao\").\n<blockquote>I too, when I had not yet understood the Great Way (Buddhism), had studied Taoist practises. Hundreds and thousands of recipes are there for longevity through [[Bigu (grain avoidance)|abstention from cereals]]. I practised them, but without success; I saw them put to use, but without result. That is why I abandoned them.<ref>Maspero 1981, p. 406.</ref></blockquote>\nEarly Chinese Buddhism was conflated and mixed with Daoism, and it was within Daoist circles that it found its first adepts. Traces are evident in Han period Chinese translations of Buddhist scriptures, which hardly differentiated between [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Buddhist nirvana]] and [[Xian (Taoism)|Daoist immortality]]. ''[[Wu wei|Wuwei]]'', the Daoist concept of non-interference, was the normal term for translating [[Sanskrit]] ''nirvana'', which is [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transcribed]] as ''ni\u00e8p\u00e1n'' ({{lang|zh|\u6d85\u69c3}}) in modern Chinese usage.<ref>Maspero 1981, p. 409</ref>\n\n====Traditional accounts====\n[[File:WhiteHorseTemple.jpg|thumb|right|[[White Horse Temple]], traditionally held to be at the origin of Chinese Buddhism.]]\n\nA number of popular accounts in historical Chinese literature have led to the popularity of certain legends regarding the introduction of Buddhism into China. According to the most popular one, [[Emperor Ming of Han]] (28\u201375 CE) precipitated the  introduction of Buddhist teachings into China. The (early 3rd to early 5th century) ''[[Mouzi Lihuolun]]'' first records this legend:\n\n{{quote|In olden days Emperor Ming saw in a dream a god whose body had the brilliance of the sun and who flew before his palace; and he rejoiced exceedingly at this. The next day he asked his officials: \"What god is this?\" the scholar Fu Yi said: \"Your subject has heard it said that in [[India]] there is somebody who has attained the Dao and who is called Buddha; he flies in the air, his body had the brilliance of the sun; this must be that god.\"<ref>Tr. by Henri Maspero, 1981, ''Taoism and Chinese Religion'', tr. by Frank A. Kierman Jr., [[University of Massachusetts Press]], p. 402.</ref>}}\n\nThe emperor then sent an envoy to [[Tianzhu (India)|Tianzhu]] (Southern India) to inquire about the teachings of the Buddha.<ref>Hill (2009), p. 31.</ref> Buddhist scriptures were said to have been returned to China on the backs of white horses, after which [[White Horse Temple]] was named. Two Indian monks also returned with them, named [[Dharmaratna]] and [[Kasyapa Matanga|Ka\u015byapa M\u0101ta\u1e45ga]].\n\nAn 8th-century Chinese fresco at [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] in [[Gansu]] portrays [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141\u201387 BCE) worshiping statues of a golden man; \"golden men brought in 121 BCE by a great Han general in his campaigns against the nomads\". However, neither the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Shiji]]'' nor ''[[Book of Han]]'' histories of Emperor Wu mentions a golden Buddhist statue (compare Emperor Ming above).\n\n====The first translations====\n[[File:HanWudiBuddhas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Mogao Caves]] 8th-century mural depicting the legend of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] worshipping buddha statues]]\n\nThe first documented translation of Buddhist scriptures from various Indian languages into Chinese occurs in 148 CE with the arrival of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] prince-turned-monk [[An Shigao]] (Ch. {{lang|zh|\u5b89\u4e16\u9ad8}}). He worked to establish Buddhist temples in [[Luoyang]] and organized the translation of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese, testifying to the beginning of a wave of Central Asian Buddhist proselytism that was to last several centuries. An Shigao translated Buddhist texts on basic doctrines, [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], and [[abhidharma]]. [[An Xuan]] (Ch. {{lang|zh|\u5b89\u7384}}), a Parthian layman who worked alongside An Shigao, also translated an early Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist text on the [[bodhisattva]] path.\n\n[[Mahayana|Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] Buddhism was first widely propagated in China by the Kushan monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokak\u1e63ema]] (Ch. {{lang|zh|\u652f\u5a41\u8fe6\u8b96}}, active c. 164\u2013186 CE), who came from the ancient Buddhist kingdom of [[Gandh\u0101ra]]. Lokak\u1e63ema translated important [[Mahayana sutras|Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras]] such as the ''A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra'', as well as rare, early Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras on topics such as [[Sam\u0101dhi (Buddhism)|sam\u0101dhi]], and meditation on the buddha [[Akshobhya|Ak\u1e63obhya]]. These translations from Lokak\u1e63ema continue to give insight into the early period of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. This corpus of texts often includes emphasizes ascetic practices and forest dwelling, and absorption in states of meditative concentration:<ref>Williams, Paul. ''Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' 2008. p. 30</ref>\n\n{{quote|Paul Harrison has worked on some of the texts that are arguably the earliest versions we have of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras, those translated into Chinese in the last half of the second century CE by the Indo-Scythian translator Lokak\u1e63ema. Harrison points to the enthusiasm in the Lokak\u1e63ema s\u016btra corpus for the extra ascetic practices, for dwelling in the forest, and above all for states of meditative absorption (''sam\u0101dhi''). Meditation and meditative states seem to have occupied a central place in early Mah\u0101y\u0101na, certainly because of their spiritual efficacy but also because they may have given access to fresh revelations and inspiration.}}\n\n====Early Buddhist schools====\n[[File:MetMuseum - Hunping - P1090403.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jiangnan]] [[hunping|funerary jar]], ca. 250\u2013300 CE, [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], decorated with a row of Buddhas seated on lotus thrones.<ref>Label for item no. 1992.165.21 in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]</ref>]]\n\nDuring the early period of Chinese Buddhism, the Indian [[early Buddhist schools]] recognized as important, and whose texts were studied, were the [[Dharmaguptaka]]s, [[Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka]]s, [[K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya]]s, [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins]], and the [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika]]s.<ref>Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism.'' 2000. p. 281</ref>\n\nThe Dharmaguptakas made more efforts than any other sect to spread Buddhism outside India, to areas such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Central Asia]], and China, and they had great success in doing so.<ref>Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 278</ref> Therefore, most countries which adopted Buddhism from China, also adopted the Dharmaguptaka [[vinaya]] and ordination lineage for [[bhikkhu|bhik\u1e63u]]s and [[bhikkhuni|bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b]]s. According to [[A.K. Warder]], in some ways in those East Asian countries, the Dharmaguptaka sect can be considered to have survived to the present.<ref>Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 489</ref> Warder further writes that the Dharmaguptakas can be credited with effectively establishing Chinese Buddhism during the early period:<ref>Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism.'' 2000. pp. 280\u2013281</ref>\n\n{{quote|It was the Dharmaguptakas who were the first Buddhists to establish themselves in Central Asia.

After establishing themselves as far west as [[Parthia]] they followed the \"silk route\", the east-west axis of Asia, eastwards across Central Asia and on into China, where they effectively established Buddhism in the second and third centuries A.D.

The concept of [[monasticism]] and the aversion to social affairs seemed to contradict the long-established norms and standards established in Chinese society. Some even declared that Buddhism was harmful to the authority of the state, that Buddhist monasteries contributed nothing to the economic prosperity of China, that Buddhism was barbaric and undeserving of Chinese cultural traditions.<ref>Bentley, Jerry. ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' 1993. p. 82</ref> However, Buddhism was often associated with [[Taoism]] in its ascetic meditative tradition, and for this reason a concept-matching system was used by some early Indian translators, to adapt native Buddhist ideas onto Daoist ideas and terminology.<ref>Oh, Kang-nam (2000).

Gentry Buddhism was a medium of introduction for the beginning of Buddhism in China, it gained imperial and courtly support. By the early 5th century Buddhism was established in south China.<ref>Jerry Bentley \"''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times''\" (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 78.</ref>\nDuring this time, Indian monks continued to travel along the Silk Road to teach Buddhism, and translation work was primarily done by foreign monks rather than Chinese.\n\n====The arrival of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva (334\u2013413 CE)====\nWhen the famous monk [[Kum\u0101raj\u012bva]] was captured during the Chinese conquest of the Buddhist kingdom of [[Kucha]], he was imprisoned for many years. When he was released in AD 401, he immediately took a high place in Chinese Buddhism and was appraised as a great master from the West. He was especially valued by Emperor [[Yao Xing]] of the state of [[Later Qin]], who gave him an honorific title and treated him like a god. Kum\u0101raj\u012bva revolutionized Chinese Buddhism with his high quality translations (from AD 402\u2013413), which are still praised for their flowing smoothness, clarity of meaning, subtlety, and literary skill. Due to the efforts of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva, Buddhism in China became not only recognized for its practice methods, but also as high philosophy and religion. The arrival of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva also set a standard for Chinese translations of Buddhist texts, effectively doing away with previous concept-matching systems.\n\nThe translations of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva have often remained more popular than those of other translators. Among the most well-known are his translations of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', the ''[[Amitabha Sutra]]'', the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra|Vimalak\u012brti Nirde\u015ba S\u016btra]]'', the ''[[M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101]]'', and the ''[[Prajnaparamita|A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra]]''.\n\n====A completed S\u016btra Pi\u1e6daka====\nAround the time of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva, the four major Sanskrit [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|\u0101gamas]] were also translated into Chinese. Each of the \u0101gamas was translated independently by a different Indian monk. These \u0101gamas comprise the only other complete surviving [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|S\u016btra Pi\u1e6daka]], which is generally comparable to the [[Pali]] [[Sutta Pitaka]] of [[Theravada]] Buddhism. The teachings of the S\u016btra Pi\u1e6daka are usually considered to be one of the earliest teachings on Buddhism and a core text of the [[Early Buddhist Schools]] in China. It is noteworthy that before the modern period, these \u0101gama were seldom if ever used by Buddhist communities, due to their [[H\u012bnay\u0101na]] attribution, as Chinese Buddhism was already avowedly [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] in persuasion.\n\n====Early Chinese Buddhist traditions====\nDue to the wide proliferation of Buddhist texts available in Chinese and the large number of foreign monks who came to teach Buddhism in China, much like new branches growing from a main tree trunk, various specific focus traditions emerged. Among the most influential of these was the practice of [[Pure Land Buddhism]] established by [[Huiyuan (Buddhist)|Hui Yuan]], which focused on [[Amit\u0101bha]] Buddha and his western [[pure land]] of [[Sukhavati|Sukh\u0101vat\u012b]]. Other early traditions were the [[Tiantai]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]]  and the [[Vinaya school]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shengyen.org/e_content/content/about/about_04_06.aspx |script-title=zh:\u6cd5\u9f13\u5c71\u8056\u56b4\u6cd5\u5e2b\u6578\u4f4d\u5178\u85cf |accessdate=2013-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528023559/http://www.shengyen.org/e_content/content/about/about_04_06.aspx |archivedate=2013-05-28 }}</ref> Such schools were based upon the primacy of the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus S\u016btra]]'', the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra]]'', and the ''Dharmaguptaka Vinaya'', respectively, along with supplementary s\u016btras and commentaries. The Tiantai founder [[Zhiyi]] wrote several works that became important and widely read meditation manuals in China such as the \"Concise samatha-vipasyana\", and the \"[[Mohe Zhiguan|Great samatha-vipasyana]].\"\n\n====Daily life of nuns====\nAn important aspect of a nun was the practice of a vegetarian as it was heavily emphasized in the Buddhist religion to not harm any living creature for the purpose of them to consume. There were also some nuns who did not eat regularly, as an attempt of fasting. Another dietary practice of nuns was their practice of consuming fragrant oil or incense as a \u201cpreparation for self- immolation by fire.\u201d<ref>Kathryn Ann Tsai, Lives Of The Nuns. (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press), pp. 10.</ref>\n\nSome daily activities of nuns include the reading, memorizing, and reciting of Buddhist scriptures and religious text. Another was mediation as it is seen as the \u201cheart of Buddhist monastic life.\u201d There are biographers explaining when nuns mediate they enter a state where their body of becomes hard, rigid, and stone-like where they are often mistaken as lifeless.<ref name=\"Kathryn Ann Tsai pp. 11\">Kathryn Ann Tsai, Lives Of The Nuns., pp. 11.</ref>\n\n===Southern and Northern Dynasties (420\u2013589) and Sui Dynasty (589\u2013618 CE)===\n{{See also|Southern and Northern Dynasties|Sui dynasty}}\n\n====Ch\u00e1n: pointing directly to the mind====\n{{Main|Chinese Ch\u00e1n}}\n\n[[File:Master Wei-Chueh.png|thumb|right|Ven.

[[Ekay\u0101na]]) to [[buddhahood]]. In the early years, the teachings of Ch\u00e1n were therefore referred to as the \"One Vehicle School.\"<ref>''The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch'', translated with notes by Philip B. Yampolsky, 1967, [[Columbia University Press]], {{ISBN|0-231-08361-0}}, page 29, note 87</ref> The earliest masters of the Ch\u00e1n school were called \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra Masters\", for their mastery of practice according to the principles of the ''La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra''.\n\nThe principal teachings of Ch\u00e1n were later often known for the use of so-called ''encounter stories'' and [[koan]]s, and the teaching methods used in them. [[Nan Huai-Chin]] identifies the ''La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra'' and the ''Diamond S\u016btra'' (''Vajracchedik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra'') as the principle texts of the Ch\u00e1n school, and summarizes the principles succinctly: \n{{quote|The Zen teaching was a separate transmission outside the scriptural teachings that did not posit any written texts as sacred.

During his travels he visited holy sites, learned the lore of his faith, and studied with many famous Buddhist masters, especially at the famous center of Buddhist learning at [[Nalanda|N\u0101landa University]]. When he returned, he brought with him some 657 [[Sanskrit]] texts. Xuanzang also returned with relics, statues, and Buddhist paraphernalia loaded onto twenty-two horses.<ref>Jerry Bentley, \"''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times''\" (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 81.</ref> With the emperor's support, he set up a large translation bureau in [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]), drawing students and collaborators from all over [[East Asia]]. He is credited with the translation of some 1,330 fascicles of scriptures into Chinese. His strongest personal interest in Buddhism was in the field of [[Yog\u0101c\u0101ra]], or \"Consciousness-only\".\n\nThe force of his own study, translation and commentary of the texts of these traditions initiated the development of the [[Faxiang]] school in East Asia. Although the school itself did not thrive for a long time, its theories regarding [[perception]], [[consciousness]], [[karma]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], etc. found their way into the doctrines of other more successful schools. Xuanzang's closest and most eminent student was [[Kuiji]] who became recognized as the first patriarch of the Faxiang school. Xuanzang's logic, as described by Kuiji, was often misunderstood by scholars of Chinese Buddhism because they lack the necessary background in [[Indian logic]].<ref>See Eli Franco, \"Xuanzang's proof of idealism.\" Horin 11 (2004): 199\u2013212.</ref>  Another important disciple was the Korean monk [[Woncheuk]].\n\nXuanzang's translations were especially important for the transmission of Indian texts related to the [[Yogacara|Yog\u0101c\u0101ra]] school. He translated central Yog\u0101c\u0101ra texts such as the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Sa\u1e43dhinirmocana S\u016btra]]'' and the ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi \u015a\u0101stra]]'', as well as important texts such as the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra]]'' and the ''[[Bhaisajyaguru|Bhai\u1e63ajyaguruvaid\u016bryaprabhar\u0101ja S\u016btra]]'' (Medicine Buddha S\u016btra). He is credited with writing or compiling the ''[[Cheng Weishi Lun]]'' (''Vij\u00f1aptim\u0101trat\u0101siddhi \u015a\u0101stra'') as composed from multiple commentaries on [[Vasubandhu]]'s ''[[Tri\u1e43\u015bik\u0101-vij\u00f1aptim\u0101trat\u0101]]''. His translation of the ''[[Heart Sutra|Heart S\u016btra]]'' became and remains the standard in all East Asian Buddhist sects. The proliferation of these texts expanded the Chinese Buddhist canon significantly with high quality translations of some of the most important Indian Buddhist texts.\n\n====Caves, art, and technology====\n[[File:Longmen-lu-she-na-1.jpg|thumb|right|Massive [[Tang dynasty]] statues of a [[bodhisattva]] [[Guanyin]], an [[arhat]] [[Kshitigarbha]], and [[Vairocana]] [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. [[Longmen Grottoes]], [[Henan]] province, [[China]]]]\n\nThe popularization of Buddhism in this period is evident in the many scripture-filled caves and structures surviving from this period. The [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] and the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] are the most renowned examples from the [[Northern Dynasties|Northern]], [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasties]]. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.\n\nMonks and pious laymen spread Buddhist concepts through story-telling and preaching from sutra texts. These oral presentations were written down as [[Bianwen (transformation texts)|bianwen]] (transformation stories) which influenced the writing of fiction by their new ways of telling stories  [[Prosimetrum|combining prose and poetry]]. Popular legends in this style included [[Mulian Rescues His Mother]], in which a monk descends into hell in a show of [[filial piety in Buddhism|filial piety]].\n\nMaking duplications of Buddhist texts was considered to bring meritorious [[karma]]. [[Printing]] from individually carved wooden blocks and from clay or metal movable type proved much more efficient than hand copying and eventually eclipsed it. The ''Diamond S\u016btra'' (''Vajracchedik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra'') of 868 CE, a Buddhist scripture discovered in 1907 inside the Mogao Caves, is the first dated example of block printing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/collections/treasures/diamond.html |title=Diamond Sutra |accessdate=2008-09-12 |work=Landmarks in Printing |publisher=The British Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306001443/http://www.bl.uk/collections/treasures/diamond.html |archivedate=2005-03-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Arrival of Esoteric Buddhism====\n[[File:Pratisara Mantra1.png|thumb|right|Chinese use of the [[Siddha\u1e43 script]] for the Pratisara [[Mantra]], from the [[Later Tang]]. 927 CE]]\n\nThe Kaiyuan's Three Great Enlightened Masters, [[Subhakarasimha|\u015aubhakarasi\u1e43ha]], [[Vajrabodhi]], and [[Amoghavajra]], established Esoteric Buddhism in China from AD 716 to 720 during the reign of emperor [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]]. They came to Daxing Shansi ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u5174\u5584\u5bfa}}, ''Great Propagating Goodness Temple''), which was the predecessor of Temple of the Great Enlightener [[Mahavairocana]]. Daxing Shansi was established in the ancient capital Chang'an, today's Xi'an, and became one of the four great centers of scripture translation supported by the imperial court. They had translated many Buddhist scriptures, sutra and tantra, from Sanskrit to Chinese. They had also assimilated the prevailing teachings of China: Daoism and Confucianism, with Buddhism, and had further evolved the practice of the Esoteric school.\n\nThey brought to the Chinese a mysterious, dynamic, and magical teaching, which included mantra formula and detailed rituals to protect a person or an empire, to affect a person's fate after death, and, particularly popular, to bring rain in times of drought. It is not surprising, then, that all three masters were well received by the emperor Tang Xuanzong, and their teachings were quickly taken up at the Tang court and among the elite. Mantrayana altars were installed in temples in the capital, and by the time of emperor [[Emperor Daizong of Tang|Tang Daizong]] (r. 762\u2013779) its influence among the upper classes outstripped that of Daoism. However, relations between Amoghavajra and Daizong were especially good. In life the emperor favored Amoghavajra with titles and gifts, and when the master died in 774, he honored his memory with a stupa, or funeral monument. The Esoteric Buddhist lineage of China (and almost all of Buddhism in China at the time) was nearly wiped out by the Emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Tang Wuzong]], leading to the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]]. Historically, the Hanmi Chinese Esoteric School of Buddhism was also thought to have been lost when Emperor Tang Wuzong banned the teaching. Master [[Huiguo]], the last known disciple of Amoghavajra, foresaw this. He was happy to see the arrival of Japanese student monk [[K\u016bkai]] and tried to teach him every details in Esoteric Buddhism at that time, consisting of two major divisions, the Womb Realm and the Diamond Realm. Master Kukai went back to Japan to establish the Japanese Esoteric school of Buddhism, later known as [[Shingon Buddhism]].

One factor is the foreign origins of Buddhism, unlike [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. [[Han Yu]] wrote, ''\"Buddha was a man of the barbarians who did not speak the language of China and wore clothes of a different fashion. His sayings did not concern the ways of our ancient kings, nor did his manner of dress conform to their laws. He understood neither the duties that bind sovereign and subject, nor the affections of father and son.\"''\n\nOther components included the Buddhists' withdrawal from society, since the Chinese believed that Chinese people should be involved with family life. Wealth, tax-exemption status and power of the Buddhist temples and monasteries also annoyed many critics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palumbo|first=Antonello|date=2017|title=Exemption Not Granted: The Confrontation between Buddhism and the Chinese State in Late Antiquity and the \u203aFirst Great Divergence\u2039 Between China and Western Eurasia|url=http://hw.oeaw.ac.at/?arp=0x00372f23|journal=Medieval Worlds|language=en|volume=medieval worlds|issue=Volume 6. 2017|pages=118\u2013155|doi=10.1553/medievalworlds_no6_2017s118|issn=2412-3196}}</ref>\n\nAs mentioned earlier, persecution came during the reign of [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] in the Tang dynasty. Wuzong was said to hate the sight of Buddhist monks, who he thought were tax-evaders. In 845, he ordered the destruction of 4,600 Buddhist monasteries and 40,000 temples. More than 400,000 Buddhist monks and nuns then became peasants liable to the Two Taxes (grain and cloth).<ref name=\"Gernet\">Gernet, Jacques. Verellen, Franciscus.

Five Dynasties, mid-10th century AD. British Museum..jpg|thumb|[[Vaishravana]] riding across the waters, [[Dunhuang]], [[Mogao Caves]], Cave 17, 10th century, [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms|Five Dyasties era]], [[British Museum]]]]\n\nThe [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u4e94\u4ee3\u5341\u570b|s=\u4e94\u4ee3\u5341\u56fd|p=W\u01d4d\u00e0i Sh\u00edgu\u00f3}}) was an era of political upheaval in [[China]], between the fall of the [[Tang dynasty]] and the founding of the [[Song dynasty]]. During this period, five dynasties quickly succeeded one another in the north, and more than 12 independent states were established, mainly in the south. However, only ten are traditionally listed, hence the era's name, \"Ten Kingdoms\". Some historians, such as [[Bo Yang]], count eleven, including [[Yan (Ten Kingdoms)|Yan]] and [[Qi (Five Dynasties)|Qi]], but not [[Northern Han]], viewing it as simply a continuation of Later Han. This era also led to the founding of the [[Liao dynasty]].\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Tang dynasty]], China was without effective central control during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. China was divided into several autonomous regions. Support for Buddhism was limited to a few areas. The Hua-yen and T'ien-t'ai schools suffered from the changing circumstances, since they had depended on imperial support. The collapse of T'ang society also deprived the aristocratic classes of wealth and influence, which meant a further drawback for Buddhism. Shenxiu's Northern Ch\u00e1n School and Henshui's Southern Ch\u00e1n School didn't survive the changing circumstances. Nevertheless, Ch\u00e1n emerged as the dominant stream within Chinese Buddhism, but with various schools developing various emphasises in their teachings, due to the regional orientation of the period. The [[Fayan school]], named after Fa-yen Wen-i (885\u2013958) became the dominant school in the southern kingdoms of Nan-T'ang ([[Jiangxi]], Chiang-hsi) and [[Wuyue]] (Che-chiang).{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Song Dynasty (960\u20131279)===\n[[File:Guanyin 00.jpg|thumb|Seated [[Bodhisattva]] Avalokitesvara ([[Guanyin]]), wood and pigment, 11th century, Chinese [[Northern Song dynasty]], [[St. Louis Art Museum]]]]\n\nThe [[Song dynasty]] is divided into two distinct periods: the Northern Song and Southern Song. During the Northern Song ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u5317\u5b8b}}, 960\u20131127), the Song capital was in the northern city of Bianjing (now [[Kaifeng]]) and the dynasty controlled most of [[China Proper|inner China]]. The Southern Song ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u5357\u5b8b}}, 1127\u20131279) refers to the period after the Song lost control of [[Northern and southern China|northern China]] to the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]]. During this time, the Song court retreated south of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and established their capital at Lin'an (now [[Hangzhou]]). Although the Song Dynasty had lost control of the traditional birthplace of Chinese civilization along the [[Yellow River]], the Song economy was not in ruins, as the Southern Song Empire contained 60 percent of China's population  and a majority of the most productive agricultural land.{{sfn|Ebrey|2006|p=167}}\n\nDuring the Song dynasty, Ch\u00e1n ({{lang|zh|\u79aa}}) was used by the government to strengthen its control over the country, and Ch\u00e1n grew to become the largest sect in Chinese Buddhism. An ideal picture of the Ch\u00e1n of the Tang period was produced, which served the legacy of this newly acquired status.{{sfn|McRae|1993|p=119\u2013120}}\n\nIn the early Song dynasty \"Ch\u00e1n-Pure Land syncretism became a dominant movement.\"<ref>Heng-Ching Shih (1987). Yung-Ming's Syncretism of Pure Land and Chan, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 10 (1), p. 117</ref>\nBuddhist ideology began to merge with Confucianism and Daoism, due in part to the use of existing Chinese philosophical terms in the translation of Buddhist scriptures. Various Confucian scholars of the [[Song dynasty]], including [[Zhu Xi]] ([[Wade-Giles|wg:]] [[Chu Hsi]]), sought to redefine Confucianism as [[Neo-Confucianism]].\n\nDuring the Song dynasty, in 1021 CE, it is recorded that there were 458,855 Buddhist monks and nuns actively living in monasteries.<ref name=\"Gernet\"/> The total number of monks was 397,615, while the total number of nuns was recorded as 61,240.<ref name=\"Gernet\"/>\n\n===Mongol Yuan rule (1279\u20131368)===\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty|Mongol Yuan]] domination, the [[Mongolia|Mongol]] emperors made Esoteric Buddhism an official religion of their empire which China was a part of, and Tibetan lamas were given patronage at the court.<ref name=\"Nan Huaijin 1997. p. 99\">Nan Huai-Chin.

He was also renowned as a lecturer and commentator and admired for his strict adherence to the precepts.<ref name=\"Keown, Damien 2003. p. 104\"/>\n\nAccording to Jiang Wu, for Chan masters in this period such as Hanshan Deqing, training through self-cultivation was encouraged, and clich\u00e9d or formulaic instructions were despised.<ref name=\"Dispute. 2008. p. 41\">Jiang Wu.

By devoting themselves to religion, they received less social criticism from society because during the Ming time women were expected to remain faithful to their husband. An example of this is Xia Shuji. Xia's husband Hou Xun, (1591-1645), had led a resistance in Jiading which arrested the Qing troops who later on beheaded him.<ref>Beata Grant, \u201cSetting the Stage: Seventeenth-Century Texts and Contexts.\u201d In Eminent Nuns: Women Chan Masters of Seventeenth-Century China pp., 5.</ref> Xia Shuji who secluded herself from the outside life to devote herself to religion and took on the religious name of Shengyin.<ref>Beata Grant, \u201cSetting the Stage: Seventeenth-Century Texts and Contexts.\u201d In Eminent Nuns: Women Chan Masters of Seventeenth-Century China., pp. 6.\n</ref>\n\nDuring the time of late Ming, a period of social upheaval, the monastery or convent provided shelter for these women who no longer had protection from a male in their family: husband, son or father due to death, financial constraint and other situations.<ref name=\"Kathryn Ann Tsai pp. 6\"/>  However, in most circumstances, a woman who wanted to join a nunnery was because they wanted to escape a marriage or they felt isolated as her husband has died- she also had to overcome many difficulties that arose socially from this decision. For most of these women, a convent was seen as a haven to escape their family or an unwanted marriage. Such difficulties were due to the social expectation of the women as it was considered unfilial to leave their duty as a wife, daughter, mother or daughter in law.<ref>Beata Grant., and Wilt Idema, \u201cEmpresses, Nuns, and Actresses.

An RFID tag consists of a tiny radio transponder; a radio receiver and transmitter.  When triggered by an electromagnetic interrogation pulse from a nearby RFID reader device, the tag transmits digital data, usually an identifying inventory number, back to the reader.  This number can be used to inventory goods.  There are two types.  ''Passive tags'' are powered by energy from the RFID reader's interrogating [[radio wave]]s.  ''Active tags'' are powered by a battery and thus can be read at a greater range from the RFID reader; up to hundreds of meters.  Unlike a [[barcode]], the tag doesn't need to be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method of [[automatic identification and data capture]] (AIDC).<ref>[http://www.mhi.org/fundamentals/automatic-identification Automatic Identification and Data Collection (AIDC)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505190510/http://www.mhi.org/fundamentals/automatic-identification |date=May 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nRFID tags are used in many industries. For example, an RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line; RFID-tagged pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses; and [[Microchip implant (animal)|implanting RFID microchips]] in livestock and pets enables positive identification of animals.\n\nSince RFID tags can be attached to cash, clothing, and possessions, or implanted in animals and people, the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised serious privacy concerns.<ref name=\"Angell\">{{cite journal |journal=Communications of the ACM |year=2006 |volume=49 |issue=12 |pages=90\u201396 |title=RFID and the end of cash? |author=Angell, I., Kietzmann, J. |doi=10.1145/1183236.1183237 |url=http://beedie.sfu.ca/files/Research/Journal_Articles/Journal_Articles_misc/RFID_and_the_end_of_Cash.pdf |accessdate=9 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224155226/http://beedie.sfu.ca/files/Research/Journal_Articles/Journal_Articles_misc/RFID_and_the_end_of_Cash.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These concerns resulted in standard specifications development addressing privacy and security issues.

The RFID tag includes either fixed or programmable logic for processing the transmission and sensor data, respectively.\n\nRFID tags can be either passive, active or battery-assisted passive. An active tag has an on-board battery and periodically transmits its ID signal. A battery-assisted passive has a small battery on board and is activated when in the presence of an RFID reader. A passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery; instead, the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader. However, to operate a passive tag, it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than an active tag for signal transmission. That makes a difference in interference and in exposure to radiation.\n\nTags may either be read-only, having a factory-assigned serial number that is used as a key into a database, or may be read/write, where object-specific data can be written into the tag by the system user. Field programmable tags may be write-once, read-multiple; \"blank\" tags may be written with an electronic product code by the user.\n\nThe RFID tag receives the message and then responds with its identification and other information. This may be only a unique tag serial number, or may be product-related information such as a stock number, lot or batch number, production date, or other specific information. Since tags have individual serial numbers, the RFID system design can discriminate among several tags that might be within the range of the RFID reader and read them simultaneously.\n\n===Readers===\n\nRFID systems can be classified by the type of tag and reader.\n\nA '''Passive Reader Active Tag''' ('''PRAT''') system has a passive reader which only receives radio signals from active tags (battery operated, transmit only). The reception range of a PRAT system reader can be adjusted from {{convert|1|-|2000|ft|-2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/technology-explained-how-do-rfid-tags-work/|title=How Does RFID Technology Work?|website=MakeUseOf|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>, allowing flexibility in applications such as asset protection and supervision.\n\nAn '''Active Reader Passive Tag''' ('''ARPT''') system has an active reader, which transmits interrogator signals and also receives authentication replies from passive tags.\n\nAn '''Active Reader Active Tag''' ('''ARAT''') system uses active tags awoken with an interrogator signal from the active reader. A variation of this system could also use a Battery-Assisted Passive (BAP) tag which acts like a passive tag but has a small battery to power the tag's return reporting signal.\n\nFixed readers are set up to create a specific interrogation zone which can be tightly controlled. This allows a highly defined reading area for when tags go in and out of the interrogation zone. Mobile readers may be handheld or mounted on carts or vehicles.\n\n===Frequencies===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ RFID frequency bands<ref name=Sen09>{{Citation |first1=Dipankar |last1=Sen |first2=Prosenjit |last2=Sen |first3=Anand M. |last3=Das |title=RFID For Energy and Utility Industries |publisher=PennWell |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-59370-105-5 |doi= }}, pp.&nbsp;1-48</ref><ref name=Weis>{{Citation |first=Stephen A. |last=Weis |title=RFID (Radio Frequency Identification): Principles and Applications |publisher=MIT CSAIL |year=2007 <!-- Year from PDF document properties; 2006 from access dates in article --> |doi= |citeseerx=10.1.1.182.5224 }}</ref>\n|-\n!

Tags operating on LF and HF bands are, in terms of radio wavelength, very close to the reader antenna because they are only a small percentage of a wavelength away. In this [[Near and far field|near field]] region, the tag is closely coupled electrically with the transmitter in the reader. The tag can modulate the field produced by the reader by changing the electrical loading the tag represents. By switching between lower and higher relative loads, the tag produces a change that the reader can detect. At UHF and higher frequencies, the tag is more than one radio wavelength away from the reader, requiring a different approach. The tag can [[backscatter]] a signal. Active tags may contain functionally separated transmitters and receivers, and the tag need not respond on a frequency related to the reader's interrogation signal.<ref name=Dobkin08>Daniel M. Dobkin, ''The RF in RFID: Passive UHF RFID In Practice'', Newnes 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-7506-8209-1}}, chapter 8</ref>\n\nAn [[Electronic Product Code]] (EPC) is one common type of data stored in a tag. When written into the tag by an RFID printer, the tag contains a 96-bit string of data.  The first eight bits are a header which identifies the version of the protocol. The next 28 bits identify the organization that manages the data for this tag; the organization number is assigned by the EPCGlobal consortium. The next 24 bits are an object class, identifying the kind of product; the last 36 bits are a unique serial number for a particular tag. These last two fields are set by the organization that issued the tag. Rather like a [[Uniform resource locator|URL]], the total electronic product code number can be used as a key into a global database to uniquely identify a particular product.<ref>John R. Vacca ''Computer and information security handbook'', Morgan Kaufmann, 2009 {{ISBN|0-12-374354-0}}, page 208</ref>\n\nOften more than one tag will respond to a tag reader, for example, many individual products with tags may be shipped in a common box or on a common pallet. Collision detection is important to allow reading of data.  Two different types of protocols are used to [[Singulation|\"singulate\"]] a particular tag, allowing its data to be read in the midst of many similar tags.  In a [[ALOHAnet|slotted Aloha]] system, the reader broadcasts an initialization command and a parameter that the tags individually use to pseudo-randomly delay their responses. When using an \"adaptive binary tree\" protocol, the reader sends an initialization symbol and then transmits one bit of ID data at a time; only tags with matching bits respond, and eventually only one tag matches the complete ID string.<ref>Bill Glover, Himanshu Bhatt ,''RFID essentials'',  O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|0-596-00944-5}}, pages 88\u201389</ref>\n[[File:RFID search environment.png|thumb|right|An example of a binary tree method of identifying an RFID tag]]\nBoth methods have drawbacks when used with many tags or with multiple overlapping readers.\n\n===Bulk reading===\n\"Bulk reading\" is a strategy for interrogating multiple tags at the same time, but lacks sufficient precision for inventory control.  A group of objects, all of them RFID tagged, are read completely from one single reader position at one time. Bulk reading is a possible use of [[High frequency|HF]] (ISO 18000-3), [[UHF]] (ISO 18000-6) and [[Super high frequency|SHF]] (ISO 18000-4) RFID tags. However, as tags respond strictly sequentially, the time needed for bulk reading grows linearly with the number of labels to be read. This means it takes at least twice as long to read twice as many labels. Due to collision effects, the time required is greater. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rfidjournal.com/site/faqs|title=Frequently Asked Questions - RFID Journal|website=www.rfidjournal.com|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\nA group of tags has to be illuminated by the interrogating signal just like a single tag. This is not a challenge concerning energy, but with respect to visibility; if any of the tags are shielded by other tags, they might not be sufficiently illuminated to return a sufficient response. The response conditions for inductively coupled [[High frequency|HF]] RFID tags and coil antennas in magnetic fields appear better than for UHF or SHF dipole fields, but then distance limits apply and may prevent success.\n\nUnder operational conditions, bulk reading is not reliable. Bulk reading can be a rough guide for logistics decisions, but due to a high proportion of reading failures, it is not (yet) suitable for inventory management. However, when a single RFID tag might be seen as not guaranteeing a proper read, a bunch of RFID tags, where at least one will respond, may be a safer approach for detecting a known grouping of objects. In this respect, bulk reading is a [[Fuzzy mathematics|fuzzy]] method for process support. From the perspective of cost and effect, bulk reading is not reported as an economical approach to secure process control in logistics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.com/files/SGTF_Report_Final_posted_v1.1.pdf|title=STGF Report}}</ref>\n\n===Miniaturization===\nRFID tags are easy to conceal or incorporate in other items.

The tag can be read if passed near a reader, even if it is covered by the object or not visible. The tag can be read inside a case, carton, box or other container, and unlike barcodes, RFID tags can be read hundreds at a time. Bar codes can only be read one at a time using current devices.\n\nIn 2011, the cost of passive tags started at US$0.09 each; special tags, meant to be mounted on metal or withstand gamma sterilization, can go up to US$5.

It can also act as a [[security]] device, taking the place of the more traditional [[electronic article surveillance|electromagnetic security strip]].<ref name=\"butters\">{{cite journal |last1=Butters |first1=Alan |title=Radio Frequency Identification: An Introduction for Library Professionals |journal=Australasian Public Libraries and Information Services |volume=19 |issue=4 | date=December 2006 |pages=164\u201374 |url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=312996058408409;res=IELHSS |issn=1030-5033}}</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that over 30 million library items worldwide now contain RFID tags, including some in the [[Vatican Library]] in [[Rome]].<ref name=\"singh\">{{cite journal |doi=10.6017/ital.v25i1.3326 |title=The State of RFID Applications in Libraries |year=2013 |last1=Sing |first1=Jay |last2=Brar |first2=Navjit |last3=Fong |first3=Carmen |journal=Information Technology and Libraries |volume=25\u201332|page=24 }}</ref>\n\nSince RFID tags can be read through an item, there is no need to open a book cover or DVD case to scan an item, and a stack of books can be read simultaneously.  Book tags can be read while books are in motion on a [[conveyor belt]], which reduces staff time. This can all be done by the borrowers themselves, reducing the need for library staff assistance. With portable readers, inventories could be done on a whole shelf of materials within seconds.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Radio Frequency Identification |first1=Rachel |last1=Wadham |journal=Library Mosaics |volume=14 |issue=5 |year=2003 |page=22}}</ref>\nHowever, as of 2008 this technology remained too costly for many smaller libraries, and the conversion period has been estimated at 11 months for an average-size library. A 2004 Dutch estimate was that a library which lends 100,000 books per year should plan on a cost of \u20ac50,000 (borrow- and return-stations: 12,500 each, detection porches 10,000 each; tags 0.36 each). RFID taking a large burden off staff could also mean that fewer staff will be needed, resulting in some of them getting laid off,<ref name=\"singh\"/> but that has so far not happened in North America where recent surveys have not returned a single library that cut staff because of adding RFID. In fact, library budgets are being reduced for personnel and increased for infrastructure, making it necessary for libraries to add automation to compensate for the reduced staff size. Also, the tasks that RFID takes over are largely not the primary tasks of librarians. A finding in the Netherlands is that borrowers are pleased with the fact that staff are now more available for answering questions.\n\nPrivacy concerns have been raised surrounding library use of RFID. Because some RFID tags can be read from up to {{convert|100|m}}, there is some concern over whether sensitive information could be collected from an unwilling source. However, library RFID tags do not contain any patron information,<ref>{{cite journal |first=David |last=Dorman |title=RFID Poses No Problem for Patron Privacy |journal=American Libraries |volume=34 |issue=11 | date=December 2003 |page=86 |url=http://www.ala.org/PrinterTemplate.cfm?section=archive&template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=50931}}</ref> and the tags used in the majority of libraries use a frequency only readable from approximately {{convert|10|ft}}.<ref name=\"butters\"/> Further, another non-library agency could potentially record the RFID tags of every person leaving the library without the library administrator's knowledge or consent. One simple option is to let the book transmit a code that has meaning only in conjunction with the library's database. Another possible enhancement would be to give each book a new code every time it is returned. In future, should readers become ubiquitous (and possibly networked), then stolen books could be traced even outside the library. Tag removal could be made difficult if the tags are so small that they fit invisibly inside a (random) page, possibly put there by the publisher.\n\n====Museums====\nRFID technologies are now also implemented in end-user applications in museums. An example was the custom-designed temporary research application, \"eXspot,\" at the [[Exploratorium]], a science museum in [[San Francisco, California]]. A visitor entering the museum received an RF Tag that could be carried as a card. The eXspot system enabled the visitor to receive information about specific exhibits. Aside from the exhibit information, the visitor could take photographs of themselves at the exhibit. It was also intended to allow the visitor to take data for later analysis. The collected information could be retrieved at home from a \"personalized\" website keyed to the RFID tag.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/1081992.1082021 |title=RFID enhances visitors' museum experience at the Exploratorium |year=2005 |last1=Hsi |first1=Sherry |last2=Fait |first2=Holly |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=60\u20135}}</ref>\n\n====Schools and universities====\nSchool authorities in the Japanese city of [[Osaka]] are now chipping children's clothing, backpacks, and student IDs in a primary school.<ref name=LAN>{{cite web|url=http://networks.silicon.com/lans/0,39024663,39122042,00.htm |title=Schoolchildren to be RFID-chipped |publisher=Networks.silicon.com |accessdate=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427003216/http://networks.silicon.com/lans/0,39024663,39122042,00.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2012 }}</ref> A school in [[Doncaster]], [[England]] is piloting a monitoring system designed to keep tabs on pupils by tracking radio chips in their uniforms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Christopher |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/22/kid_chipping_doncaster_go/ |title=Schoolkid chipping trial 'a success' |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2007-10-22 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref> [[List of further education colleges in England#S|St Charles Sixth Form College]] in west [[London]], England, started in 2008, uses an RFID card system to check in and out of the main gate, to both track attendance and prevent unauthorized entrance. Similarly, [[Whitcliffe Mount School]] in [[Cleckheaton]], England uses RFID to track pupils and staff in and out of the building via a specially designed card. In the Philippines, some schools already use RFID in IDs for borrowing books. Gates in those particular schools have RFID ID scanners for buying items at a school shop and canteen. RFID is also used in the library, and to sign in and out for student and teacher attendance.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:2008 Nike+ Human Race in Taipei the ChampionChip.jpg|thumb|ChampionChip]]\n[[Transponder timing|RFID for timing races]] began in the early 1990s with pigeon racing, introduced by the company [[Deister Electronics]] in Germany. RFID can provide race start and end timings for individuals in large races where it is impossible to get accurate stopwatch readings for every entrant.\n\nIn the race, the racers wear tags that are read by antennas placed alongside the track or on mats across the track. UHF tags provide accurate readings with specially designed antennas. Rush error, lap count errors and accidents at start time are avoided since anyone can start and finish any time without being in a batch mode.\n[[File:Marathon Zeitnahme.JPG|thumb|left|[[jchip|J-Chip]] 8-channel receiver next to timing mat. The athlete wears a chip on a strap around his ankle. [https://web.archive.org/web/19961218232821/http://www.ironman.de/ Ironman Germany] 2007 in Frankfurt.]]\n\nThe design of chip+antenna controls the range from which it can be read. Short range compact chips are twist tied to the shoe or velcro strapped to the ankle. These need to be about 400mm from the mat and so give very good temporal resolution. Alternatively, a chip plus a very large (125mm square) antenna can be incorporated into the bib number worn on the athlete's chest at about 1.25m height.\n\nPassive and active RFID systems are used in off-road events such as [[Orienteering]], [[Enduro]] and [[Hare and Hound (Motorcycle Race)|Hare and Hounds]] racing. Riders have a transponder on their person, normally on their arm. When they complete a lap they swipe or touch the receiver which is connected to a computer and log their lap time.\n\nRFID is being adapted by many recruitment agencies which have a PET (physical endurance test) as their qualifying procedure, especially in cases where the candidate volumes may run into millions (Indian Railway recruitment cells, police and power sector).\n\nA number of [[ski resort]]s have adopted RFID tags to provide skiers hands-free access to [[ski lift]]s. Skiers do not have to take their passes out of their pockets. Ski jackets have a left pocket into which the chip+card fits. This nearly contacts the sensor unit on the left of the turnstile as the skier pushes through to the lift. These systems were based on high frequency (HF) at 13.56 megahertz. The bulk of ski areas in Europe, from Verbier to Chamonix, use these systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cliqology.com/2010/09/epic-mix-skiiers-and-snowboards-social-media-dream/ |title=Epic Mix \u2013 Skiiers [sic] and Snowboarders Social Media Dream |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://snowboard-mag.com/content/vail-resorts-launches-epic-mix-39814 |title=Vail Resorts Launches Epic Mix &#124; SNOWBOARD MAGAZINE |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904085254/http://snowboard-mag.com/content/vail-resorts-launches-epic-mix-39814 |accessdate=2020-03-01|archive-date=2010-09-04 }}</ref><ref>Kinsella, Bret.

They may never completely replace barcodes, due in part to their higher cost and the advantage of multiple data sources on the same object. Also, unlike RFID labels, barcodes can be generated and distributed electronically, ''e.g.'' via e-mail or mobile phone, for printing or display by the recipient. An example is airline [[boarding passes]]. The new [[Electronic Product Code|EPC]], along with several other schemes, is widely available at reasonable cost.\n\nThe storage of data associated with tracking items will require many [[terabyte]]s. Filtering and categorizing RFID data is needed to create useful information. It is likely that goods will be tracked by the pallet using RFID tags, and at package level with Universal Product Code ([[Universal Product Code|UPC]]) or [[European Article Number|EAN]] from unique barcodes.\n\nThe unique identity is a mandatory requirement for RFID tags, despite special choice of the numbering scheme. RFID tag data capacity is large enough that each individual tag will have a unique code, while current bar codes are limited to a single type code for a particular product. The uniqueness of RFID tags means that a product may be tracked as it moves from location to location, finally ending up in the consumer's hands. This may help to combat theft and other forms of product loss. The tracing of products is an important feature that is well supported with RFID tags containing a unique identity of the tag and the serial number of the object. This may help companies cope with quality deficiencies and resulting recall campaigns, but also contributes to concern about tracking and profiling of consumers after the sale.\n\n===Waste management===\nRFID use has recently developed in the [[waste management]] industry. RFID tags are installed on waste collection carts, linking carts to the owner's account for easy billing and service verification. The tag is embedded into a garbage and recycle container, and the RFID reader is affixed to the garbage and recycle trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waste360.com/route-optimization/rfid-still-early-stages-adoption-waste-industry|title=RFID Still In Early Stages of Adoption by Waste Industry|last=|first=|date=2016-08-10|website=|access-date=}}</ref> RFID also measures a customer's set-out rate and provides insight as to the number of carts serviced by each waste collection vehicle. This RFID process replaces traditional \"[[pay as you throw]]\" (PAYT) [[municipal solid waste]] usage-pricing models.\n\n===Telemetry===\nActive RFID tags have the potential to function as low-cost remote sensors that broadcast [[telemetry]] back to a base station. Applications of tagometry data could include sensing of road conditions by implanted [[Bluetooth low energy beacon|beacons]], weather reports, and noise level monitoring.<ref>{{ISSN search link|0001-0782}}</ref>\n\nPassive RFID tags can also report sensor data. For example, the [[Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform]] is a passive tag that reports temperature, acceleration and capacitance to commercial Gen2 RFID readers.\n\nIt is possible that active or battery-assisted passive (BAP) RFID tags could broadcast a signal to an in-store receiver to determine whether the RFID tag (product) is in the store.\n\n==Regulation and standardization==\nTo avoid injuries to humans and animals RF transmission needs to be controlled.<ref name=\"regs\">{{Cite web |url=https://rfid4u.com/rfid-basics-resources/basics-rfid-regulations/ |title=RFID Regulations |date=n.d |website=RFID4U |language=en-US |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\nA number of organizations have set standards for RFID, including the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), [[ASTM International]], the [[DASH7]] Alliance and [[EPCglobal]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nSeveral specific industries also have set guidelines, including the Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) for tracking IT Assets with RFID, the Computer Technology Industry Association [[CompTIA]] for certifying RFID engineers, and the International Airlines Transport Association [[IATA]] for luggage in airports.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nEvery country can set its own rules for [[frequency allocation]] for RFID tags, and not all radio bands are available in all countries.

Two tag air interfaces (the protocol for exchanging information between a tag and a reader) were defined (but not ratified) by EPCglobal prior to 2003. These protocols, commonly known as Class 0 and Class 1, saw significant commercial implementation in 2002\u20132005.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://rfid4u.com/rfid-basics-resources/how-to-select-a-correct-rfid-tag-standards-mandates/ |title = RFID Standards and Mandates}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the Hardware Action Group created a new protocol, the Class 1 Generation 2 interface, which addressed a number of problems that had been experienced with Class 0 and Class 1 tags. The EPC Gen2 standard was approved in December 2004. This was approved after a contention from [[Intermec]] that the standard may infringe a number of their RFID-related patents.

A large amount of data may be generated that is not useful for managing inventory or other applications. For example, a customer moving a product from one shelf to another, or a pallet load of articles that passes several readers while being moved in a warehouse, are events that do not produce data that are meaningful to an inventory control system.<ref>Bill Glover, Himanshu Bhatt, ''RFID Essentials'', O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|0-596-00944-5}} page 43</ref>\n\nEvent filtering is required to reduce this data inflow to a meaningful depiction of moving goods passing a threshold. Various concepts{{Examples|date=June 2010}} have been designed, mainly offered as ''[[middleware]]'' performing the filtering from noisy and redundant raw data to significant processed data.\n\n===Global standardization===\nThe frequencies used for UHF RFID in the USA are as of 2007 incompatible with those of Europe or Japan. Furthermore, no emerging standard has yet become as universal as the [[barcode]].<ref>{{cite news|date = 7 June 2007|title = Radio Silence|url = http://economist.com/printedition/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9249278|newspaper = The Economist}}</ref> To address international trade concerns, it is necessary to use a tag that is operational within all of the international frequency domains.\n\n===Security concerns===\nA primary RFID security concern is the illicit tracking of RFID tags. Tags, which are world-readable, pose a risk to both personal location privacy and corporate/military security. Such concerns have been raised with respect to the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s recent adoption of RFID tags for [[supply chain management]].<ref>{{cite web|work = Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)|title = What's New|date = 4 April 2007|url = http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/index.htm|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060228101133/http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/index.htm|archivedate = 28 February 2006}}</ref> More generally, privacy organizations have expressed concerns in the context of ongoing efforts to embed electronic product code (EPC) RFID tags in consumer products. This is mostly as result of the fact that RFID tags can be read, and legitimate transactions with readers can be eavesdropped, from non-trivial distances. RFID used in access control, payment and eID (e-passport) systems operate at a shorter range than EPC RFID systems but are also vulnerable to [[RFID skimming|skimming]] and eavesdropping, albeit at shorter distance.<ref name=Hancke>{{cite journal|last=Hancke|first=Gerhard P|title=Practical eavesdropping and skimming attacks on high-frequency RFID tokens|journal=Journal of Computer Security|year=2011|volume=19|issue=2|pages=259\u2013288|doi=10.3233/JCS-2010-0407|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/xx855446h2kh84r2/|accessdate=10 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527141257/http://iospress.metapress.com/content/xx855446h2kh84r2/|archivedate=27 May 2016|citeseerx=10.1.1.169.9341}}</ref>\n\nA second method of prevention is by using cryptography. [[Rolling code]]s and [[challenge-response authentication]] (CRA) are commonly used to foil monitor-repetition of the messages between the tag and reader; as any messages that have been recorded would prove to be unsuccessful on repeat transmission. Rolling codes rely upon the tag's id being changed after each interrogation, while CRA uses software to ask for a [[cryptographic]]ally coded response from the tag. The protocols used during CRA can be [[symmetric key cryptography|symmetric]], or may use [[public key cryptography]].<ref name=RFIDHbook1>{{cite book|last=Ilyas|first=edited by Syed Ahson, Mohammad|title=RFID handbook : applications, technology, security, and privacy|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9781420054996|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4aCyZnq0cwC&pg=PA478&lpg=PA478&dq=Rather,+the+reader+issues+a+challenge+to+the+tag,+which+responds+with+a+result+computed+using+a+cryptographic+circuit+keyed+with+some+secret+value&source=bl&ots=nL2ORy_M-7&sig=mo9QSZyOeEEwnO9xqgAAg5cnx08&hl=en&sa=X&ei=82YhUIjwGeWg0QXp6oDwBQ&ved=0CGMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Rather%2C%20the%20reader%20issues%20a%20challenge%20to%20the%20tag%2C%20which%20responds%20with%20a%20result%20computed%20using%20a%20cryptographic%20circuit%20keyed%20with%20some%20secret%20value&f=false|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|accessdate=7 August 2012|page=478|chapter=26.5}}</ref>\n\nUnauthorized reading of RFID tags presents a risk to privacy and to business secrecy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vde-verlag.de/proceedings-en/453168007.html|title=Business risks from naive use of RFID in tracking, tracing and logistics - Conference papers - VDE Publishing House|website=www.vde-verlag.de|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Unauthorized readers can potentially use RFID information to identify or track packages, consumers, carriers, or the contents of a package.<ref name=RFIDHbook1/> Several prototype systems are being developed to combat unauthorized reading, including RFID signal interruption,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2115|title = RFID Privacy and Security|publisher = RSA Laboratories|accessdate = 2013-09-22|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061218210709/http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2115|archivedate = 2006-12-18}}</ref> as well as the possibility of legislation, and 700 scientific papers have been published on this matter since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://avoine.net/rfid/|title = RFID Security and Privacy Lounge|publisher=Avoine.net|accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref> There are also concerns that the database structure of [[Object Naming Service]] may be susceptible to infiltration, similar to [[denial-of-service attack]]s, after the EPCglobal Network ONS root servers were shown to be vulnerable.<ref>{{cite web|first=Adi|last=Tedjasaputra|url=http://www.rfid-asia.info/2007/02/putting-rfid-network-security-in.htm|title=Putting RFID Network Security in Perspective|publisher=RFID Asia|date=2006-12-11|accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>\n\n===Health===\nMicrochip\u2013induced tumors have been noted during animal trials.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Microchip-induced tumors in laboratory rodents and dogs: A review of the literature 1990\u20132006 |pages=337\u2013349 |last=Albrecht |first=Katherine |year=2010 |publisher=IEEE |doi= 10.1109/ISTAS.2010.5514622|isbn=978-1-4244-7777-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090800997_pf.html |title=Chip Implants Linked to Animal Tumors |last=Lewan |first=Todd |newspaper=Washington Post |date=8 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Shielding===\n{{Further information|Aluminium foil#Electromagnetic shielding}}\nIn an effort to prevent the passive \u201c[[RFID skimming|skimming]]\u201d of RFID-enabled cards or passports, the U.S. [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) issued a set of test procedures for evaluating electromagnetically opaque sleeves.<ref>{{cite web|title = Electromagnetically Opaque Sleeve Test Procedure version 3.0.0|publisher = GSA|url = http://fips201ep.cio.gov/documents/Electromagnetically%20Opaque%20Sleeve_Test%20Procedure_v3.0.0.pdf}}</ref> For shielding products to be in compliance with FIPS-201 guidelines, they must meet or exceed this published standard;

Consumer privacy experts [[Katherine Albrecht]] and [[Liz McIntyre (writer)|Liz McIntyre]] are two prominent critics of the \"spychip\" technology. The two main privacy concerns regarding RFID are:\n* Since the owner of an item will not necessarily be aware of the presence of an RFID tag and the tag can be read at a distance without the knowledge of the individual, it becomes possible to gather sensitive data about an individual without consent.\n* If a tagged item is paid for by credit card or in conjunction with use of a [[loyalty card]], then it would be possible to indirectly deduce the identity of the purchaser by reading the globally unique ID of that item (contained in the RFID tag). This is only true if the person doing the watching also had access to the loyalty card data and the credit card data, and the person with the equipment knows where the purchaser is going to be.\n\nMost concerns revolve around the fact that RFID tags affixed to products remain functional even after the products have been purchased and taken home and thus can be used for [[surveillance]] and other purposes unrelated to their supply chain inventory functions.<ref>Markus Hansen, Sebastian Meissner: [https://tepin.aiki.de/blog/uploads/2007-hansen-meissner-tracking-epc-rfid-ifip.pdf Identification and Tracking of Individuals and Social Networks using the Electronic Product Code on RFID Tags], IFIP Summer School, Karlstad, 2007, [https://tepin.aiki.de/blog/uploads/20070807-ifip-hansen-meissner-tracking-rfid-epc.pdf Slides].</ref>\n\nThe RFID Network argued that these fears are unfounded in the first episode of their syndicated cable TV series by letting RF engineers demonstrate how RFID works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://0y3v.errandrunner.org/onbqfGf|title=How to read data from rfid reader|website=0y3v.errandrunner.org|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref> They provided images of RF engineers driving an RFID-enabled van around a building and trying to take an inventory of items inside. They discussed satellite tracking of a passive RFID tag, which is surprising since the maximum range is under 200m.\n\nThe concerns raised by the above may be addressed in part by use of the [[Clipped Tag]]. The Clipped Tag is an RFID tag designed to increase consumer privacy. The Clipped Tag has been suggested by [[IBM]] researchers [[Paul Moskowitz]] and Guenter Karjoth. After the point of sale, a consumer may tear off a portion of the tag. This allows the transformation of a long-range tag into a proximity tag that still may be read, but only at short range&nbsp;\u2013 less than a few inches or centimeters. The modification of the tag may be confirmed visually. The tag may still be used later for returns, recalls, or recycling.\n\nHowever, read range is a function of both the reader and the tag itself. Improvements in technology may increase read ranges for tags. Tags may be read at longer ranges than they are designed for by increasing reader power. The limit on read distance then becomes the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal reflected from the tag back to the reader. Researchers at two security conferences have demonstrated that passive Ultra-HighFID tags normally read at ranges of up to 30 feet, can be read at ranges of 50 to 69 feet using suitable equipment.<ref>[http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/000798.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040106/http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/000798.html|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2005/07/_defcon_rfid_wo.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207081350/http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2005/07/_defcon_rfid_wo.html|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2004 privacy advocates from CASPIAN and the German privacy group [[digitalcourage|FoeBuD]] were invited to the METRO Future Store in [[Germany]], where an RFID pilot project was implemented.

An RFID tag consists of a tiny radio transponder; a radio receiver and transmitter.  When triggered by an electromagnetic interrogation pulse from a nearby RFID reader device, the tag transmits digital data, usually an identifying inventory number, back to the reader.  This number can be used to inventory goods.  There are two types.  ''Passive tags'' are powered by energy from the RFID reader's interrogating [[radio wave]]s.  ''Active tags'' are powered by a battery and thus can be read at a greater range from the RFID reader; up to hundreds of meters.  Unlike a [[barcode]], the tag doesn't need to be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method of [[automatic identification and data capture]] (AIDC).<ref>[http://www.mhi.org/fundamentals/automatic-identification Automatic Identification and Data Collection (AIDC)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505190510/http://www.mhi.org/fundamentals/automatic-identification |date=May 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nRFID tags are used in many industries.

The RFID tag includes either fixed or programmable logic for processing the transmission and sensor data, respectively.\n\nRFID tags can be either passive, active or battery-assisted passive. An active tag has an on-board battery and periodically transmits its ID signal. A battery-assisted passive has a small battery on board and is activated when in the presence of an RFID reader. A passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery; instead, the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader. However, to operate a passive tag, it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than an active tag for signal transmission. That makes a difference in interference and in exposure to radiation.\n\nTags may either be read-only, having a factory-assigned serial number that is used as a key into a database, or may be read/write, where object-specific data can be written into the tag by the system user. Field programmable tags may be write-once, read-multiple; \"blank\" tags may be written with an electronic product code by the user.\n\nThe RFID tag receives the message and then responds with its identification and other information. This may be only a unique tag serial number, or may be product-related information such as a stock number, lot or batch number, production date, or other specific information. Since tags have individual serial numbers, the RFID system design can discriminate among several tags that might be within the range of the RFID reader and read them simultaneously.\n\n===Readers===\n\nRFID systems can be classified by the type of tag and reader. A '''Passive Reader Active Tag''' ('''PRAT''') system has a passive reader which only receives radio signals from active tags (battery operated, transmit only). The reception range of a PRAT system reader can be adjusted from {{convert|1|-|2000|ft|-2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/technology-explained-how-do-rfid-tags-work/|title=How Does RFID Technology Work?|website=MakeUseOf|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>, allowing flexibility in applications such as asset protection and supervision.\n\nAn '''Active Reader Passive Tag''' ('''ARPT''') system has an active reader, which transmits interrogator signals and also receives authentication replies from passive tags.\n\nAn '''Active Reader Active Tag''' ('''ARAT''') system uses active tags awoken with an interrogator signal from the active reader. A variation of this system could also use a Battery-Assisted Passive (BAP) tag which acts like a passive tag but has a small battery to power the tag's return reporting signal.\n\nFixed readers are set up to create a specific interrogation zone which can be tightly controlled. This allows a highly defined reading area for when tags go in and out of the interrogation zone. Mobile readers may be handheld or mounted on carts or vehicles.\n\n===Frequencies===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ RFID frequency bands<ref name=Sen09>{{Citation |first1=Dipankar |last1=Sen |first2=Prosenjit |last2=Sen |first3=Anand M. |last3=Das |title=RFID For Energy and Utility Industries |publisher=PennWell |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-59370-105-5 |doi= }}, pp.&nbsp;1-48</ref><ref name=Weis>{{Citation |first=Stephen A. |last=Weis |title=RFID (Radio Frequency Identification): Principles and Applications |publisher=MIT CSAIL |year=2007 <!-- Year from PDF document properties; 2006 from access dates in article --> |doi= |citeseerx=10.1.1.182.5224 }}</ref>\n|-\n!

Tags operating on LF and HF bands are, in terms of radio wavelength, very close to the reader antenna because they are only a small percentage of a wavelength away. In this [[Near and far field|near field]] region, the tag is closely coupled electrically with the transmitter in the reader. The tag can modulate the field produced by the reader by changing the electrical loading the tag represents. By switching between lower and higher relative loads, the tag produces a change that the reader can detect. At UHF and higher frequencies, the tag is more than one radio wavelength away from the reader, requiring a different approach. The tag can [[backscatter]] a signal. Active tags may contain functionally separated transmitters and receivers, and the tag need not respond on a frequency related to the reader's interrogation signal.<ref name=Dobkin08>Daniel M. Dobkin, ''The RF in RFID: Passive UHF RFID In Practice'', Newnes 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-7506-8209-1}}, chapter 8</ref>\n\nAn [[Electronic Product Code]] (EPC) is one common type of data stored in a tag. When written into the tag by an RFID printer, the tag contains a 96-bit string of data.  The first eight bits are a header which identifies the version of the protocol. The next 28 bits identify the organization that manages the data for this tag; the organization number is assigned by the EPCGlobal consortium. The next 24 bits are an object class, identifying the kind of product; the last 36 bits are a unique serial number for a particular tag. These last two fields are set by the organization that issued the tag. Rather like a [[Uniform resource locator|URL]], the total electronic product code number can be used as a key into a global database to uniquely identify a particular product.<ref>John R. Vacca ''Computer and information security handbook'', Morgan Kaufmann, 2009 {{ISBN|0-12-374354-0}}, page 208</ref>\n\nOften more than one tag will respond to a tag reader, for example, many individual products with tags may be shipped in a common box or on a common pallet. Collision detection is important to allow reading of data.  Two different types of protocols are used to [[Singulation|\"singulate\"]] a particular tag, allowing its data to be read in the midst of many similar tags.  In a [[ALOHAnet|slotted Aloha]] system, the reader broadcasts an initialization command and a parameter that the tags individually use to pseudo-randomly delay their responses. When using an \"adaptive binary tree\" protocol, the reader sends an initialization symbol and then transmits one bit of ID data at a time; only tags with matching bits respond, and eventually only one tag matches the complete ID string.<ref>Bill Glover, Himanshu Bhatt ,''RFID essentials'',  O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|0-596-00944-5}}, pages 88\u201389</ref>\n[[File:RFID search environment.png|thumb|right|An example of a binary tree method of identifying an RFID tag]]\nBoth methods have drawbacks when used with many tags or with multiple overlapping readers.\n\n===Bulk reading===\n\"Bulk reading\" is a strategy for interrogating multiple tags at the same time, but lacks sufficient precision for inventory control.  A group of objects, all of them RFID tagged, are read completely from one single reader position at one time. Bulk reading is a possible use of [[High frequency|HF]] (ISO 18000-3), [[UHF]] (ISO 18000-6) and [[Super high frequency|SHF]] (ISO 18000-4) RFID tags. However, as tags respond strictly sequentially, the time needed for bulk reading grows linearly with the number of labels to be read. This means it takes at least twice as long to read twice as many labels. Due to collision effects, the time required is greater. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rfidjournal.com/site/faqs|title=Frequently Asked Questions - RFID Journal|website=www.rfidjournal.com|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\nA group of tags has to be illuminated by the interrogating signal just like a single tag. This is not a challenge concerning energy, but with respect to visibility; if any of the tags are shielded by other tags, they might not be sufficiently illuminated to return a sufficient response. The response conditions for inductively coupled [[High frequency|HF]] RFID tags and coil antennas in magnetic fields appear better than for UHF or SHF dipole fields, but then distance limits apply and may prevent success.\n\nUnder operational conditions, bulk reading is not reliable. Bulk reading can be a rough guide for logistics decisions, but due to a high proportion of reading failures, it is not (yet) suitable for inventory management. However, when a single RFID tag might be seen as not guaranteeing a proper read, a bunch of RFID tags, where at least one will respond, may be a safer approach for detecting a known grouping of objects. In this respect, bulk reading is a [[Fuzzy mathematics|fuzzy]] method for process support. From the perspective of cost and effect, bulk reading is not reported as an economical approach to secure process control in logistics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.com/files/SGTF_Report_Final_posted_v1.1.pdf|title=STGF Report}}</ref>\n\n===Miniaturization===\nRFID tags are easy to conceal or incorporate in other items.

It can be made out of copper, aluminum, or silver strips. The antenna can take different shapes: a spiral, a single [[dipole antenna]], two dipoles with one dipole perpendicular to another, or a folded dipole. The antenna length and geometry depends on the frequency at which the tag operates.<ref name=\"constr\"/> \n\nChip and antenna are embedded onto a thin plastic substrate of 100 to 200 nm, for example polymer, PVC, Polyethylenetherephtalate (PET), phenolics, polyesters, styrene, or paper via copper etching or [[hot stamping]].

The tag can be read if passed near a reader, even if it is covered by the object or not visible. The tag can be read inside a case, carton, box or other container, and unlike barcodes, RFID tags can be read hundreds at a time. Bar codes can only be read one at a time using current devices.\n\nIn 2011, the cost of passive tags started at US$0.09 each; special tags, meant to be mounted on metal or withstand gamma sterilization, can go up to US$5. Active tags for tracking containers, medical assets, or monitoring environmental conditions in data centers start at US$50 and can go up over US$100 each. Battery-Assisted Passive (BAP) tags are in the US$3\u201310 range and also have sensor capability like temperature and humidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eptls.org/rfid.html|title=EPTLS {{!}} The Electronic Product Tag & Labelling Scheme|website=eptls.org|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\nRFID can be used in a variety of applications,<ref>{{cite web|author=Martein Meints|date=June 2007|title= D3.7 A Structured Collection on Information and Literature on Technological and Usability Aspects of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), FIDIS deliverable 3(7)|url=http://www.fidis.net/resources/deliverables/hightechid/#c1782|accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Paolo Magrassi|author-link=Paolo Magrassi|year=2001|url=http://www.gartner.com|title=A World Of Smart Objects: The Role Of Auto Identification Technologies|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> such as:\n\n[[File:RFkey.jpg|thumb|Electronic key for RFID based lock system]]\n* Access management\n* Tracking of goods\n* Tracking of persons and animals<ref>Silva, S., Lowry, M., Macaya-Solis, C., Byatt, B., & Lucas, M.

Book tags can be read while books are in motion on a [[conveyor belt]], which reduces staff time. This can all be done by the borrowers themselves, reducing the need for library staff assistance. With portable readers, inventories could be done on a whole shelf of materials within seconds.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Radio Frequency Identification |first1=Rachel |last1=Wadham |journal=Library Mosaics |volume=14 |issue=5 |year=2003 |page=22}}</ref>\nHowever, as of 2008 this technology remained too costly for many smaller libraries, and the conversion period has been estimated at 11 months for an average-size library. A 2004 Dutch estimate was that a library which lends 100,000 books per year should plan on a cost of \u20ac50,000 (borrow- and return-stations: 12,500 each, detection porches 10,000 each; tags 0.36 each). RFID taking a large burden off staff could also mean that fewer staff will be needed, resulting in some of them getting laid off,<ref name=\"singh\"/> but that has so far not happened in North America where recent surveys have not returned a single library that cut staff because of adding RFID. In fact, library budgets are being reduced for personnel and increased for infrastructure, making it necessary for libraries to add automation to compensate for the reduced staff size. Also, the tasks that RFID takes over are largely not the primary tasks of librarians. A finding in the Netherlands is that borrowers are pleased with the fact that staff are now more available for answering questions.\n\nPrivacy concerns have been raised surrounding library use of RFID. Because some RFID tags can be read from up to {{convert|100|m}}, there is some concern over whether sensitive information could be collected from an unwilling source. However, library RFID tags do not contain any patron information,<ref>{{cite journal |first=David |last=Dorman |title=RFID Poses No Problem for Patron Privacy |journal=American Libraries |volume=34 |issue=11 | date=December 2003 |page=86 |url=http://www.ala.org/PrinterTemplate.cfm?section=archive&template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=50931}}</ref> and the tags used in the majority of libraries use a frequency only readable from approximately {{convert|10|ft}}.<ref name=\"butters\"/> Further, another non-library agency could potentially record the RFID tags of every person leaving the library without the library administrator's knowledge or consent. One simple option is to let the book transmit a code that has meaning only in conjunction with the library's database. Another possible enhancement would be to give each book a new code every time it is returned. In future, should readers become ubiquitous (and possibly networked), then stolen books could be traced even outside the library. Tag removal could be made difficult if the tags are so small that they fit invisibly inside a (random) page, possibly put there by the publisher.\n\n====Museums====\nRFID technologies are now also implemented in end-user applications in museums. An example was the custom-designed temporary research application, \"eXspot,\" at the [[Exploratorium]], a science museum in [[San Francisco, California]]. A visitor entering the museum received an RF Tag that could be carried as a card. The eXspot system enabled the visitor to receive information about specific exhibits. Aside from the exhibit information, the visitor could take photographs of themselves at the exhibit. It was also intended to allow the visitor to take data for later analysis. The collected information could be retrieved at home from a \"personalized\" website keyed to the RFID tag.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/1081992.1082021 |title=RFID enhances visitors' museum experience at the Exploratorium |year=2005 |last1=Hsi |first1=Sherry |last2=Fait |first2=Holly |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=60\u20135}}</ref>\n\n====Schools and universities====\nSchool authorities in the Japanese city of [[Osaka]] are now chipping children's clothing, backpacks, and student IDs in a primary school.<ref name=LAN>{{cite web|url=http://networks.silicon.com/lans/0,39024663,39122042,00.htm |title=Schoolchildren to be RFID-chipped |publisher=Networks.silicon.com |accessdate=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427003216/http://networks.silicon.com/lans/0,39024663,39122042,00.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2012 }}</ref> A school in [[Doncaster]], [[England]] is piloting a monitoring system designed to keep tabs on pupils by tracking radio chips in their uniforms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Christopher |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/22/kid_chipping_doncaster_go/ |title=Schoolkid chipping trial 'a success' |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2007-10-22 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref> [[List of further education colleges in England#S|St Charles Sixth Form College]] in west [[London]], England, started in 2008, uses an RFID card system to check in and out of the main gate, to both track attendance and prevent unauthorized entrance.

In the Philippines, some schools already use RFID in IDs for borrowing books. Gates in those particular schools have RFID ID scanners for buying items at a school shop and canteen. RFID is also used in the library, and to sign in and out for student and teacher attendance.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:2008 Nike+ Human Race in Taipei the ChampionChip.jpg|thumb|ChampionChip]]\n[[Transponder timing|RFID for timing races]] began in the early 1990s with pigeon racing, introduced by the company [[Deister Electronics]] in Germany. RFID can provide race start and end timings for individuals in large races where it is impossible to get accurate stopwatch readings for every entrant.\n\nIn the race, the racers wear tags that are read by antennas placed alongside the track or on mats across the track. UHF tags provide accurate readings with specially designed antennas. Rush error, lap count errors and accidents at start time are avoided since anyone can start and finish any time without being in a batch mode.\n[[File:Marathon Zeitnahme.JPG|thumb|left|[[jchip|J-Chip]] 8-channel receiver next to timing mat. The athlete wears a chip on a strap around his ankle. [https://web.archive.org/web/19961218232821/http://www.ironman.de/ Ironman Germany] 2007 in Frankfurt.]]\n\nThe design of chip+antenna controls the range from which it can be read. Short range compact chips are twist tied to the shoe or velcro strapped to the ankle. These need to be about 400mm from the mat and so give very good temporal resolution. Alternatively, a chip plus a very large (125mm square) antenna can be incorporated into the bib number worn on the athlete's chest at about 1.25m height.\n\nPassive and active RFID systems are used in off-road events such as [[Orienteering]], [[Enduro]] and [[Hare and Hound (Motorcycle Race)|Hare and Hounds]] racing. Riders have a transponder on their person, normally on their arm. When they complete a lap they swipe or touch the receiver which is connected to a computer and log their lap time.\n\nRFID is being adapted by many recruitment agencies which have a PET (physical endurance test) as their qualifying procedure, especially in cases where the candidate volumes may run into millions (Indian Railway recruitment cells, police and power sector).\n\nA number of [[ski resort]]s have adopted RFID tags to provide skiers hands-free access to [[ski lift]]s. Skiers do not have to take their passes out of their pockets. Ski jackets have a left pocket into which the chip+card fits. This nearly contacts the sensor unit on the left of the turnstile as the skier pushes through to the lift. These systems were based on high frequency (HF) at 13.56 megahertz. The bulk of ski areas in Europe, from Verbier to Chamonix, use these systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cliqology.com/2010/09/epic-mix-skiiers-and-snowboards-social-media-dream/ |title=Epic Mix \u2013 Skiiers [sic] and Snowboarders Social Media Dream |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://snowboard-mag.com/content/vail-resorts-launches-epic-mix-39814 |title=Vail Resorts Launches Epic Mix &#124; SNOWBOARD MAGAZINE |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904085254/http://snowboard-mag.com/content/vail-resorts-launches-epic-mix-39814 |accessdate=2020-03-01|archive-date=2010-09-04 }}</ref><ref>Kinsella, Bret.

Currently cameras stay focused on the [[quarterback]]; however, numerous plays are happening simultaneously on the field. The RFID chip will provide new insight into these simultaneous plays.<ref>{{cite web|title=How a pair of microchips could transform football into an intricate dance of data|url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/nfl-rfid-player-tracking-zebra-technologies/|website=DailyDot|accessdate=1 September 2015|date=2015-08-12}}</ref> The chip triangulates the player's position within six inches and will be used to digitally [[broadcast]] replays.

They may never completely replace barcodes, due in part to their higher cost and the advantage of multiple data sources on the same object. Also, unlike RFID labels, barcodes can be generated and distributed electronically, ''e.g.'' via e-mail or mobile phone, for printing or display by the recipient. An example is airline [[boarding passes]]. The new [[Electronic Product Code|EPC]], along with several other schemes, is widely available at reasonable cost.\n\nThe storage of data associated with tracking items will require many [[terabyte]]s. Filtering and categorizing RFID data is needed to create useful information. It is likely that goods will be tracked by the pallet using RFID tags, and at package level with Universal Product Code ([[Universal Product Code|UPC]]) or [[European Article Number|EAN]] from unique barcodes.\n\nThe unique identity is a mandatory requirement for RFID tags, despite special choice of the numbering scheme. RFID tag data capacity is large enough that each individual tag will have a unique code, while current bar codes are limited to a single type code for a particular product. The uniqueness of RFID tags means that a product may be tracked as it moves from location to location, finally ending up in the consumer's hands. This may help to combat theft and other forms of product loss. The tracing of products is an important feature that is well supported with RFID tags containing a unique identity of the tag and the serial number of the object. This may help companies cope with quality deficiencies and resulting recall campaigns, but also contributes to concern about tracking and profiling of consumers after the sale.\n\n===Waste management===\nRFID use has recently developed in the [[waste management]] industry. RFID tags are installed on waste collection carts, linking carts to the owner's account for easy billing and service verification. The tag is embedded into a garbage and recycle container, and the RFID reader is affixed to the garbage and recycle trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waste360.com/route-optimization/rfid-still-early-stages-adoption-waste-industry|title=RFID Still In Early Stages of Adoption by Waste Industry|last=|first=|date=2016-08-10|website=|access-date=}}</ref> RFID also measures a customer's set-out rate and provides insight as to the number of carts serviced by each waste collection vehicle. This RFID process replaces traditional \"[[pay as you throw]]\" (PAYT) [[municipal solid waste]] usage-pricing models.\n\n===Telemetry===\nActive RFID tags have the potential to function as low-cost remote sensors that broadcast [[telemetry]] back to a base station. Applications of tagometry data could include sensing of road conditions by implanted [[Bluetooth low energy beacon|beacons]], weather reports, and noise level monitoring.<ref>{{ISSN search link|0001-0782}}</ref>\n\nPassive RFID tags can also report sensor data. For example, the [[Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform]] is a passive tag that reports temperature, acceleration and capacitance to commercial Gen2 RFID readers.\n\nIt is possible that active or battery-assisted passive (BAP) RFID tags could broadcast a signal to an in-store receiver to determine whether the RFID tag (product) is in the store.\n\n==Regulation and standardization==\nTo avoid injuries to humans and animals RF transmission needs to be controlled.<ref name=\"regs\">{{Cite web |url=https://rfid4u.com/rfid-basics-resources/basics-rfid-regulations/ |title=RFID Regulations |date=n.d |website=RFID4U |language=en-US |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\nA number of organizations have set standards for RFID, including the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), [[ASTM International]], the [[DASH7]] Alliance and [[EPCglobal]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nSeveral specific industries also have set guidelines, including the Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) for tracking IT Assets with RFID, the Computer Technology Industry Association [[CompTIA]] for certifying RFID engineers, and the International Airlines Transport Association [[IATA]] for luggage in airports.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nEvery country can set its own rules for [[frequency allocation]] for RFID tags, and not all radio bands are available in all countries.

These standards include conformance, performance and interoperability tests.\n\n===EPC Gen2===\nEPC Gen2 is short for ''EPCglobal UHF Class 1 Generation 2''.\n\n[[EPCglobal]], a joint venture between [[GS1]] and GS1 US, is working on international standards for the use of mostly passive RFID and the [[Electronic Product Code]] (EPC) in the identification of many items in the [[supply chain]] for companies worldwide.\n\nOne of the missions of EPCglobal was to simplify the Babel of protocols prevalent in the RFID world in the 1990s. Two tag air interfaces (the protocol for exchanging information between a tag and a reader) were defined (but not ratified) by EPCglobal prior to 2003. These protocols, commonly known as Class 0 and Class 1, saw significant commercial implementation in 2002\u20132005.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://rfid4u.com/rfid-basics-resources/how-to-select-a-correct-rfid-tag-standards-mandates/ |title = RFID Standards and Mandates}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the Hardware Action Group created a new protocol, the Class 1 Generation 2 interface, which addressed a number of problems that had been experienced with Class 0 and Class 1 tags. The EPC Gen2 standard was approved in December 2004. This was approved after a contention from [[Intermec]] that the standard may infringe a number of their RFID-related patents. It was decided that the standard itself does not infringe their patents, making the standard royalty free.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Mark|last=Roberti|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/1293 |title= EPCglobal Ratifies Gen 2 Standard |publisher=RFID Journal |date=2004-12-16|accessdate = 2011-07-07}}</ref> The EPC Gen2 standard was adopted with minor modifications as ISO 18000-6C in 2006.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Mary|last=Catherine O'Connor|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/2481/1/1 |title= Gen 2 EPC Protocol Approved as ISO 18000-6C |publisher=RFID Journal |date=2004-07-12|accessdate = 2011-07-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the lowest cost of Gen2 EPC inlay was offered by the now-defunct company SmartCode, at a price of $0.05 apiece in volumes of 100 million or more.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Mark|last=Roberti|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/2295/1/128/ |title= A 5-Cent Breakthrough |publisher=RFID Journal |date=2006-05-06|accessdate = 2007-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Problems and concerns==\n\n===Data flooding===\nNot every successful reading of a tag (an observation) is useful for business purposes. A large amount of data may be generated that is not useful for managing inventory or other applications. For example, a customer moving a product from one shelf to another, or a pallet load of articles that passes several readers while being moved in a warehouse, are events that do not produce data that are meaningful to an inventory control system.<ref>Bill Glover, Himanshu Bhatt, ''RFID Essentials'', O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|0-596-00944-5}} page 43</ref>\n\nEvent filtering is required to reduce this data inflow to a meaningful depiction of moving goods passing a threshold. Various concepts{{Examples|date=June 2010}} have been designed, mainly offered as ''[[middleware]]'' performing the filtering from noisy and redundant raw data to significant processed data.\n\n===Global standardization===\nThe frequencies used for UHF RFID in the USA are as of 2007 incompatible with those of Europe or Japan. Furthermore, no emerging standard has yet become as universal as the [[barcode]].<ref>{{cite news|date = 7 June 2007|title = Radio Silence|url = http://economist.com/printedition/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9249278|newspaper = The Economist}}</ref> To address international trade concerns, it is necessary to use a tag that is operational within all of the international frequency domains.\n\n===Security concerns===\nA primary RFID security concern is the illicit tracking of RFID tags. Tags, which are world-readable, pose a risk to both personal location privacy and corporate/military security. Such concerns have been raised with respect to the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s recent adoption of RFID tags for [[supply chain management]].<ref>{{cite web|work = Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)|title = What's New|date = 4 April 2007|url = http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/index.htm|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060228101133/http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/index.htm|archivedate = 28 February 2006}}</ref> More generally, privacy organizations have expressed concerns in the context of ongoing efforts to embed electronic product code (EPC) RFID tags in consumer products. This is mostly as result of the fact that RFID tags can be read, and legitimate transactions with readers can be eavesdropped, from non-trivial distances. RFID used in access control, payment and eID (e-passport) systems operate at a shorter range than EPC RFID systems but are also vulnerable to [[RFID skimming|skimming]] and eavesdropping, albeit at shorter distance.<ref name=Hancke>{{cite journal|last=Hancke|first=Gerhard P|title=Practical eavesdropping and skimming attacks on high-frequency RFID tokens|journal=Journal of Computer Security|year=2011|volume=19|issue=2|pages=259\u2013288|doi=10.3233/JCS-2010-0407|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/xx855446h2kh84r2/|accessdate=10 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527141257/http://iospress.metapress.com/content/xx855446h2kh84r2/|archivedate=27 May 2016|citeseerx=10.1.1.169.9341}}</ref>\n\nA second method of prevention is by using cryptography. [[Rolling code]]s and [[challenge-response authentication]] (CRA) are commonly used to foil monitor-repetition of the messages between the tag and reader; as any messages that have been recorded would prove to be unsuccessful on repeat transmission. Rolling codes rely upon the tag's id being changed after each interrogation, while CRA uses software to ask for a [[cryptographic]]ally coded response from the tag. The protocols used during CRA can be [[symmetric key cryptography|symmetric]], or may use [[public key cryptography]].<ref name=RFIDHbook1>{{cite book|last=Ilyas|first=edited by Syed Ahson, Mohammad|title=RFID handbook : applications, technology, security, and privacy|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9781420054996|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4aCyZnq0cwC&pg=PA478&lpg=PA478&dq=Rather,+the+reader+issues+a+challenge+to+the+tag,+which+responds+with+a+result+computed+using+a+cryptographic+circuit+keyed+with+some+secret+value&source=bl&ots=nL2ORy_M-7&sig=mo9QSZyOeEEwnO9xqgAAg5cnx08&hl=en&sa=X&ei=82YhUIjwGeWg0QXp6oDwBQ&ved=0CGMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Rather%2C%20the%20reader%20issues%20a%20challenge%20to%20the%20tag%2C%20which%20responds%20with%20a%20result%20computed%20using%20a%20cryptographic%20circuit%20keyed%20with%20some%20secret%20value&f=false|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|accessdate=7 August 2012|page=478|chapter=26.5}}</ref>\n\nUnauthorized reading of RFID tags presents a risk to privacy and to business secrecy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vde-verlag.de/proceedings-en/453168007.html|title=Business risks from naive use of RFID in tracking, tracing and logistics - Conference papers - VDE Publishing House|website=www.vde-verlag.de|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Unauthorized readers can potentially use RFID information to identify or track packages, consumers, carriers, or the contents of a package.<ref name=RFIDHbook1/> Several prototype systems are being developed to combat unauthorized reading, including RFID signal interruption,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2115|title = RFID Privacy and Security|publisher = RSA Laboratories|accessdate = 2013-09-22|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061218210709/http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2115|archivedate = 2006-12-18}}</ref> as well as the possibility of legislation, and 700 scientific papers have been published on this matter since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://avoine.net/rfid/|title = RFID Security and Privacy Lounge|publisher=Avoine.net|accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref> There are also concerns that the database structure of [[Object Naming Service]] may be susceptible to infiltration, similar to [[denial-of-service attack]]s, after the EPCglobal Network ONS root servers were shown to be vulnerable.<ref>{{cite web|first=Adi|last=Tedjasaputra|url=http://www.rfid-asia.info/2007/02/putting-rfid-network-security-in.htm|title=Putting RFID Network Security in Perspective|publisher=RFID Asia|date=2006-12-11|accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>\n\n===Health===\nMicrochip\u2013induced tumors have been noted during animal trials.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Microchip-induced tumors in laboratory rodents and dogs: A review of the literature 1990\u20132006 |pages=337\u2013349 |last=Albrecht |first=Katherine |year=2010 |publisher=IEEE |doi= 10.1109/ISTAS.2010.5514622|isbn=978-1-4244-7777-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090800997_pf.html |title=Chip Implants Linked to Animal Tumors |last=Lewan |first=Todd |newspaper=Washington Post |date=8 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Shielding===\n{{Further information|Aluminium foil#Electromagnetic shielding}}\nIn an effort to prevent the passive \u201c[[RFID skimming|skimming]]\u201d of RFID-enabled cards or passports, the U.S. [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) issued a set of test procedures for evaluating electromagnetically opaque sleeves.<ref>{{cite web|title = Electromagnetically Opaque Sleeve Test Procedure version 3.0.0|publisher = GSA|url = http://fips201ep.cio.gov/documents/Electromagnetically%20Opaque%20Sleeve_Test%20Procedure_v3.0.0.pdf}}</ref> For shielding products to be in compliance with FIPS-201 guidelines, they must meet or exceed this published standard;

[[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] Ultra-HighFID tags (pallets and cartons) are difficult to read when placed within a few millimetres of a metal surface, although their read range is actually increased when they are spaced 2\u20134&nbsp;cm from a metal surface due to positive reinforcement of the reflected wave and the incident wave at the tag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.falkensecurenetworks.com/PDFs/A_Primer_on_RFID.pdf|title=A Primer on RFID}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n{{criticism section|date=June 2012}}\n[[Image:Stoprfid-logo.svg|thumb|Logo of the anti-RFID campaign by German privacy group [[digitalcourage]] (formerly FoeBuD)]]\n\n===Privacy===\n\nThe use of RFID has engendered considerable controversy and even product [[boycott]]s by [[consumer privacy]] advocates. Consumer privacy experts [[Katherine Albrecht]] and [[Liz McIntyre (writer)|Liz McIntyre]] are two prominent critics of the \"spychip\" technology. The two main privacy concerns regarding RFID are:\n* Since the owner of an item will not necessarily be aware of the presence of an RFID tag and the tag can be read at a distance without the knowledge of the individual, it becomes possible to gather sensitive data about an individual without consent.\n* If a tagged item is paid for by credit card or in conjunction with use of a [[loyalty card]], then it would be possible to indirectly deduce the identity of the purchaser by reading the globally unique ID of that item (contained in the RFID tag). This is only true if the person doing the watching also had access to the loyalty card data and the credit card data, and the person with the equipment knows where the purchaser is going to be.\n\nMost concerns revolve around the fact that RFID tags affixed to products remain functional even after the products have been purchased and taken home and thus can be used for [[surveillance]] and other purposes unrelated to their supply chain inventory functions.<ref>Markus Hansen, Sebastian Meissner: [https://tepin.aiki.de/blog/uploads/2007-hansen-meissner-tracking-epc-rfid-ifip.pdf Identification and Tracking of Individuals and Social Networks using the Electronic Product Code on RFID Tags], IFIP Summer School, Karlstad, 2007, [https://tepin.aiki.de/blog/uploads/20070807-ifip-hansen-meissner-tracking-rfid-epc.pdf Slides].</ref>\n\nThe RFID Network argued that these fears are unfounded in the first episode of their syndicated cable TV series by letting RF engineers demonstrate how RFID works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://0y3v.errandrunner.org/onbqfGf|title=How to read data from rfid reader|website=0y3v.errandrunner.org|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref> They provided images of RF engineers driving an RFID-enabled van around a building and trying to take an inventory of items inside. They discussed satellite tracking of a passive RFID tag, which is surprising since the maximum range is under 200m.\n\nThe concerns raised by the above may be addressed in part by use of the [[Clipped Tag]]. The Clipped Tag is an RFID tag designed to increase consumer privacy. The Clipped Tag has been suggested by [[IBM]] researchers [[Paul Moskowitz]] and Guenter Karjoth. After the point of sale, a consumer may tear off a portion of the tag. This allows the transformation of a long-range tag into a proximity tag that still may be read, but only at short range&nbsp;\u2013 less than a few inches or centimeters. The modification of the tag may be confirmed visually. The tag may still be used later for returns, recalls, or recycling.\n\nHowever, read range is a function of both the reader and the tag itself. Improvements in technology may increase read ranges for tags. Tags may be read at longer ranges than they are designed for by increasing reader power. The limit on read distance then becomes the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal reflected from the tag back to the reader. Researchers at two security conferences have demonstrated that passive Ultra-HighFID tags normally read at ranges of up to 30 feet, can be read at ranges of 50 to 69 feet using suitable equipment.<ref>[http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/000798.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040106/http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/000798.html|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2005/07/_defcon_rfid_wo.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207081350/http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2005/07/_defcon_rfid_wo.html|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2004 privacy advocates from CASPIAN and the German privacy group [[digitalcourage|FoeBuD]] were invited to the METRO Future Store in [[Germany]], where an RFID pilot project was implemented.

The chip is flip-chip assembled on the Al/PET flexible substrate through ACA hot-press process. After bonding process, the shear strength of the tag inlay can be measured using the bond tester. The shear strength test principle is based on the solder ball shear test standard,<ref>\nJEDEC Standard JESD22-B117A.\n[\" Solder Ball Shear \"].\nJEDEC Solid State Technology Association.\n2006.\n</ref>  as shown in Fig.1(b). A rigid clamping device is used to fix one side of the substrate, and the vacuum plate is used to absorb the bottom of the sample. The blade is pushed horizontally from one side. The maximum shear force for each joint, which finally separates the chip from the substrate, is recorded, as shown in Fig.1(c). <ref>\nG.

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

name {{nihongo|Jack|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Jakku}}, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the main protagonists of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series of video games. The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

It consists of eight [[feature film]]s and additional media.\n\nIn 2003, Wan and Whannell made a [[Saw (2003 film)|short film]] to help [[Sales presentation|pitch]] a potential [[feature film]] concept. Their pitch was ultimately successful, and in 2004, [[Saw (2004 film)|the first installment]] of what would become the feature film franchise debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was released theatrically that October, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The sequels were directed by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], [[David Hackl]], and [[Kevin Greutert]], and were written by Wan, Whannell, Bousman, [[Patrick Melton]], and [[Marcus Dunstan]], and were released subsequently every October, on the Friday before [[Halloween]], between 2004 and 2010. Both of the creators remained with the franchise as [[executive producer]]s.\n\nOn July 22, 2010, producer [[Mark Burg]] confirmed that the seventh film, ''[[Saw 3D]]'', is the final installment of the series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=July 22, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3dlvkb|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, Lionsgate reportedly expressed interest in continuing the franchise with a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]].<ref name=\"Lionsgate Remaking Saw\">{{cite web|title=Lionsgate Remaking Saw?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/58024/lionsgate-remaking-saw|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> In November 2013, it was reported that they were actively developing a sequel.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\">{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Lionsgate Is Actively Developing Next 'Saw'|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3262916/exclusive-lionsgate-is-actively-developing-next-saw/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref> An eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', was eventually released in October 2017. In 2019, a ninth film was announced, ''[[Spiral (2020 film)|Spiral]]'', with comedian and actor [[Chris Rock]] attached to star, produce, and co-write.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3561412/saw-reimagined-chris-rock-darren-bousman-returning-direct/|title=\u2018SAW\u2019 Being Reimagined by Chris Rock with Darren Bousman Returning to Direct!|first=Brad|last=Miska|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=May 16, 2019|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe franchise primarily revolves around [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]], also called the \"Jigsaw Killer\" or simply \"Jigsaw\". He was introduced briefly in ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and developed in more detail in ''[[Saw II]]'' and the subsequent films. Rather than killing his [[List of Saw characters|victims]] outright, Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls \"tests\" or \"games\" to test their will to live through physical or psychological torture and believes that if they survive, they will be \"rehabilitated\". Despite the fact that John was murdered in ''[[Saw III]]'', the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].\n\nThe franchise grossed more than {{US$|1 billion|long=no|link=yes}} from [[box office]] and retail sales by 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lidz|first=Franz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/movies/25lidz.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&hpw|title=Limbs Pile Up, and Money, Too|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=October 21, 2009|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> and the films have collectively grossed over {{US$|976 million|long=no}} at the worldwide box office as of 2018.

Jill lost her unborn baby, Gideon, due to the unwitting actions of a drug addict named [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil]], who fled the scene. ''[[Saw VI]]'' later showed that another drug addict, [[Amanda Young]], also had an unintentional role in the death of Gideon. John grieved over the loss of his child and distanced himself from his friends and his wife.\n\nJohn and Jill eventually drifted apart and divorced. After this turn of events, John found himself trapped by his own complacency until he was diagnosed with inoperable [[cancer]]. Extremely bitter over his squandered life and the loss of his unborn son, John began observing the lives of others and became even more depressed as he saw those around him squandering the gift of life that he had just been denied. John went to a man named William Easton to get money for a cancer treatment, but was denied. Flashbacks from ''[[Saw II]]'' show that, after surviving a [[suicide]] attempt where he drove his car off a cliff, John was \"reborn\", and nurtured the idea that the only way for someone to change is for them to change themselves. Then, in ''[[Saw IV]]'' flashbacks, he designed the first trap and test for Cecil and decided to use the rest of his existence to design more of these \"tests\" or \"games\" as a form of \"instant rehabilitation\" that would change the world, \"one person at a time\". John was soon given the name \"The Jigsaw Killer\" (or \"Jigsaw\"), because he removed a puzzle-piece-shaped chunk of flesh from those who did not escape his traps. John stated that this name was given to him by the media, and that the cut piece of flesh was meant to represent that these victims were each missing something\u2014what he called the \"survival instinct\".\n\nFew of Jigsaw's victims can survive his brutal mechanical traps, which are often [[irony|ironically]] [[symbol]]ic representations of the problems in the victim's life and require them to undergo severe physical and psychological [[torture]] to escape.\n\nIn ''[[Saw V]]'', police lieutenant [[Mark Hoffman]]'s ties with John are revealed in a series of flashbacks during the film. Hoffman's sister is murdered by her boyfriend, [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]. Seth is arrested; however, a technicality allowed him to be released, and Hoffman, feeling Seth had not served the full capacity of his sentence, kills him in an inescapable trap designed to look like one of Jigsaw's, laying the blame on him. Jigsaw then kidnaps Hoffman and blackmails him into becoming his apprentice in his \"rehabilitation\" methods, though eventually Hoffman would become a willing apprentice, helping set up John's tests from almost the beginning, starting with [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]'s trap.\n\nThe first surviving victim, [[Amanda Young]], views Jigsaw as a hero who ultimately changed her life for the better. Amanda, upon Jigsaw's request, agrees to become his [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]]. After Amanda survives, John shows Jill her rehabilitation, and Jill then becomes knowledgeable of John's traps and becomes somewhat of an accomplice as well.\n\nIn ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', Jigsaw has chained the man who diagnosed his cancer, [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], in a dilapidated industrial washroom with [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]], a photographer who has been tailing the doctor due to belief he is cheating on his wife. Lawrence has instructions to kill Adam by six o'clock, or else his wife and daughter will be killed. Flashbacks show detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who suspect Lawrence of being Jigsaw, following a trail of clues from other Jigsaw traps. Sing's death from a shotgun trap after saving a victim named Jeff causes Tapp to obsess over catching Jigsaw. Later on, he chases [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]], who monitors Adam and Lawrence's tests, and gets shot in the chest. Eventually, Lawrence saws off his own foot in order to escape, leaving Adam in the bathroom while Lawrence goes to try to save his family and get help for Adam. It is later seen in ''Saw 3D'' that Lawrence found a steaming hot pipe and cauterized his wound, stopping the bleeding and ultimately surviving the trap. John catches up with Lawrence and makes him his next apprentice, a fact which he hides from his other accomplices. Flashbacks from ''Saw III'' show that Amanda kidnapped Adam and later returned to suffocate him as an act of \"mercy killing\".\n\n[[File:Saw-cast.jpg|thumb|left|Central actors of the series. From top-left to bottom-right: Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Cary Elwes, Costas Mandylor, Danny Glover, and Betsy Russell.|250px]]\n''[[Saw II]]'' begins with the police tracking a severely weakened Jigsaw to his lair. However, another test is in place, as he and Amanda have kidnapped the son of Detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]] and trapped him and a group of seven convicts, previously framed by Eric, in a house that is slowly being filled with [[Sarin|sarin gas]], with Amanda Young among them. He will trade [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel Matthews]]' life for Eric's time, conversing with him until the game is concluded. Eric loses his patience and assaults Jigsaw, forcing him to take him to the house, only to discover that the video feed from inside the house had been pre-recorded, the events actually taking place much earlier; Eric's son was locked in a safe in Jigsaw's warehouse, being kept alive with an oxygen tank. Eric is knocked unconscious by a masked figure and wakes up imprisoned in the bathroom from ''Saw'', which is part of the foundation of the house. Amanda reveals herself to Eric as Jigsaw's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e before leaving him to die. In a flashback from ''Saw III'', Eric manages to escape the bathroom by breaking his foot. He confronts and beats Amanda, demanding to know where his son is. Amanda fights him off and leaves him for dead. A flashback from ''Saw IV'' shows Hoffman later dragging Eric to a prison cell, keeping him alive for a future game.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw III]]'' and ''[[Saw IV]]'' occur concurrently. ''Saw III'' begins with Jigsaw, weakened and near death, confined to a makeshift hospital bed. Amanda has taken over his work, designing traps of her own; however, these traps are inescapable, as Amanda is convinced that Jigsaw's traps have no effect and that people don't change. A [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|kidnapped doctor]] is forced to keep Jigsaw alive while another test is performed on [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]], a man obsessed with vengeance against the drunk driver who killed his son. Jigsaw, unwilling to allow a murderer to continue his legacy, designs a test for Amanda as well; she ultimately fails, and it results in the deaths of both Jigsaw and Amanda. ''Saw IV'', meanwhile, revolves around tests meant for [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Daniel Rigg]], which are overseen by Hoffman. Rigg fails his test, resulting in the death of Eric Matthews. Rigg is left to bleed to death by Hoffman, who later discovers the bodies of Jigsaw and Amanda. When an [[autopsy]] is performed on Jigsaw, a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] coated in wax is found in his [[stomach]]; the tape informs Hoffman that he is wrong to think that it is all over just because Jigsaw is dead, and he should not expect to go untested.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw V]]'' show one of Hoffman's first solo tests, five people connected by different roles in a disastrous fire that killed several others are put into four interconnected tests of teamwork, killing off one person in each trap. The two remaining test subjects realize at the final trap that each previous trap was meant to be completed by each of the five people doing a small part, rather than killing one person per trap. With this knowledge, the two work together and barely manage to escape. They are found alive by Special Agent Erikson. Meanwhile, Hoffman has set up FBI Agent [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]] to appear to be Jigsaw's accomplice, while Strahm pursues Hoffman and is eventually killed due to his inability to follow Hoffman's rules, leaving Hoffman free to continue Jigsaw's \"work\".\n\n''[[Saw VI]]'' begins with Hoffman setting up a game as per John's instructions left in a box for Jill during ''Saw V''. This game centers on insurance executive named [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] who oversees a team responsible for rejecting two-thirds of all insurance claims. As William progresses through four tests, he saves as many people as he can and learns the error of his choice to reject so many policies, which inherently \"kill\" the rejected. His last test is revealed to be a test of forgiveness by the family of [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold Abbott]], a man to whom William rejected a policy in the past, whose son ultimately chooses to kill William using [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Meanwhile, Agent Erickson and the-previously-thought-to-be-dead agent [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]] search for Agent Strahm with the assistance of Hoffman. Upon finding irregularities in previous murder scenes, Perez and Erickson discover Hoffman's identity, but are killed by him before they can go public with his involvement. Hoffman travels back to the site of William's tests in which Jill attacks him to obey John's final request. She leaves Hoffman in a new Reverse Beartrap left behind by John, though does not leave a key for him to free himself. He is able to manipulate the trap and escapes wounded.\n\n''[[Saw 3D]]'' picks up with Jill and Hoffman battling for control of Jigsaw's legacy. As Jill enters protective custody and makes Hoffman's true identity public, Hoffman sets up a new game involving [[skinhead]]s to find a way to Jill. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen, a fraud who has written a book about escaping a Jigsaw trap he never experienced, is captured and forced to confront people who knew that he lied about being in a trap. Three of Dagen's friends die and his test concludes with him being forced to reenact the trap that he claimed to have survived before. He fails, which results in the death of his wife. Meanwhile, Hoffman has posed as a corpse and killed several officers to infiltrate the police station. He finds and kills Jill using the Reverse Beartrap. Hoffman attempts to leave town but is captured by Lawrence Gordon and his accomplices, then placed in the bathroom from the first film. Jigsaw is revealed to have aided Lawrence after his game and, in return, Lawrence helped him with subsequent traps. Hoffman is then left shackled in the bathroom to die.\n\n''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'' begins with a new game presumably being conducted 10 years after the events of John Kramer's death in ''Saw III''. Five people are forced to undergo a series of tests in an abandoned barn, led by John. In the first test, one of the subjects is seemingly killed by buzzsaws after remaining unconscious during instruction. Most of the remaining subjects are killed throughout the game, until only two, Anna and the heavily wounded Ryan, are left. The two of them are drugged and wake up chained on opposite sides of a room. John is revealed to be in the room with them, and he provides them with a shotgun, explaining it is the \"key to their freedom\", before leaving them to escape. Anna attempts to kill Ryan with the shotgun, but the weapon was rigged to backfire, killing her and leaving Ryan to die. Meanwhile, police forces led by Detective Halloran and aided by medical forensic scientists Logan Nelson and Eleanor Bonneville attempt to discover the location and participants in the game, while also struggling to understand how the deceased John could be behind it all. Logan and Eleanor find the location of the game at an abandoned barn owned by Jill Tuck, with Halloran pursuing them, believing they are behind the most recent games. Eleanor is shown escaping, and Logan and Halloran are placed in a room with collars lined with laser cutters around their neck. They are told by John that they must confess their sins to survive. Logan is presumably killed after admitting his error delayed John's diagnosis. Halloran then confesses he let various guilty convicts walk free, deactivating his collar. However, Logan rises from the ground, revealing his collar was harmless. He explains that the game in the barn was the very first game that took place ten years earlier, and that the bodies found by the team were criminals that Halloran let walk free, who Logan placed into an identical game of his own. He reveals he was the participant in the first game who was presumably killed by the buzzsaws, but that John did not believe Logan should die simply because his \"crime\" was merely an accident, and rescued him as a result. John took Logan under his wing, and Logan aided John in all the various traps throughout the series, making him John's very first apprentice. Logan reactivates Halloran's collar, slicing his head open, before slamming the door shut.\n\n===Recurring elements===\n'''Billy'''\n{{Main|Billy the Puppet}}\nBilly is a puppet resembling a [[Ventriloquism#Ventriloquist.27s dummy|ventriloquist's dummy]], sometimes seen riding a [[tricycle]], that has appeared throughout the films and has become a type of [[mascot]] for the series. It is used by the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] to communicate with his victims by delivering televised messages or occasionally in person to describe details of the sadistic traps and the means by which the victims could survive. Viewers have sometimes incorrectly identified the puppet itself as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]], because of its presence and connection to the killer.\n\nAge and use of the puppet over the course of the films necessitated its reconstruction. According to [[James Wan|Wan]], the original puppet's face for ''Saw'' involved clay, [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]], and black ping-pong balls with the irises painted in for the eyes, but in later films more sophisticated construction included [[Water jet cutter|waterjet-cut]] foam for the body and remote-controlled [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronics]].<ref name=\"GreggJoBlopt2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/saw-2-diary-2|title=Saw 2: Dairy #2|last=Hoffman|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Hoffman|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|page=2|date=May 13, 2005|access-date=August 24, 2011<!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AcAwHaK|archive-date=August 24, 2011-->}}</ref>\n\nThe endurance and popularity of the franchise has resulted in the production of ''Billy'' merchandise, as well as references in other media and its use in promotions for the films.\n\n'''\"Hello Zepp\"'''\n{{Main|Hello Zepp}}\n\n\"Hello Zepp\" is a piece of instrumental music that was originally composed by [[Charlie Clouser]] for the first film in the series. In ''Saw'', the implied villain, Zep Hindle, is revealed to actually be a victim of the Jigsaw Killer. (The character's name in the script is spelled \"Zep\", whereas the music titles are spelled \"Zepp\".)<ref>[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Saw.html ''Saw'' script] on IMSDb. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref><ref>[http://saw.ugo.com/?cur=saw-i-soundtrack ''Saw'' track listing] on [[UGO Networks|UGO]]. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref> As the series continued, the piece was reused in every film as a [[leitmotif]], often being renamed and remixed to accommodate the changing situations and characters. The music was used in every ''Saw'' ending, usually during the revealing of plot revelations and twists which ''Saw'' films often use and it serves as the main theme tune for the whole films.\n\n'''Traps'''<br />\nAn important component of each film is the variety of (usually mechanical in form) traps Jigsaw and his apprentices use on their captives to communicate his message.\n\nAccording to [[David Hackl]], all of the traps are real objects, and not [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. They were designed to look horrific but ultimately be safe for the actors in them. Writer [[Marcus Dunstan]] said: \"It's built to function there on the day\", and added: \"It works. So if there's a scalping chair\u2014there really was a chair with working gears to grind and pull your scalp back.\" The most potentially dangerous item was a \"water box\" used in ''[[Saw V]]'', in which one of the actors ([[Scott Patterson]], as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]]) had to keep his head submerged as long as possible. Another element of the traps is that [[David Hackl|Hackl]] desired a specific look of rust and menace, but he also wanted them to have a type of beauty about them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/103/1039913p1.html|title=The Anatomy of a Trap: Saw|date=October 29, 2009|access-date=July 22, 2010|last=Monfette|first=Christopher|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3t1zc2|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\n[[File:Saw Guinness award cropped.jpg|thumb|The ''Saw'' series was placed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the \"Most Successful Horror Franchise\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/23/film-saw-idUSN2215375420100723|title=\"Saw\" movie franchise to get Guinness world record|last=Kit|first=Zorianna|work=[[Reuters]]|date=July 22, 2010|access-date=September 21, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61rOhewtb|archive-date=September 21, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Pictured here is director [[Kevin Greutert]] receiving the award at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2010 Comic-Con]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/content/printVersion/61775/|title=Splattered: An Interview with James Wan Talking torture, politics and not-so-sweet revenge|last=Foundas|first=Scott|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=August 30, 2011|access-date=August 19, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/614BzHXY1|archive-date=August 19, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\n''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' grossed $18.2 million its opening weekend and had become [[Lionsgate]]'s second-best opening, after ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''{{'s}} {{nowrap|$23.9 million}} (2004).<ref name=\"BOMOpening\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1540&p=.htm|title='Ray,' 'Saw' See Robust Bows|last=Gray|first=Brandon|work=Box Office Mojo|publisher=Amazon.com|date=November 1, 2004|access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref> ''Saw'' went on to gross {{nowrap|$103 million}} worldwide,<ref name=\"SawBOM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=saw.htm|title=Saw (2004)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=August 16, 2011}}</ref> and is the second-lowest-grossing film in the series after ''[[Saw VI]]''.<ref name=\"Saw.vs\">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/showdowns/chart/?id=sawvs.htm|title='Saw' Vs.

It consists of eight [[feature film]]s and additional media.\n\nIn 2003, Wan and Whannell made a [[Saw (2003 film)|short film]] to help [[Sales presentation|pitch]] a potential [[feature film]] concept. Their pitch was ultimately successful, and in 2004, [[Saw (2004 film)|the first installment]] of what would become the feature film franchise debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was released theatrically that October, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The sequels were directed by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], [[David Hackl]], and [[Kevin Greutert]], and were written by Wan, Whannell, Bousman, [[Patrick Melton]], and [[Marcus Dunstan]], and were released subsequently every October, on the Friday before [[Halloween]], between 2004 and 2010. Both of the creators remained with the franchise as [[executive producer]]s.\n\nOn July 22, 2010, producer [[Mark Burg]] confirmed that the seventh film, ''[[Saw 3D]]'', is the final installment of the series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=July 22, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3dlvkb|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, Lionsgate reportedly expressed interest in continuing the franchise with a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]].<ref name=\"Lionsgate Remaking Saw\">{{cite web|title=Lionsgate Remaking Saw?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/58024/lionsgate-remaking-saw|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> In November 2013, it was reported that they were actively developing a sequel.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\">{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Lionsgate Is Actively Developing Next 'Saw'|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3262916/exclusive-lionsgate-is-actively-developing-next-saw/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref> An eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', was eventually released in October 2017. In 2019, a ninth film was announced, ''[[Spiral (2020 film)|Spiral]]'', with comedian and actor [[Chris Rock]] attached to star, produce, and co-write.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3561412/saw-reimagined-chris-rock-darren-bousman-returning-direct/|title=\u2018SAW\u2019 Being Reimagined by Chris Rock with Darren Bousman Returning to Direct!|first=Brad|last=Miska|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=May 16, 2019|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe franchise primarily revolves around [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]], also called the \"Jigsaw Killer\" or simply \"Jigsaw\". He was introduced briefly in ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and developed in more detail in ''[[Saw II]]'' and the subsequent films. Rather than killing his [[List of Saw characters|victims]] outright, Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls \"tests\" or \"games\" to test their will to live through physical or psychological torture and believes that if they survive, they will be \"rehabilitated\". Despite the fact that John was murdered in ''[[Saw III]]'', the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].\n\nThe franchise grossed more than {{US$|1 billion|long=no|link=yes}} from [[box office]] and retail sales by 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lidz|first=Franz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/movies/25lidz.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&hpw|title=Limbs Pile Up, and Money, Too|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=October 21, 2009|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> and the films have collectively grossed over {{US$|976 million|long=no}} at the worldwide box office as of 2018. The film series as a whole has received mostly mixed to negative reviews by critics, but has been a financial success at the box office and is one of the highest-grossing horror film franchises of all time.

Jill lost her unborn baby, Gideon, due to the unwitting actions of a drug addict named [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil]], who fled the scene. ''[[Saw VI]]'' later showed that another drug addict, [[Amanda Young]], also had an unintentional role in the death of Gideon. John grieved over the loss of his child and distanced himself from his friends and his wife.\n\nJohn and Jill eventually drifted apart and divorced. After this turn of events, John found himself trapped by his own complacency until he was diagnosed with inoperable [[cancer]]. Extremely bitter over his squandered life and the loss of his unborn son, John began observing the lives of others and became even more depressed as he saw those around him squandering the gift of life that he had just been denied. John went to a man named William Easton to get money for a cancer treatment, but was denied. Flashbacks from ''[[Saw II]]'' show that, after surviving a [[suicide]] attempt where he drove his car off a cliff, John was \"reborn\", and nurtured the idea that the only way for someone to change is for them to change themselves. Then, in ''[[Saw IV]]'' flashbacks, he designed the first trap and test for Cecil and decided to use the rest of his existence to design more of these \"tests\" or \"games\" as a form of \"instant rehabilitation\" that would change the world, \"one person at a time\". John was soon given the name \"The Jigsaw Killer\" (or \"Jigsaw\"), because he removed a puzzle-piece-shaped chunk of flesh from those who did not escape his traps. John stated that this name was given to him by the media, and that the cut piece of flesh was meant to represent that these victims were each missing something\u2014what he called the \"survival instinct\".\n\nFew of Jigsaw's victims can survive his brutal mechanical traps, which are often [[irony|ironically]] [[symbol]]ic representations of the problems in the victim's life and require them to undergo severe physical and psychological [[torture]] to escape.\n\nIn ''[[Saw V]]'', police lieutenant [[Mark Hoffman]]'s ties with John are revealed in a series of flashbacks during the film. Hoffman's sister is murdered by her boyfriend, [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]. Seth is arrested; however, a technicality allowed him to be released, and Hoffman, feeling Seth had not served the full capacity of his sentence, kills him in an inescapable trap designed to look like one of Jigsaw's, laying the blame on him. Jigsaw then kidnaps Hoffman and blackmails him into becoming his apprentice in his \"rehabilitation\" methods, though eventually Hoffman would become a willing apprentice, helping set up John's tests from almost the beginning, starting with [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]'s trap.\n\nThe first surviving victim, [[Amanda Young]], views Jigsaw as a hero who ultimately changed her life for the better. Amanda, upon Jigsaw's request, agrees to become his [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]]. After Amanda survives, John shows Jill her rehabilitation, and Jill then becomes knowledgeable of John's traps and becomes somewhat of an accomplice as well.\n\nIn ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', Jigsaw has chained the man who diagnosed his cancer, [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], in a dilapidated industrial washroom with [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]], a photographer who has been tailing the doctor due to belief he is cheating on his wife. Lawrence has instructions to kill Adam by six o'clock, or else his wife and daughter will be killed. Flashbacks show detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who suspect Lawrence of being Jigsaw, following a trail of clues from other Jigsaw traps. Sing's death from a shotgun trap after saving a victim named Jeff causes Tapp to obsess over catching Jigsaw. Later on, he chases [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]], who monitors Adam and Lawrence's tests, and gets shot in the chest. Eventually, Lawrence saws off his own foot in order to escape, leaving Adam in the bathroom while Lawrence goes to try to save his family and get help for Adam. It is later seen in ''Saw 3D'' that Lawrence found a steaming hot pipe and cauterized his wound, stopping the bleeding and ultimately surviving the trap. John catches up with Lawrence and makes him his next apprentice, a fact which he hides from his other accomplices. Flashbacks from ''Saw III'' show that Amanda kidnapped Adam and later returned to suffocate him as an act of \"mercy killing\".\n\n[[File:Saw-cast.jpg|thumb|left|Central actors of the series. From top-left to bottom-right: Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Cary Elwes, Costas Mandylor, Danny Glover, and Betsy Russell.|250px]]\n''[[Saw II]]'' begins with the police tracking a severely weakened Jigsaw to his lair. However, another test is in place, as he and Amanda have kidnapped the son of Detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]] and trapped him and a group of seven convicts, previously framed by Eric, in a house that is slowly being filled with [[Sarin|sarin gas]], with Amanda Young among them. He will trade [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel Matthews]]' life for Eric's time, conversing with him until the game is concluded. Eric loses his patience and assaults Jigsaw, forcing him to take him to the house, only to discover that the video feed from inside the house had been pre-recorded, the events actually taking place much earlier; Eric's son was locked in a safe in Jigsaw's warehouse, being kept alive with an oxygen tank. Eric is knocked unconscious by a masked figure and wakes up imprisoned in the bathroom from ''Saw'', which is part of the foundation of the house. Amanda reveals herself to Eric as Jigsaw's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e before leaving him to die. In a flashback from ''Saw III'', Eric manages to escape the bathroom by breaking his foot. He confronts and beats Amanda, demanding to know where his son is. Amanda fights him off and leaves him for dead. A flashback from ''Saw IV'' shows Hoffman later dragging Eric to a prison cell, keeping him alive for a future game.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw III]]'' and ''[[Saw IV]]'' occur concurrently. ''Saw III'' begins with Jigsaw, weakened and near death, confined to a makeshift hospital bed. Amanda has taken over his work, designing traps of her own; however, these traps are inescapable, as Amanda is convinced that Jigsaw's traps have no effect and that people don't change. A [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|kidnapped doctor]] is forced to keep Jigsaw alive while another test is performed on [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]], a man obsessed with vengeance against the drunk driver who killed his son. Jigsaw, unwilling to allow a murderer to continue his legacy, designs a test for Amanda as well; she ultimately fails, and it results in the deaths of both Jigsaw and Amanda. ''Saw IV'', meanwhile, revolves around tests meant for [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Daniel Rigg]], which are overseen by Hoffman. Rigg fails his test, resulting in the death of Eric Matthews. Rigg is left to bleed to death by Hoffman, who later discovers the bodies of Jigsaw and Amanda. When an [[autopsy]] is performed on Jigsaw, a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] coated in wax is found in his [[stomach]]; the tape informs Hoffman that he is wrong to think that it is all over just because Jigsaw is dead, and he should not expect to go untested.\n\nThe events of ''[[Saw V]]'' show one of Hoffman's first solo tests, five people connected by different roles in a disastrous fire that killed several others are put into four interconnected tests of teamwork, killing off one person in each trap. The two remaining test subjects realize at the final trap that each previous trap was meant to be completed by each of the five people doing a small part, rather than killing one person per trap. With this knowledge, the two work together and barely manage to escape. They are found alive by Special Agent Erikson. Meanwhile, Hoffman has set up FBI Agent [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]] to appear to be Jigsaw's accomplice, while Strahm pursues Hoffman and is eventually killed due to his inability to follow Hoffman's rules, leaving Hoffman free to continue Jigsaw's \"work\".\n\n''[[Saw VI]]'' begins with Hoffman setting up a game as per John's instructions left in a box for Jill during ''Saw V''. This game centers on insurance executive named [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] who oversees a team responsible for rejecting two-thirds of all insurance claims. As William progresses through four tests, he saves as many people as he can and learns the error of his choice to reject so many policies, which inherently \"kill\" the rejected. His last test is revealed to be a test of forgiveness by the family of [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold Abbott]], a man to whom William rejected a policy in the past, whose son ultimately chooses to kill William using [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Meanwhile, Agent Erickson and the-previously-thought-to-be-dead agent [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]] search for Agent Strahm with the assistance of Hoffman. Upon finding irregularities in previous murder scenes, Perez and Erickson discover Hoffman's identity, but are killed by him before they can go public with his involvement. Hoffman travels back to the site of William's tests in which Jill attacks him to obey John's final request. She leaves Hoffman in a new Reverse Beartrap left behind by John, though does not leave a key for him to free himself. He is able to manipulate the trap and escapes wounded.\n\n''[[Saw 3D]]'' picks up with Jill and Hoffman battling for control of Jigsaw's legacy. As Jill enters protective custody and makes Hoffman's true identity public, Hoffman sets up a new game involving [[skinhead]]s to find a way to Jill. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen, a fraud who has written a book about escaping a Jigsaw trap he never experienced, is captured and forced to confront people who knew that he lied about being in a trap. Three of Dagen's friends die and his test concludes with him being forced to reenact the trap that he claimed to have survived before. He fails, which results in the death of his wife. Meanwhile, Hoffman has posed as a corpse and killed several officers to infiltrate the police station. He finds and kills Jill using the Reverse Beartrap. Hoffman attempts to leave town but is captured by Lawrence Gordon and his accomplices, then placed in the bathroom from the first film. Jigsaw is revealed to have aided Lawrence after his game and, in return, Lawrence helped him with subsequent traps. Hoffman is then left shackled in the bathroom to die.\n\n''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'' begins with a new game presumably being conducted 10 years after the events of John Kramer's death in ''Saw III''. Five people are forced to undergo a series of tests in an abandoned barn, led by John. In the first test, one of the subjects is seemingly killed by buzzsaws after remaining unconscious during instruction. Most of the remaining subjects are killed throughout the game, until only two, Anna and the heavily wounded Ryan, are left. The two of them are drugged and wake up chained on opposite sides of a room. John is revealed to be in the room with them, and he provides them with a shotgun, explaining it is the \"key to their freedom\", before leaving them to escape. Anna attempts to kill Ryan with the shotgun, but the weapon was rigged to backfire, killing her and leaving Ryan to die. Meanwhile, police forces led by Detective Halloran and aided by medical forensic scientists Logan Nelson and Eleanor Bonneville attempt to discover the location and participants in the game, while also struggling to understand how the deceased John could be behind it all. Logan and Eleanor find the location of the game at an abandoned barn owned by Jill Tuck, with Halloran pursuing them, believing they are behind the most recent games. Eleanor is shown escaping, and Logan and Halloran are placed in a room with collars lined with laser cutters around their neck. They are told by John that they must confess their sins to survive. Logan is presumably killed after admitting his error delayed John's diagnosis. Halloran then confesses he let various guilty convicts walk free, deactivating his collar. However, Logan rises from the ground, revealing his collar was harmless. He explains that the game in the barn was the very first game that took place ten years earlier, and that the bodies found by the team were criminals that Halloran let walk free, who Logan placed into an identical game of his own. He reveals he was the participant in the first game who was presumably killed by the buzzsaws, but that John did not believe Logan should die simply because his \"crime\" was merely an accident, and rescued him as a result. John took Logan under his wing, and Logan aided John in all the various traps throughout the series, making him John's very first apprentice. Logan reactivates Halloran's collar, slicing his head open, before slamming the door shut.\n\n===Recurring elements===\n'''Billy'''\n{{Main|Billy the Puppet}}\nBilly is a puppet resembling a [[Ventriloquism#Ventriloquist.27s dummy|ventriloquist's dummy]], sometimes seen riding a [[tricycle]], that has appeared throughout the films and has become a type of [[mascot]] for the series. It is used by the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] to communicate with his victims by delivering televised messages or occasionally in person to describe details of the sadistic traps and the means by which the victims could survive. Viewers have sometimes incorrectly identified the puppet itself as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]], because of its presence and connection to the killer.\n\nAge and use of the puppet over the course of the films necessitated its reconstruction. According to [[James Wan|Wan]], the original puppet's face for ''Saw'' involved clay, [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]], and black ping-pong balls with the irises painted in for the eyes, but in later films more sophisticated construction included [[Water jet cutter|waterjet-cut]] foam for the body and remote-controlled [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronics]].<ref name=\"GreggJoBlopt2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/saw-2-diary-2|title=Saw 2: Dairy #2|last=Hoffman|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Hoffman|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|page=2|date=May 13, 2005|access-date=August 24, 2011<!--|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AcAwHaK|archive-date=August 24, 2011-->}}</ref>\n\nThe endurance and popularity of the franchise has resulted in the production of ''Billy'' merchandise, as well as references in other media and its use in promotions for the films.\n\n'''\"Hello Zepp\"'''\n{{Main|Hello Zepp}}\n\n\"Hello Zepp\" is a piece of instrumental music that was originally composed by [[Charlie Clouser]] for the first film in the series. In ''Saw'', the implied villain, Zep Hindle, is revealed to actually be a victim of the Jigsaw Killer. (The character's name in the script is spelled \"Zep\", whereas the music titles are spelled \"Zepp\".)<ref>[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Saw.html ''Saw'' script] on IMSDb. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref><ref>[http://saw.ugo.com/?cur=saw-i-soundtrack ''Saw'' track listing] on [[UGO Networks|UGO]]. Accessed 2010-07-23.</ref> As the series continued, the piece was reused in every film as a [[leitmotif]], often being renamed and remixed to accommodate the changing situations and characters. The music was used in every ''Saw'' ending, usually during the revealing of plot revelations and twists which ''Saw'' films often use and it serves as the main theme tune for the whole films.\n\n'''Traps'''<br />\nAn important component of each film is the variety of (usually mechanical in form) traps Jigsaw and his apprentices use on their captives to communicate his message.\n\nAccording to [[David Hackl]], all of the traps are real objects, and not [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. They were designed to look horrific but ultimately be safe for the actors in them. Writer [[Marcus Dunstan]] said: \"It's built to function there on the day\", and added: \"It works. So if there's a scalping chair\u2014there really was a chair with working gears to grind and pull your scalp back.\" The most potentially dangerous item was a \"water box\" used in ''[[Saw V]]'', in which one of the actors ([[Scott Patterson]], as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]]) had to keep his head submerged as long as possible. Another element of the traps is that [[David Hackl|Hackl]] desired a specific look of rust and menace, but he also wanted them to have a type of beauty about them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/103/1039913p1.html|title=The Anatomy of a Trap: Saw|date=October 29, 2009|access-date=July 22, 2010|last=Monfette|first=Christopher|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61r3t1zc2|archive-date=September 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\n[[File:Saw Guinness award cropped.jpg|thumb|The ''Saw'' series was placed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the \"Most Successful Horror Franchise\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/23/film-saw-idUSN2215375420100723|title=\"Saw\" movie franchise to get Guinness world record|last=Kit|first=Zorianna|work=[[Reuters]]|date=July 22, 2010|access-date=September 21, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61rOhewtb|archive-date=September 21, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Pictured here is director [[Kevin Greutert]] receiving the award at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2010 Comic-Con]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/content/printVersion/61775/|title=Splattered: An Interview with James Wan Talking torture, politics and not-so-sweet revenge|last=Foundas|first=Scott|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=August 30, 2011|access-date=August 19, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/614BzHXY1|archive-date=August 19, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\n''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' grossed $18.2 million its opening weekend and had become [[Lionsgate]]'s second-best opening, after ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''{{'s}} {{nowrap|$23.9 million}} (2004).<ref name=\"BOMOpening\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1540&p=.htm|title='Ray,' 'Saw' See Robust Bows|last=Gray|first=Brandon|work=Box Office Mojo|publisher=Amazon.com|date=November 1, 2004|access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref> ''Saw'' went on to gross {{nowrap|$103 million}} worldwide,<ref name=\"SawBOM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=saw.htm|title=Saw (2004)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=August 16, 2011}}</ref> and is the second-lowest-grossing film in the series after ''[[Saw VI]]''.<ref name=\"Saw.vs\">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/showdowns/chart/?id=sawvs.htm|title='Saw' Vs.

Commercial finance is made available to the traders through [[Negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], which are discounted by Bill. The [[Accepting house|acceptance houses]] and discount markets help in financing foreign trade.\n\n===Financing industry===\nThe money market contributes to the growth of industries in two ways:\n* They help industries secure short-term loans to meet their [[working capital]] requirements through the system of finance bills, commercial papers, etc.\n* Industries generally need long-term loans, which are provided in the [[capital market]]. However, the capital market depends upon the nature of and the conditions in the money market. The short-term interest rates of the money market influence the long-term interest rates of the capital market. Thus, money market indirectly helps the industries through its link with and influence on long-term capital market.\n\n===Profitable Investments===\nThe money market enables commercial banks to use their excess reserves in profitable investments. The main objective of commercial banks is to earn income from its reserves as well as maintain liquidity to meet the uncertain cash demand of its depositors. In the money market, the excess reserves of commercial banks are invested in [[near money]] assets (e.g., short-term bills of exchange), which are easily converted into cash. Thus, commercial banks earn profits without sacrificing liquidity.\n\n===Self-sufficiency of commercial banks===\nDeveloped money markets help commercial banks to become self-sufficient. In an emergency, when commercial banks have scarcity of funds, they need not approach the central bank and borrow at a higher interest rate. They can instead meet their requirements by recalling their old short-run loans from the money market.\n\n===Help to central bank===\nThough the [[central bank]] can function and influence the banking system in the absence of a money market, the existence of a developed money market smooths the functioning and increases the efficiency of the central bank. \n\nMoney markets help central banks in two ways:\n* Short-run interest rates serve as an indicator of the monetary and banking conditions in the country and, in this way, guide the central bank to adopt an appropriate banking policy,\n* Sensitive and integrated money markets help the central bank secure quick and widespread influence on the sub-markets, thus facilitating effective policy implementation\n\n== Money market instruments ==\n* [[Certificate of deposit]] \u2013 Time deposit, commonly offered to consumers by banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions.\n* [[Repurchase agreement]]s \u2013 Short-term loans\u2014normally for less than one  week and frequently for one day\u2014arranged by selling securities to an investor with an agreement to repurchase them at a fixed price on a fixed date.\n*Money market mutual funds- it means it's a short term investment debt, operated by professional institutions.

The company premiered many operas in the UK, employing a mix of established opera stars and young singers, reaching new opera audiences with popularly priced tickets.  It survived Rosa's death in 1889, and continued to present opera in English on tour until 1960, when it was obliged to close for lack of funds. The company was revived in 1997, presenting mostly lighter operatic works including those by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. The company \"was arguably the most influential opera company ever in the UK\".<ref>[http://www.operascotland.org/operator/58/Carl+Rosa+Opera+Company \"Carl Rosa Opera Company\"], Opera Scotland, accessed 26 August 2012</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Carl Rosa]] was born Karl August Nikolaus Rose in [[Hamburg]], Germany, the son of a local businessman. A child violin prodigy, Rosa studied at the Conservatorium at [[Leipzig]] and in Paris.

The company premiered many operas in the UK, employing a mix of established opera stars and young singers, reaching new opera audiences with popularly priced tickets.  It survived Rosa's death in 1889, and continued to present opera in English on tour until 1960, when it was obliged to close for lack of funds. The company was revived in 1997, presenting mostly lighter operatic works including those by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. The company \"was arguably the most influential opera company ever in the UK\".<ref>[http://www.operascotland.org/operator/58/Carl+Rosa+Opera+Company \"Carl Rosa Opera Company\"], Opera Scotland, accessed 26 August 2012</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Carl Rosa]] was born Karl August Nikolaus Rose in [[Hamburg]], Germany, the son of a local businessman.
