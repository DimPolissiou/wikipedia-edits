Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nAnalyses of additional [[STIS]] data obtained in 2013 and 2014 argue that Fomalhaut b is fading and expanding in size, a behavior that may support the interpretation that Fomalhaut b identifies the collision between two asteroid-sized objects <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

However, longer-term monitoring of Fomalhaut b may show evidence that the object is fading with time <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nIn order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet,<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere.

Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting the star's debris disk give a mass 0.5 times that of Jupiter.

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nAnalyses of additional [[STIS]] data obtained in 2013 and 2014 argue that Fomalhaut b is fading and expanding in size, a behavior that may support the interpretation that Fomalhaut b identifies the collision between two asteroid-sized objects <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

Fomalhaut b appears to be moving at about 4 kilometers per second.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  While it is unclear whether Fomalhaut b's orbit will make it cross the debris disk or cross the debris disk only in projection (i.e. it is not orbiting in the same plane as the disk), its orbit is not completely nested within the debris disk<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.\n\nAt the optical wavelengths at which Fomalhaut b is detected, it is only about 2.7\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup> times as bright as the star and is the faintest (intrinsically) extrasolar object yet imaged.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/>  The shape of its spectrum, as determined from measurements obtained at 0.4&nbsp;to&nbsp;0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm, appears similar to that of its host star, suggesting that the emission identifying Fomalhaut b is completely due to scattered starlight<ref name=\"Currie\"/>.  Although the initial discovery paper for Fomalhaut b suggested that its optical brightness may be variable due to [[planetary accretion]], later reanalyses of these data fail to find convincing evidence that Fomalhaut b is indeed variable,<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Galicher\"/> <ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>thus eliminating evidence for planetary accretion.   However, longer-term monitoring of Fomalhaut b may show evidence that the object is fading with time <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nIn order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet,<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere.  A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/>  A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of {{convert|0.004|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}} can make Fomalhaut b visible.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth\u2013Sun distance.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/><ref name=\"Currie\"/> However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths and in the most recently-analyzed HST data, which would indicate that its emitting area is larger,<ref name=\"Galicher\"/> <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nThe mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain.

Each episode was one hour long including commercials. The show ran from 1958 to 1964.\n\n==Description==\n===Initial set-up and characters===\n[[File:Roger Smith Biff Elliot Maureen Leeds 77 Sunset Strip 1961.JPG|thumb|left|Roger Smith with guest stars [[Biff Elliot]] and Maureen Leeds, 1961]]\nPrivate detective Stuart (\"Stu\") Bailey (Zimbalist) was a former government [[espionage|secret agent]]. Jeff Spencer (Smith) also was a former government agent, and a nonpracticing [[Lawyer|attorney]].  The duo worked out of stylish offices at 77 [[Sunset Boulevard]], Suites 101 and 102.  The street address was colloquially known as [[Sunset Strip]], and was located between [[La Cienega Boulevard]] and Alta Loma Road on the south side of the strip next door to [[Dean Martin]]'s real-life lounge, Dino's Lodge.  Typically, the two detectives would alternate as leads, with a Stuart Bailey case being featured one week, and a Jeff Spencer case the next -- although depending on the nature of the case, sometimes the two would team up.  \n\nSuzanne Fabry, the beautiful French switchboard operator played by [[Jacqueline Beer]], handled the phones for Sunset Answering Service located in suite 103.  The firm of Bailey & Spencer employed her answering service, as did other clients.  Although not technically an employee of the firm, Suzanne would be involved in casework from time to time, especially in season two.\n\nComic relief was provided by Roscoe the racetrack tout (played by [[Louis Quinn]]).  Roscoe was forever hanging around the offices, giving horse racing tips.  However, he was sometimes used as an operative, and was an ever-informed source concerning the word on the street.  \n\nThe firm's most frequently seen police contact was Lt. Roy Gilmore ([[Byron Keith]]), who was almost never called by his first name.\n\nThe 'breakout' character, who had not been included in the pilot film, was Gerald Lloyd \"Kookie\" Kookson III ([[Edd Byrnes]]), the [[rock and roll]]-loving, wisecracking, hair-combing [[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] and aspiring PI who initially worked as the valet parking attendant at Dino's, the club next door to the detectives' office. \"Kookie\" often found a way to get himself involved in the firm's cases, and was eventually made a full partner in the firm with his own office.\n\nAlso seen relatively frequently were The [[Frank Ortega]] Trio, playing themselves as the jazzy house band at Dino's Lodge.\n\n===Tone and cultural impact===\nHuggins intended the show to be a hard-edged drama, but beginning with the 23rd episode, \"The Pasadena Caper,\" the tone started to become much lighter, with a strong element of self-deprecating humor and \"caper\" frequently used in episode titles. The catchy theme song, written by the accomplished team of [[Mack David]] and [[Jerry Livingston]], typified the show's breezy, jazzed atmosphere. The song became the centerpiece of an album of the show's music in Warren Barker orchestrations, which was released in 1959, a top-10 hit in the ''Billboard'' LP charts.\n[[File:Edd Byrnes Kookie Sue Randall 77 Sunset Strip 1964.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Sue Randall]] and \"Kookie\", 1964]]\nThe Kookie character became a cultural phenomenon, with his slang expressions such as \"ginchy\" (cool) and \"piling up Zs\" (sleeping). When Kookie helped the detectives on a case by singing a song, Edd Byrnes began a singing career with the novelty single \"[[Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)]]\" (Warner Bros. 5047), based on his frequent combing of his hair; this featured [[Connie Stevens]] on vocals in the chorus and the song, with words and music by Irving Taylor, became the first hit single for the recently established [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Kookie was also used to provide [[product placement]] for [[Harley-Davidson]], appearing on their [[Harley-Davidson Topper|Topper]] [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motor scooter]] in the show and in Harley-Davidson advertisements.<ref name=\"ScootersNeedToKnow_13\">{{cite book |last1= Dregni|first1= Eric|authorlink1= Eric Dregni|last2= Pete|first2= Pixel |title= Scooters: Everything You Need to Know|url= https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=L0QYaQC85KQC&source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate= 2013-08-24 |year=2005 |publisher= MBI Publishing|location= |language= |isbn= 978-0-7603-2217-8|page= 13|chapter= Chapter 1: Scooter History|chapterurl=https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=L0QYaQC85KQC&pg=PA6&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote= Being the little brother to world famous motorcycles, the Harley Topper could never live up to that rebel image, even with Kookie from ''77 Sunset Strip'' pushing the putt-putts with ad copy like \"Kookie, where's your Topper?\"}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |date=December 1959|title= Harley-Davidson advertisement|journal= Popular Mechanics|volume= 112|issue= 6|page= 211|location= Chicago, IL USA|publisher= Popular Mechanics|editor1-first= Roderick M.|editor1-last= Grant|id= |doi= |accessdate= 2013-08-24|url= https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=8OUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA211&dq=Kookie+Topper+77+Sunset+Strip&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sHIYUo_-Oa6o4AOjmYCwDQ&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Kookie%20Topper%2077%20Sunset%20Strip&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Cast changes during seasons 1\u20135===\nWhen Byrnes' demands for more money and an expanded role were not met, he left the show for a period in season two.  After an absence of 16 episodes beginning in January 1960, Byrnes and Warner Brothers settled their differences, and Kookie came back beginning in May. (During his absence, Roscoe's and Suzanne's roles were beefed up to handle the leg work normally assigned to Kookie.)  \n\nFor the 1960\u201361 season, [[Richard Long (actor)|Richard Long]] (who had previously been seen in different roles in two season one ''77 Sunset Strip'' episodes) moved over from the recently canceled detective series ''[[Bourbon Street Beat]]''.  His ''BSB'' character of Rex Randolph was said to have left New Orleans and relocated to North Hollywood, joining Bailey and Spencer's firm, and taking office 104.  The character was dropped after one season, but Long (once again playing different one-shot guest characters) was seen again on ''77 Sunset Strip'' in seasons five and six.  \n\nKookie became a full-fledged detective and partner in the firm as of season four, taking over Rex Randolph's office in 104.  At the same time, [[Robert Logan]] became the new parking lot attendant, J.R. Hale, who usually spoke in abbreviations.  Hale was seen throughout seasons four and five.\n\n===Episode and guest cast highlights===\nOne of the series' more unusual episodes was the 1960 \"The Silent Caper\", written by Smith.  It presented its story completely without dialogue, hence the title. Another off-beat entry was 1961's \"Reserved For Mr. Bailey\", which finds Zimbalist alone in a ghost town. He is the only main actor on screen for the entire hour. (This latter episode was never included in the syndication package, and many fans had expressed their frustration at being unable to see it again. After 56 years out of circulation, it finally resurfaced on [[MeTV]] on June 17, 2017.)\n\nThe show was so popular that rising young actors clamored for guest spots. Up-and-comers who made guest appearances include: [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Roger Moore]], [[DeForest Kelley]], [[William Shatner]], [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Shirley MacLaine]] look-alike Gigi Verone, [[Robert Conrad]], [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Janet De Gore]], [[Jay North]], [[Connie Stevens]], [[Irish McCalla]], [[Adam West]], [[Tuesday Weld]], [[Sherry Jackson]], [[Marlo Thomas]], [[Max Baer Jr.]], [[Carole Mathews]], [[Elizabeth Montgomery]], [[Karen Steele]], [[Randy Stuart]], [[Susan Oliver]], [[Robert Vaughn]], [[Suzanne Storrs]], [[Peter Breck]], [[Donna Douglas]], [[Troy Donahue]], [[Chad Everett]], [[Gena Rowlands]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Eve McVeagh]], and [[Diane Ladd]]. Established film and TV actors and older stars who guest-starred include [[Fay Wray]], [[Francis X. Bushman]], [[Rodolfo Hoyos Jr.]], [[Ida Lupino]], [[Liliane Montevecchi]], [[Keenan Wynn]], [[Rolfe Sedan]], [[Jim Backus]], [[Billie Burke]], [[Buddy Ebsen]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[Peter Lorre]], [[Boris Karloff]], [[Burgess Meredith]], [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]], [[Gerald Mohr]], and [[Roy Roberts]], among others. The show occasionally featured sports stars such as [[Sandy Koufax]] in guest roles.\n\n==The Controversial Sixth Season, 1963\u20131964==\n{{unrefsec|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 1963, as the show's popularity waned, the entire cast was [[dismissal (employment)|let go]] except for Zimbalist. [[Jack Webb]] was brought in as [[executive producer]] and [[William Conrad]] as a producer/[[television director|director]]. The character of Stuart Bailey was presented as a solo private investigator, with no continuity or reference to his past years with Jeff Spencer, Suzanne, Kookie, and Roscoe, or his military OSS background. It was an abrupt, unexplained disconnect. The series and Bailey's personality took on a darker tone, and the familiar office, parking lot and Dino's Lodge were gone. A new musical theme was written by [[Bob Thompson (musician)|Bob Thompson]]. \n\nThe season six show title was not changed, it still was an address, but Bailey's new office was dramatically different from Bailey and Spencer's 77 Sunset Strip office of the past five years. The interior of Bailey's new office building was shown behind the show's opening and closing credits, forcing viewers to ponder how the same address could look so very different (it was actually the historic Bradbury building in downtown Los Angeles).  There seemed to be no spoken mention of his office address in the season six shows, although in the episode \"Bonus Baby\" when a police officer inspects Bailey's Private Investigator License, a close-up shows the address \"77 Sunset Strip\". \n\nAs the season progressed, there were some shifts in tone. Several episodes into the season, Bailey's stern personality became lighter, though still different from prior seasons. His secretary Hannah, previously known to sixth season viewers only because Bailey addressed her in his recorded dictations, was seen on-screen beginning in the season's eleventh episode.  Played by [[Joan Staley]], Hannah worked in Bailey's office, where he developed a romantic interest in her -- but she continually stymied and frustrated him by playing hard-to-get. As of episode \"Alimony League\" (the sixteenth of the season's twenty episodes), the opening and closing background of Bradbury building was gone, replaced by Bailey in silhouette walking past lighted store windows.

Each episode was one hour long including commercials. The show ran from 1958 to 1964.\n\n==Description==\n===Initial set-up and characters===\n[[File:Roger Smith Biff Elliot Maureen Leeds 77 Sunset Strip 1961.JPG|thumb|left|Roger Smith with guest stars [[Biff Elliot]] and Maureen Leeds, 1961]]\nPrivate detective Stuart (\"Stu\") Bailey (Zimbalist) was a former government [[espionage|secret agent]]. Jeff Spencer (Smith) also was a former government agent, and a nonpracticing [[Lawyer|attorney]].  The duo worked out of stylish offices at 77 [[Sunset Boulevard]], Suites 101 and 102.  The street address was colloquially known as [[Sunset Strip]], and was located between [[La Cienega Boulevard]] and Alta Loma Road on the south side of the strip next door to [[Dean Martin]]'s real-life lounge, Dino's Lodge.  Typically, the two detectives would alternate as leads, with a Stuart Bailey case being featured one week, and a Jeff Spencer case the next -- although depending on the nature of the case, sometimes the two would team up.  \n\nSuzanne Fabry, the beautiful French switchboard operator played by [[Jacqueline Beer]], handled the phones for Sunset Answering Service located in suite 103.  The firm of Bailey & Spencer employed her answering service, as did other clients.  Although not technically an employee of the firm, Suzanne would be involved in casework from time to time, especially in season two.\n\nComic relief was provided by Roscoe the racetrack tout (played by [[Louis Quinn]]).  Roscoe was forever hanging around the offices, giving horse racing tips.  However, he was sometimes used as an operative, and was an ever-informed source concerning the word on the street.  \n\nThe firm's most frequently seen police contact was Lt. Roy Gilmore ([[Byron Keith]]), who was almost never called by his first name.\n\nThe 'breakout' character, who had not been included in the pilot film, was Gerald Lloyd \"Kookie\" Kookson III ([[Edd Byrnes]]), the [[rock and roll]]-loving, wisecracking, hair-combing [[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] and aspiring PI who initially worked as the valet parking attendant at Dino's, the club next door to the detectives' office. \"Kookie\" often found a way to get himself involved in the firm's cases, and was eventually made a full partner in the firm with his own office.\n\nAlso seen relatively frequently were The [[Frank Ortega]] Trio, playing themselves as the jazzy house band at Dino's Lodge.\n\n===Tone and cultural impact===\nHuggins intended the show to be a hard-edged drama, but beginning with the 23rd episode, \"The Pasadena Caper,\" the tone started to become much lighter, with a strong element of self-deprecating humor and \"caper\" frequently used in episode titles. The catchy theme song, written by the accomplished team of [[Mack David]] and [[Jerry Livingston]], typified the show's breezy, jazzed atmosphere. The song became the centerpiece of an album of the show's music in Warren Barker orchestrations, which was released in 1959, a top-10 hit in the ''Billboard'' LP charts.\n[[File:Edd Byrnes Kookie Sue Randall 77 Sunset Strip 1964.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Sue Randall]] and \"Kookie\", 1964]]\nThe Kookie character became a cultural phenomenon, with his slang expressions such as \"ginchy\" (cool) and \"piling up Zs\" (sleeping). When Kookie helped the detectives on a case by singing a song, Edd Byrnes began a singing career with the novelty single \"[[Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)]]\" (Warner Bros. 5047), based on his frequent combing of his hair; this featured [[Connie Stevens]] on vocals in the chorus and the song, with words and music by Irving Taylor, became the first hit single for the recently established [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Kookie was also used to provide [[product placement]] for [[Harley-Davidson]], appearing on their [[Harley-Davidson Topper|Topper]] [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motor scooter]] in the show and in Harley-Davidson advertisements.<ref name=\"ScootersNeedToKnow_13\">{{cite book |last1= Dregni|first1= Eric|authorlink1= Eric Dregni|last2= Pete|first2= Pixel |title= Scooters: Everything You Need to Know|url= https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=L0QYaQC85KQC&source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate= 2013-08-24 |year=2005 |publisher= MBI Publishing|location= |language= |isbn= 978-0-7603-2217-8|page= 13|chapter= Chapter 1: Scooter History|chapterurl=https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=L0QYaQC85KQC&pg=PA6&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote= Being the little brother to world famous motorcycles, the Harley Topper could never live up to that rebel image, even with Kookie from ''77 Sunset Strip'' pushing the putt-putts with ad copy like \"Kookie, where's your Topper?\"}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |date=December 1959|title= Harley-Davidson advertisement|journal= Popular Mechanics|volume= 112|issue= 6|page= 211|location= Chicago, IL USA|publisher= Popular Mechanics|editor1-first= Roderick M.|editor1-last= Grant|id= |doi= |accessdate= 2013-08-24|url= https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=8OUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA211&dq=Kookie+Topper+77+Sunset+Strip&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sHIYUo_-Oa6o4AOjmYCwDQ&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Kookie%20Topper%2077%20Sunset%20Strip&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Cast changes during seasons 1\u20135===\nWhen Byrnes' demands for more money and an expanded role were not met, he left the show for a period in season two.  After an absence of 16 episodes beginning in January 1960, Byrnes and Warner Brothers settled their differences, and Kookie came back beginning in May. (During his absence, Roscoe's and Suzanne's roles were beefed up to handle the leg work normally assigned to Kookie.)  \n\nFor the 1960\u201361 season, [[Richard Long (actor)|Richard Long]] (who had previously been seen in different roles in two season one ''77 Sunset Strip'' episodes) moved over from the recently canceled detective series ''[[Bourbon Street Beat]]''.  His ''BSB'' character of Rex Randolph was said to have left New Orleans and relocated to North Hollywood, joining Bailey and Spencer's firm, and taking office 104.  The character was dropped after one season, but Long (once again playing different one-shot guest characters) was seen again on ''77 Sunset Strip'' in seasons five and six.  \n\nKookie became a full-fledged detective and partner in the firm as of season four, taking over Rex Randolph's office in 104.  At the same time, [[Robert Logan]] became the new parking lot attendant, J.R. Hale, who usually spoke in abbreviations.  Hale was seen throughout seasons four and five.\n\n===Episode and guest cast highlights===\nOne of the series' more unusual episodes was the 1960 \"The Silent Caper\", written by Smith.  It presented its story completely without dialogue, hence the title. Another off-beat entry was 1961's \"Reserved For Mr. Bailey\", which finds Zimbalist alone in a ghost town. He is the only main actor on screen for the entire hour. (This latter episode was never included in the syndication package, and many fans had expressed their frustration at being unable to see it again. After 56 years out of circulation, it finally resurfaced on [[MeTV]] on June 17, 2017.)\n\nThe show was so popular that rising young actors clamored for guest spots. Up-and-comers who made guest appearances include: [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Roger Moore]], [[DeForest Kelley]], [[William Shatner]], [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Shirley MacLaine]] look-alike Gigi Verone, [[Robert Conrad]], [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Janet De Gore]], [[Jay North]], [[Connie Stevens]], [[Irish McCalla]], [[Adam West]], [[Tuesday Weld]], [[Sherry Jackson]], [[Marlo Thomas]], [[Max Baer Jr.]], [[Carole Mathews]], [[Elizabeth Montgomery]], [[Karen Steele]], [[Randy Stuart]], [[Susan Oliver]], [[Robert Vaughn]], [[Suzanne Storrs]], [[Peter Breck]], [[Donna Douglas]], [[Troy Donahue]], [[Chad Everett]], [[Gena Rowlands]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Eve McVeagh]], and [[Diane Ladd]]. Established film and TV actors and older stars who guest-starred include [[Fay Wray]], [[Francis X. Bushman]], [[Rodolfo Hoyos Jr.]], [[Ida Lupino]], [[Liliane Montevecchi]], [[Keenan Wynn]], [[Rolfe Sedan]], [[Jim Backus]], [[Billie Burke]], [[Buddy Ebsen]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[Peter Lorre]], [[Boris Karloff]], [[Burgess Meredith]], [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]], [[Gerald Mohr]], and [[Roy Roberts]], among others. The show occasionally featured sports stars such as [[Sandy Koufax]] in guest roles.\n\n==The Controversial Sixth Season, 1963\u20131964==\n{{unrefsec|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 1963, as the show's popularity waned, the entire cast was [[dismissal (employment)|let go]] except for Zimbalist. [[Jack Webb]] was brought in as [[executive producer]] and [[William Conrad]] as a producer/[[television director|director]]. The character of Stuart Bailey was presented as a solo private investigator, with no continuity or reference to his past years with Jeff Spencer, Suzanne, Kookie, and Roscoe <i>et al</i>, or his military OSS background. It was an abrupt, unexplained disconnect. The series and Bailey's personality took on a darker tone, and the familiar office, parking lot and Dino's Lodge were gone. A new musical theme was written by [[Bob Thompson (musician)|Bob Thompson]]. \n\nThe season six show title was not changed, it still was an address, but Bailey's new office was dramatically different from Bailey and Spencer's 77 Sunset Strip office of the past five years. The interior of Bailey's new office building was shown behind the show's opening and closing credits, forcing viewers to ponder how the same address could look so very different (it was actually the historic Bradbury building in downtown Los Angeles).  There seemed to be no spoken mention of his office address in the season six shows, although in the episode \"Bonus Baby\" when a police officer inspects Bailey's Private Investigator License, a close-up shows the address \"77 Sunset Strip\". \n\nAs the season progressed, there were some shifts in tone. Several episodes into the season, Bailey's stern personality became lighter, though still different from prior seasons. His secretary Hannah, previously known to sixth season viewers only because Bailey addressed her in his recorded dictations, was seen on-screen beginning in the season's eleventh episode.  Played by [[Joan Staley]], Hannah worked in Bailey's office, where he developed a romantic interest in her -- but she continually stymied and frustrated him by playing hard-to-get. As of episode \"Alimony League\" (the sixteenth of the season's twenty episodes), the opening and closing background of Bradbury building was gone, replaced by Bailey in silhouette walking past lighted store windows. This was actually a scene from \"5\" (the 6th Season opener) and it was SUPPOSEDLY located in New York City where Bailey arrived to work for a client to \"pay his dead brother's way into heaven\".\n\nEpisode \"The Target\" was unusual because key roles were played by the show's primary behind-the-scenes people, who happened to also be experienced actors. Show producer William Conrad played \"Maestrian\", associate producer James Lydon played \"Charlie\", writer Tony Barrett played \"Carnovan\", and director Lawrence Dobkin played \"Landers\". \n\nSeason six of ''77 Sunset Strip'' was essentially a different show from what had aired in seasons one to five -- a show that oddly used the title (and one character name and actor) from the different prior show, and showed a different building with the same address. Viewers did not appreciate such a massive alteration, and the show was cancelled halfway through its sixth season in February 1964.<ref>{{cite news |title=A.B.C.-TV TO DROP '77 SUNSET STRIP' / Also Discontinuing 3 Other Series Before April|work=[[The New York Times]], p.41|author=Adams, Val|date=January 1, 1964|accessdate=November 18, 2018| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/01/01/106930685.html?pageNumber=41}}</ref> In the 1964 summer reruns period, shows from the Bailey and Spencer years were shown; the Season Six episodes were abandoned, rarely seen until September 2017 on [[MeTV]].\n\n==Broadcast history==\nNOTE: The most frequent time slot for the series is in '''bold text'''.\n*Friday at 9:30\u201310:30&nbsp;pm on ABC: October 10, 1958 \u2013 May 29, 1959; October 12, 1962 \u2013 June 14, 1963\n*'''Friday at 9:00\u201310:00  pm on ABC: October 2, 1959 \u2013 June 29, 1962'''\n*Friday at 7:30\u20138:30  pm on ABC: September 20, 1963 \u2013 February 7, 1964\n\n==Related shows==\nThe success of ''77 Sunset Strip'' led to the creation of several other detective shows in exotic locales, all produced by the Warner Bros. studio, which created ''Strip'' \u2014 ''[[Bourbon Street Beat]]'' in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'' in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], and ''[[Surfside 6]]'' in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]].

[[Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs]], a long-standing song contest that takes place every year in Albania since 1962, is used to select the country's entrant for that year's Eurovision Song Contest. \n\nIn 2004, Albania's first entry at Eurovision, [[Anjeza Shahini]], finished seventh in the final.

The following year, [[Luiz Ejlli]] and his entry \"[[Zjarr e ftoht\u00eb]]\" failed to qualify for the grand final in [[Athens]] simultaneously marking the first time in their participation history.\n\nThe 2007 entry was [[Frederik Ndoci]] with \"[[Hear My Plea]]\", performed at [[Festivali I K\u00ebng\u00ebs 45]] as \"Balada e gurit\" (The stone ballad). The song was performed at Eurovision in both English and Albanian. In the semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007 contest]] he received 49 points, placing 17th of 28 in his semi-final and failing to qualify for the final.\n\nThe winner of [[Festivali I K\u00ebng\u00ebs 46]] was \"[[Zemr\u00ebn e lam\u00eb peng]]\" (Hearts trapped in time) by [[Olta Boka]]. However the result of the juries that selected the winner was controversial and rumours arose that the final two judges intentionally awarded high marks to Boka in order to avoid sending the runners-up, Flaka Krelani and Doruntina Disha, to the contest. Press reactions in Albania were not happy with the decision, and RTSH announced that they would investigate into alleged cheating by the final two judges to award their points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/9917|title=Albania: press reaction on Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs|last=Klier|first=Marcus|date=2007-12-17|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/9930|title=Albania: Festivali I Kenges result under investigation|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2007-12-19|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref> Despite this, Olta Boka's victory remained, and she sang for Albania at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].

The following year, [[Luiz Ejlli]] and his entry \"[[Zjarr e ftoht\u00eb]]\" failed to qualify for the grand final in [[Athens]] simultaneously marking the first time in their participation history.\n\nThe 2007 entry was [[Frederik Ndoci]] with \"[[Hear My Plea]]\", performed at [[Festivali I K\u00ebng\u00ebs 45]] as \"Balada e gurit\" (The stone ballad). The song was performed at Eurovision in both English and Albanian. In the semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007 contest]] he received 49 points, placing 17th of 28 in his semi-final and failing to qualify for the final.\n\nThe winner of [[Festivali I K\u00ebng\u00ebs 46]] was \"[[Zemr\u00ebn e lam\u00eb peng]]\" (Hearts trapped in time) by [[Olta Boka]]. However the result of the juries that selected the winner was controversial and rumours arose that the final two judges intentionally awarded high marks to Boka in order to avoid sending the runners-up, Flaka Krelani and Doruntina Disha, to the contest. Press reactions in Albania were not happy with the decision, and RTSH announced that they would investigate into alleged cheating by the final two judges to award their points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/9917|title=Albania: press reaction on Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs|last=Klier|first=Marcus|date=2007-12-17|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/9930|title=Albania: Festivali I Kenges result under investigation|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2007-12-19|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref> Despite this, Olta Boka's victory remained, and she sang for Albania at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].

It stars [[Laurence Harvey]] as [[Lionel Crabb|Lionel \"Buster\" Crabb]] and describes his exploits during [[World War II]]. Based on [[Marshall Pugh]]'s book ''Commander Crabb'', it was made following the publicity created by Crabb's mysterious disappearance and likely death during a [[Cold War]] incident a year earlier. It was the first Universal Pictures film in [[Widescreen|SuperScope]]\n\nThe film depicts events in [[Gibraltar]] harbour during the [[World War II]], [[Decima Flottiglia MAS#Chronicle of operations|Italian frogman and manned torpedo attacks]], although the film's depiction of those events is highly fictionalised.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins with a dramatisation of the Italian manned torpedo [[raid on Alexandria (1941)]] in which two British battleships {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} and {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}} were severely damaged. The British are worried that this new tactic will give the Italians naval supremacy in the [[Mediterranean]], with the primary target for the Italians being the Royal Navy base at [[Gibraltar]]. To counter this threat, Bomb disposal expert Lionel Crabb (Harvey) is posted to Gibraltar. He creates an initially very small team of divers to intercept the Italian attacks and defuse the bombs. Meanwhile, from [[Algeciras]] in neutral [[Spain]], an Italian expert on underwater operations, Antonio Tomolino (Fo\u00e0), is secretly watching the British base in Gibraltar and planning new attacks.\n\nAfter the Italians mount a failed attack upon a cruiser in Gibraltar, Crabb and his divers recover one of the manned torpedoes and begin to repair it, with the new somewhat stringent Petty Officer Thorpe (James) coming in to take over physical and diving training.\n\nAfter a further series of attacks against ships in Gibraltar harbour and an attempt to recover secret documents from a wrecked aircraft, Crabb decides to visit Algeciras to discover where the Italians are operating from.

It stars [[Laurence Harvey]] as [[Lionel Crabb|Lionel \"Buster\" Crabb]] and describes his exploits during [[World War II]]. Based on [[Marshall Pugh]]'s book ''Commander Crabb'', it was made following the publicity created by Crabb's mysterious disappearance and likely death during a [[Cold War]] incident a year earlier. It was the first Universal Pictures film in [[Widescreen|SuperScope]]\n\nThe film depicts events in [[Gibraltar]] harbour during the [[World War II]], [[Decima Flottiglia MAS#Chronicle of operations|Italian frogman and manned torpedo attacks]], although the film's depiction of those events is highly fictionalised.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins with a dramatisation of the Italian manned torpedo [[raid on Alexandria (1941)]] in which two British battleships {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} and {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}} were severely damaged. The British are worried that this new tactic will give the Italians naval supremacy in the [[Mediterranean]], with the primary target for the Italians being the Royal Navy base at [[Gibraltar]]. To counter this threat, Bomb disposal expert Lionel Crabb (Harvey) is posted to Gibraltar. He creates an initially very small team of divers to intercept the Italian attacks and defuse the bombs. Meanwhile, from [[Algeciras]] in neutral [[Spain]], an Italian expert on underwater operations, Antonio Tomolino (Fo\u00e0), is secretly watching the British base in Gibraltar and planning new attacks.\n\nAfter the Italians mount a failed attack upon a cruiser in Gibraltar, Crabb and his divers recover one of the manned torpedo's and begin to repair it, with the new somewhat stringent Petty Officer Thorpe (James) coming in to take over physical and diving training.\n\nAfter a further series of attacks against ships in Gibraltar harbour and an attempt to recover secret documents from a wrecked aircraft, Crabb decides to visit Algeciras to discover where the Italians are operating from. After following a man with an Italian tattoo to an interned Italian ship, the [[Italian auxiliary ship Olterra|Olterra]], he discovers that the ships hold is being used as a workshop and base for the operations with an underwater door being used for the manned torpedo's and frogmen, which leaves them undiscovered by Spanish authorities. Crabb reports the discovery of the Olterra to his superiors but under the laws of neutrality, he cannot arrange an attack without top level authority.\n\nMeanwhile, the Italians plan a major attack on a British convoy.

He was the youngest son of George Beckman, a blacksmith, and his second wife Elizabeth Ellen Jewkes.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|5}} He was curious about the world from an early age. When he was nine, Beckman found an old chemistry textbook, [[Joel Dorman Steele]]'s ''Fourteen Weeks in Chemistry'', and began trying out the experiments.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|9}} His father encouraged his scientific interests by letting him convert a toolshed into a laboratory.\n\nBeckman's mother, Elizabeth, died of diabetes in 1912. Beckman's father sold his blacksmith shop, and became a travelling salesman for blacksmithing tools and materials.  A housekeeper, Hattie Lange, was engaged to look after the Beckman children. Arnold Beckman earned money as a \"practice pianist\" with a local band, and as an \"official cream tester\" running a centrifuge for a local store.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|12\u201313}}\n\nIn 1914, the Beckman family moved to Normal, located just north of [[Bloomington, Illinois]], so that the young Beckmans could attend [[University High School (Normal)|University High School]] in [[Normal, Illinois|Normal]], a \"laboratory school\" associated with [[Illinois State University]].<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|16}} In 1915 they moved to Bloomington itself,<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|17\u201318}} but continued to attend University High, where Arnold Beckman obtained permission to take university level classes from professor of chemistry Howard W. Adams.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|17\u201318}} While still in high school, Arnold started his own business, \"Bloomington Research Laboratories\", doing analytic chemistry for the local gas company.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|21\u201322}} He also performed at night as a movie-house pianist, and played with local dance bands.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|24\u201325}} He graduated valedictorian of his class, with an average of 89.41 over four years, the highest attained.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|27}}\n\nBeckman was allowed to leave school a few months early to contribute to the [[First World War]] effort in early 1918 by working as a chemist.  At Keystone Steel and Iron he took samples of molten iron and tested them to see if the chemical composition of carbon, sulfur, manganese and phosphorus was suitable for pouring steel.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|26}}\n\nWhen Beckman turned 18 in August 1918, he enlisted in the [[United States Marines]]. After three months at marine boot camp on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]],<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|31}} he was sent to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], for transit to the war in Europe. Because of a train delay, another unit embarked in place of Beckman's unit. Then, counted into groups in the barracks, Beckman missed being sent to [[Russia]] by one space in line.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|32}} Instead, Arnold spent [[Thanksgiving]] at the local [[YMCA]], where he met 17-year-old Mabel Stone Meinzer, who was helping to serve the meal.  Mabel would become his wife.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|33}}  A few days later, the [[First Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|armistice]] was signed, ending the war.\n\n==University education==\nBeckman attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] beginning in the fall of 1918. During his freshman year, he worked with [[Carl Shipp Marvel]] on the synthesis of organic mercury compounds, but both men became ill from exposure to toxic [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|42}} As a result, Beckman changed his major from organic chemistry to physical chemistry, where he worked with Worth Rodebush, T. A. White, and Gerhard Dietrichson.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|50\u201351}}  He earned his [[bachelor's]] degree in chemical engineering in 1922 and his master's degree in physical chemistry in 1923.<ref name=OralHistory>{{cite book|first1=Jeffrey L. |last1=Sturchio|first2= Arnold |last2=Thackray|title=Arnold O.

A. White.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|55}}\n\nSoon after arriving at the University of Illinois, Beckman joined the [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|55}} He was initiated into Zeta chapter of [[Alpha Chi Sigma]], the chemistry fraternity, in 1921<ref name=AlphaChiSigma>{{cite web|title=Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame|url=http://www.alphachisigma.org/page.aspx?pid=268|publisher=Alpha Chi Sigma Fraternity|accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref> and the [[Gamma Alpha]] Graduate Scientific Fraternity in December 1922.\n\nBeckman decided to go to [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) for his doctorate. He stayed there for a year, before returning to New York to be near his fianc\u00e9e, Mabel, who was working as a secretary for the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society]]. He found a job with [[Western Electric]]'s engineering department, the precursor to the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]. Working with [[Walter A. Shewhart]],<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|61}} Beckman developed [[quality control]] programs for the manufacture of [[vacuum tube]]s and learned about circuit design. It was here that Beckman discovered his interest in [[electronics]].\n\n[[File:Mabel and Arnold Beckman 4.23.tif|thumb|right| Mabel and Arnold Beckman]]\n\nBeckman married Mabel on June 10, 1925.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|68}} In 1926 the couple moved back to California and Beckman resumed his studies at Caltech. He became interested in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor, [[Roscoe G. Dickinson]], on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light. It worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a [[thermocouple]], converting the incident heat into electricity, which drove a [[galvanometer]]. After receiving a Ph.D. in photochemistry in 1928<ref name=OralHistory /> for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions, Beckman was asked to stay on at Caltech as an instructor and then as a professor.<ref>Beckman, A. O. (1928). The Photochemical Decomposition of Hydrogen Azide (Doctoral dissertation, California Institute of Technology)|URL=http://caltech.tind.io/record/571245</ref> [[Linus Pauling]], another of [[Roscoe G. Dickinson]]'s graduate students, was also asked to stay on at Caltech.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|99}}\n\nIn 1933, Beckman and his family built a home in [[Altadena, California]], in the foothills and adjacent to Pasadena. They lived in Altadena for over 27 years, raising their family.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Teaching and consultancy at Caltech==\n[[File:Beckman lab Caltech 3.31.tif|thumb|right|Arnold Beckman's laboratory at Caltech]]\nDuring his time at Caltech, Beckman was active in teaching at both the introductory and advanced graduate levels. Beckman shared his expertise in glass-blowing by teaching classes in the machine shop. He also taught classes in the design and use of research instruments.  Beckman dealt first-hand with the chemists' need for good instrumentation as manager of the chemistry department's instrument shop.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|96\u201399}} Beckman's interest in electronics made him very popular within the chemistry department at Caltech, as he was very skilled in building [[measuring instruments]].\n\nOver the time that he was at Caltech, the focus of the department increasingly moved towards pure science and away from chemical engineering and applied chemistry. [[Arthur Amos Noyes]], head of the chemistry division, encouraged both Beckman and chemical engineer William Lacey to be in contact with real-world engineers and chemists, and  [[Robert Andrews Millikan]], Caltech's president, referred technical questions to Beckman from government and businesses.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|98\u2013101}} With their blessing, Beckman began accepting outside work as a scientific and technical consultant. He also acted as a scientific expert in legal trials.\n\n==National Inking Appliance Company==\n[[File:National Inking Appliance Company original building pasadena 5x21tf694.tiff |thumb|right |Original site of the National Inking Appliance Company, later National Technical Laboratories]]\n\nIn 1934, Millikan referred I. H. Lyons from the National Postal Meter Company to Arnold Beckman. Lyons wanted a non-clogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines, instead of having clerks lick stamps.<ref name=Jaehnig>{{cite book|last1=Jaehnig|first1=Kenton G.|title=Finding Aid to the Beckman Historical Collection 1911 - 2011 (Bulk 1935 - 2004 )|url=http://othmerlib.sciencehistory.org/record=b1072260~S6|website=Science History Institute|quote=\"Click on 'Beckman Historical Collection Finding Aid' to go to full document.\"|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> Beckman's solution was to make ink with [[butyric acid]], a malodorous substance. Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it. Beckman decided to make it himself. He started the National Inking Appliance Company, obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker Fred Henson and hiring two Caltech students, Robert Barton and Henry Fracker. Beckman developed and took out a couple of patents for re-inking [[typewriter ribbon]]s, but marketing them was not successful. This was Beckman's first experience at running a company and marketing a product, and while this first product failed, Beckman repurposed the company for another product.<ref name=\"hundred\"/>{{rp|124\u2013129}}\n\n==pH Meter==\n{{see also|pH meter}}\n[[File:Beckman Model M pH Meter 2006.072.002.tif |thumb|right | Beckman Model M pH Meter]]\n[[File:George Garcelon using Beckman pH meter 2004.012.020.tif|thumb|right|Beckman Portable pH meter in use]]\n\n[[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist Growers]] was having problems with its own manufacturing process. Lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into [[pectin]] or [[citric acid]], with [[sulfur dioxide]] used as a preservative. Sunkist needed to know the [[pH|acidity of the product]] at any given time, and the colorimetric methods then in use, such as readings from [[litmus paper]], did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them.  Chemist Glen Joseph at Sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogen-ion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically, but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes, and non-reactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile.\n\nJoseph approached Beckman, who proposed that instead of trying to increase the sensitivity of his measurements, he amplify his results. Beckman, familiar with glassblowing, electricity, and chemistry, suggested a design for a vacuum-tube amplifier and ended up building a working apparatus for Joseph.  The glass electrode used to measure pH was placed in a grid circuit in the vacuum tube, producing an amplified signal which could then be read by an electronic meter. The prototype was so useful that Joseph requested a second unit.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|124\u2013129}}\n\nBeckman saw an opportunity, and rethinking the project, decided to create a complete chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists. By October 1934, he had registered patent application US Patent No. 2,058,761 for his \"acidimeter\", later renamed the pH meter.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|131}}<ref name=Chicago /> The Arthur H. Thomas Company, a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in Philadelphia, was willing to try selling it.  Although it was priced expensively at $195, roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time, it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components, about $500.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|134\u2013135}} The original pH meter weighed in at nearly 7&nbsp;kg, but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment. The earliest meter had a design glitch, in that the pH readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes, but Beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode.\n\nOn April 8, 1935, Beckman renamed his company [[National Technical Laboratories]], formally acknowledging his new focus on the making of scientific instruments.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|131\u2013132}} The company rented larger quarters at 3330 Colorado Street,<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|135}} and began manufacturing pH meters. The pH meter is an important device for measuring the pH of a solution, and by 11 May 1939, sales were successful enough that Beckman left Caltech to become the full-time president of National Technical Laboratories.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|142\u2013143}} By 1940, Beckman was able to take out a loan to build his own 12,000 square foot factory in South Pasadena.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|147\u2013148}}\n\n==Spectrophotometry==\n\n===Ultraviolet===\n[[File:Beckman DK1 Spectrophotometer 2002.003.004b.tif|thumb|right|Beckman DK1 Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer]]\n[[File:James Feeman using Beckman DU spectrophotometer 2004.012.021.tif|thumb|right|Beckman DU spectrophotometer in use]]\nIn 1940, the equipment needed to measure light energy in the visible spectrum could cost a laboratory as much as $3,000, a huge amount at that time. There was also growing interest in examining ultraviolet spectra beyond that range. Just as Beckman had created a single easy-to-use instrument for measuring pH, he made it a goal to create an easy-to-use instrument for spectrophotometry.

For example, the role of vitamins in health was being studied, and scientists wanted to identify [[Vitamin A]]-rich foods to keep soldiers healthy.

There was a critical shortage of [[rubber]], which was used in jeep and airplane tires and in tanks. Natural sources from the Far East were unavailable because of the war, and scientists sought a reliable synthetic substitute. Beckman was approached  by the Office of Rubber Reserve about developing an [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrophotometer]] to aid in the study of chemicals such as [[toluene]] and [[butadiene]]. The Office of Rubber Reserve met secretly in Detroit  with [[Robert Brattain]] of the Shell Development Company, Arnold O. Beckman, and R. Bowling Barnes of American Cyanamid. Beckman was asked to secretly produce a hundred infrared spectrophotometers to be used by authorized government scientists, based on a design for a single-beam spectrophotometer which had already been developed by Robert Brattain for Shell.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|163}} The result was the  Beckman IR-1 Spectrophotometer.\n\nBy September 1942, the first of the instruments was being shipped. Approximately 75 IR-1s were made between 1942 and 1945 for use by the US synthetic-rubber effort. The researchers were not allowed to publish or discuss anything related to the new machines until after the war.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beckman Infrared Spectrometer|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/research/policy-center/oral-history-program/projects/rubber-matters/feature-beckman-ir.aspx|publisher=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=24 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204215034/http://www.chemheritage.org/research/policy-center/oral-history-program/projects/rubber-matters/feature-beckman-ir.aspx|archivedate=February 4, 2015}}</ref> Other researchers who were independently pursuing the development of infrared spectrometry, were able to publish and to develop instruments during this time without being affected by secrecy restrictions.\n\nBeckman had continued to develop the infrared spectrophotometer after the release of the IR-1. Facing stiff competition, he decided in 1953 to go forward with a radical redesign of the instrument.  The result was the IR-4, which could be operated using either a single or double beam of infrared light.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|165}} This allowed a user to take both the reference measurement and the sample measurement at the same time.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|163}}\n\n==Other secret projects==\n\n===Helipot===\n[[File:Beckman Helipot potentiometer SA1400A 2007.075.002.jpg|thumb|right|Beckman Helipot potentiometer SA1400A]]\n[[File:Helipot division unidentif st74cq71x-1.tiff| thumb|right|Helipot microcircuitry, 1966]]\nAt the same time that Beckman was approached about infrared spectrometry, he was contacted by Paul Rosenberg. Rosenberg worked at MIT's [[Radiation Laboratory]]. The lab was part of a secret network of research institutions in both the United States and Britain that were working to develop [[radar]], \"radio detecting and ranging\". The project was interested in Beckman because of the high quality of the tuning knobs or \"potentiometers\" which were used on his pH meters. Beckman had trademarked the design of the pH meter knobs, under the name \"helipot\" for \"helical potentiometer\". Rosenberg had found that the helipot was more precise, by a factor of ten, than other knobs. Nonetheless, for use in continuously moving airplanes, ships, or submarines, which might be under attack, a redesign would be needed to ensure that the knobs could withstand shocks and vibrations.\n\nBeckman was not allowed to tell his staff the reason behind the redesign, and they were not particularly interested in the problem; he eventually came up with a solution himself. Instead of using a wire wrapped around a coil, with pressure from a small spring to create a single contact point, he redesigned the knob to have a continuous groove, in which the contact point was contained. The contact point could then move smoothly and continuously, and could not be jarred out of contact. Beckman's Model A Helipot was in tremendous demand by the military. Within the first year of its production, its sales became 40% of the company's income. Beckman spun off a separate company, the Helipot Corporation, to take on the electronics component manufactory.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|167\u2013175}}\n\n===Pauling oxygen meter===\n[[File:Beckman D2 Oxygen analyzer and patient 2012 002 5132 cn69m4659.tiff|thumb|right|Beckman D2 Oxygen analyzer in use with patient, ca. 1950s]]\n\n[[File:Beckman Model D Oxygen Meter with infant incubator 73666474j.tiff|thumb|right|Beckman Model D Oxygen Meter, based on Pauling's design, in use with infant incubator]]\n\n[[Linus Pauling]] at Caltech was also doing secret work for the military. The [[National Defense Research Committee]] called a meeting on October 3, 1940, wanting an instrument that could reliably measure oxygen content in a mixture of gases, so that they could measure oxygen conditions in submarines and airplanes. Pauling designed the Pauling oxygen meter for them.  Originally approached to supply housing boxes for the meter by Holmes Sturdivant, Pauling's assistant, Beckman was soon asked to produce the entire instrument.\n\nWhile the board of the National Technical Laboratory was unwilling to support the secret project, whose details they could not be told, they agreed that Beckman was free to follow up on it independently. Beckman set up a second spinoff company, Arnold O. Beckman, Inc., for their manufacture.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|180\u2013185}} Creating the oxygen meter was a technical challenge, involving the creation of tiny, highly precise glass dumbbells. Beckman created a tiny glass-blowing machine which would generate a precisely measured puff of air to create the glass balls.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|185\u2013186}}\n\nAfter the war, Beckman developed oxygen analyzers for another market. They were used to monitor conditions in incubators for premature babies. Doctors at Johns Hopkins University used them to determine recommendations for healthy oxygen levels for incubators.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|185\u2013186}}\n\n===Manhattan Project===\nBeckman instruments were also used by the [[Manhattan Project]]. Scientists in the project were attempting to develop instruments to measure [[radiation]] in gas-filled, electrically charged [[ionization chamber]]s in nuclear reactors. It was difficult to get reliable readings because the signals were weak. Beckman realized that with a relatively minor adjustment \u2013 substituting an input-load resistor for the glass electrode \u2013 the pH meter could be adapted to do the job. As a result, Beckman Instruments developed a new product, the micro-ammeter.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|175\u2013177}}\n\nIn addition, Beckman developed a [[dosimeter]] for measuring exposure to radiation, to protect personnel of the Manhattan project. The dosimeter was a miniature ionization chamber, charged with 170 volts. It had a small calibrated scale on top, whose needle was a platinum-covered quartz fiber. The dosimeters were also manufactured by Beckman's spinoff company, Arnold O. Beckman, Inc.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\n==Battling smog==\nIn postwar Southern California, including the area of Pasadena where the Beckmans lived, [[smog]] was becoming an increasing topic of conversation, as well as an unpleasant experience. First characterized as \"gas attacks\" in 1943, suspicion fell on a variety of possible causes including the [[smudge pot]]s used by orange growers, the smoke produced by local industrial plants, and car exhausts.  The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce was one of the organizations concerned about the possible causes and effects of smog, as it related both to industry (and jobs) and to quality of life in the area.  Beckman was involved with the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIn 1947, California governor [[Earl Warren]] signed a statewide air pollution control act, authorizing the creation of Air Pollution Control Districts (APCDs) in every county of the state.<ref name=\"overview\">{{cite news|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/resourcecenter/teams/airquality/teamaq_law.pdf|title=An Overview of Federal Air Quality Legislation|authors=Tianjia Tang, Bob O'Loughlin, Mike Roberts, Edward Dancausse|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce asked Beckman to represent them in dealing with creation of a local APCD. The new APCD, when formed, asked Beckman to become the scientific consultant to the Air Pollution Control Officer.  He held the position from 1948 to 1952.\n\nThe Air Pollution Control Officer in question was Louis McCabe, a geologist with a background in chemical engineering. McCabe initially suspected that smog was a result of sulfur dioxide pollution, and proposed that the county convert the suspected pollutant into fertilizer through a costly process. Beckman was not convinced that sulfur dioxide was the real culprit behind Los Angeles smog. He visited Gary, Indiana, where steps were being taken to address sulfur dioxide pollution, and was struck by the characteristic smell of sulfur in the air. Returning, Beckman convinced McCabe that they needed to search for a different cause.\n\n[[File:Beckman patent 1071952 Sheet 1 crop.tif|thumb|upright|Patent 1071952, \"Apparatus for recording gas concentrations in the atmosphere\"]]\n\nBeckman got in touch with a Caltech professor who was working on smog, [[Arie Jan Haagen-Smit]].<ref>[https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/fighting-smog-in-los-angeles \u201cFighting Smog in Los Angeles\u201d], ''Distillations'' Podcast, 2018, [[Science History Institute]]</ref> They developed an apparatus to collect particulate matter from Los Angeles air, using a system of tubing intermittently cooled by liquid nitrogen. Haagen-Smit identified the substance they collected as a [[Organic peroxide|peroxy organic material]]. He agreed to spend a year studying the chemistry of smog. His results, presented in 1952, identified ozone and hydrocarbons from smokestacks, refineries and car exhausts as key ingredients in the formation of smog.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|220\u2013224}}\n\nWhile Haagen-Smit worked out the genesis of smog, Beckman developed an instrument to measure it. On October 7, 1952, he was granted a patent for an \"oxygen recorder\" that used [[Colorimetry|colorimetric methods]] to measure the levels of compounds present in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|224\u2013226}} Beckman Instruments eventually developed a range of instruments for various uses in monitoring and treating automobile exhaust and air pollution. They even produced \"air quality monitoring vans\", customized laboratories on wheels for use by government and industry.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|224\u2013226}}\n\nBeckman himself was approached by California governor [[Goodwin Knight]] to head a Special Committee on Air Pollution, to propose ways to combat smog.  At the end of 1953, the committee made its findings public. The \"Beckman Bible\" advised key steps to be taken immediately:<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|225}}\n* stopping vapor leaks from refineries and filling stations\n* establishing standards for automobile exhausts\n* converting from diesel trucks and buses to propane\n* asking polluting industries to restrict pollutants or move away from cities\n* banning open burning of trash\n* developing regional mass transportation\n\nBeckman Instruments also acquired the Liston-Becker Instrument Company in June 1955. Founded by [[Max D. Liston]], Liston-Becker had a successful record in the development of [[infrared gas analyzer]]s.<ref name=\"hundred\"/>{{rp|207\u2013208}} Liston developed instruments to measure [[smog]] and car exhaust emissions, essential to attempts to improve [[Los Angeles]] air quality in the 1950s.<ref name=Model28>{{cite web|title=Liston-Becker Model 28 Exhaust Gas Analyzer|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/liston-becker-model-28-exhaust-gas-analyzer |publisher=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=20 March 2018|date=2016-08-02 }}</ref>\n\nBeckman helped to create the Air Pollution Foundation, a non-profit organization to support research on finding solutions to smog, and educating the public about scientific issues related to smog.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|225}}\n\nIn 1954, he became a member of the board of directors of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and chairman of its Air Pollution Committee. He advocated for stronger powers for the APCD, and encouraged industry, business, and citizens to support for their work.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|226}} He helped the Chamber of Commerce to develop a unified approach to monitoring smog, broadcasting smog alerts, and addressing the smog problem. On January 25, 1956, he became president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. He identified the two key issues of his term as battling smog, and supporting the collaboration of local science, technology, industry, and education.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|227}}\n\nBeckman recognized that air quality would not improve overnight. His work with air quality continued for years, and brought him national attention. In 1967, Beckman was appointed to the Federal Air Quality Board for a four-year term, by President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|228}}\n\n==Electronics==\nJohn J. Murdock held substantial stock in National Technical Laboratories. He and Arnold Beckman signed a stock option agreement by which Beckman could purchase Murdock's NTL stock from his estate after his death. When Murdock died in 1948, Beckman was able to gain a controlling interest in the company.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|195\u2013196}} On April 27, 1950, National Technical Laboratories was renamed Beckman Instruments, Incorporated. In 1952, Beckman Instruments became a publicly traded company on the [[New York Curb Exchange]], generating new capital for expansion, including overseas expansion.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|197,232\u2013233}}\n\n===Cermets===\nHelipot Corporation, the spinoff company that Beckman had created when NTL's board were dubious about electronics, was reincorporated into Beckman Instruments and became the Helipot Division in 1958. Helipot researchers were experimenting with [[cermet]]s, composite materials made by mixing [[ceramic]]s and [[metals]].  Potentiometers made with cermet instead of metal were more heat-resistant, suitable for use at extreme temperatures.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|211}}\n\n===Centrifuges===\nIn 1954, Beckman Instruments acquired [[ultracentrifuge]] maker Spinco (Specialized Instruments Corp.), founded by Edward Greydon Pickels in 1946. This acquisition was the basis of Beckman's Spinco [[centrifuge]] division. The division went on to design and manufacture a range of preparative and analytical ultracentrifuges.<ref name=\"hundred\" />\n\n===Semiconductors===\nIn 1955, Beckman was contacted by [[William Shockley]]. Shockley, who had been one of Beckman's students at Caltech, led [[Bell Labs]] research program into [[Semiconductor|semiconductor technology]]. Semiconductors were, in some ways, similar to cermets. Shockley wanted to create a new company, and asked Beckman to serve on the board. After considerable discussion, Beckman became more closely involved: he and Shockley signed a letter of intent to create the [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]] as a subsidiary of Beckman Instruments, under  William Shockley's direction. The new group would specialize in semiconductors, beginning with the automated production of [[Diffusion transistor|diffused-base transistors]].<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|237\u2013241}}<ref name=IEEE20131129>{{cite journal|last=Brock|first=David C.|title=How William Shockley's Robot Dream Helped Launch Silicon Valley|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=29 Nov 2013|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/how-william-shockleys-robot-dream-helped-launch-silicon-valley|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nBecause Shockley's aging mother lived in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], Shockley wanted to establish the laboratory in nearby [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View, California]]. [[Frederick Terman]], provost at [[Stanford University]], offered the firm space in Stanford's new industrial park. The firm launched in February 1956, the same year that Shockley received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] along with [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Houser Brattain]] \"for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1956 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1956/index.html |accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>  Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as Silicon Valley.\n\nShockley, however, lacked experience in business and industrial management.  Moreover, he decided that the lab would research an invention of his own, the four-layer diode, rather than developing the diffused silicon transistor that he and Beckman had agreed upon. Beckman was reassured by his engineers that the scientific ideas behind Shockley's project were still sound. When appealed to by members of Shockley's lab, Beckman chose not to interfere with its management.<ref name=IEEE20131129/>  In 1957, eight leading scientists including [[Gordon Moore]] and [[Robert Noyce]] left Shockley's group to form a competing startup, [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], which would successfully develop silicon transistors.  In 1960, Beckman sold the Shockley subsidiary to the Clevite Transistor Company, ending his formal association with semiconductors.  Nonetheless, Beckman had been an essential backer of the new industry in its initial stages.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|237\u2013250}}\n\n===Computers and automation===\n[[File:First spacecraft picture of the Moon PIA02975.jpg|thumb|right |The first picture of the Moon taken by a US spacecraft, Ranger 7, on 31 July 1964]]\n\nBeckman also saw that computers and automation offered a myriad of opportunities for integration into instruments, and the development of new instruments.  Beckman Instruments purchased Berkeley Scientific Company in the 1950s, and later developed a Systems Division within [[Beckman Coulter|Beckman Instruments]] \"to develop and build industrial data systems for automation\".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/wsj/doc/132348380.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Jul+9%2C+1957&author=&pub=Wall+Street+Journal++%281923+-+Current+file%29&edition=&startpage=12&desc=Beekman+Instruments+Data+Systems | title=Beekman Instruments Data Systems | date=9 July 1957 | newspaper=Wall Street Journal | page=12}}</ref>  Berkeley developed the EASE [[analog computer]], and by 1959 Beckman had contracts with major companies in the aerospace, space, and defense industries, including [[Boeing|Boeing Aerospace]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft]], [[North American Aviation]], and [[Lear Siegler]].

He was the youngest son of George Beckman, a blacksmith, and his second wife Elizabeth Ellen Jewkes.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|5}} He was curious about the world from an early age. When he was nine, Beckman found an old chemistry textbook, [[Joel Dorman Steele]]'s ''Fourteen Weeks in Chemistry'', and began trying out the experiments.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|9}} His father encouraged his scientific interests by letting him convert a toolshed into a laboratory.\n\nBeckman's mother, Elizabeth, died of diabetes in 1912. Beckman's father sold his blacksmith shop, and became a travelling salesman for blacksmithing tools and materials.  A housekeeper, Hattie Lange, was engaged to look after the Beckman children. Arnold Beckman earned money as a \"practice pianist\" with a local band, and as an \"official cream tester\" running a centrifuge for a local store.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|12\u201313}}\n\nIn 1914, the Beckman family moved to Normal, located just north of [[Bloomington, Illinois]], so that the young Beckmans could attend [[University High School (Normal)|University High School]] in [[Normal, Illinois|Normal]], a \"laboratory school\" associated with [[Illinois State University]].<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|16}} In 1915 they moved to Bloomington itself,<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|17\u201318}} but continued to attend University High, where Arnold Beckman obtained permission to take university level classes from professor of chemistry Howard W. Adams.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|17\u201318}} While still in high school, Arnold started his own business, \"Bloomington Research Laboratories\", doing analytic chemistry for the local gas company.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|21\u201322}} He also performed at night as a movie-house pianist, and played with local dance bands.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|24\u201325}} He graduated valedictorian of his class, with an average of 89.41 over four years, the highest attained.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|27}}\n\nBeckman was allowed to leave school a few months early to contribute to the [[First World War]] effort in early 1918 by working as a chemist.  At Keystone Steel and Iron he took samples of molten iron and tested them to see if the chemical composition of carbon, sulfur, manganese and phosphorus was suitable for pouring steel.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|26}}\n\nWhen Beckman turned 18 in August 1918, he enlisted in the [[United States Marines]]. After three months at marine boot camp on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]],<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|31}} he was sent to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], for transit to the war in Europe. Because of a train delay, another unit embarked in place of Beckman's unit. Then, counted into groups in the barracks, Beckman missed being sent to [[Russia]] by one space in line.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|32}} Instead, Arnold spent [[Thanksgiving]] at the local [[YMCA]], where he met 17-year-old Mabel Stone Meinzer, who was helping to serve the meal.  Mabel would become his wife.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|33}}  A few days later, the [[First Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|armistice]] was signed, ending the war.\n\n==University education==\nBeckman attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] beginning in the fall of 1918. During his freshman year, he worked with [[Carl Shipp Marvel]] on the synthesis of organic mercury compounds, but both men became ill from exposure to toxic [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|42}} As a result, Beckman changed his major from organic chemistry to physical chemistry, where he worked with Worth Rodebush, T. A.

A. White.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|55}}\n\nSoon after arriving at the University of Illinois, Beckman joined the [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|55}} He was initiated into Zeta chapter of [[Alpha Chi Sigma]], the chemistry fraternity, in 1921<ref name=AlphaChiSigma>{{cite web|title=Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame|url=http://www.alphachisigma.org/page.aspx?pid=268|publisher=Alpha Chi Sigma Fraternity|accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref> and the [[Gamma Alpha]] Graduate Scientific Fraternity in December 1922.\n\nBeckman decided to go to [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) for his doctorate. He stayed there for a year, before returning to New York to be near his fianc\u00e9e, Mabel, who was working as a secretary for the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society]]. He found a job with [[Western Electric]]'s engineering department, the precursor to the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]. Working with [[Walter A. Shewhart]],<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|61}} Beckman developed [[quality control]] programs for the manufacture of [[vacuum tube]]s and learned about circuit design. It was here that Beckman discovered his interest in [[electronics]].\n\n[[File:Mabel and Arnold Beckman 4.23.tif|thumb|right| Mabel and Arnold Beckman]]\n\nBeckman married Mabel on June 10, 1925.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|68}} In 1926 the couple moved back to California and Beckman resumed his studies at Caltech. He became interested in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor, [[Roscoe G. Dickinson]], on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light. It worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a [[thermocouple]], converting the incident heat into electricity, which drove a [[galvanometer]]. After receiving a Ph.D. in photochemistry in 1928<ref name=OralHistory /> for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions, Beckman was asked to stay on at Caltech as an instructor and then as a professor.<ref>Beckman, A. O. (1928). The Photochemical Decomposition of Hydrogen Azide (Doctoral dissertation, California Institute of Technology)|URL=http://caltech.tind.io/record/571245</ref> [[Linus Pauling]], another of [[Roscoe G. Dickinson]]'s graduate students, was also asked to stay on at Caltech.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|99}}\n\nIn 1933, Beckman and his family built a home in [[Altadena, California]], in the foothills and adjacent to Pasadena. They lived in Altadena for over 27 years, raising their family.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Teaching and consultancy at Caltech==\n[[File:Beckman lab Caltech 3.31.tif|thumb|right|Arnold Beckman's laboratory at Caltech]]\nDuring his time at Caltech, Beckman was active in teaching at both the introductory and advanced graduate levels. Beckman shared his expertise in glass-blowing by teaching classes in the machine shop. He also taught classes in the design and use of research instruments.  Beckman dealt first-hand with the chemists' need for good instrumentation as manager of the chemistry department's instrument shop.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|96\u201399}} Beckman's interest in electronics made him very popular within the chemistry department at Caltech, as he was very skilled in building [[measuring instruments]].\n\nOver the time that he was at Caltech, the focus of the department increasingly moved towards pure science and away from chemical engineering and applied chemistry. [[Arthur Amos Noyes]], head of the chemistry division, encouraged both Beckman and chemical engineer William Lacey to be in contact with real-world engineers and chemists, and  [[Robert Andrews Millikan]], Caltech's president, referred technical questions to Beckman from government and businesses.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|98\u2013101}} With their blessing, Beckman began accepting outside work as a scientific and technical consultant. He also acted as a scientific expert in legal trials.\n\n==National Inking Appliance Company==\n[[File:National Inking Appliance Company original building pasadena 5x21tf694.tiff |thumb|right |Original site of the National Inking Appliance Company, later National Technical Laboratories]]\n\nIn 1934, Millikan referred I. H. Lyons from the National Postal Meter Company to Arnold Beckman. Lyons wanted a non-clogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines, instead of having clerks lick stamps.<ref name=Jaehnig>{{cite book|last1=Jaehnig|first1=Kenton G.|title=Finding Aid to the Beckman Historical Collection 1911 - 2011 (Bulk 1935 - 2004 )|url=http://othmerlib.sciencehistory.org/record=b1072260~S6|website=Science History Institute|quote=\"Click on 'Beckman Historical Collection Finding Aid' to go to full document.\"|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> Beckman's solution was to make ink with [[butyric acid]], a malodorous substance. Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it. Beckman decided to make it himself. He started the National Inking Appliance Company, obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker Fred Henson and hiring two Caltech students, Robert Barton and Henry Fracker. Beckman developed and took out a couple of patents for re-inking [[typewriter ribbon]]s, but marketing them was not successful. This was Beckman's first experience at running a company and marketing a product, and while this first product failed, Beckman repurposed the company for another product.<ref name=\"hundred\"/>{{rp|124\u2013129}}\n\n==pH Meter==\n{{see also|pH meter}}\n[[File:Beckman Model M pH Meter 2006.072.002.tif |thumb|right | Beckman Model M pH Meter]]\n[[File:George Garcelon using Beckman pH meter 2004.012.020.tif|thumb|right|Beckman Portable pH meter in use]]\n\n[[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist Growers]] was having problems with its own manufacturing process. Lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into [[pectin]] or [[citric acid]], with [[sulfur dioxide]] used as a preservative. Sunkist needed to know the [[pH|acidity of the product]] at any given time, and the colorimetric methods then in use, such as readings from [[litmus paper]], did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them.  Chemist Glen Joseph at Sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogen-ion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically, but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes, and non-reactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile.\n\nJoseph approached Beckman, who proposed that instead of trying to increase the sensitivity of his measurements, he amplify his results. Beckman, familiar with glassblowing, electricity, and chemistry, suggested a design for a vacuum-tube amplifier and ended up building a working apparatus for Joseph.  The glass electrode used to measure pH was placed in a grid circuit in the vacuum tube, producing an amplified signal which could then be read by an electronic meter. The prototype was so useful that Joseph requested a second unit.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|124\u2013129}}\n\nBeckman saw an opportunity, and rethinking the project, decided to create a complete chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists. By October 1934, he had registered patent application US Patent No. 2,058,761 for his \"acidimeter\", later renamed the pH meter.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|131}}<ref name=Chicago /> The Arthur H. Thomas Company, a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in Philadelphia, was willing to try selling it.  Although it was priced expensively at $195, roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time, it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components, about $500.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|134\u2013135}} The original pH meter weighed in at nearly 7&nbsp;kg, but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment. The earliest meter had a design glitch, in that the pH readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes, but Beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode.\n\nOn April 8, 1935, Beckman renamed his company [[National Technical Laboratories]], formally acknowledging his new focus on the making of scientific instruments.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|131\u2013132}} The company rented larger quarters at 3330 Colorado Street,<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|135}} and began manufacturing pH meters. The pH meter is an important device for measuring the pH of a solution, and by 11 May 1939, sales were successful enough that Beckman left Caltech to become the full-time president of National Technical Laboratories.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|142\u2013143}} By 1940, Beckman was able to take out a loan to build his own 12,000 square foot factory in South Pasadena.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|147\u2013148}}\n\n==Spectrophotometry==\n\n===Ultraviolet===\n[[File:Beckman DK1 Spectrophotometer 2002.003.004b.tif|thumb|right|Beckman DK1 Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer]]\n[[File:James Feeman using Beckman DU spectrophotometer 2004.012.021.tif|thumb|right|Beckman DU spectrophotometer in use]]\nIn 1940, the equipment needed to measure light energy in the visible spectrum could cost a laboratory as much as $3,000, a huge amount at that time. There was also growing interest in examining ultraviolet spectra beyond that range. Just as Beckman had created a single easy-to-use instrument for measuring pH, he made it a goal to create an easy-to-use instrument for spectrophotometry. Beckman's research team, led by [[Howard Cary]], developed several models.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|148\u2013149}}\n\nThe new spectrophotometers used a prism to separate light into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum. They allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance, giving a standardized \"fingerprint\", characteristic of a compound.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|151}} With Beckman's model D, later known as the [[DU spectrophotometer]], National Technical Laboratories successfully provided the first easy-to-use single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for [[Ultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy|ultraviolet-absorption spectrophotometry]].<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|153}} The user could insert a sample, dial up the desired wavelength of light, and read the amount of absorption of that frequency from a simple meter.  It produced accurate absorption spectra in both the ultraviolet and the visible regions of the spectrum with relative ease and repeatable accuracy.<ref name=AHist>{{cite web|title=Beckman DU Spectrophotometer|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_399 |publisher=National Museum of American History|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>  The National Bureau of Standards ran tests to certify that the DU's results were accurate and repeatable and recommended its use.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|156}}\n\nBeckman's DU spectrophotometer has been referred to as the \"Model T\" of scientific instruments: \"This device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis, by allowing researchers to perform a 99.9% accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes, as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only 25% accuracy.\"<ref name=MIT>{{cite web|title=Arnold O.

For example, the role of vitamins in health was being studied, and scientists wanted to identify [[Vitamin A]]-rich foods to keep soldiers healthy. Previous  methods involved feeding rats for several weeks, then performing a biopsy to estimate Vitamin A levels.  The DU spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes.<ref name=LabNews>{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Andrew|title=Leading the way in chemical instrumentation|journal=Laboratory News|date=September 21, 2007|url=http://www.labnews.co.uk/features/leading-the-way-in-chemical-instrumentation/|accessdate=6 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306204312/http://www.labnews.co.uk/features/leading-the-way-in-chemical-instrumentation/|archive-date=6 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The DU spectrophotometer was also an important tool for scientists studying and producing the new wonder drug penicillin.<ref name=Smutzer>{{cite news|last=Smutzer|first=Gregory |title=Spectrophotometers: An Absorbing Tale|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=The Scientist|date=October 15, 2001|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/13639/title/Spectrophotometers--An-Absorbing-Tale/}}</ref> By the end of the war, American pharmaceutical companies were producing 650 billion units of penicillin each month.<ref name=Penicillin>{{cite web|last=Markel|first=Howard|title=The Real Story Behind Penicillin|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/the-real-story-behind-the-worlds-first-antibiotic/|work=September 27, 2013|publisher=PBS Newshour|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=2013-09-27}}</ref> Much of the work done in this area during World War II was kept secret until after the war.<ref name=\"Sneader\">{{cite book|last1=Sneader|first1=Walter|title=Drug Discovery: A History|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=9780470359297|page=294 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb6BOkj9fK4C&pg=PA294}}</ref>\n\n===Infrared===\n<!-- remove image for now, due to concerns about loan agreement with collections\n[[File:Beckman Ir-1 Spectrophotometer, ca. 1941.jpg|thumb|220px|Beckman IR-1 Spectrophotometer, ca. 1941]]\n-->\nBeckman and his company were involved in a number of secret projects. There was a critical shortage of [[rubber]], which was used in jeep and airplane tires and in tanks. Natural sources from the Far East were unavailable because of the war, and scientists sought a reliable synthetic substitute. Beckman was approached  by the Office of Rubber Reserve about developing an [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrophotometer]] to aid in the study of chemicals such as [[toluene]] and [[butadiene]]. The Office of Rubber Reserve met secretly in Detroit  with [[Robert Brattain]] of the Shell Development Company, Arnold O. Beckman, and R. Bowling Barnes of American Cyanamid. Beckman was asked to secretly produce a hundred infrared spectrophotometers to be used by authorized government scientists, based on a design for a single-beam spectrophotometer which had already been developed by Robert Brattain for Shell.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|163}} The result was the  Beckman IR-1 Spectrophotometer.\n\nBy September 1942, the first of the instruments was being shipped. Approximately 75 IR-1s were made between 1942 and 1945 for use by the US synthetic-rubber effort. The researchers were not allowed to publish or discuss anything related to the new machines until after the war.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beckman Infrared Spectrometer|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/research/policy-center/oral-history-program/projects/rubber-matters/feature-beckman-ir.aspx|publisher=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=24 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204215034/http://www.chemheritage.org/research/policy-center/oral-history-program/projects/rubber-matters/feature-beckman-ir.aspx|archivedate=February 4, 2015}}</ref> Other researchers who were independently pursuing the development of infrared spectrometry, were able to publish and to develop instruments during this time without being affected by secrecy restrictions.\n\nBeckman had continued to develop the infrared spectrophotometer after the release of the IR-1. Facing stiff competition, he decided in 1953 to go forward with a radical redesign of the instrument.  The result was the IR-4, which could be operated using either a single or double beam of infrared light.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|165}} This allowed a user to take both the reference measurement and the sample measurement at the same time.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|163}}\n\n==Other secret projects==\n\n===Helipot===\n[[File:Beckman Helipot potentiometer SA1400A 2007.075.002.jpg|thumb|right|Beckman Helipot potentiometer SA1400A]]\n[[File:Helipot division unidentif st74cq71x-1.tiff| thumb|right|Helipot microcircuitry, 1966]]\nAt the same time that Beckman was approached about infrared spectrometry, he was contacted by Paul Rosenberg. Rosenberg worked at MIT's [[Radiation Laboratory]]. The lab was part of a secret network of research institutions in both the United States and Britain that were working to develop [[radar]], \"radio detecting and ranging\". The project was interested in Beckman because of the high quality of the tuning knobs or \"potentiometers\" which were used on his pH meters. Beckman had trademarked the design of the pH meter knobs, under the name \"helipot\" for \"helical potentiometer\". Rosenberg had found that the helipot was more precise, by a factor of ten, than other knobs. Nonetheless, for use in continuously moving airplanes, ships, or submarines, which might be under attack, a redesign would be needed to ensure that the knobs could withstand shocks and vibrations.\n\nBeckman was not allowed to tell his staff the reason behind the redesign, and they were not particularly interested in the problem; he eventually came up with a solution himself. Instead of using a wire wrapped around a coil, with pressure from a small spring to create a single contact point, he redesigned the knob to have a continuous groove, in which the contact point was contained. The contact point could then move smoothly and continuously, and could not be jarred out of contact. Beckman's Model A Helipot was in tremendous demand by the military. Within the first year of its production, its sales became 40% of the company's income. Beckman spun off a separate company, the Helipot Corporation, to take on the electronics component manufactory.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|167\u2013175}}\n\n===Pauling oxygen meter===\n[[File:Beckman D2 Oxygen analyzer and patient 2012 002 5132 cn69m4659.tiff|thumb|right|Beckman D2 Oxygen analyzer in use with patient, ca. 1950s]]\n\n[[File:Beckman Model D Oxygen Meter with infant incubator 73666474j.tiff|thumb|right|Beckman Model D Oxygen Meter, based on Pauling's design, in use with infant incubator]]\n\n[[Linus Pauling]] at Caltech was also doing secret work for the military. The [[National Defense Research Committee]] called a meeting on October 3, 1940, wanting an instrument that could reliably measure oxygen content in a mixture of gases, so that they could measure oxygen conditions in submarines and airplanes. Pauling designed the Pauling oxygen meter for them.  Originally approached to supply housing boxes for the meter by Holmes Sturdivant, Pauling's assistant, Beckman was soon asked to produce the entire instrument.\n\nWhile the board of the National Technical Laboratory was unwilling to support the secret project, whose details they could not be told, they agreed that Beckman was free to follow up on it independently. Beckman set up a second spinoff company, Arnold O. Beckman, Inc., for their manufacture.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|180\u2013185}} Creating the oxygen meter was a technical challenge, involving the creation of tiny, highly precise glass dumbbells. Beckman created a tiny glass-blowing machine which would generate a precisely measured puff of air to create the glass balls.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|185\u2013186}}\n\nAfter the war, Beckman developed oxygen analyzers for another market. They were used to monitor conditions in incubators for premature babies. Doctors at Johns Hopkins University used them to determine recommendations for healthy oxygen levels for incubators.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|185\u2013186}}\n\n===Manhattan Project===\nBeckman instruments were also used by the [[Manhattan Project]]. Scientists in the project were attempting to develop instruments to measure [[radiation]] in gas-filled, electrically charged [[ionization chamber]]s in nuclear reactors. It was difficult to get reliable readings because the signals were weak. Beckman realized that with a relatively minor adjustment \u2013 substituting an input-load resistor for the glass electrode \u2013 the pH meter could be adapted to do the job. As a result, Beckman Instruments developed a new product, the micro-ammeter.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|175\u2013177}}\n\nIn addition, Beckman developed a [[dosimeter]] for measuring exposure to radiation, to protect personnel of the Manhattan project. The dosimeter was a miniature ionization chamber, charged with 170 volts. It had a small calibrated scale on top, whose needle was a platinum-covered quartz fiber. The dosimeters were also manufactured by Beckman's spinoff company, Arnold O. Beckman, Inc.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\n==Battling smog==\nIn postwar Southern California, including the area of Pasadena where the Beckmans lived, [[smog]] was becoming an increasing topic of conversation, as well as an unpleasant experience. First characterized as \"gas attacks\" in 1943, suspicion fell on a variety of possible causes including the [[smudge pot]]s used by orange growers, the smoke produced by local industrial plants, and car exhausts.  The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce was one of the organizations concerned about the possible causes and effects of smog, as it related both to industry (and jobs) and to quality of life in the area.  Beckman was involved with the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIn 1947, California governor [[Earl Warren]] signed a statewide air pollution control act, authorizing the creation of Air Pollution Control Districts (APCDs) in every county of the state.<ref name=\"overview\">{{cite news|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/resourcecenter/teams/airquality/teamaq_law.pdf|title=An Overview of Federal Air Quality Legislation|authors=Tianjia Tang, Bob O'Loughlin, Mike Roberts, Edward Dancausse|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce asked Beckman to represent them in dealing with creation of a local APCD. The new APCD, when formed, asked Beckman to become the scientific consultant to the Air Pollution Control Officer.  He held the position from 1948 to 1952.\n\nThe Air Pollution Control Officer in question was Louis McCabe, a geologist with a background in chemical engineering. McCabe initially suspected that smog was a result of sulfur dioxide pollution, and proposed that the county convert the suspected pollutant into fertilizer through a costly process. Beckman was not convinced that sulfur dioxide was the real culprit behind Los Angeles smog. He visited Gary, Indiana, where steps were being taken to address sulfur dioxide pollution, and was struck by the characteristic smell of sulfur in the air. Returning, Beckman convinced McCabe that they needed to search for a different cause.\n\n[[File:Beckman patent 1071952 Sheet 1 crop.tif|thumb|upright|Patent 1071952, \"Apparatus for recording gas concentrations in the atmosphere\"]]\n\nBeckman got in touch with a Caltech professor who was working on smog, [[Arie Jan Haagen-Smit]].<ref>[https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/fighting-smog-in-los-angeles \u201cFighting Smog in Los Angeles\u201d], ''Distillations'' Podcast, 2018, [[Science History Institute]]</ref> They developed an apparatus to collect particulate matter from Los Angeles air, using a system of tubing intermittently cooled by liquid nitrogen. Haagen-Smit identified the substance they collected as a [[Organic peroxide|peroxy organic material]]. He agreed to spend a year studying the chemistry of smog. His results, presented in 1952, identified ozone and hydrocarbons from smokestacks, refineries and car exhausts as key ingredients in the formation of smog.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|220\u2013224}}\n\nWhile Haagen-Smit worked out the genesis of smog, Beckman developed an instrument to measure it. On October 7, 1952, he was granted a patent for an \"oxygen recorder\" that used [[Colorimetry|colorimetric methods]] to measure the levels of compounds present in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|224\u2013226}} Beckman Instruments eventually developed a range of instruments for various uses in monitoring and treating automobile exhaust and air pollution. They even produced \"air quality monitoring vans\", customized laboratories on wheels for use by government and industry.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|224\u2013226}}\n\nBeckman himself was approached by California governor [[Goodwin Knight]] to head a Special Committee on Air Pollution, to propose ways to combat smog.  At the end of 1953, the committee made its findings public. The \"Beckman Bible\" advised key steps to be taken immediately:<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|225}}\n* stopping vapor leaks from refineries and filling stations\n* establishing standards for automobile exhausts\n* converting from diesel trucks and buses to propane\n* asking polluting industries to restrict pollutants or move away from cities\n* banning open burning of trash\n* developing regional mass transportation\n\nBeckman Instruments also acquired the Liston-Becker Instrument Company in June 1955. Founded by [[Max D. Liston]], Liston-Becker had a successful record in the development of [[infrared gas analyzer]]s.<ref name=\"hundred\"/>{{rp|207\u2013208}} Liston developed instruments to measure [[smog]] and car exhaust emissions, essential to attempts to improve [[Los Angeles]] air quality in the 1950s.<ref name=Model28>{{cite web|title=Liston-Becker Model 28 Exhaust Gas Analyzer|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/liston-becker-model-28-exhaust-gas-analyzer |publisher=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=20 March 2018|date=2016-08-02 }}</ref>\n\nBeckman helped to create the Air Pollution Foundation, a non-profit organization to support research on finding solutions to smog, and educating the public about scientific issues related to smog.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|225}}\n\nIn 1954, he became a member of the board of directors of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and chairman of its Air Pollution Committee. He advocated for stronger powers for the APCD, and encouraged industry, business, and citizens to support for their work.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|226}} He helped the Chamber of Commerce to develop a unified approach to monitoring smog, broadcasting smog alerts, and addressing the smog problem. On January 25, 1956, he became president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. He identified the two key issues of his term as battling smog, and supporting the collaboration of local science, technology, industry, and education.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|227}}\n\nBeckman recognized that air quality would not improve overnight. His work with air quality continued for years, and brought him national attention. In 1967, Beckman was appointed to the Federal Air Quality Board for a four-year term, by President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|228}}\n\n==Electronics==\nJohn J. Murdock held substantial stock in National Technical Laboratories. He and Arnold Beckman signed a stock option agreement by which Beckman could purchase Murdock's NTL stock from his estate after his death. When Murdock died in 1948, Beckman was able to gain a controlling interest in the company.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|195\u2013196}} On April 27, 1950, National Technical Laboratories was renamed Beckman Instruments, Incorporated. In 1952, Beckman Instruments became a publicly traded company on the [[New York Curb Exchange]], generating new capital for expansion, including overseas expansion.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|197,232\u2013233}}\n\n===Cermets===\nHelipot Corporation, the spinoff company that Beckman had created when NTL's board were dubious about electronics, was reincorporated into Beckman Instruments and became the Helipot Division in 1958. Helipot researchers were experimenting with [[cermet]]s, composite materials made by mixing [[ceramic]]s and [[metals]].  Potentiometers made with cermet instead of metal were more heat-resistant, suitable for use at extreme temperatures.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|211}}\n\n===Centrifuges===\nIn 1954, Beckman Instruments acquired [[ultracentrifuge]] maker Spinco (Specialized Instruments Corp.), founded by Edward Greydon Pickels in 1946. This acquisition was the basis of Beckman's Spinco [[centrifuge]] division. The division went on to design and manufacture a range of preparative and analytical ultracentrifuges.<ref name=\"hundred\" />\n\n===Semiconductors===\nIn 1955, Beckman was contacted by [[William Shockley]]. Shockley, who had been one of Beckman's students at Caltech, led [[Bell Labs]] research program into [[Semiconductor|semiconductor technology]]. Semiconductors were, in some ways, similar to cermets. Shockley wanted to create a new company, and asked Beckman to serve on the board. After considerable discussion, Beckman became more closely involved: he and Shockley signed a letter of intent to create the [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]] as a subsidiary of Beckman Instruments, under  William Shockley's direction. The new group would specialize in semiconductors, beginning with the automated production of [[Diffusion transistor|diffused-base transistors]].<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|237\u2013241}}<ref name=IEEE20131129>{{cite journal|last=Brock|first=David C.|title=How William Shockley's Robot Dream Helped Launch Silicon Valley|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=29 Nov 2013|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/how-william-shockleys-robot-dream-helped-launch-silicon-valley|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nBecause Shockley's aging mother lived in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], Shockley wanted to establish the laboratory in nearby [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View, California]]. [[Frederick Terman]], provost at [[Stanford University]], offered the firm space in Stanford's new industrial park. The firm launched in February 1956, the same year that Shockley received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] along with [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Houser Brattain]] \"for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1956 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1956/index.html |accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>  Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as Silicon Valley.\n\nShockley, however, lacked experience in business and industrial management.  Moreover, he decided that the lab would research an invention of his own, the four-layer diode, rather than developing the diffused silicon transistor that he and Beckman had agreed upon. Beckman was reassured by his engineers that the scientific ideas behind Shockley's project were still sound. When appealed to by members of Shockley's lab, Beckman chose not to interfere with its management.<ref name=IEEE20131129/>  In 1957, eight leading scientists including [[Gordon Moore]] and [[Robert Noyce]] left Shockley's group to form a competing startup, [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], which would successfully develop silicon transistors.  In 1960, Beckman sold the Shockley subsidiary to the Clevite Transistor Company, ending his formal association with semiconductors.  Nonetheless, Beckman had been an essential backer of the new industry in its initial stages.<ref name=\"hundred\" />{{rp|237\u2013250}}\n\n===Computers and automation===\n[[File:First spacecraft picture of the Moon PIA02975.jpg|thumb|right |The first picture of the Moon taken by a US spacecraft, Ranger 7, on 31 July 1964]]\n\nBeckman also saw that computers and automation offered a myriad of opportunities for integration into instruments, and the development of new instruments.

It is most useful in close combat, as it focuses on elbow, knee, shoulder and hip strikes. When blocking an attack or nearing an opponent, baji quan techniques emphasize striking major points of vulnerability, namely the thorax (trunk of the body), legs and neck.\n[[File:Master zhou baji quan posture.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zhou Jingxuan of Tianjin, holding a typical Baji Quan posture. The sideways-protruding elbow is often used for striking in this art.]]\n\nThe \"six big ways of opening\" (''liu da kai'' {{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u5927\u958b}}) are:<ref>{{cite book|last=Jaw|first=Peter|title=The Treasure Book of Chinese Martial Arts|publisher=Authorhouse|volume=1|year=2004|isbn=978-1-4140-7573-0}}</ref>\n\n* ''Ding'' {{zh|labels=no|t=\u9802}}: using the fist, elbow or shoulder to push forward and upward.\n* ''Bao'' {{zh|labels=no|c=\u62b1}}: putting arms together as if hugging someone.

There are twenty fist forms, which include twelve Baji Small Structure Fists, Baji Black Tiger Fist, Baji Dan Zhai, Baji Dan Da/Dui Da, Baji Luohan Gong, and Baji Si Lang Kuan. There are eight weapons forms, including Liu He Da [[Qiang (spear)|Qiang]] (spear), Chun Yang [[Jian]] (sword), San Yin [[Dao (sword)|Dao]] (sabre), Xing Zhe Bang (staff), [[Pudao]], and Chun Qiu [[Dao (sword)|Da Dao]] (a long two-handed heavy blade, used by Generals sitting on their horses).\n\nMost schools focus on a much smaller curriculum. Standard across almost all groups are Xiaobaji and Dabaji; two weapons forms, the sabre and the spear; a two-man training routine called Baji Duijie or Baji Duida and a series of 8 short attacking methods called the \"Ba Shi\" (Eight Postures), which are derived from the art of Shaolin Jingang Bashi.\n\n=== Power generation and expression ===\nThe major features of baji include elbow strikes, arm/fist punches, hip checks and strikes with the shoulder. All techniques are executed with a short power, developed through training; among Chinese martial artists, baji is known for its fast movements. Baji focuses on infighting, entering from a longer range with a distinctive charging step (''zhen jiao'').\n\nThe essence of baji quan lies in [[Neijin|jin]], or power-issuing methods, particularly [[fa jin]] (explosive power). The style contains six types of ''jin'', eight different ways to hit and several principles of power usage. Most of baji quan's moves utilize a one-hit push-strike method from very close range. The bulk of the damage is dealt through the momentary acceleration that travels up from the waist to the limb and further magnified by the charging step known as ''zhen jiao''.\n\nThe mechanics of ''jin'' are developed through many years of practice and baji quan is known for its strenuous lower-body training and its emphasis on the [[horse stance]].<ref name=\"Bajiquan\"/> Its horse stance is higher than that of typical [[Changquan|Long Fist]] styles. Like other styles, there is also \"the arrow-bow stance\", \"the one-leg stance\", \"the empty stance\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u865b\u6b65|p=x\u016bb\u00f9}}), \"the drop stance\" ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u4ec6\u6b65|p=p\u016bb\u00f9}}), etc. There are eight different hand poses, in addition to different types of breathing and ''zhen jiao''.\n\n== Influences ==\nBaji focuses on being more direct, culminating in powerful, fast strikes that will render an opponent unable to continue. Even so, there are some styles that are derived from Baji's main principles or concepts on how to hit the opponent:\n* Eight postures (''Ba shi'')\n* Eight movements method (''Ba shi gong'')\n* Eight movements method (''Ba shi chui'')\n* Double Eight Postures (''Shuang ba shi'')\n* Eight postures of the dragon style (''Longxing ba shi'')\n\nMany of these forms are also based or mixed with [[Luohan (martial arts)|Luohan fist]], a [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin]] style.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The term ''ba shi'' may also refer to baji. The term is also used in [[xingyi quan]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wufamilybajiquan.com Official website of the Wu family BajiQuan].\n* [http://www.bajimen.com Bajimen.com - Grandmaster Liu Yun Qiao].\n* [http://swz.weebly.com Website of Master Zhou Jingxuan].\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100328115448/http://www.hollowfist.com/ Hollowfist.com - Essays about Bajiquan's internal theory.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060613062723/http://pachitanglang.com/ Pachitanglang International] - Grandmaster Su Yuchang, disciple of Liu Yunqiao.\n\n{{Commons category|Bajiquan}}\n{{Kung Fu schools}}\n{{Martial arts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bajiquan}}\n[[Category:Chinese martial arts]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=October 2007}}\n{{Infobox martial art\n| logo         =\n| logocaption  =\n| logosize     =\n| image        = WLZ-liang-yi-ding2.jpg\n| imagecaption = Master Wu Lian-Zhi in the typical stance of Baji Quan style.\n| imagesize    = 100px\n| name         = Baji quan<br />(\u516b\u6975\u62f3)\n| aka          = Kai Men Bajiquan (\u958b\u9580\u516b\u6975\u62f3)&nbsp;\u2013 Gate-Opening Eight Extremities Fist\n| focus        = [[Strike (attack)|Striking]]\n| country      = {{flagicon|China}} [[China]]\n| creator      = Unknown.

When baji is added to pigua, heroes will sigh knowing they are no match against it.\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u516b\u6975\u53c3\u5288\u639b\uff0c\u795e\u9b3c\u90fd\u5bb3\u6015\u3002\u5288\u639b\u53c3\u516b\u6975\uff0c\u82f1\u96c4\u5606\u83ab\u53ca}})<ref name=\"Piguazhang\"/><ref>[[Su Yuchang]], ''Pachi Tanglang Chuan: Eight Ultimate Praying Mantis'', 2014, p. 175ff.</ref>\n\n== Branches and lineages ==\nProminent branches and lineages of the art survived to modern times, including Han family Baji, Huo family, Ji family, Li family, Ma family, Qiang family, Wu family (from Wu Xiefeng), Wutan Baji Quan and Yin Yang Baji Quan.

It is most useful in close combat, as it focuses on elbow, knee, shoulder and hip strikes. When blocking an attack or nearing an opponent, baji quan techniques emphasize striking major points of vulnerability, namely the thorax (trunk of the body), legs and neck.\n[[File:Master zhou baji quan posture.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zhou Jingxuan of Tianjin, holding a typical Baji Quan posture. The sideways-protruding elbow is often used for striking in this art.]]\n\nThe \"six big ways of opening\" (''liu da kai'' {{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u5927\u958b}}) are:<ref>{{cite book|last=Jaw|first=Peter|title=The Treasure Book of Chinese Martial Arts|publisher=Authorhouse|volume=1|year=2004|isbn=978-1-4140-7573-0}}</ref>\n\n* ''Ding'' {{zh|labels=no|t=\u9802}}: using the fist, elbow or shoulder to push forward and upward.\n* ''Bao'' {{zh|labels=no|c=\u62b1}}: putting arms together as if hugging someone.

There are twenty fist forms, which include twelve Baji Small Structure Fists, Baji Black Tiger Fist, Baji Dan Zhai, Baji Dan Da/Dui Da, Baji Luohan Gong, and Baji Si Lang Kuan. There are eight weapons forms, including Liu He Da [[Qiang (spear)|Qiang]] (spear), Chun Yang [[Jian]] (sword), San Yin [[Dao (sword)|Dao]] (sabre), Xing Zhe Bang (staff), [[Pudao]], and Chun Qiu [[Dao (sword)|Da Dao]] (a long two-handed heavy blade, used by Generals sitting on their horses).\n\nMost schools focus on a much smaller curriculum. Standard across almost all groups are Xiaobaji and Dabaji; two weapons forms, the sabre and the spear; a two-man training routine called Baji Duijie or Baji Duida and a series of 8 short attacking methods called the \"Ba Shi\" (Eight Postures), which are derived from the art of Shaolin Jingang Bashi.\n\n=== Power generation and expression ===\nThe major features of baji include elbow strikes, arm/fist punches, hip checks and strikes with the shoulder. All techniques are executed with a short power, developed through training; among Chinese martial artists, baji is known for its fast movements. Baji focuses on infighting, entering from a longer range with a distinctive charging step (''zhen jiao'').\n\nThe essence of baji quan lies in [[Neijin|jin]], or power-issuing methods, particularly [[fa jin]] (explosive power). The style contains six types of ''jin'', eight different ways to hit and several principles of power usage. Most of baji quan's moves utilize a one-hit push-strike method from very close range. The bulk of the damage is dealt through the momentary acceleration that travels up from the waist to the limb and further magnified by the charging step known as ''zhen jiao''.\n\nThe mechanics of ''jin'' are developed through many years of practice and baji quan is known for its strenuous lower-body training and its emphasis on the [[horse stance]].<ref name=\"Bajiquan\"/> Its horse stance is higher than that of typical [[Changquan|Long Fist]] styles. Like other styles, there is also \"the arrow-bow stance\", \"the one-leg stance\", \"the empty stance\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u865b\u6b65|p=x\u016bb\u00f9}}), \"the drop stance\" ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u4ec6\u6b65|p=p\u016bb\u00f9}}), etc. There are eight different hand poses, in addition to different types of breathing and ''zhen jiao''.\n\n== Influences ==\nBaji focuses on being more direct, culminating in powerful, fast strikes that will render an opponent unable to continue. Even so, there are some styles that are derived from Baji's main principles or concepts on how to hit the opponent:\n* Eight postures (''Ba shi'')\n* Eight movements method (''Ba shi gong'')\n* Eight movements method (''Ba shi chui'')\n* Double Eight Postures (''Shuang ba shi'')\n* Eight postures of the dragon style (''Longxing ba shi'')\n\nMany of these forms are also based or mixed with [[Luohan (martial arts)|Luohan fist]], a [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin]] style.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The term ''ba shi'' may also refer to baji. The term is also used in [[xingyi quan]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wufamilybajiquan.com Official website of the Wu family BajiQuan].\n* [http://www.bajimen.com Bajimen.com - Grandmaster Liu Yun Qiao].\n* [http://swz.weebly.com Website of Master Zhou Jingxuan].\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100328115448/http://www.hollowfist.com/ Hollowfist.com - Essays about Bajiquan's internal theory.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060613062723/http://pachitanglang.com/ Pachitanglang International] - Grandmaster Su Yuchang, disciple of Liu Yunqiao.\n\n{{Commons category|Bajiquan}}\n{{Kung Fu schools}}\n{{Martial arts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bajiquan}}\n[[Category:Chinese martial arts]]\n", "name_user": "LittleDragon21", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajiquan"}
