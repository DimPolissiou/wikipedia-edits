{"title_page": "List of United States Marine Corps battalions", "text_new": "{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\nThis is a list of current '''[[United States Marine Corps]] [[battalion]]s''', sorted by the mission they perform.\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Active units==\n\n===Ground Combat Element battalions===\n{{See also|Ground combat element}}\n\nThe ground combat element (GCE) consists of those combat and combat support units whose primary mission is to, (1) engage with and destroy the enemy by fire and/or maneuver, and/or shock effect, performed by infantry, field artillery, and tank units, (2) provide close battlefield support to other GCE units by assault amphibian, combat assault, light armored reconnaissance, reconnaissance, and combat engineer units, or (3) provide immediate command and control, and limited logistical support including consolidated Navy personnel administration and motor transport (medium truck) support to subordinate GCE battalions and regiments (infantry and artillery only) by Marine division (MARDIV) headquarters battalions. Additionally, this battalion provides communications networking and law enforcement support across the GCE. The headquarters battalion also includes the division band, whose tactical mission is to serve as a provisional rifle platoon in providing division headquarters security.\n\nNote: Some GCE battalions and regiments are provided air liaison officers/forward air controllers (i.e., Marine Corps naval aviators \u2014 aircraft pilots, and naval flight officers \u2014 airborne weapons and sensor systems officers) with specialized skills in coordinating air support of ground units) from the Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) of the aviation combat element (ACE). These officers facilitate employment of Marine aviation in support of GCE units to perform offensive air support (e.g., close air support), assault support (e.g., troop, cargo, and casualty transport, aerial command and control, liaison, communications, and illumination, and close-in fire support by light/attack helicopters), and aerial reconnaissance (e.g., tactical reconnaissance and artillery spotting).\n\n====Infantry battalions====\n\n[[Ground combat element#U.S. Marine Corps Infantry|'''Infantry''']] battalions are the heart and soul of the [[ground combat element]]. The mission of locating, closing with, and destroying the enemy with fire and maneuver and repelling the enemy's assault with fire and close combat lies with the \"[[Infantry|grunts]]\". [[Battalion#United States Marine Corps|Marine infantry battalions]] often have limited organic equipment outside of small arms, infantry crew-served weapons (e.g., heavy machine guns, medium mortars, and anti-tank missiles), and a few light tactical trucks. Marine infantry primarily maneuvers by foot as [[light infantry]], and must be supplemented with additional [[List of vehicles of the U.S. Marine Corps#Wheeled Vehicles|trucks]] to become [[motorized infantry]] or [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle]]s to become [[mechanized infantry]].\n\nA Marine infantry battalion is usually organized into three [[Company (military unit)#Marine Corps|rifle companies]], a [[Weapons company#United States Marine Corps|weapons company]], and a [[headquarters and service company]]. The rifle company has a company [[Headquarters#Military|headquarters]], three rifle [[Platoon#United States Marine Corps|platoons]], with three rifle [[Squad#United States Marine Corps|squads]] each, and a weapons platoon with [[M240 machine gun|medium machinegun]]s, [[M224 Mortar|mortar]]s, and [[Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon|assault]] [[FGM-172 SRAW|weapons]] [[Section (military unit)#United States Marine Corps|sections]]. The weapons company includes a company headquarters, a [[M2 Browning machine gun|heavy]] [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|machinegun]] platoon, an [[M252 Mortar|81mm mortar]] platoon, and an [[FGM-148 Javelin|anti]][[BGM-71 TOW|armor]] platoon. Sometimes, the commander will mix these into [[Combined Anti-Armor Team]]s. The headquarters and service company includes all [[command and control|command]], [[Military administration|administration]], [[intelligence]], [[Military operation|operations]], [[logistics]], and [[military communication|communication]] Marines and equipment, as well as the battalion's  [[Scout Sniper]] platoon and Battalion Aid Station (BAS) staffed by U.S. Navy [[Hospital Corpsman]].\n\n[[File:INDIA5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Riflemen]] ]]\n[[File:AfghUSpatrolDOD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Marines on patrol]]\n[[File:M82 Sniper.JPEG|thumb|right|250px|Marine [[Scout Sniper|scout sniper]] ]]\n[[File:3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines - RIMPAC 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mechanized Marines]]\n[[File:M2 - 24th MEU.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Machine gunner with [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 .50cal]] ]]\n[[File:Hmmwv-036.jpg|thumb|right|250px|TOW [[anti-tank]] missile.]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

(EFSS) 120 mm, heavy mortar]]. Two regiments (11th Marines and 14th Marines) also have one rocket battalion equipped with the [[M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System]] (HIMARS) equipped with the [[MGM-140 ATACMS]] surface-to-surface, guided missile.\nMarine artillery battalions contain a [[Headquarters and Service Company#Headquarters Battery (Field Artillery) and Headquarters and Service Battery (LAAD)|Headquarters Battery]] and three or four firing [[Artillery Battery#United States Marine Corps|batteries]].\nFiring batteries contain a headquarters platoon (including a liaison section with three [[Field artillery#Forward Observer|forward observer teams]]) and one or two firing platoons (depending upon weapons systems). The firing platoon(s) contain a battery operations center, a [[Field artillery#FDC (Fire Direction Center)|fire direction center]], and four or six artillery sections (depending upon weapon system). [[Counter-battery radar]] is usually a regimental asset, but can be detached to augment battalions or batteries.\n\n[[File:M777 howitzer rear.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[M777 howitzer]] firing]]\n[[File:4-14 Marines in Fallujah.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[M198 howitzer]] firing]]\n[[File:HIMARS DA-SD-07-43938.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[HIMARS]] firing]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

When task-organized with infantry, tanks, and other forces, the battalion conducts combined arms operations as a separate maneuver element in support of the [[List of United States Marine Corps divisions|Marine Division]].\n\nCurrently, Assault Amphibian (AA) battalions utilize the [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle]] (AAVP-7A1) and consist of a headquarters and service company and two to six AA companies. Each AA company is equipped with 42 AAVs (including personnel, command, and recovery variants) organized into three platoons of 12 AAVs each and an additional six AAVs in the company headquarters. Each AA platoon is capable of transporting an entire Marine rifle company plus any dismounted attachments (e.g., mortar forward observer teams, anti-tank missile crews, scout/sniper or reconnaissance squads) thus transforming into amphibious/mechanized infantry. (One AA company is capable of transporting the assault echelon of a Marine infantry battalion.)  Although plans were in place to replace it with the [[Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle]], the cancellation of the program is going to prolong use of the AAV.\n\n[[Light Armored Reconnaissance]] (LAR) battalions use the [[LAV 25]] series of vehicles and consist of a headquarters and service company and four LAR companies. Each LAR company is equipped with 25 LAVs (including 14 LAV-25, two mortar, four anti-tank, one command & control, three logistics, and one recovery variant).\n\n[[File:LAV-25 armored vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[LAV 25]] ]]\n[[File:USMarines AAV Iraq apr 2004 116 hires.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Amphibious Assault Vehicle|AAVP-7A1]] ]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Counter mobility includes creating obstacles and barriers for the enemy, which could include the destruction of structures and/or bridges. Survivability includes the [[fortification]] of positions and the construction of new outposts. Other jobs can include [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] (EOD), construction, and utilities (such as generators and refrigeration).\nCurrently, combat engineers use a variety of tools for their trade. Some vehicles include the [[M9 Armored Combat Earthmover]], [[Caterpillar D7|D7 Bulldozer]], [[M60A1 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB)|M60A1 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge]], and various [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[forklifts]]. Each combat engineer battalion consists of a headquarters and service company, three combat engineer companies, one mobility assault company, and an engineer support company.\n\n[[File:D7marines01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Caterpillar D7|D7 Bulldozer]] ]]\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

They specialize in [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] recon, including [[hydrography]]; as well as [[airborne forces|airborne]] recon, [[Infiltration tactics|infiltration]] via surface, subsurface and airborne operations, and conducting limited scale raids and ambushes. The battalions consist of a headquarters and service company and one to four reconnaissance companies (divisional assets, individual companies usually attached to an RCT). All battalions (except 4th Recon) also have a force reconnaissance company dedicated to provide deep reconnaissance and direct action capability to a MEF HQ. (Two additional separate force reconnaissance companies exist in the Marine Forces Reserve.)\n\n[[File:US Marines on reconnaissance exercise 2003.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Recon Marines]]\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Additionally, this battalion provides communications networking and law enforcement support across the LCE.  The headquarters and service battalion also provides specialized services, including: military postal service, Marine Corps Exchange (MCX), and other personal services, to units of all four MAGTF elements (i.e., GCE, ACE, LCE, and CE).\n\n====Combat Logistics battalions====\nCombat logistics battalions (CLB) provide combat service support for the GCE and ACE beyond their organic capabilities. The battalions primarily provide motor transport and logistics control and materiel handling (i.e., landing support) services, and limited engineer, maintenance, and supply services, to dedicated Regimental Combat Teams (RCT) or Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU). CLBs that support RCTs typically consist of a headquarters and service company, and three support companies (engineer, maintenance, and transportation); those CLBs that support MEUs typically consist of several functional units (individual units may be styled as either a section, platoon, detachment, or company depending upon the size of unit, function, and the unit's parent battalion/regiment/group). In addition to a headquarters and service unit, these CLBs contain units dedicated to providing: air delivery, communications, engineer, explosive ordnance disposal, health services (medical and dental), landing support, law enforcement (military police), maintenance, motor transport, and supply support to the MEU.  \n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#CCCCCC\"\n!

However, intelligence (i.e., ground intelligence) may also be considered as a GCE function (primarily located in the infantry battalion scout/sniper platoon) and communications and law enforcement may also be considered as logistics functions. Most GCE battalions and regiments, and ACE squadrons/battalions (LAAD), Marine aircraft groups (MAGs), and Marine air control groups (MACGs), contain some organic communications assets such as battalion and regimental communications platoons, MARDIV and MLG communications companies, and Marine wing communications squadrons. In addition, MARDIVs, Marine Aircraft Wings (MAWs), and MLGs also possess a limited organic law enforcement capability.\n\n====Communications battalions====\nCommunications battalions provide [[military communication|communication]] support for the MAGTF as part of the MEF headquarters groups.

Marine Corps Bulletin 5400, released in September 2011, called for the reactivation of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Military Police Battalions, now designated as law enforcement battalions, in each Marine Expeditionary Force and Marine Forces Reserve. Three law enforcement battalions were activated in June 2012, with each battalion consisting of a headquarters and service company and two or more law enforcement companies.<ref>{{cite web|author=<!-- Byline --> By Julie WatsonThe Associated Press |url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20120723/NEWS/207230326/Corps-creates-law-enforcement-battalions |title=Corps creates law enforcement battalions &#124; Marine Corps Times |publisher=marinecorpstimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> Each included \"500 military police officers [''sic''] and dozens of dogs.\"<ref>https://www.military.com/daily-news/2012/07/23/marine-corps-creates-law-enforcement-battalions.html</ref> (Note: As military units, each battalion contains only about 30 to 40 \"officers,\" as the majority of the military police Marines are enlisted members and not officers. \"Officers\" as in any military organization, command the battalion and its organic companies and platoons and serve as staff officers in the battalion headquarters.)\n\nNew structural plans made public in March 2020 indicated that the law enforcement battalions would be disestablished as part of future reorganization.<ref>https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/03/23/marines-shut-down-all-tank-units-cut-infantry-battalions-major-overhaul.html</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Col. who is assisted by an executive officer and an executive staff (S-1, S-2, etc.). The company's organic platoons often operate independently and are normally commanded by a major (ANGLICO) or captain (FORECON).\n\nAir Naval Gunfire Liaison companies (ANGLICO) provide Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commanders a liaison capability, with foreign area expertise, to plan, coordinate, and conduct terminal control of fires in support of joint, allied, and coalition forces. ANGLICO units are separate companies (i.e., not organic to a battalion or regiment) reporting directly to one of the three MEF HQ Groups (1st, 2nd, & 5th ANGLICO) or the Forces HQ Group, Marine Forces Reserve (3rd, 4th, and 6th ANGLICO).\n\nFleet Marine Force Reconnaissance (FORECON) companies provide Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commanders with deep reconnaissance and direct action capability. The FORECON companies of the three MEFs are organic to their respective divisional reconnaissance battalions and are under operational control of their parent MEF HQ Group. The 3rd and 4th FORECON companies are separate companies reporting directly to the Forces HQ Group, Marine Forces Reserve and are dedicated to supporting II MEF and I MEF, respectively, whenever a MEF's active duty FORECON company is not available.\n \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Additionally, this battalion provides communications networking and law enforcement support across the GCE. The headquarters battalion also includes the division band, whose tactical mission is to serve as a provisional rifle platoon in providing division headquarters security.\n\nNote: Some GCE battalions and regiments are provided air liaison officers/forward air controllers (i.e., Marine Corps naval aviators \u2014 aircraft pilots, and naval flight officers \u2014 airborne weapons and sensor systems officers) with specialized skills in coordinating air support of ground units) from the Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) of the aviation combat element (ACE). These officers facilitate employment of Marine aviation in support of GCE units to perform offensive air support (e.g., close air support), assault support (e.g., troop, cargo, and casualty transport, aerial command and control, liaison, communications, and illumination, and close-in fire support by light/attack helicopters), and aerial reconnaissance (e.g., tactical reconnaissance and artillery spotting).\n\n====Infantry battalions====\n\n[[Ground combat element#U.S. Marine Corps Infantry|'''Infantry''']] battalions are the heart and soul of the [[ground combat element]]. The mission of locating, closing with, and destroying the enemy with fire and maneuver and repelling the enemy's assault with fire and close combat lies with the \"[[Infantry|grunts]]\". [[Battalion#United States Marine Corps|Marine infantry battalions]] often have limited organic equipment outside of small arms, infantry crew-served weapons (e.g., heavy machine guns, medium mortars, and anti-tank missiles), and a few light tactical trucks. Marine infantry primarily maneuvers by foot as [[light infantry]], and must be supplemented with additional [[List of vehicles of the U.S. Marine Corps#Wheeled Vehicles|trucks]] to become [[motorized infantry]] or [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle]]s to become [[mechanized infantry]].\n\nA Marine infantry battalion is usually organized into three [[Company (military unit)#Marine Corps|rifle companies]], a [[Weapons company#United States Marine Corps|weapons company]], and a [[headquarters and service company]]. The rifle company has a company [[Headquarters#Military|headquarters]], three rifle [[Platoon#United States Marine Corps|platoons]], with three rifle [[Squad#United States Marine Corps|squads]] each, and a weapons platoon with [[M240 machine gun|medium machinegun]]s, [[M224 Mortar|mortar]]s, and [[Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon|assault]] [[FGM-172 SRAW|weapons]] [[Section (military unit)#United States Marine Corps|sections]]. The weapons company includes a company headquarters, a [[M2 Browning machine gun|heavy]] [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|machinegun]] platoon, an [[M252 Mortar|81mm mortar]] platoon, and an [[FGM-148 Javelin|anti]][[BGM-71 TOW|armor]] platoon. Sometimes, the commander will mix these into [[Combined Anti-Armor Team]]s. The headquarters and service company includes all [[command and control|command]], [[Military administration|administration]], [[intelligence]], [[Military operation|operations]], [[logistics]], and [[military communication|communication]] Marines and equipment, as well as the battalion's  [[Scout Sniper]] platoon and Battalion Aid Station (BAS) staffed by U.S. Navy [[Hospital Corpsman]].\n\n[[File:INDIA5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Riflemen]] ]]\n[[File:AfghUSpatrolDOD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Marines on patrol]]\n[[File:M82 Sniper.JPEG|thumb|right|250px|Marine [[Scout Sniper|scout sniper]] ]]\n[[File:3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines - RIMPAC 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mechanized Marines]]\n[[File:M2 - 24th MEU.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Machine gunner with [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 .50cal]] ]]\n[[File:Hmmwv-036.jpg|thumb|right|250px|TOW [[anti-tank]] missile.]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

(11th Marines only) cannon battalions and are equipped with the [[M777 howitzer|M777 lightweight, towed, 155 mm, medium howitzer]] and the [[Dragon fire (mortar)|Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS) 120 mm, heavy mortar]]. Two regiments (11th Marines and 14th Marines) also have one rocket battalion equipped with the [[M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System]] (HIMARS) equipped with the [[MGM-140 ATACMS]] surface-to-surface, guided missile.\nMarine artillery battalions contain a [[Headquarters and Service Company#Headquarters Battery (Field Artillery) and Headquarters and Service Battery (LAAD)|Headquarters Battery]] and three or four firing [[Artillery Battery#United States Marine Corps|batteries]].\nFiring batteries contain a headquarters platoon (including a liaison section with three [[Field artillery#Forward Observer|forward observer teams]]) and one or two firing platoons (depending upon weapons systems). The firing platoon(s) contain a battery operations center, a [[Field artillery#FDC (Fire Direction Center)|fire direction center]], and four or six artillery sections (depending upon weapon system). [[Counter-battery radar]] is usually a regimental asset, but can be detached to augment battalions or batteries.\n\n[[File:M777 howitzer rear.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[M777 howitzer]] firing]]\n[[File:4-14 Marines in Fallujah.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[M198 howitzer]] firing]]\n[[File:HIMARS DA-SD-07-43938.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[HIMARS]] firing]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

When task-organized with infantry, tanks, and other forces, the battalion conducts combined arms operations as a separate maneuver element in support of the [[List of United States Marine Corps divisions|Marine Division]].\n\nCurrently, Assault Amphibian (AA) battalions utilize the [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle]] (AAVP-7A1) and consist of a headquarters and service company and two to six AA companies. Each AA company is equipped with 42 AAVs (including personnel, command, and recovery variants) organized into three platoons of 12 AAVs each and an additional six AAVs in the company headquarters. Each AA platoon is capable of transporting an entire Marine rifle company plus any dismounted attachments (e.g., mortar forward observer teams, anti-tank missile crews, scout/sniper or reconnaissance squads) thus transforming into amphibious/mechanized infantry. (One AA company is capable of transporting the assault echelon of a Marine infantry battalion.)  Although plans were in place to replace it with the [[Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle]], the cancellation of the program is going to prolong use of the AAV.\n\n[[Light Armored Reconnaissance]] (LAR) battalions use the [[LAV 25]] series of vehicles and consist of a headquarters and service company and four LAR companies. Each LAR company is equipped with 25 LAVs (including 14 LAV-25, two mortar, four anti-tank, one command & control, three logistics, and one recovery variant).\n\n[[File:LAV-25 armored vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[LAV 25]] ]]\n[[File:USMarines AAV Iraq apr 2004 116 hires.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Amphibious Assault Vehicle|AAVP-7A1]] ]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Counter mobility includes creating obstacles and barriers for the enemy, which could include the destruction of structures and/or bridges. Survivability includes the [[fortification]] of positions and the construction of new outposts. Other jobs can include [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] (EOD), construction, and utilities (such as generators and refrigeration).\nCurrently, combat engineers use a variety of tools for their trade. Some vehicles include the [[M9 Armored Combat Earthmover]], [[Caterpillar D7|D7 Bulldozer]], [[M60A1 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB)|M60A1 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge]], and various [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[forklifts]].

They specialize in [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] recon, including [[hydrography]]; as well as [[airborne forces|airborne]] recon, [[Infiltration tactics|infiltration]] via surface, subsurface and airborne operations, and conducting limited scale raids and ambushes. The battalions consist of a headquarters and service company and one to four reconnaissance companies (divisional assets, individual companies usually attached to an RCT). All battalions (except 4th Recon) also have a force reconnaissance company dedicated to provide deep reconnaissance and direct action capability to a MEF HQ. (Two additional separate force reconnaissance companies exist in the Marine Forces Reserve.)\n\n[[File:US Marines on reconnaissance exercise 2003.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Recon Marines]]\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Additionally, this battalion provides communications networking and law enforcement support across the LCE.  The headquarters and service battalion also provides specialized services, including: military postal service, Marine Corps Exchange (MCX), and other personal services, to units of all four MAGTF elements (i.e., GCE, ACE, LCE, and CE).\n\n====Combat Logistics battalions====\nCombat logistics battalions (CLB) provide combat service support for the GCE and ACE beyond their organic capabilities. The battalions primarily provide motor transport and logistics control and materiel handling (i.e., landing support) services, and limited engineer, maintenance, and supply services, to dedicated Regimental Combat Teams (RCT) or Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU). CLBs that support RCTs typically consist of a headquarters and service company, and three support companies (engineer, maintenance, and transportation); those CLBs that support MEUs typically consist of several functional units (individual units may be styled as either a section, platoon, detachment, or company depending upon the size of unit, function, and the unit's parent battalion/regiment/group). In addition to a headquarters and service unit, these CLBs contain units dedicated to providing: air delivery, communications, engineer, explosive ordnance disposal, health services (medical and dental), landing support, law enforcement (military police), maintenance, motor transport, and supply support to the MEU.  \n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#CCCCCC\"\n!

However, intelligence (i.e., ground intelligence) may also be considered as a GCE function (primarily located in the infantry battalion scout/sniper platoon) and communications and law enforcement may also be considered as logistics functions. Most GCE battalions and regiments, and ACE squadrons/battalions (LAAD), Marine aircraft groups (MAGs), and Marine air control groups (MACGs), contain some organic communications assets such as battalion and regimental communications platoons, MARDIV and MLG communications companies, and Marine wing communications squadrons. In addition, MARDIVs, Marine Aircraft Wings (MAWs), and MLGs also possess a limited organic law enforcement capability.\n\n====Communications battalions====\nCommunications battalions provide [[military communication|communication]] support for the MAGTF as part of the MEF headquarters groups. They also perform networking and data services when deployed.

Col. who is assisted by an executive officer and an executive staff (S-1, S-2, etc.). The company's organic platoons often operate independently and are normally commanded by a major (ANGLICO) or captain (FORECON).\n\nAir Naval Gunfire Liaison companies (ANGLICO) provide Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commanders a liaison capability, with foreign area expertise, to plan, coordinate, and conduct terminal control of fires in support of joint, allied, and coalition forces.

It was recorded from August to October 1979 and released in February 1980 by [[Arista Records]].\n\nScott-Heron and Jackson produced ''1980'' with [[Malcolm Cecil]] and performed with a host of studio musicians, including drummer [[Harvey Mason]], guitarist [[Marlo Henderson]], and trombonist [[Bill Watrous]]. They incorporated sounds from contemporary pop music, such as [[disco]], [[electronic dance music|dance]], and [[new wave music|new wave]], into their established [[jazz-funk]] style. Jackson played a number of instruments, including [[Tonto's Expanding Head Band#The TONTO synthesizer|the T.O.N.T.O. synthesizer]], which was featured in the album's cover photo. Scott-Heron wrote the lyrics to all the songs, which explored societal themes, pressures in life, and fear of the future.\n\nThe album charted at number 82 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] while also impacting the R&B and jazz charts. It was also a critical success, receiving praise for its musical qualities and Scott-Heron's subject matter.

It was recorded from August to October 1979 and released in February 1980 by [[Arista Records]].\n\nScott-Heron and Jackson produced ''1980'' with [[Malcolm Cecil]] and performed with a host of studio musicians, including drummer [[Harvey Mason]], guitarist [[Marlo Henderson]], and trombonist [[Bill Watrous]]. They incorporated sounds from contemporary pop music, such as [[disco]], [[electronic dance music|dance]], and [[new wave music|new wave]], into their past [[jazz-funk]] style. Jackson played a number of instruments, including [[Tonto's Expanding Head Band#The TONTO synthesizer|the T.O.N.T.O. synthesizer]], which was featured in the album's cover photo. Scott-Heron wrote the lyrics to all the songs, which explored societal themes, pressures in life, and fear of the future.\n\nThe album charted at number 82 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] while also impacting the R&B and jazz charts. It was also a critical success, receiving praise for its musical qualities and Scott-Heron's subject matter.

The remainder of the lineup included Gregory \"Greg Koogler\" MacArthur in the middays, Bruce \"Doc Winston\" Soderholm in the afternoons, Craig \"Jay Taylor\" Wendel in the evenings, and \"Brooklyn Dave\" holding down overnights. Brooklyn Dave only lasted a few months before being replaced by Ricky Jeffrey.\n\nOperating on a shoestring budget in its early days, the station made its name through a variety of promotions and gimmicks under the guidance of General Manager and DJ William \"Billy 'Will' Cunningham\" Honeylamb and Mark Evans who doubled as Sweet 98 FM's 1st program director and morning DJ. In September 1980, listeners were offered the opportunity to win $50,000 for answering their phones with the now iconic but legendary phrase, \"I Listen to the new sound of Sweet 98 FM!\"\n\nAt approximately the same time, the station opened its \"Supermouth\" contest, whereby local teens competed for a year-long stint as a Sweet 98 evening jock, a $1,000-a-month salary, a $1,000 wardrobe, and use of a new Pontiac Firebird, emblazoned with station logos and a giant Supermouth emblem on the hood. According to the station, it received over 5,000 applications, from which it auditioned over 300 in 30-second over-the-phone song intros. After narrowing the field to 20 semi-finalists who were given 15 minutes of live airtime apiece, 10 finalists received 30-minute auditions (again live). On February 14, 1981, after five hours of on-air auditions, Bill Cunningham proclaimed Alan Bone, an 18-year-old UNL student, the station's first Supermouth. In all, the station crowned seven Supermouths, the most successful of whom was Scotty \"Hot Scott\" O'Hanlon, who eventually dominated evenings for most of the late 80s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAnother 1981 promotion involved the station asking listeners to affix Sweet 98 FM's \"stickificates\" to their bumpers for a chance to win $98,000. After stringing the promotion out over several months by sending jocks out in a \"Roving (Buick) Riviera\" to pull stickificate-bearing cars over and give out small cash prizes and gift certificates, the station told listeners to bring their stickificates (and cars) to the Crossroads Mall parking lot at 72nd and Dodge one early June evening. The result was a colossal traffic jam, lots of chaos, and a cascade of publicity for the station proving to Billy, Mark, and all of the Sweet 98 jocks that there is no such thing as bad publicity.\n\nIn 1982, the station initiated on-air bingo games as a means of increasing listenership, a promotional idea that dragged on for several ratings periods, in one form or another. \"Big Guy\" a squeaky voiced character created by Mark. Big Guy was the mascot of Sweet 98 FM's bingo promotions.

One memorable moment came when a seemingly meek elderly woman claimed to have a bingo and made her way, gingerly to the stage only to be told that she did not after all have the matching numbers. Upon receiving this news the formerly adorable grandmother unleashed a profanity laced tirade on Billy and the Sweet 98 jocks, much to the delight of the crowd.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe Sweet 98 FM studios were originally located in a dilapidated building at 3600 Broadway in Council Bluffs. Formerly an apartment building next to what was rumored to have once been a brothel, the Council Bluffs digs were condemned on several occasions in the early 1980s and razed shortly after the move to downtown Omaha in 1987. So bad was the Council Bluffs facility that when a thunderstorm knocked the power out in 1982 the station operated off the generator of a run-down RV parked in the mud-and-gravel lot behind the building. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe downtown Omaha studios were much more plush and prominently located in the famed Old Market at 10th and Farnam. The window front studios featured a hydraulic lift which the jocks could raise and lower with a foot pedal to greet revelers who frequently passed by the while celebrating birthdays, weddings, and graduations and making song dedications.\n\nA spaceman jumpsuit hung on the wall of the studio. It was ostensibly for the Sweet jocks to wear even though none of the Sweet jocks will admit to ever wearing it.\n\nIn January 1992, after 12 years in mornings, \"The Breakfast Flakes\" was replaced with \"Rockett in the Morning\", starring G. Rockett Phillips, with Tommy Zenner, and Elizabeth \"Liz\" Adams. The show ran until August 1995, and after Johnny Danger's morning show didn't work, G. Rockett got asked to come back for another year in January 1997. \"Rockett in the Morning\" was then replaced with \"The Sweet 98 Morning Zoo\" with Darren & Wayne and Rachael Adams, and then later by Pat & JT in 2002. By the early 2000s, KQKQ rebranded as \"Sweet 98.5.\"\n\nSweet 98 began hosting a big concert event in the late 90s known as \"Sweetstock\" which featured big named Top 40 bands at the time including [[NSync]].<ref>Kim Roberts, \"Hot bands to hit Sweetstock,\" ''The Omaha World-Herald'', May 24, 2001.</ref> The last Sweetstock event was held in 2002.<ref>Erin Grace, \"Sweetstock tests fans' endurance,\" ''The Omaha World-Herald'', July 15, 2002.</ref>\n\nAfter dropping significantly in the ratings with [[KQCH]] (94.1 FM) taking over as the leading Top 40 station in Omaha during the early 2000s, \"Sweet 98.5\" signed off at 3 p.m. on March 11, 2004, and began [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with a robotic countdown accompanied by \"[[On the Run (instrumental)|On the Run]]\" by [[Pink Floyd]]. The countdown ended at 3 p.m. the following day, when it flipped to [[Modern AC]] as \"Q98Five, Modern Hit Music.\" The first song on \"Q\" was \"[[How You Remind Me]]\" by [[Nickelback]].<ref>Kim Roberts, \"Radio's 98.5, 106.9 return with new formats today,\" ''The Omaha World-Herald'', March 12, 2004.</ref><ref>[https://formatchange.com/kqkq-relaunches-as-q98five/  KQKQ Relaunches as Q98Five]</ref> The new format puts less emphasis on personalities and focuses more on music news and upcoming concerts in the Omaha area. While playing some of the same music that was featured in the CHR format, most hip hop, rap, teen pop and dance songs have been removed from the playlist for songs tailored more to an older adult listening audience. The format has since evolved to a more broad-based [[Hot AC]].\n\nOn May 26, 2017, at 8:25&nbsp;a.m., KQKQ rebranded back to the \"Sweet 98.5\" moniker, while retaining the Hot AC format and current airstaff.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/118100/kqkq-is-sweet-once-again/ KQKQ is Sweet Once Again] Radioinsight - May 26, 2017</ref> \n\nIn October 2018, Pat & JT were replaced by Matt Tompkins and Nikki Oswald.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/171050/people-moves-10-9-morning-moves-in-tampa-omaha/  People Moves 10/9: Morning Moves in Tampa, Omaha]</ref>\n\n==Previous logo==\n[[File:OmahaKQKQlogo.jpg]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.q985fm.com Official website]\n*{{FM station data|KQKQ}}\n\n{{Omaha Radio}}\n{{Lincoln Radio}}\n{{NRG Media}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Iowa|QKQ-FM]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1980]]\n[[Category:NRG Media radio stations]]\n[[Category:Hot adult contemporary radio stations in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Hot adult contemporary radio station in Omaha}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name                 = KQKQ-FM\n| image                = kqkqfm.png\n| city                 = [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]\n| area                 = [[Omaha\u2013Council Bluffs metropolitan area]]\n| branding             = ''Sweet 98.5''\n| slogan               = ''Omaha's Sweetest Variety''\n| frequency            = 98.5 [[MHz]]\n| airdate              = [[1969 in radio|1969]]\n| share                = \n| share as of          =  \n| share source         =  \n| format               = [[Hot adult contemporary]]\n| power                = \n| erp                  = 100,000 [[watt]]s\n| haat                 = 336 meters\n| class                = C\n| facility_id          = 43238\n| coordinates          = {{coord|41|18|25|N| 96|1|37|W|region:US-IA|display=inline,title}}\n| callsign_meaning     =\n| former_callsigns     = \n| affiliations         = \n| owner                = [[NRG Media]]\n| licensee             = NRG License Sub, LLC\n| sister_stations      = [[KMMQ]], [[KOIL]], [[KOOO]], [[KOPW]], [[KOZN]], [[KZOT]]\n| webcast              = [http://player.listenlive.co/52421 Listen Live]\n| website              = [http://www.sweet985.com sweet985.com]\n}}\n'''KQKQ-FM''' (98.5 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is a [[radio station]] broadcasting a [[hot adult contemporary]] format.

The window front studios featured a hydraulic lift which the jocks could raise and lower with a foot pedal to greet revelers who frequently passed by the while celebrating birthdays, weddings, and graduations and making song dedications.\n\nA spaceman jumpsuit hung on the wall of the studio. It was ostensibly for the Sweet jocks to wear even though none of the Sweet jocks will admit to ever wearing it.\n\nIn January 1992, after 12 years in mornings, \"The Breakfast Flakes\" was replaced with \"Rockett in the Morning\", starring G. Rockett Phillips, with Tommy Zenner, and Elizabeth \"Liz\" Adams. The show ran until August 1995, and after Johnny Danger's morning show didn't work, G. Rockett got asked to come back for another year in January 1997. \"Rockett in the Morning\" was then replaced with \"The Sweet 98 Morning Zoo\" with Darren & Wayne and Rachael Adams, and then later by Pat & JT in 2002. By the early 2000s, KQKQ rebranded as \"Sweet 98.5.\"\n\nSweet 98 began hosting a big concert event in the late 90s known as \"Sweetstock\" which featured big named Top 40 bands at the time including [[NSync]].<ref>Kim Roberts, \"Hot bands to hit Sweetstock,\" ''The Omaha World-Herald'', May 24, 2001.</ref> The last Sweetstock event was held in 2002.<ref>Erin Grace, \"Sweetstock tests fans' endurance,\" ''The Omaha World-Herald'', July 15, 2002.</ref>\n\nAfter dropping significantly in the ratings with [[KQCH]] (94.1 FM) taking over as the leading Top 40 station in Omaha during the early 2000s, \"Sweet 98.5\" signed off at 3 p.m. on March 11, 2004, and began [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with a robotic countdown accompanied by \"[[On the Run (instrumental)|On the Run]]\" by [[Pink Floyd]]. The countdown ended at 3 p.m. the following day, when it flipped to [[Modern AC]] as \"Q98Five, Modern Hit Music.\" The first song on \"Q\" was \"[[How You Remind Me]]\" by [[Nickelback]].<ref>Kim Roberts, \"Radio's 98.5, 106.9 return with new formats today,\" ''The Omaha World-Herald'', March 12, 2004.</ref><ref>[https://formatchange.com/kqkq-relaunches-as-q98five/  KQKQ Relaunches as Q98Five]</ref> The new format puts less emphasis on personalities and focuses more on music news and upcoming concerts in the Omaha area. While playing some of the same music that was featured in the CHR format, most hip hop, rap, teen pop and dance songs have been removed from the playlist for songs tailored more to an older adult listening audience. The format has since evolved to a more broad-based [[Hot AC]].\n\nOn May 26, 2017, at 8:25&nbsp;a.m., KQKQ rebranded back to the \"Sweet 98.5\" moniker, while retaining the Hot AC format and current airstaff.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/118100/kqkq-is-sweet-once-again/ KQKQ is Sweet Once Again] Radioinsight - May 26, 2017</ref> \n\nIn October 2018, Pat & JT were replaced by Matt Tompkins and Nikki Oswald.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/171050/people-moves-10-9-morning-moves-in-tampa-omaha/  People Moves 10/9: Morning Moves in Tampa, Omaha]</ref>\n\n==Previous logo==\n[[File:OmahaKQKQlogo.jpg]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.q985fm.com Official website]\n*{{FM station data|KQKQ}}\n\n{{Omaha Radio}}\n{{Lincoln Radio}}\n{{NRG Media}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Iowa|QKQ-FM]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1980]]\n[[Category:NRG Media radio stations]]\n[[Category:Hot adult contemporary radio stations in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Alex jirgens", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KQKQ-FM"}
