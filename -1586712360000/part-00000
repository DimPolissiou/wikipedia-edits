The games have been developed and published by several different companies. The first two games in the series, ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' and ''[[Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame]]'', were published by Br\u00f8derbund. ''[[Prince of Persia 3D]]'', the first to use [[3D computer graphics]], was developed by [[Red Orb Entertainment]] and published by The Learning Company on [[Personal computer|PC]], and developed by [[Avalanche Software]] and published by [[Mattel Interactive]] on [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]]. [[Ubisoft]] began developing and publishing the series in 2003 with ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]''.\n\nThe series has been rebooted twice since its acquisition by Ubisoft, and has been made into a film, ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (film)|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', penned in part by Mechner and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 2010.

Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.<ref name=\"polygon oral\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title=  Assassin\u2019s Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> They developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''.

The franchise is built around a series of action-adventure games focused on various incarnations of the eponymous [[Prince (Prince of Persia)|Prince]]. The games have been developed and published by several different companies. The first two games in the series, ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' and ''[[Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame]]'', were published by Br\u00f8derbund. ''[[Prince of Persia 3D]]'', the first to use [[3D computer graphics]], was developed by [[Red Orb Entertainment]] and published by The Learning Company on [[Personal computer|PC]], and developed by [[Avalanche Software]] and published by [[Mattel Interactive]] on [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]]. [[Ubisoft]] began developing and publishing the series in 2003 with ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]''.\n\nThe series has been rebooted twice since its acquisition by Ubisoft, and has been made into a film, ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (film)|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', penned in part by Mechner and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 2010. The franchise also includes ''[[Prince of Persia: The Graphic Novel]]'' and the [[Lego]] line [[Lego Prince of Persia|Lego ''Prince of Persia'']].
