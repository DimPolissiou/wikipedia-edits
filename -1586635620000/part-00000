Gen. Sherman (the [[Military Division of the Mississippi]]), starting in [[Tennessee]] in the previous year.}} On January 1, Union Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] advanced north from [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], through the [[The Carolinas|Carolinas]], with the intention of linking up with Union forces in [[Virginia]]. The defeat of Confederate Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army at the [[Battle of Bentonville]], and its [[unconditional surrender]] to Union forces on April 26, 1865, effectively ended the [[American Civil War]].\n\n==Background==\nAfter Sherman captured Savannah, the culmination of his '[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]', he was ordered by Union Army general-in-chief [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to embark his army on ships to reinforce the [[Army of the Potomac]] and the [[Army of the James]] in Virginia, where Grant was bogged down in the [[Siege of Petersburg]] against Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]]. Sherman had bigger things in mind. He predicted on January 5, 1865: \"I do think that in the several grand epochs of this war, my name will have a prominent part.\" He persuaded Grant that he should march north through the Carolinas instead, destroying everything of military value along the way, similar to his 'March to the Sea' through [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Sherman was particularly interested in targeting [[South Carolina]], as the first state to [[secession|secede]] from the Union, for the effect it would have on Southern morale.\n\nSherman's army commenced toward [[Columbia, South Carolina]], in late January 1865. His 60,079 men were divided into two wings: the [[Army of the Tennessee]],  and two corps, the [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV]] and [[XX Corps (Union Army)|XX]], under Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Slocum]], which was later formally designated the [[Army of Georgia]]. Reinforcements arrived regularly during his march north, and by April 1 he commanded 88,948 men after the [[Army of the Ohio]] under Maj. Gen. [[John M. Schofield]] joined up at Goldsboro, NC.<ref>Eicher, p. 797.</ref>\n\nSherman's opponents on the Confederate side had considerably fewer men. The primary force in the Carolinas was the battered [[Confederate Army of Tennessee|Army of Tennessee]], again under the command of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston (who had been relieved of duty by [[President of the Confederate States|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] during the [[Atlanta Campaign]] against Sherman and restored after [[John Bell Hood]] led a [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign|disastrous invasion of Tennessee]]). His strength was recorded in mid-March at 9,513 and 15,188 by mid-April. The army was organized into three corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. [[William J. Hardee]], Lt. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]], and Lt. Gen. [[Stephen D. Lee]]. Also in the Carolinas were cavalry forces from the [[division (military)|division]] of Maj. Gen. [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] and a small number in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], under Gen. [[Braxton Bragg]].\n\nSherman's plan was to bypass the minor Confederate troop concentrations at [[Augusta, Georgia]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and reach [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]], by March 15. As with his Georgia operations, Sherman marched his armies in multiple directions simultaneously, confusing the scattered Confederate defenders as to his first true objective, which was the state capital of [[Columbia, South Carolina]].\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union===\n{{further|Carolinas Campaign Union order of battle|l1=Union order of battle}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{further|Carolinas Campaign Confederate order of battle|l1=Confederate order of battle}}\n\n==Battles==\n[[File:SHERMAN'S MARCHES.jpg|thumb|400px|Sherman's advance: Tennessee, Georgia and Carolinas (1863\u201365).]]\n[[Image:Carolinas Campaign.png|thumb|300px|Movements in Carolinas Campaign]]\nThe following battles were fought in the Carolinas Campaign.\n\n===Rivers' Bridge (February 3, 1865)===\n{{further|Battle of Rivers' Bridge}}\n[[File:Sherman's March to the Sea ; crossing the Edisto.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of Howard's Corps of [[William T.

Union forces were overwhelmed by throngs of liberated Federal prisoners and emancipated [[slave]]s. Many soldiers took advantage of ample supplies of liquor in the city and began to drink. Fires began in the city, and high winds spread the flames across a wide area. Most of the central city was destroyed, and the city's fire companies found it difficult to operate in conjunction with the invading Union army, many of whom were also trying to put out the fire. The burning of Columbia has engendered controversy ever since, with some claiming the fires were accidental, others stating they were a deliberate act of vengeance as in Atlanta, and others claiming that the fires were set by retreating Confederate soldiers who lit bales of cotton on their way out of town. On that same day, the Confederates evacuated Charleston. On February 18, Sherman's forces destroyed virtually anything of military value in Columbia, including railroad depots, warehouses, arsenals, and machine shops. On February 22, Wilmington, NC surrendered.\n\n===Aiken (February 11)===\n{{further|Battle of Aiken}}\nThis battle took place entirely in South Carolina.\n\n===Wyse Fork (March 7\u201310)===\n{{further|Battle of Wyse Fork}}\nSchofield planned to advance inland from [[Wilmington, NC]], in February. At the same time, he assigned Maj. Gen. [[Jacob D. Cox]] to direct Union forces from [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] toward Goldsboro. On March 7, Cox's advance was stopped by divisions under Gen. Braxton Bragg's command at Southwest Creek south of [[Kinston, North Carolina]]. On March 8, the Confederates attempted to seize the initiative by attacking the Union flanks. After initial success, their attacks stalled because of faulty communications. On March 9, the Union forces were reinforced and beat back Bragg's renewed attacks on March 10 after heavy fighting. Bragg withdrew across the [[Neuse River]] and was unable to prevent the fall of Kinston on March 14.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc017.htm NPS Wyse Fork] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413212024/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc017.htm |date=April 13, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Monroe's Cross Roads (March 10)===\n{{further|Battle of Monroe's Cross Roads}}\nAs Sherman's army advanced into North Carolina, Maj. Gen. [[Judson Kilpatrick]]'s Cavalry Division screened its left flank. On the evening of March 9, two of Kilpatrick's brigades encamped near the Charles Monroe House in Cumberland (now [[Hoke County, North Carolina|Hoke]]) County. Early on March 10, Hampton's Confederate cavalry surprised the Federals in their camps, driving them back in confusion and capturing wagons and artillery. The Federals regrouped and counterattacked, regaining their artillery and camps after a desperate fight. With Union reinforcements on the way, the Confederates withdrew.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc018.htm NPS Monroe's Cross Roads] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527193832/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc018.htm |date=May 27, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Averasborough (March 16)===\n{{further|Battle of Averasborough}}\nOn the afternoon of March 15, Kilpatrick's cavalry came up against Hardee's corps deployed across the Raleigh Road near Smithville. After feeling out the Confederate defenses, Kilpatrick withdrew and called for infantry support. During the night, four divisions of the XX Corps arrived to confront the Confederates. At dawn, March 16, the Federals advanced on a division front, driving back skirmishers, but they were stopped by the main Confederate line and a counterattack. Mid-morning, the Federals renewed their advance with strong reinforcements and drove the Confederates from two lines of works, but they were repulsed at a third line. Late afternoon, the Union XIV Corps began to arrive on the field but was unable to deploy before dark because of the swampy ground. Hardee retreated during the night after holding up the Union advance for nearly two days.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc019.htm NPS Averasborough] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115212254/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc019.htm |date=January 15, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Bentonville (March 19\u201321)===\n{{further|Battle of Bentonville}}\nWhile Slocum's advance was stalled at Averasborough by Hardee's troops, the right wing of Sherman's army under Howard marched toward Goldsboro. On March 19, Slocum encountered the entrenched Confederates of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston who had concentrated to meet his advance at Bentonville. Johnston had increased his forces to about 21,000 men by absorbing the troops under Bragg, who had abandoned Wilmington. Late afternoon, Johnston attacked, crushing the line of the XIV Corps. Only strong counterattacks and desperate fighting south of the Goldsborough Road blunted the Confederate offensive. Elements of the XX Corps were thrown into the action as they arrived on the field. Five Confederate attacks failed to dislodge the Federal defenders, and darkness ended the first day's fighting. During the night, Johnston contracted his line into a \"V\" to protect his flanks, with Mill Creek to his rear. On March 20, Slocum was heavily reinforced, but fighting was sporadic. Sherman was inclined to let Johnston retreat. On March 21, however, Johnston remained in position while he removed his wounded. Skirmishing heated up along the entire front. In the afternoon, Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Mower]] led his Union division along a narrow trace that carried it across Mill Creek into Johnston's rear. Confederate counterattacks stopped Mower's advance, saving the army's only line of communication and retreat. Mower withdrew, ending fighting for the day. During the night, Johnston retreated across the bridge at Bentonville. Union forces pursued at first light, driving back Wheeler's rearguard and saving the bridge. Federal pursuit was halted at Hannah's Creek after a severe skirmish. Sherman, after regrouping at Goldsboro, pursued Johnston toward [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc020.htm NPS Bentonville] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312222354/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc020.htm |date=March 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nSherman's Carolina Campaign, in which his troops marched {{convert|425|mi|km}} in 50 days, was similar to his march to the sea through Georgia, although physically more demanding. However, the Confederate forces opposing him were much smaller and more dispirited. When Joseph E. Johnston met with [[Jefferson Davis]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] on April 12\u201313, he told the Confederate president:\n\n{{Quote|Our people are tired of the war, feel themselves whipped, and will not fight. Our country is overrun, its military resources greatly diminished, while the enemy's military power and resources were never greater and may be increased to any extent desired. ... My small force is melting away like snow before the sun.}}\n\nOn April 18, three days after the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination of]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], Johnston signed an [[armistice]] with Sherman at [[Bennett Place]], a farmhouse near [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham Station]]. Sherman got himself into political hot water by offering terms of surrender to Johnston that encompassed political issues as well as military, without authorization from General Grant or the United States government. The confusion on this issue lasted until April 26, when Johnston agreed to purely military terms and formally surrendered his army and all Confederate forces in the Carolinas, Georgia, and [[Florida]]. It was the second significant surrender that month. On April 9, Robert E. Lee had surrendered the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]]. It was the virtual end for the Confederacy, although some smaller forces held out, particularly in the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi]] region, into the summer.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[David J.

Hardee retreated during the night after holding up the Union advance for nearly two days.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc019.htm NPS Averasborough] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115212254/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc019.htm |date=January 15, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Bentonville (March 19\u201321)===\n{{further|Battle of Bentonville}}\nWhile Slocum's advance was stalled at Averasborough by Hardee's troops, the right wing of Sherman's army under Howard marched toward Goldsboro. On March 19, Slocum encountered the entrenched Confederates of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston who had concentrated to meet his advance at Bentonville. Johnston had increased his forces to about 21,000 men by absorbing the troops under Bragg, who had abandoned Wilmington. Late afternoon, Johnston attacked, crushing the line of the XIV Corps. Only strong counterattacks and desperate fighting south of the Goldsborough Road blunted the Confederate offensive. Elements of the XX Corps were thrown into the action as they arrived on the field. Five Confederate attacks failed to dislodge the Federal defenders, and darkness ended the first day's fighting. During the night, Johnston contracted his line into a \"V\" to protect his flanks, with Mill Creek to his rear. On March 20, Slocum was heavily reinforced, but fighting was sporadic. Sherman was inclined to let Johnston retreat. On March 21, however, Johnston remained in position while he removed his wounded. Skirmishing heated up along the entire front. In the afternoon, Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Mower]] led his Union division along a narrow trace that carried it across Mill Creek into Johnston's rear. Confederate counterattacks stopped Mower's advance, saving the army's only line of communication and retreat. Mower withdrew, ending fighting for the day. During the night, Johnston retreated across the bridge at Bentonville. Union forces pursued at first light, driving back Wheeler's rearguard and saving the bridge. Federal pursuit was halted at Hannah's Creek after a severe skirmish. Sherman, after regrouping at Goldsboro, pursued Johnston toward [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc020.htm NPS Bentonville] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312222354/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc020.htm |date=March 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nSherman's Carolina Campaign, in which his troops marched {{convert|425|mi|km}} in 50 days, was similar to his march to the sea through Georgia, although physically more demanding. However, the Confederate forces opposing him were much smaller and more dispirited. When Joseph E. Johnston met with [[Jefferson Davis]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] on April 12\u201313, he told the Confederate president:\n\n{{Quote|Our people are tired of the war, feel themselves whipped, and will not fight. Our country is overrun, its military resources greatly diminished, while the enemy's military power and resources were never greater and may be increased to any extent desired. ... My small force is melting away like snow before the sun.}}\n\nOn April 18, three days after the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination of]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], Johnston signed an [[armistice]] with Sherman at [[Bennett Place]], a farmhouse near [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham Station]]. Sherman got himself into political hot water by offering terms of surrender to Johnston that encompassed political issues as well as military, without authorization from General Grant or the United States government. The confusion on this issue lasted until April 26, when Johnston agreed to purely military terms and formally surrendered his army and all Confederate forces in the Carolinas, Georgia, and [[Florida]]. It was the second significant surrender that month. On April 9, Robert E. Lee had surrendered the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]]. It was the virtual end for the Confederacy, although some smaller forces held out, particularly in the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi]] region, into the summer.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[David J.

On his arrival in London he met instead the newly appointed [[George Henry Hall, 1st Viscount Hall|George Hall]] who had succeeded Stanley following Labour's win in the 1945 general election. He resigned his ministry in 1946 to push for full independence. That year he formed the [[United National Party]] (UNP) by amalgamating three right-leaning pro-Dominion parties.<ref name=\"ref2\"/>\n\nThe granting of independence to India in 1947 and the appointment of [[Arthur Creech Jones]] as Colonial Secretary gave a new window for Senanayake to push for his case using the new constitution that was recommended by the Soulbury Commission. In the negotiations that followed, the British government accepted Senanayake's proposals for constitutional change and self-rule. Senanayake presented the Soulbury Constitution to the State Council which voted it in with only three votes against it.\n\n[[1947 Ceylonese parliamentary election|Parliamentary elections]] were held from 23 August \u2013 20 September 1947. Senanayake was contested for the first time in the [[Mirigama Electoral District|Mirigama electorate]], having been elected uncontested in all previous elections. He won the seat by a majority of over 16,000 votes against [[Edmund Samarakkody]] of the [[Bolshevik\u2013Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma]]. Senanayake's party the UNP fell short of a majority at the general election, but was able to form a government in coalition with the [[All Ceylon Tamil Congress]].\n\nOn September 24, 1947 he was invited by the [[Governor General of Ceylon]] [[Henry Monck-Mason Moore|Sir Henry Moore]] to form the island's first cabinet as its first Prime Minister. On 11 November 1947, Senanayake and Sir Henry signed agreements between Ceylon and Britain including a defence pact and public service agreements that paved the way for independence of Ceylon. The \"Independence Bill of Ceylon\" was passed in December 1947. On 4 February 1948, Ceylon marked its independence with a ceremonial opening of parliament.<ref name=\"ref2\"/><ref>[http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/68.htm ''Sinhalese Parties''], Country Studies, Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress</ref>\n\n==First prime minister==\n[[File:First Cabinet of Ceylon.jpg|right|thumb|D.

While most domestic institutions existed, Ceylon remained dependent on Britain for trade, defence and external affairs.

With a rapidly expanding population and food shortages faced during the war, Senanayake aimed to increase local food production to be self sustainable. Renovation of sites of historic importance in [[Anuradhapura]] and [[Polonnaruwa]] took place at this time. Senanayake also proposaled expansion of hydro-electric power in the island.<ref>{{cite news|title=D. S.

Only about 5,000 Indian Tamils qualified for citizenship. More than 700,000 people, about 11% of the population, were denied citizenship and made [[statelessness|stateless]].

He soon had difficulties with one of the strongest members of his cabinet and leader of the largest factions of his party, [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]]. Bandaranaike joined his [[Sinhala Maha Sabha]] in forming the UNP in 1947 having given the impression that Senanayake would soon retire and he would succeed him. With no signs of Senanayake retiring and conflicts with Senanayake on hard line nationalist policies of he had, in 1951, Bandaranaike resigned from his posts and dissolved the Sinhala Maha Sabha and established the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] (SLFP). Senanayake assumed the portfolio of Health and Local Government held by Bandaranaike and began countering his break in parliament for the next few months.<ref>Richardson (2005), ''Paradise Poisoned'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sIRxpjfd-EC&pg=PA145 p. 145.]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn the morning of Friday, 21 March 1952, Senanayake took his usual pre-breakfast ride on [[Galle Face Green]], a short distance from his official residence [[Temple Trees]].

Senanayake married [[Mollie Dunuwila Senanayake|Molly Dunuwila]] in 1910. She was the daughter of R. R. Dunuwila, then Secretary of the [[Colombo Municipal Council]] and Grace Jayatilaka, daughter of Frederick Jayatilaka of the [[Ceylon Civil Service]] and District Judge of Kalutara. They had two sons, [[Dudley Shelton Senanayake]] (19 June 1911 \u2013 13 April 1973) and Robert Parakrama Senanayake (8 April 1913 \u2013 26 April 1986).<ref name=\"island.lk\"/> His eldest son, Dudley Shelton Senanayake, succeeded him as Prime Minister in 1952, followed by his nephew, Sir [[John Kotelawala]] (1897\u20131980) in 1953, but this nine-year family dynasty ended with the [[landslide victory]] of [[Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike]] in 1956, campaigning under the \"[[Sinhala Only Act|Sinhala Only]]\" slogan. Dudley Senanayake regained the premiership in 1960, and served again from 1965 to 1970. [[Rukman Senanayake]], one of his grandsons, is a former cabinet minister, former chairman of the UNP, current member of parliament, and assistant leader of the UNP.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Rt.Hon Don Stephen Senanayaka Laying the Foundation Stone of Poramadulla Central College on 1st June 1951..jpg|150px|right|thumb|D.

He resigned his ministry in 1946 to push for full independence. That year he formed the [[United National Party]] (UNP) by amalgamating three right-leaning pro-Dominion parties.<ref name=\"ref2\"/>\n\nThe granting of independence to India in 1947 and the appointment of [[Arthur Creech Jones]] as Colonial Secretary gave a new window for Senanayake to push for his case using the new constitution that was recommended by the Soulbury Commission. In the negotiations that followed, the British government accepted Senanayake's proposals for constitutional change and self-rule. Senanayake presented the Soulbury Constitution to the State Council which voted it in with only three votes against it.\n\n[[1947 Ceylonese parliamentary election|Parliamentary elections]] were held from 23 August \u2013 20 September 1947. Senanayake was contested for the first time in the [[Mirigama Electoral District|Mirigama electorate]], having been elected uncontested in all previous elections. He won the seat by a majority of over 16,000 votes against [[Edmund Samarakkody]] of the [[Bolshevik\u2013Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma]]. Senanayake's party the UNP fell short of a majority at the general election, but was able to form a government in coalition with the [[All Ceylon Tamil Congress]].\n\nOn September 24, 1947 he was invited by the [[Governor General of Ceylon]] [[Henry Monck-Mason Moore|Sir Henry Moore]] to form the island's first cabinet as its first Prime Minister. On 11 November 1947, Senanayake and Sir Henry signed agreements between Ceylon and Britain including a defence pact and public service agreements that paved the way for independence of Ceylon. The \"Independence Bill of Ceylon\" was passed in December 1947. On 4 February 1948, Ceylon marked its independence with a ceremonial opening of parliament.<ref name=\"ref2\"/><ref>[http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/68.htm ''Sinhalese Parties''], Country Studies, Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress</ref>\n\n==First prime minister==\n[[File:First Cabinet of Ceylon.jpg|right|thumb|D.

Only about 5,000 Indian Tamils qualified for citizenship. More than 700,000 people, about 11% of the population, were denied citizenship and made [[statelessness|stateless]]. The bill had been opposed fiercely in Parliament by the [[Ceylon Workers' Congress|Ceylon Indian Congress]], which represented the Indian Tamils, and the Sinhalese [[leftist]] parties, as well as the [[All Ceylon Tamil Congress]], which represented the [[Sri Lankan Tamils]], including its leader [[G.G.

He developed Ceylon's post-independence foreign policy, establishing formal relations with foreign nations. Initially gaining membership of the [[Commonwealth]] and establishing diplomatic ties other member countries, he established diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan. He established the [[Ceylon Overseas Service]] to build a carder of career diplomats. He hosted the Commonwealth Conference of Foreign Ministers, held in Colombo in January 1950. One of the significant outcomes of this conference was the establishment of the [[Colombo Plan]].\n\n===Defence===\n[[File:PM visits the 1st Bn CLI.jpg|thumb|right|D. S. Senanayake visiting the 1st battalion of the [[Sri Lanka Light Infantry|CLI]] at the [[Echelon Barracks|Echelon Square.]]]]\nAlthough Ceylon had maintained a [[Ceylon Defence Force|small volunteer force]] for the defense of coloney, Senanayake introduced the Army Act (1949), Navy Act (1950) and the Air Force Act (1951) establishing the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces|Armed forces of Ceylon]]. Having engaged in Defence Agreement with Britain when gaining independence, Senanayake retained British bases in Ceylon and gain her assistance in training and arming its new military.\n\n===Political challenges===\nIn the early years of Senanayake's premiership he faced opposition and criticism from many of the [[Sri Lanka leftist parties|leftist parties]]. He soon had difficulties with one of the strongest members of his cabinet and leader of the largest factions of his party, [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]]. Bandaranaike joined his [[Sinhala Maha Sabha]] in forming the UNP in 1947 having given the impression that Senanayake would soon retire and he would succeed him. With no signs of Senanayake retiring and conflicts with Senanayake on hard line nationalist policies of he had, in 1951, Bandaranaike resigned from his posts and dissolved the Sinhala Maha Sabha and established the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] (SLFP). Senanayake assumed the portfolio of Health and Local Government held by Bandaranaike and began countering his break in parliament for the next few months.<ref>Richardson (2005), ''Paradise Poisoned'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sIRxpjfd-EC&pg=PA145 p. 145.]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn the morning of Friday, 21 March 1952, Senanayake took his usual pre-breakfast ride on [[Galle Face Green]], a short distance from his official residence [[Temple Trees]]. He was riding the one of his favorite horses ''Chitra'' a [[mare]] belonging to the [[mounted police]]. Accompanying him on that day was [[Richard Aluwihare|Sir Richard Aluwihare]], the [[Inspector General of Police|IGP]]; [[G.G. Ponnambalam]], a cabinet minister and [[Inspector of Police|Inspector]] [[Eddie Grey]]. The horse broke into a gallop from a canter and went on for a mile, when suddenly the Prime Minister fell off the saddle.\n\nHe was taken to a nursing home where he remained unconscious for the next thirty-two hours. It was believed that he had suffered a [[stroke]]. He was treated by Dr M. V. P. Pieris, Ceylon's senior surgeon and a team of Professors from the [[University of Manitoba]] who had been visiting Ceylon as part of a [[WHO]] medical mission. A radio message was sent for [[Hugh Cairns (surgeon)|Sir Hugh Cairns]], who decided to fly out to Ceylon to attend the Prime Minister. [[Winston Churchill]] order a [[RAF]] [[Handley Page Hastings|Hastings]] with a double crew to take Sir Hugh. However the aircraft with three more doctors and two nurses was taxing to take off when the message was received that it was too late as the Prime Minister's situation was deteriorating. Two more neurosurgeons from India and Pakistan had reached Colombo, it was too late.

Senanayake and Mollie Dunuwille in 1910.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Wedding of D. S.

A keen horticulturist, he grew orchids and would typically wear an orchid in the lapel of his suit. He suffered from diabetes most of his later life.\n\n===Marriage and children===\nD. S. Senanayake married [[Mollie Dunuwila Senanayake|Molly Dunuwila]] in 1910. She was the daughter of R. R. Dunuwila, then Secretary of the [[Colombo Municipal Council]] and Grace Jayatilaka, daughter of Frederick Jayatilaka of the [[Ceylon Civil Service]] and District Judge of Kalutara. They had two sons, [[Dudley Shelton Senanayake]] (19 June 1911 \u2013 13 April 1973) and Robert Parakrama Senanayake (8 April 1913 \u2013 26 April 1986).<ref name=\"island.lk\"/> His eldest son, Dudley Shelton Senanayake, succeeded him as Prime Minister in 1952, followed by his nephew, Sir [[John Kotelawala]] (1897\u20131980) in 1953, but this nine-year family dynasty ended with the [[landslide victory]] of [[Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike]] in 1956, campaigning under the \"[[Sinhala Only Act|Sinhala Only]]\" slogan.

Under his family's leadership, Sri Lanka's economy flourished, and he is still known as \"The Father of Sri Lanka\".\n\nStatues of D. S.

[[Video game publisher|publisher]] founded in 1996 by [[Gabe Newell]] and [[Mike Harrington]]. The company is based in [[Bellevue, Washington]].<ref name=\"gamesradar history\" /> Valve's first game was ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', a [[first-person shooter]] released in 1998.<ref name=\"ign hl review\" /> It received universal acclaim and sold over nine million retail copies.<ref name=\"metacritic hl\" /><ref name=\"gamasutra sales\" /> Alongside ''Half-Life''{{'}}s launch, Valve released development tools to enable the player community to create content and [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]].<ref name=\"bafta fellowship\" /> The company then proceeded to hire the creators of popular mods, such as ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which became the most popular multiplayer first-person shooter for the next decade.<ref name=\"gamesradar history\" />\n\nValve continued their trend of developing predominantly [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] video games in the 2000s with a number of critically successful releases. In 2004, they released the highly anticipated sequel ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' through their own digital distribution service [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. The game sold over 10 million copies and was met with acclaim. Valve released two subsequent episodes for ''Half-Life 2'' and later packaged those games together with the puzzle game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' and the multiplayer shooter ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' in a collection known as ''[[The Orange Box]]''.<ref name=\"gamesradar history2\" /> By the end of 2008, combined retail sales of the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]], [[Counter-Strike|''Counter-Strike'' series]] and ''The Orange Box'' had surpassed 32 million units.<ref name=\"gamasutra sales\" /> Newell also projected that digital sales of Valve's games would eventually exceed retail sales as Steam continued to grow.<ref name=\"gamasutra sales\" /><ref name=\"gamasutra steam\" /> In the late 2000s, Valve released two zombie-themed first-person shooters focusing on [[cooperative gameplay]] with the [[Left 4 Dead (series)|''Left 4 Dead'' series]]. The company continued to release multiplayer games with the launches of ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'' and ''[[Dota 2]]'',<ref name=\"gamesradar history2\" /> both of which have large [[esports]] communities fostered by Valve.<ref name=\"espn esports\" /> During the 2010s, Valve began focusing on supporting their established multiplayer games with regular content updates.<ref name=\"gamesradar history2\" /><ref name=\"kotaku csgo update\" /><ref name=\"pcgamer dota7\" /><ref name=\"pcgamer tf2 updates\" /> In the late 2010s, Valve began investing in [[virtual reality]] and started to develop games and other software that make use of the technology, such as ''[[Half-Life: Alyx]]''.<ref name=\"polygon vr\" /><ref name=\"theverge hla\" />\n\nValve is considered to be one of the most important and influential companies in the gaming industry.<ref name=\"gamesradar important\" /> The reception of their games, along with the creation of Steam, has prompted some publications to list Valve as one of the top game developers of all time,<ref name=\"ign top maker\" /><ref name=\"gamasutra top dev\" /> and the most powerful company in [[PC game|PC gaming]].<ref

Founded in 1876, Calvin University is an educational institution of the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]] and stands in the [[Reformed churches|Reformed tradition]] of [[Protestantism]].<ref name=usnwr /> Known as Calvin College for most of its history, the school is named after [[John Calvin]], the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant Reformer]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\nThe [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]] founded the school on August 4, 1876, as part of ''Calvin College and Theological Seminary'' (with the seminary becoming [[Calvin Theological Seminary]]) to train church ministers. The college and seminary began with seven students, in a rented upper room on Spring Street, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The initial six-year [[curriculum]] included four years of literary studies and two years of [[theology]]. In 1892, the campus moved to the intersection of Madison Avenue and Franklin Street (Fifth Avenue) in Grand Rapids. In September 1894, the school expanded the curriculum for those who were not pre-theological students, effectually making the institution a preparatory school. In 1900, the curriculum further broadened, making it more attractive to students interested in teaching or preparing for professional courses at universities.  In 1901, Calvin admitted the first women to the school.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = History  | work =   | publisher = Calvin University  | date =  | url = https://calvin.edu/about/history/   | doi =   | accessdate = 30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1906, the literary department of the college became known as ''John Calvin Junior College'' and the college held its first commencement.<ref name=\"History\"/>  The student newspaper ''Chimes'' was first published in 1907. Around 1910, the West Michigan cities of Muskegon and Kalamazoo fought to have Calvin relocate to their respective cities. Muskegon offered [[US$]]10,000 (approximately $260,000 in 2015 dollars) and a tract of land to attract the college. The city of Grand Rapids countered with its own $10,000 offer and the junior college chose to stay in Grand Rapids. In time, the two-year college became a four-year college, and the preparatory department was discontinued. In 1917, John Calvin Junior College moved to the Franklin Street Campus, which was the southeast edge of Grand Rapids at the time. Two years later the college appointed its first president, the [[John Hiemenga|Rev. J.J. Hiemenga]]. Then a year later, in 1920, the college officially transitioned into a four-year college following the liberal arts philosophy of the [[Vrije Universiteit|Free University]] in [[Amsterdam]] as laid out by Dutch theologian and statesman Abraham Kuyper.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuyper|first=Abraham|title=Lectures on Calvinism: The Stone Lectures of 1898|year=2008|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|isbn=9781598562989|pages=197|url=http://www.reformationalpublishingproject.com/pdf_books/Scanned_Books_PDF/LecturesOnCalvinism.pdf}}</ref> The next year the college awarded its first bachelor's degree. In 1924, with the opening of [[Grand Rapids Christian High School]], the college offered its last year of preparatory education, turned its focus exclusively to higher education, and opened its first dormitory. In 1925, the college began a teacher training program and, in 1926, appointed its first female faculty member, Johanna Timmer, as Dean of Women. The college dedicated its library, the Hekman Library on March 8, 1928. The college later dedicated its seminary building at the Franklin Street Campus on October 29, 1930. Still under the leadership of Rev. Hiemenga the college faced significant trouble during the [[Great Depression]] as financial hardship beset the college.<ref name=rbkuiper>{{cite web|title=Rienk B. Kuiper|url=http://www.calvin.edu/hh/seminary_presidents/semm_pres_kuiper.htm|website=Calvin University|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the school grew slowly in these early years, by 1930 it had reached its pre-[[World War I]] size of 350-450 students. Like many colleges in the United States, the end of the war led to the fastest enrollment increase in Calvin's history.  By 1950 the enrollment had climbed to 1,270 and Calvin joined the [[Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association|M.I.A.A.]]. The enrollment increase led to space limitations at the Franklin Campus. William Spoelhoef became president of Calvin in 1951.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nIn 1956, the [[Synod]] of the Christian Reformed Church authorized the college to purchase the Knollcrest Farm from J.C. Miller for $400,000 (approximately $3.6 million in 2018). Located beyond the Grand Rapids city limits at the time, the Knollcrest farm increased Calvin's campus from approximately one large city block to {{nowrap|{{convert|390|acre|km2|abbr=on}}}} with a {{nowrap|{{convert|100|acre|km2|abbr=on}}}} nature preserve.  Many were reticent about the project and the college's ability to finance it, but Spoelhof pursued the initiative. The Theological Seminary was first to move to the new campus since it did not need to be close to the rest of college,  building a new academic building and holding classes there starting in 1960. As space constraints became more noticeable on the Franklin campus, the college built its first academic building on the Knollcrest Campus and first held classes there in 1962. For the next 10 years, the college continued to operate at both the Knollcrest and Franklin campuses, until fully transitioning to the Knollcrest Campus in 1973. During the latter decades of the 20th century, Calvin grew to around 4,200 students. In 1991, the seminary and the college established separate boards of trustees.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, Calvin began several new construction projects.  Among these were a new communications and political science building, a conference center and hotel. In 2006, Calvin announced an expansion of the Fieldhouse which was completed in the spring of 2009.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Anderson  | first = Myrna  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Calvin dedicates new fieldhouse | work =   | publisher = Calvin College  | date = 2009-02-24 | url = http://www.calvin.edu/news/2008-09/SFC-dedication/   | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 2009-03-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608130957/http://www.calvin.edu/news/2008-09/SFC-dedication/|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref> Shortly after, in 2010, Calvin completed an extensive renovation and expansion of the Fine Arts Center, thereafter rededicated as the Covenant Fine Arts Center.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vision & Priorities: Covenant Fine Arts Center|url=http://www.calvin.edu/campaign/priorities/fac/|work=The Campaign for Calvin College|publisher=Calvin College|accessdate=26 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531232749/http://www.calvin.edu/campaign/priorities/fac/|archive-date=31 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe curriculum has expanded to include professional training in a variety of fields, but the college maintains a strong commitment to a liberal arts curriculum, which the college views as a means to develop students' understanding of God's world and their place in it.\n\nThe school made national headlines in 2005 when [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George W.

The average student takes 45 hours of core courses in the course of a four-year degree at Calvin.\n\nWhen students matriculate into Calvin, they begin their studies with a first-year, ''Core Gateway'' seminar which introduces students to issues of learning, identity, vocation, discernment, and awareness through discussions and presentations. Students also take Developing a Christian Mind (DCM) in the discipline of their choice, a course which (through the lenses of various academic disciplines)  introduces the idea of Christian worldview and faith-based engagement with culture.\n\nCalvin students are required to take a number of essential classes focusing on ''Core Competencies and Core Studies''.  Core Competencies, such as written rhetoric, world language, and information technology, develop skills essential to success in the academic and professional worlds. Core studies courses introduce students to a variety of disciplines, providing them with a greater understanding of the world and integration of ideas essential to a well-rounded liberal arts education. Typically a number of core courses will overlap with major and minor requirements.\n\nThe ''Capstone'' course, generally taken during the senior year, draws together themes and concepts from the core curriculum. Some Capstone course are intended for students of specific majors, while others may be unrelated to a student's chosen major(s) and minor(s), such as PHIL 205: Ethics, which can qualify as the capstone course for students of any major, including non-philosophy majors.<ref>https://catalog.calvin.edu/content.php?catoid=15&navoid=483</ref>\n\n===Off-campus programs===\nCalvin offers a large number of off-campus programs and ranks 2nd out of baccalaureate institutions for the number of students who study abroad each year.<ref name=\"Study Abroad Ranking\">{{cite web|title=Open Doors Data|url=http://www.iie.org/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/Data/US-Study-Abroad/Leading-Institutions-by-Institutional-Type/2013-14/|work=Institute of International Education|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Semester programs====\nCalvin runs 11 of its own off-campus semester programs.  These programs are led by Calvin faculty to ensure that students receive the same caliber of education that they would receive on campus.  These programs are currently offered in the [[United Kingdom]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ghana]], [[Honduras]], [[Hungary]], [[Peru]], [[Spain]], and [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref name=\"Off Campus\">{{cite web|title=Off-Campus Programs|url=https://calvin.edu/offices-services/off-campus-programs/programs/semester-programs/|work=Calvin University|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Calvin works with numerous other colleges to offer dozens of other off-campus programs around the world.<ref name=\"Non-Calvin Programs\">{{cite web|title=Non-Calvin Programs|url=https://calvin.edu/offices-services/off-campus-programs/programs/non-calvin-programs/|work=Calvin University|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Off-campus interim====\nCalvin also offers a variety of off-campus programs during the one-month interim term that takes place each January.

Unlike many college campuses which feature an impressive structure, like a chapel, tower, or administrative hall, at the center of campus, Calvin has no central building. The major buildings on campus form a great circle around the Commons Lawn. The lawn was intended and serves as the common point of interaction between faculty, students, and administration.  Following the ideal of an integrated community, most buildings serve a variety of purposes. Administration is mixed with classrooms, faculty offices and lecture halls. Departments are not sequestered from other departments in separate buildings; instead many departments share facilities to encourage the solidarity of purpose and unity contributing to a strong inter-departmental character and strong Christian community.\n\n===Academic buildings===\nCalvin has nine academic buildings on campus.\n\nThe first to be constructed was Hiemenga Hall, named after John Hiemenga and built in 1961.  Hiemenga Hall houses numerous academic departments including modern languages, [[history]], [[philosophy]], classical languages, gender studies, and [[theology|religion]].  The building also houses some programs and offices.  It is connected to the campus chapel and the Spoelhof Center via tunnels.\n\nThe Spoelhof Center, named after president emeritus [[William Spoelhof]], houses the [[art]], [[education]], [[social work]] and [[sociology]] departments, the Office of the President, and several other administrative departments.  The Gezon Auditorium is also housed in the Spoelhof Center.  Dedicated in 1974, the Gezon Auditorium primarily serves as the main stage for the Calvin Theatre Company.  Like the CFAC, it has flexible lighting and sound systems and serves as a venue for concerts, lectures and other events. The Spoelhof Center connects to the Science Building and Hiemenga Hall via tunnels.\n\nThe Science Building houses many of the science departments at Calvin, including [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[psychology]] and [[nursing]].  The building also includes half of the [[Calvin-Rehoboth Robotic Observatory]].  When there are favorable skies, the observatory is open to the public on most weeknights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Calvin Observatory|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/phys/observatory/|work=Physics and Astronomy|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> The Science Building is also distinctive for having been designed in the shape of a hexagon, emulating the [[benzene]] ring. In 2009, it was the backdrop for scenes of the film ''[[The Genesis Code]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Serba|first=John|title='Genesis Code' shoot on Calvin College campus has actors dressed in winter garb|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2009/08/grand_rapids_hopefully_movie.html|accessdate=7 April 2012|newspaper=The Grand Rapids Press|date=4 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nConstructed in 1998, DeVries Hall houses classrooms, faculty offices, research labs and a greenhouse.  In addition to the [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] departments, the building houses the West Michigan Regional Lab, a consortium between the college and local hospital, Spectrum Health.\n\nAttached to DeVries Hall and the Science Building is North Hall, which houses several departments including [[economics]], [[business]], [[geology]], [[geography]], [[environmental studies]], [[computer science]], and [[mathematics]].\n\nTo the west of North Hall is the Engineering Building which consists of the Prince Engineering Design Center and the Vermeer Engineering Projects Center.  The Engineering Building was constructed in 1999 and houses faculty and student research facilities, metal and wood shops, a wind tunnel, a three-dimensional printer, and an [[anechoic chamber]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Engineering Facilities|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/engineering/about/facilities/|work=Calvin College|accessdate=26 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406112734/http://www.calvin.edu/academic/engineering/about/facilities/|archivedate=2014-04-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex, located on the north end of campus, houses a number of classrooms and houses the [[Kinesiology]] department. The fieldhouse underwent a major renovation and expansion in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex|url=http://www.calvin.edu/map/sfc/|work=Campus Map|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Covenant Fine Arts Center is one of the most recognizable buildings on campus, given its giant heptagon shape.  Designed around the central auditorium, which seats 1,011, the CFAC houses the [[Music]] and [[English language|English]] departments.  The CFAC auditorium is the preeminent musical performance space on campus featuring exceptional acoustics.  At the back of the stage is the 39 rank, 32 stop mechanical action organ built by [http://www.schlickerorgans.com/about.htm Schlicker] [[Organ (music)|Organ]] Company in 1966. Since its opening, the CFAC has hosted over 18,000 events. The auditorium is designed for versatility and is equipped with acoustical curtains, shifting acoustic deflection panels, a stage lift, and three catwalks. The building was closed for 2009-2010 for extensive remodeling.\n\n[[File:Calvin Crossing in Winter.jpg|thumb|right|Calvin Crossing]]\n\nIn 2002, the DeVos Communication Center was constructed across the East Beltline Road.  It is connected to west campus by the Calvin Crossing bridge. The building's upper level houses department and faculty offices for both the political science and communications arts and sciences departments.  Additionally, there is a suite of audiology and speech pathology classrooms and facilities including a working clinic.  The lower level of the building features media production and consumption facilities such as the Bytwerk Video Theatre, an audio studio, [[sound stage]], control room, and editing suites for audio and video production.  The ground floor features classrooms, a public atrium, and a snack shop.\n\n===Hekman Library===\n\nBeginning in 1917 with 3,500 volumes, Calvin's \"library room\" eventually became the modern Hekman Library now boasting over one million volumes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Library Statistics|url=https://library.calvin.edu/about/statistics|work=Hekman Library|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref> The collection's emphasis is on works in the traditional liberal arts disciplines.

Henry Meeter Center for Calvin Studies is located in the Hekman Library.  The center specializes in John Calvin and Calvinism.  With many rare items, books, manuscripts, articles and literature, the Meeter Center is the largest collection of Calvin materials in North America.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meeter Center|url=http://www.calvin.edu/meeter/about/|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Athletic facilities==\nThe Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex is home to the combined health, physical education, recreation, dance and sport department.  In Spring 2007, the college began a $50 million construction project to renovate and expand the Calvin Fieldhouse.  The fieldhouse reopened in Spring 2009 as the Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex. The {{convert|362000|sqft|m2}} facility includes a new 5,000 seat arena ([[Van Noord Arena]]) which is currently the largest arena in a Division III school, an Olympic-regulation swimming pool (Venema Aquatic Center) which seats about 550, a tennis and track center (Huizenga Tennis and Track Center) containing 4 tennis courts and a 200-meter track, {{convert|14000|sqft|m2}} of weight training rooms and a custom made rock climbing wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://calvin.edu/athletics/facilities/|title=Athletic Facilities|publisher=calvin.edu|accessdate=2019-04-05}}</ref> The Hoogenboom Health and Recreation Center contains the original renovated gym that is now used for basketball, volleyball, PE classes, intramurals, and many concerts.  The Hoogenboom Center also has two dance studios as well as racquetball courts and exercise science laboratories.\n\n===Chapel===\n[[File:Calvin Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|Calvin University Chapel]]\n\nThough always part of the master plan, the Chapel was not built until the late 1980s.  The chapel holds daily services in a protected time slot to ensure that all students and faculty members are able to attend the 20 minute worship services if they so choose. Chapel services follow a weekly rhythm and each day of the week has a different theme (Believe, Behold, Belong, Be Still, and Be Loud).<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapel|url=http://www.calvin.edu/faith/worship/chapel.html|work=Calvin University|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nDesigned by GMB Architects, the chapel sits at the highest point of the academic circle and its spire rises above all of the academic buildings.  Shaped as an octagon, with seating in the round, the Chapel offers exceptional acoustics for both instrumental and vocal music, in addition to the spoken word.  The Chapel also features a large organ built by [[Dobson Pipe Organ Builders]].  The three manual instrument features mechanical key action with a detached console.  The facade pipes, made of 75% burnished tin, conceal some 2,500 pipes.  In addition to the sanctuary, the Chapel has small prayer rooms, meeting spaces, a kitchen, theatre storage and rehearsal spaces.\n\nA tunnel system connecting to the Spoelhof Center creates an outdoor plaza at ground level and the multi-use Lab Theatre below.  The Lab Theatre is a blackbox theatre built in 1988 as a part of the chapel building project.<ref>{{cite web|title=Theater Locations: Behind the Scenes|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/ctc/theaters/more-info.html|work=Calvin Theatre Company|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Bunker Interpretive Center===\nThe Bunker Interpretive Center is located in Calvin's nature preserve and serves as the home base for formal programs and an educational resource for the approximately 5,000 casual visitors that the Calvin University Ecosystem Preserve & Native Gardens receives annually.

First and second year students may live off-campus if they lodge with their parents, it has been more than two years since their high school graduation date, or if they qualify for a rare exception.\n\nOne of the most notable events put on by residence life is \"Chaos Day\", during which the residents of each of the halls have their own theme, decorate their dorm, and dress in costumes to compete in a number of relay races and similar games.<ref>{{cite news|last=Struyk|first=Ryan|title=Underclassmen, dorm leadership rally for Chaos Day|url=http://www.calvin.edu/chimes/2012/09/06/underclassmen-dorm-leadership-rally-for-chaos-day/|accessdate=26 August 2013|newspaper=Chimes|date=7 September 2012}}</ref> The dorm building Schultze-Eldersveld has traditionally dominated the Chaos Day competition and has the most victories of any hall.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Buitenhuis|first1=Ericka|title=45 Years of Chaos Day: The Making of Calvin\u2019s Coveted Competition|url=http://www.calvin.edu/chimes/2014/09/13/45-years-of-chaos-day-the-making-of-calvins-coveted-competition/|website=Chimes|accessdate=31 December 2016|date=12 September 2014}}</ref> Floor Serenades, when one floor goes around campus singing songs to other floors,<ref>{{cite web|last=Graff|first=Allison R.|title=After-hours at Calvin|url=http://www.calvin.edu/verge/2012/fall/after-hours-at-calvin|work=Verge|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref> and Floor Dates, when two or more floors plan an activity together in order to meet new people, are common occurrences on campus.\n\n===Student Activities Office and The Calvin Concert Series===\n\nThe Student Activities Office at Calvin plans and hosts many films, concerts, and lectures aimed to foster cultural engagement and discernment in a Christian context.  The Student Activities Office shows a wide variety of popular and lesser-known films throughout the year.  Admission to these films, hosted in the Covenant Fine Arts Center, is $1.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.calvin.edu/sao/about-us.html|work=Student Activities Office|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ben Harper at Calvin College.jpg|thumb|[[Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals]] live at Calvin College, 2000|345x345px]]\n\nCalvin is also notable for its extensive concert series. Before each concert, Calvin hosts a question and answer session with students and the artist. These sessions are meant to give artists a way to converse with students about their music and art. Calvin has hosted a variety of acts including:<ref>{{cite web|title=Calendar|url=http://www.calvin.edu/sao/calendar/|work=Student Activities Office|publisher=Calvin University|access-date=30 December 2016|date=September 2016}}</ref> Fun., Switchfoot, Death Cab for Cutie, Sufjan Stevens, MuteMath, Gungor, MGMT, the Soil & the Sun, Twin Forks, Ingrid Michaelson, Home Free, Regina Spektor, Over the Rhine, Anberlin, Jon Foreman, Peter Rollins and David Bazan, Kishi Bashi, All Sons & Daughters, NEEDTOBREATHE, Shad, Miracles of Modern Science, Diego Garcia, San Fermin, The Brilliance, Delorean, Pop Scholars, Okkervil River, The Head and The Heart, The National, Julianna Barwick, Lone Bellow, The Milk Carton Kids, Lily & Madeleine, Lecrae. The January Series also offers a wide selection of authors, singers, and musicians.\n\nBecause of its extensive and varied concert series, the Student Activities Office has faced controversy over the years.

The college and seminary began with seven students, in a rented upper room on Spring Street, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The initial six-year [[curriculum]] included four years of literary studies and two years of [[theology]]. In 1892, the campus moved to the intersection of Madison Avenue and Franklin Street (Fifth Avenue) in Grand Rapids. In September 1894, the school expanded the curriculum for those who were not pre-theological students, effectually making the institution a preparatory school. In 1900, the curriculum further broadened, making it more attractive to students interested in teaching or preparing for professional courses at universities.  In 1901, Calvin admitted the first women to the school.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = History  | work =   | publisher = Calvin University  | date =  | url = https://calvin.edu/about/history/   | doi =   | accessdate = 30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1906, the literary department of the college became known as ''John Calvin Junior College'' and the college held its first commencement.<ref name=\"History\"/>  The student newspaper ''Chimes'' was first published in 1907. Around 1910, the West Michigan cities of Muskegon and Kalamazoo fought to have Calvin relocate to their respective cities. Muskegon offered [[US$]]10,000 (approximately $260,000 in 2015 dollars) and a tract of land to attract the college. The city of Grand Rapids countered with its own $10,000 offer and the junior college chose to stay in Grand Rapids. In time, the two-year college became a four-year college, and the preparatory department was discontinued. In 1917, John Calvin Junior College moved to the Franklin Street Campus, which was the southeast edge of Grand Rapids at the time. Two years later the college appointed its first president, the [[John Hiemenga|Rev. J.J. Hiemenga]]. Then a year later, in 1920, the college officially transitioned into a four-year college following the liberal arts philosophy of the [[Vrije Universiteit|Free University]] in [[Amsterdam]] as laid out by Dutch theologian and statesman Abraham Kuyper.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuyper|first=Abraham|title=Lectures on Calvinism: The Stone Lectures of 1898|year=2008|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|isbn=9781598562989|pages=197|url=http://www.reformationalpublishingproject.com/pdf_books/Scanned_Books_PDF/LecturesOnCalvinism.pdf}}</ref> The next year the college awarded its first bachelor's degree. In 1924, with the opening of [[Grand Rapids Christian High School]], the college offered its last year of preparatory education, turned its focus exclusively to higher education, and opened its first dormitory. In 1925, the college began a teacher training program and, in 1926, appointed its first female faculty member, Johanna Timmer, as Dean of Women. The college dedicated its library, the Hekman Library on March 8, 1928. The college later dedicated its seminary building at the Franklin Street Campus on October 29, 1930. Still under the leadership of Rev. Hiemenga the college faced significant trouble during the [[Great Depression]] as financial hardship beset the college.<ref name=rbkuiper>{{cite web|title=Rienk B. Kuiper|url=http://www.calvin.edu/hh/seminary_presidents/semm_pres_kuiper.htm|website=Calvin University|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the school grew slowly in these early years, by 1930 it had reached its pre-[[World War I]] size of 350-450 students. Like many colleges in the United States, the end of the war led to the fastest enrollment increase in Calvin's history.  By 1950 the enrollment had climbed to 1,270 and Calvin joined the [[Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association|M.I.A.A.]]. The enrollment increase led to space limitations at the Franklin Campus. William Spoelhoef became president of Calvin in 1951.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nIn 1956, the [[Synod]] of the Christian Reformed Church authorized the college to purchase the Knollcrest Farm from J.C. Miller for $400,000 (approximately $3.6 million in 2018). Located beyond the Grand Rapids city limits at the time, the Knollcrest farm increased Calvin's campus from approximately one large city block to {{nowrap|{{convert|390|acre|km2|abbr=on}}}} with a {{nowrap|{{convert|100|acre|km2|abbr=on}}}} nature preserve.  Many were reticent about the project and the college's ability to finance it, but Spoelhof pursued the initiative. The Theological Seminary was first to move to the new campus since it did not need to be close to the rest of college,  building a new academic building and holding classes there starting in 1960. As space constraints became more noticeable on the Franklin campus, the college built its first academic building on the Knollcrest Campus and first held classes there in 1962. For the next 10 years, the college continued to operate at both the Knollcrest and Franklin campuses, until fully transitioning to the Knollcrest Campus in 1973. During the latter decades of the 20th century, Calvin grew to around 4,200 students. In 1991, the seminary and the college established separate boards of trustees.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, Calvin began several new construction projects.  Among these were a new communications and political science building, a conference center and hotel. In 2006, Calvin announced an expansion of the Fieldhouse which was completed in the spring of 2009.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Anderson  | first = Myrna  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Calvin dedicates new fieldhouse | work =   | publisher = Calvin College  | date = 2009-02-24 | url = http://www.calvin.edu/news/2008-09/SFC-dedication/   | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 2009-03-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608130957/http://www.calvin.edu/news/2008-09/SFC-dedication/|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref> Shortly after, in 2010, Calvin completed an extensive renovation and expansion of the Fine Arts Center, thereafter rededicated as the Covenant Fine Arts Center.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vision & Priorities: Covenant Fine Arts Center|url=http://www.calvin.edu/campaign/priorities/fac/|work=The Campaign for Calvin College|publisher=Calvin College|accessdate=26 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531232749/http://www.calvin.edu/campaign/priorities/fac/|archive-date=31 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe curriculum has expanded to include professional training in a variety of fields, but the college maintains a strong commitment to a liberal arts curriculum, which the college views as a means to develop students' understanding of God's world and their place in it.\n\nThe school made national headlines in 2005 when [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George W.

The average student takes 45 hours of core courses in the course of a four-year degree at Calvin.\n\nWhen students matriculate into Calvin, they begin their studies with a first-year, ''Core Gateway'' seminar which introduces students to issues of learning, identity, vocation, discernment, and awareness through discussions and presentations. Students also take Developing a Christian Mind (DCM) in the discipline of their choice, a course which (through the lenses of various academic disciplines)  introduces the idea of Christian worldview and faith-based engagement with culture.\n\nCalvin students are required to take a number of essential classes focusing on ''Core Competencies and Core Studies''.  Core Competencies, such as written rhetoric, world language, and information technology, develop skills essential to success in the academic and professional worlds. Core studies courses introduce students to a variety of disciplines, providing them with a greater understanding of the world and integration of ideas essential to a well-rounded liberal arts education. Typically a number of core courses will overlap with major and minor requirements.\n\nThe ''Capstone'' course, generally taken during the senior year, draws together themes and concepts from the core curriculum. Some Capstone course are intended for students of specific majors, while others may be unrelated to a student's chosen major(s) and minor(s), such as PHIL 205: Ethics, which can qualify as the capstone course for students of any major, including non-philosophy majors.<ref>https://catalog.calvin.edu/content.php?catoid=15&navoid=483</ref>\n\n===Off-campus programs===\nCalvin offers a large number of off-campus programs and ranks 2nd out of baccalaureate institutions for the number of students who study abroad each year.<ref name=\"Study Abroad Ranking\">{{cite web|title=Open Doors Data|url=http://www.iie.org/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/Data/US-Study-Abroad/Leading-Institutions-by-Institutional-Type/2013-14/|work=Institute of International Education|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Semester programs====\nCalvin runs 11 of its own off-campus semester programs.  These programs are led by Calvin faculty to ensure that students receive the same caliber of education that they would receive on campus.  These programs are currently offered in the [[United Kingdom]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ghana]], [[Honduras]], [[Hungary]], [[Peru]], [[Spain]], and [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref name=\"Off Campus\">{{cite web|title=Off-Campus Programs|url=https://calvin.edu/offices-services/off-campus-programs/programs/semester-programs/|work=Calvin University|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Calvin works with numerous other colleges to offer dozens of other off-campus programs around the world.<ref name=\"Non-Calvin Programs\">{{cite web|title=Non-Calvin Programs|url=https://calvin.edu/offices-services/off-campus-programs/programs/non-calvin-programs/|work=Calvin University|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Off-campus interim====\nCalvin also offers a variety of off-campus programs during the one-month interim term that takes place each January.

Unlike many college campuses which feature an impressive structure, like a chapel, tower, or administrative hall, at the center of campus, Calvin has no central building. The major buildings on campus form a great circle around the Commons Lawn. The lawn was intended and serves as the common point of interaction between faculty, students, and administration.  Following the ideal of an integrated community, most buildings serve a variety of purposes. Administration is mixed with classrooms, faculty offices and lecture halls. Departments are not sequestered from other departments in separate buildings; instead many departments share facilities to encourage the solidarity of purpose and unity contributing to a strong inter-departmental character and strong Christian community.\n\n===Academic buildings===\nCalvin has nine academic buildings on campus.\n\nThe first to be constructed was Hiemenga Hall, named after John Hiemenga and built in 1961.  Hiemenga Hall houses numerous academic departments including modern languages, [[history]], [[philosophy]], classical languages, gender studies, and [[theology|religion]].  The building also houses some programs and offices.  It is connected to the campus chapel and the Spoelhof Center via tunnels.\n\nThe Spoelhof Center, named after president emeritus [[William Spoelhof]], houses the [[art]], [[education]], [[social work]] and [[sociology]] departments, the Office of the President, and several other administrative departments.  The Gezon Auditorium is also housed in the Spoelhof Center.  Dedicated in 1974, the Gezon Auditorium primarily serves as the main stage for the Calvin Theatre Company.  Like the CFAC, it has flexible lighting and sound systems and serves as a venue for concerts, lectures and other events. The Spoelhof Center connects to the Science Building and Hiemenga Hall via tunnels.\n\nThe Science Building houses many of the science departments at Calvin, including [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[psychology]] and [[nursing]].  The building also includes half of the [[Calvin-Rehoboth Robotic Observatory]].  When there are favorable skies, the observatory is open to the public on most weeknights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Calvin Observatory|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/phys/observatory/|work=Physics and Astronomy|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> The Science Building is also distinctive for having been designed in the shape of a hexagon, emulating the [[benzene]] ring. In 2009, it was the backdrop for scenes of the film ''[[The Genesis Code]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Serba|first=John|title='Genesis Code' shoot on Calvin College campus has actors dressed in winter garb|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2009/08/grand_rapids_hopefully_movie.html|accessdate=7 April 2012|newspaper=The Grand Rapids Press|date=4 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nConstructed in 1998, DeVries Hall houses classrooms, faculty offices, research labs and a greenhouse.  In addition to the [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] departments, the building houses the West Michigan Regional Lab, a consortium between the college and local hospital, Spectrum Health.\n\nAttached to DeVries Hall and the Science Building is North Hall, which houses several departments including [[economics]], [[business]], [[geology]], [[geography]], [[environmental studies]], [[computer science]], and [[mathematics]].\n\nTo the west of North Hall is the Engineering Building which consists of the Prince Engineering Design Center and the Vermeer Engineering Projects Center.  The Engineering Building was constructed in 1999 and houses faculty and student research facilities, metal and wood shops, a wind tunnel, a three-dimensional printer, and an [[anechoic chamber]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Engineering Facilities|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/engineering/about/facilities/|work=Calvin College|accessdate=26 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406112734/http://www.calvin.edu/academic/engineering/about/facilities/|archivedate=2014-04-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex, located on the north end of campus, houses a number of classrooms and houses the [[Kinesiology]] department. The fieldhouse underwent a major renovation and expansion in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex|url=http://www.calvin.edu/map/sfc/|work=Campus Map|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Covenant Fine Arts Center is one of the most recognizable buildings on campus, given its giant heptagon shape.  Designed around the central auditorium, which seats 1,011, the CFAC houses the [[Music]] and [[English language|English]] departments.  The CFAC auditorium is the preeminent musical performance space on campus featuring exceptional acoustics.  At the back of the stage is the 39 rank, 32 stop mechanical action organ built by [http://www.schlickerorgans.com/about.htm Schlicker] [[Organ (music)|Organ]] Company in 1966. Since its opening, the CFAC has hosted over 18,000 events. The auditorium is designed for versatility and is equipped with acoustical curtains, shifting acoustic deflection panels, a stage lift, and three catwalks. The building was closed for 2009-2010 for extensive remodeling.\n\n[[File:Calvin Crossing in Winter.jpg|thumb|right|Calvin Crossing]]\n\nIn 2002, the DeVos Communication Center was constructed across the East Beltline Road.  It is connected to west campus by the Calvin Crossing bridge. The building's upper level houses department and faculty offices for both the political science and communications arts and sciences departments.  Additionally, there is a suite of audiology and speech pathology classrooms and facilities including a working clinic.  The lower level of the building features media production and consumption facilities such as the Bytwerk Video Theatre, an audio studio, [[sound stage]], control room, and editing suites for audio and video production.  The ground floor features classrooms, a public atrium, and a snack shop.\n\n===Hekman Library===\n\nBeginning in 1917 with 3,500 volumes, Calvin's \"library room\" eventually became the modern Hekman Library now boasting over one million volumes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Library Statistics|url=https://library.calvin.edu/about/statistics|work=Hekman Library|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref> The collection's emphasis is on works in the traditional liberal arts disciplines. The library's strongest collections are in [[Theology]], [[Religion]], [[American literature]], [[British literature]], and [[Philosophy]].\n\nIn terms of books, serial backfiles, and other paper materials held, Hekman Library is currently the largest private academic library in the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hekman Library|url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=biggest+libraries+in+michigan|accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe H. Henry Meeter Center for Calvin Studies is located in the Hekman Library.  The center specializes in John Calvin and Calvinism.  With many rare items, books, manuscripts, articles and literature, the Meeter Center is the largest collection of Calvin materials in North America.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meeter Center|url=http://www.calvin.edu/meeter/about/|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Athletic facilities==\nThe Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex is home to the combined health, physical education, recreation, dance and sport department.  In Spring 2007, the college began a $50 million construction project to renovate and expand the Calvin Fieldhouse.  The fieldhouse reopened in Spring 2009 as the Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex. The {{convert|362000|sqft|m2}} facility includes a new 5,000 seat arena ([[Van Noord Arena]]) which is currently the largest arena in a Division III school, an Olympic-regulation swimming pool (Venema Aquatic Center) which seats about 550, a tennis and track center (Huizenga Tennis and Track Center) containing 4 tennis courts and a 200-meter track, {{convert|14000|sqft|m2}} of weight training rooms and a custom made rock climbing wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://calvin.edu/athletics/facilities/|title=Athletic Facilities|publisher=calvin.edu|accessdate=2019-04-05}}</ref> The Hoogenboom Health and Recreation Center contains the original renovated gym that is now used for basketball, volleyball, PE classes, intramurals, and many concerts.  The Hoogenboom Center also has two dance studios as well as racquetball courts and exercise science laboratories.\n\n===Chapel===\n[[File:Calvin Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|Calvin University Chapel]]\n\nThough always part of the master plan, the Chapel was not built until the late 1980s.  The chapel holds daily services in a protected time slot to ensure that all students and faculty members are able to attend the 20 minute worship services if they so choose. Chapel services follow a weekly rhythm and each day of the week has a different theme (Believe, Behold, Belong, Be Still, and Be Loud).<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapel|url=http://www.calvin.edu/faith/worship/chapel.html|work=Calvin University|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nDesigned by GMB Architects, the chapel sits at the highest point of the academic circle and its spire rises above all of the academic buildings.  Shaped as an octagon, with seating in the round, the Chapel offers exceptional acoustics for both instrumental and vocal music, in addition to the spoken word.  The Chapel also features a large organ built by [[Dobson Pipe Organ Builders]].  The three manual instrument features mechanical key action with a detached console.  The facade pipes, made of 75% burnished tin, conceal some 2,500 pipes.  In addition to the sanctuary, the Chapel has small prayer rooms, meeting spaces, a kitchen, theatre storage and rehearsal spaces.\n\nA tunnel system connecting to the Spoelhof Center creates an outdoor plaza at ground level and the multi-use Lab Theatre below.  The Lab Theatre is a blackbox theatre built in 1988 as a part of the chapel building project.<ref>{{cite web|title=Theater Locations: Behind the Scenes|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/ctc/theaters/more-info.html|work=Calvin Theatre Company|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Bunker Interpretive Center===\nThe Bunker Interpretive Center is located in Calvin's nature preserve and serves as the home base for formal programs and an educational resource for the approximately 5,000 casual visitors that the Calvin University Ecosystem Preserve & Native Gardens receives annually.

First and second year students may live off-campus if they lodge with their parents, it has been more than two years since their high school graduation date, or if they qualify for a rare exception.\n\nOne of the most notable events put on by residence life is \"Chaos Day\", during which the residents of each of the halls have their own theme, decorate their dorm, and dress in costumes to compete in a number of relay races and similar games.<ref>{{cite news|last=Struyk|first=Ryan|title=Underclassmen, dorm leadership rally for Chaos Day|url=http://www.calvin.edu/chimes/2012/09/06/underclassmen-dorm-leadership-rally-for-chaos-day/|accessdate=26 August 2013|newspaper=Chimes|date=7 September 2012}}</ref> The dorm building Schultze-Eldersveld has traditionally dominated the Chaos Day competition and has the most victories of any hall.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Buitenhuis|first1=Ericka|title=45 Years of Chaos Day: The Making of Calvin\u2019s Coveted Competition|url=http://www.calvin.edu/chimes/2014/09/13/45-years-of-chaos-day-the-making-of-calvins-coveted-competition/|website=Chimes|accessdate=31 December 2016|date=12 September 2014}}</ref> Floor Serenades, when one floor goes around campus singing songs to other floors,<ref>{{cite web|last=Graff|first=Allison R.|title=After-hours at Calvin|url=http://www.calvin.edu/verge/2012/fall/after-hours-at-calvin|work=Verge|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref> and Floor Dates, when two or more floors plan an activity together in order to meet new people, are common occurrences on campus.\n\n===Student Activities Office and The Calvin Concert Series===\n\nThe Student Activities Office at Calvin plans and hosts many films, concerts, and lectures aimed to foster cultural engagement and discernment in a Christian context.  The Student Activities Office shows a wide variety of popular and lesser-known films throughout the year.  Admission to these films, hosted in the Covenant Fine Arts Center, is $1.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.calvin.edu/sao/about-us.html|work=Student Activities Office|publisher=Calvin University|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ben Harper at Calvin College.jpg|thumb|[[Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals]] live at Calvin College, 2000|345x345px]]\n\nCalvin is also notable for its extensive concert series. Before each concert, Calvin hosts a question and answer session with students and the artist. These sessions are meant to give artists a way to converse with students about their music and art. Calvin has hosted a variety of acts including:<ref>{{cite web|title=Calendar|url=http://www.calvin.edu/sao/calendar/|work=Student Activities Office|publisher=Calvin University|access-date=30 December 2016|date=September 2016}}</ref> Fun., Switchfoot, Death Cab for Cutie, Sufjan Stevens, MuteMath, Gungor, MGMT, the Soil & the Sun, Twin Forks, Ingrid Michaelson, Home Free, Regina Spektor, Over the Rhine, Anberlin, Jon Foreman, Peter Rollins and David Bazan, Kishi Bashi, All Sons & Daughters, NEEDTOBREATHE, Shad, Miracles of Modern Science, Diego Garcia, San Fermin, The Brilliance, Delorean, Pop Scholars, Okkervil River, The Head and The Heart, The National, Julianna Barwick, Lone Bellow, The Milk Carton Kids, Lily & Madeleine, Lecrae. The January Series also offers a wide selection of authors, singers, and musicians.\n\nBecause of its extensive and varied concert series, the Student Activities Office has faced controversy over the years.  In September 2010, the college canceled a concert by Canadian indie rock band, [[The New Pornographers]]. According to an official statement released by Calvin, the concert was cancelled after several complaints were made due to the band's name referring to pornography.<ref>{{cite news|title=Calvin College CANCELS New Pornographers Concert Over Band's Name|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/15/calvin-college-cancels-ne_n_717494.html|accessdate=26 August 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=15 September 2010}}</ref> [[Fun (band)|Fun.]]'s advocacy of changed marriage laws when Calvin hosted them in 2012 was also met with significant controversy.<ref name=\"Fun.

At that time, all campus safety supervisors were issued collapsible batons, chemical spray and handcuffs as standard policy, even if they were not armed with a firearm.\n\nAt the time and until 2017, non-supervisory Campus Safety officers were student employees who performed their duties unarmed. In 2017, the Campus Safety Department made the decision to discontinue hiring students for non-supervisory campus safety officer roles, electing instead to hire former law enforcement officers who were licensed to carry firearms on campus. The Department continued to employ students employees as dispatchers, building security officers and customer service staff. The Campus Safety Department director, William Corner, stated that student officers were not fully qualified for the risk level of some of the incidents they were responding too. \u201cWe were putting the students in positions that, honestly, I was not comfortable with for their safety and their level of experience.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://calvinchimes.org/2017/09/29/campus-safety-increases-staff-student-hires/|title=Campus safety increases staff, hires fewer students|last=Butler|first=Hannah|date=September 29, 2017|website=Calvin College Chimes|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2014, full-time, non-student Calvin College campus safety personnel began wearing body cameras while on duty.
