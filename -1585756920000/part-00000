He is best known for his 16-film collaboration (1948\u201365) with [[Akira Kurosawa]] in such works as ''[[Rashomon]]'', ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', ''[[Throne of Blood]]'', and ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''.

Hoping to preserve their control of the region, the Japanese government maintained a large garrison and encouraged Japanese citizens to move there with promises of important and rewarding work. Among the Japanese living there before the Republic of China took over the city in 1922 were Toshiro's parents, who were working as [[Christianity in Japan|Methodist]] [[missionaries]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = 95 years ago today: Actor Toshiro Mifune born|url = http://akirakurosawa.info/2015/04/01/95-years-ago-today-actor-toshiro-mifune-born/|website = Akira Kurosawa info|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Toshiro Mifune presented in Arts section|url = http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/toshiro_mifune/|website = www.newsfinder.org|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref> Mifune grew up with his parents and two younger siblings in [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning|Fengtian]], and, from 4 to 19 years of age, in [[Manchukuo]].<ref>{{cite book|title=International Stars at War|author1=James E.

After spending the first 19 years of his life in China, as a Japanese citizen, he was drafted into the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] Aviation division, where he served in the Aerial Photography unit during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"jasper sharp\">{{cite book|last1=Sharp|first1=Jasper|title=Historical Dictionary of Japanese Cinema|date=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=9780810857957|pages=162\u201365|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAYsyZRRqzcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=19 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Early work==\nIn 1947, one of Mifune's friends who worked for the Photography Department of [[Toho|Toho Productions]] suggested Mifune try out for the Photography Department. He was accepted for a position as an assistant cameraman.\n\nAt this time, a large number of Toho actors, after a prolonged strike, had left to form their own company, Shin Toho. Toho then organized a \"new faces\" contest to find new talent. Mifune's friends submitted an application and photo, without his knowledge. He was accepted, along with 48 others (out of roughly 4000 applicants), and allowed to take a screen test for [[Kajir\u014d Yamamoto]]. Instructed to mime anger, he drew from his wartime experiences. Yamamoto took a liking to Mifune, recommending him to director [[Senkichi Taniguchi]]. This led to Mifune's first feature role, in ''Shin Baka Jidai''.\n\nMifune first encountered director [[Akira Kurosawa]] when [[Toho Studios]], the largest film production company in Japan, was conducting a massive talent search, during which hundreds of aspiring actors auditioned before a team of judges. Kurosawa was originally going to skip the event, but showed up when [[Hideko Takamine]] told him of one actor who seemed especially promising. Kurosawa later wrote that he entered the audition to see \"a young man reeling around the room in a violent frenzy&nbsp;... it was as frightening as watching a wounded beast trying to break loose. I was transfixed.\" When Mifune, exhausted, finished his scene, he sat down and gave the judges an ominous stare. He lost the competition but Kurosawa was impressed. \"I am a person rarely impressed by actors,\" he later said. \"But in the case of Mifune I was completely overwhelmed.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=136021&mainArticleId=160926|title=Rashomon|author=|date=|website=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage ==\nAmong Mifune's fellow performers, one of the 32 women chosen during the new faces contest was Sachiko Yoshimine. Eight years Mifune's junior, she came from a respected Tokyo family. They fell in love and Mifune soon proposed marriage.\n\nDirector [[Senkichi Taniguchi]], with the help of [[Akira Kurosawa]], convinced the Yoshimine family to allow the marriage. The wedding took place in February 1950 at the [[Aoyama Gakuin University|Aoyama Gakuin]] Methodist Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stuffstuff1757.tumblr.com/post/48280052288/toshiro-mifune-and-sachiko-yoshimine-wedding|title=Oddstuff, Toshiro Mifune and Sachiko Yoshimine\u2019 wedding,...|author=|date=|website=Oddstuff|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref> Yoshimine was a Buddhist but since Mifune was a Christian, they were married in church as per Christian tradition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bampfa/34925494740|title=A great photo spread of Toshiro Mifune\u2019s wedding to Sachiko Yoshimine in 1950.

Mifune's daughter {{ill|Mika Mifune|lt=Mika|ja|\u4e09\u8239\u7f8e\u4f73}} was born to his mistress, actress Mika Kitagawa, in 1982.\n\n==Period of prosperity==\nHis imposing bearing, acting range, facility with foreign languages and lengthy partnership with acclaimed director [[Akira Kurosawa]] made him the most famous Japanese actor of his time, and easily the best known to Western audiences. He often portrayed [[samurai]] or [[r\u014dnin]] who were usually coarse and gruff (Kurosawa once explained that the only weakness he could find with Mifune and his acting ability was his \"rough\" voice), inverting the popular stereotype of the genteel, clean-cut samurai. In such films as ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'', he played characters who were often comically lacking in manners, but replete with practical wisdom and experience, understated nobility, and, in the case of ''Yojimbo'', unmatched fighting prowess. ''[[Sanjuro]]'' in particular contrasts this earthy warrior spirit with the useless, sheltered propriety of the court samurai. Kurosawa highly valued Mifune for his effortless portrayal of unvarnished emotion, once commenting that he could convey in only three feet of film an emotion for which the average Japanese actor would require ten feet.<ref>{{cite book|title=Something like an autobiography|last=Kurosawa|first=Akira|authorlink=Akira Kurosawa|page=161|translator=Audie Bock}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 200\n | image1    = Flor Silvestre and Toshiro Mifune in \u00c1nimas Trujano.jpg\n | width1    =\n | caption1  = \n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Still cinematografico de Animas Trujano.jpg\n | width2    =\n | caption2  = Mifune along with [[Flor Silvestre]] and [[Antonio Aguilar]] in ''[[\u00c1nimas Trujano (film)|Animas Trujano]]'' (1964)\n | alt2      = \n}}\nHe was also known for the effort he put into his performances. To prepare for ''Seven Samurai'' and ''[[Rashomon]]'', Mifune reportedly studied footage of [[lion]]s in the wild; for ''[[\u00c1nimas Trujano (film)|\u00c1nimas Trujano]]'', he studied tapes of Mexican actors speaking, so he could recite all his lines in Spanish.\n\nMifune has been credited as originating the \"roving warrior\" archetype, which he perfected during his collaboration with Kurosawa. His martial arts instructor was [[Yoshio Sugino]] of the [[Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b]]. Sugino created the fight choreography for films such as ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'', and Kurosawa instructed his actors to emulate his movements and bearing.\n\n[[File:Toshiro Mifune wearing bandana.jpg|thumb|left|Mifune in ''[[Hell in the Pacific]]'' (1968)]]\n[[Clint Eastwood]] was among the first of many actors to adopt this wandering [[Samurai cinema#The Ronin with No Name|ronin with no name]] persona for foreign films, which he used to great effect in his [[Western film|Western]] roles, especially in [[Spaghetti Western]]s directed by [[Sergio Leone]] where he played the [[Man with No Name]], a character similar to Mifune's seemingly-nameless ronin in ''Yojimbo''.\n\nMifune may also be credited with originating the [[Yakuza]] archetype, with his performance as a mobster in Kurosawa's ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), the first [[Yakuza film]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Most of the sixteen Kurosawa\u2013Mifune films are considered cinema classics. These include ''Drunken Angel'', ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'', ''Rashomon'', ''Seven Samurai'', ''The Hidden Fortress'', ''[[High and Low (1963 film)|High and Low]]'', ''[[Throne of Blood]]'' (an adaptation of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]''), ''Yojimbo'', and ''Sanjuro''. (See filmography, below)\n\nMifune and Kurosawa finally parted ways after ''[[Red Beard]]''. Several factors contributed to the rift that ended this career-spanning collaboration. Most of Mifune's contemporaries acted in several different movies throughout the year. Since ''Red Beard'' required Mifune to grow a natural beard \u2014 one he had to keep for the entirety of the film's two years of shooting \u2014 he was unable to act in any other films during the production. This put Mifune and his financially strapped production company deeply into debt, creating friction between him and Kurosawa. Although ''Red Beard'' played to packed houses in Japan and Europe, which helped Mifune recoup some of his losses, the ensuing years held varying outcomes for both Mifune and Kurosawa. After the film's release, the careers of each man took different arcs: Mifune continued to enjoy success with a range of samurai and war-themed films (''Rebellion'', ''Samurai Assassin'', ''The Emperor and a General'', among others). In contrast, Kurosawa's output of films dwindled and drew mixed responses. During this time, Kurosawa attempted suicide. In 1980, Mifune experienced popularity with mainstream American audiences through his role as Lord Toranaga in the television miniseries ''[[Sh\u014dgun (1980 miniseries)|Shogun]]''. Yet Kurosawa did not rejoice in his estranged friend's success, and publicly made derisive remarks about ''Shogun''.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Akira Kurosawa Film director shocked by 'Shogun' \u2013 - Lawrence Journal-World Nov. 2, 1980 page 20|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19801102&id=p7pfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YecFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6671,286027&hl=en|accessdate = 2016-07-26}}</ref>\n\nAccording to his daughter, Mifune turned down an offer from [[George Lucas]] to play either [[Darth Vader]] or [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/04/toshiro-mifune-star-wars-turned-down-obi-wan-kenobi-and-darth-vader-roles|newspaper=The Guardian|year=2015|title=Toshiro Mifune turned down Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader roles}}</ref>\n\n== Later life and death ==\nEarly in the 1980s, Mifune founded an [[Drama school|acting school]], Mifune Geijutsu Gakuin ({{lang|ja|\u4e09\u8239\u82b8\u8853\u5b66\u9662}}). The school failed after only three years, due to mismanaged finances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nMifune received wide acclaim in the West after playing [[Tokugawa Ieyasu|Toranaga]] in the 1980 TV miniseries ''[[Sh\u014dgun (1980 miniseries)|Shogun]]''. However, the series' blunt portrayal of the Japanese [[shogunate]] and the greatly [[Abridgement#Abridgement for television|abridged]] version shown in Japan meant that it was not as well received in his homeland.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe relationship between Kurosawa and Mifune remained ambivalent. While Kurosawa made some very uncharitable comments about Mifune's acting, he also admitted in ''Interview'' magazine that \"All the films that I made with Mifune, without him, they would not exist\". He also presented Mifune with the Kawashita award which he himself had won two years prior. They finally made something of a reconciliation in 1993 at the funeral of their friend [[Ishir\u014d Honda]], though they never collaborated again.\n\n[[File:\u4e09\u8239\u654f\u90ce\u306e\u5893\u30fb\u795e\u5948\u5ddd\u770c\u5ddd\u5d0e\u5e02\u30fb\u6625\u79cb\u82d1.JPG|thumb|right|The Mifune family tomb in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa]] ]]\n\nIn 1992, Mifune began suffering from a serious unknown health problem. It has been variously suggested that he destroyed his health with overwork, suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], or experienced a [[stroke]]. For whatever reason, he abruptly retreated from public life and remained largely confined to his home, cared for by his estranged wife Sachiko. When she succumbed to [[pancreatic cancer]] in 1995, Mifune's physical and mental state began to decline rapidly.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1997, he died in [[Mitaka, Tokyo|Mitaka]], [[Tokyo]], of [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failure]] at the age of 77.

The speed of his movements was such that he said in a single action what took ordinary actors three separate movements to express. He put forth everything directly and boldly, and his sense of timing was the keenest I had ever seen in a Japanese actor. And yet with all his quickness, he also had surprisingly fine sensibilities. \u2013 Akira Kurosawa, ''Something Like an Autobiography''.}}\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n=== Films ===\n\nDue to variations in translation from the Japanese and other factors, there are multiple titles to many of Mifune's films (see IMDB link).

Hoping to preserve their control of the region, the Japanese government maintained a large garrison and encouraged Japanese citizens to move there with promises of important and rewarding work. Among the Japanese living there before the Republic of China took over the city in 1922 were Toshiro's parents, who were working as [[Christianity in Japan|Methodist]] [[missionaries]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = 95 years ago today: Actor Toshiro Mifune born|url = http://akirakurosawa.info/2015/04/01/95-years-ago-today-actor-toshiro-mifune-born/|website = Akira Kurosawa info|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Toshiro Mifune presented in Arts section|url = http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/toshiro_mifune/|website = www.newsfinder.org|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref> Mifune grew up with his parents and two younger siblings in [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning|Fengtian]], and, from 4 to 19 years of age, in [[Manchukuo]].<ref>{{cite book|title=International Stars at War|author1=James E. Wise Jr.|author2=Scott Baron|page=132}}</ref>\n\nIn his youth, Mifune worked in the photography shop of his father Tokuzo, a commercial photographer and importer who had emigrated from northern Japan. After spending the first 19 years of his life in China, as a Japanese citizen, he was drafted into the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] Aviation division, where he served in the Aerial Photography unit during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"jasper sharp\">{{cite book|last1=Sharp|first1=Jasper|title=Historical Dictionary of Japanese Cinema|date=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=9780810857957|pages=162\u201365|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAYsyZRRqzcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=19 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Early work==\nIn 1947, one of Mifune's friends who worked for the Photography Department of [[Toho|Toho Productions]] suggested Mifune try out for the Photography Department. He was accepted for a position as an assistant cameraman.\n\nAt this time, a large number of Toho actors, after a prolonged strike, had left to form their own company, Shin Toho. Toho then organized a \"new faces\" contest to find new talent. Mifune's friends submitted an application and photo, without his knowledge. He was accepted, along with 48 others (out of roughly 4000 applicants), and allowed to take a screen test for [[Kajir\u014d Yamamoto]]. Instructed to mime anger, he drew from his wartime experiences. Yamamoto took a liking to Mifune, recommending him to director [[Senkichi Taniguchi]]. This led to Mifune's first feature role, in ''Shin Baka Jidai''.\n\nMifune first encountered director [[Akira Kurosawa]] when [[Toho Studios]], the largest film production company in Japan, was conducting a massive talent search, during which hundreds of aspiring actors auditioned before a team of judges. Kurosawa was originally going to skip the event, but showed up when [[Hideko Takamine]] told him of one actor who seemed especially promising. Kurosawa later wrote that he entered the audition to see \"a young man reeling around the room in a violent frenzy&nbsp;... it was as frightening as watching a wounded beast trying to break loose. I was transfixed.\" When Mifune, exhausted, finished his scene, he sat down and gave the judges an ominous stare. He lost the competition but Kurosawa was impressed. \"I am a person rarely impressed by actors,\" he later said. \"But in the case of Mifune I was completely overwhelmed.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=136021&mainArticleId=160926|title=Rashomon|author=|date=|website=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage ==\nAmong Mifune's fellow performers, one of the 32 women chosen during the new faces contest was Sachiko Yoshimine. Eight years Mifune's junior, she came from a respected Tokyo family. They fell in love and Mifune soon proposed marriage.\n\nDirector [[Senkichi Taniguchi]], with the help of [[Akira Kurosawa]], convinced the Yoshimine family to allow the marriage. The wedding took place in February 1950 at the [[Aoyama Gakuin University|Aoyama Gakuin]] Methodist Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stuffstuff1757.tumblr.com/post/48280052288/toshiro-mifune-and-sachiko-yoshimine-wedding|title=Oddstuff, Toshiro Mifune and Sachiko Yoshimine\u2019 wedding,...|author=|date=|website=Oddstuff|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref> Yoshimine was a Buddhist but since Mifune was a Christian, they were married in church as per Christian tradition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bampfa/34925494740|title=A great photo spread of Toshiro Mifune\u2019s wedding to Sachiko Yoshimine in 1950.

Mifune's daughter {{ill|Mika Mifune|lt=Mika|ja|\u4e09\u8239\u7f8e\u4f73}} was born to his mistress, actress Mika Kitagawa, in 1982.\n\n==Period of prosperity==\nHis imposing bearing, acting range, facility with foreign languages and lengthy partnership with acclaimed director [[Akira Kurosawa]] made him the most famous Japanese actor of his time, and easily the best known to Western audiences. He often portrayed [[samurai]] or [[r\u014dnin]] who were usually coarse and gruff (Kurosawa once explained that the only weakness he could find with Mifune and his acting ability was his \"rough\" voice), inverting the popular stereotype of the genteel, clean-cut samurai. In such films as ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'', he played characters who were often comically lacking in manners, but replete with practical wisdom and experience, understated nobility, and, in the case of ''Yojimbo'', unmatched fighting prowess. ''[[Sanjuro]]'' in particular contrasts this earthy warrior spirit with the useless, sheltered propriety of the court samurai. Kurosawa highly valued Mifune for his effortless portrayal of unvarnished emotion, once commenting that he could convey in only three feet of film an emotion for which the average Japanese actor would require ten feet.<ref>{{cite book|title=Something like an autobiography|last=Kurosawa|first=Akira|authorlink=Akira Kurosawa|page=161|translator=Audie Bock}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 200\n | image1    = Flor Silvestre and Toshiro Mifune in \u00c1nimas Trujano.jpg\n | width1    =\n | caption1  = \n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Still cinematografico de Animas Trujano.jpg\n | width2    =\n | caption2  = Mifune along with [[Flor Silvestre]] and [[Antonio Aguilar]] in ''[[\u00c1nimas Trujano (film)|Animas Trujano]]'' (1964)\n | alt2      = \n}}\nHe was also known for the effort he put into his performances. To prepare for ''Seven Samurai'' and ''[[Rashomon]]'', Mifune reportedly studied footage of [[lion]]s in the wild; for ''[[\u00c1nimas Trujano (film)|\u00c1nimas Trujano]]'', he studied tapes of Mexican actors speaking, so he could recite all his lines in Spanish.\n\nMifune has been credited as originating the \"roving warrior\" archetype, which he perfected during his collaboration with Kurosawa. His martial arts instructor was [[Yoshio Sugino]] of the [[Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b]]. Sugino created the fight choreography for films such as ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'', and Kurosawa instructed his actors to emulate his movements and bearing.\n\n[[File:Toshiro Mifune wearing bandana.jpg|thumb|left|Mifune in ''[[Hell in the Pacific]]'' (1968)]]\n[[Clint Eastwood]] was among the first of many actors to adopt this wandering [[Samurai cinema#The Ronin with No Name|ronin with no name]] persona for foreign films, which he used to great effect in his [[Western film|Western]] roles, especially in [[Spaghetti Western]]s directed by [[Sergio Leone]] where he played the [[Man with No Name]], a character similar to Mifune's seemingly-nameless ronin in ''Yojimbo''.\n\nMifune may also be credited with originating the [[Yakuza]] archetype, with his performance as a mobster in Kurosawa's ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), the first [[Yakuza film]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Most of the sixteen Kurosawa\u2013Mifune films are considered cinema classics. These include ''Drunken Angel'', ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'', ''Rashomon'', ''Seven Samurai'', ''The Hidden Fortress'', ''[[High and Low (1963 film)|High and Low]]'', ''[[Throne of Blood]]'' (an adaptation of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]''), ''Yojimbo'', and ''Sanjuro''. (See filmography, below)\n\nMifune and Kurosawa finally parted ways after ''[[Red Beard]]''. Several factors contributed to the rift that ended this career-spanning collaboration. Most of Mifune's contemporaries acted in several different movies throughout the year. Since ''Red Beard'' required Mifune to grow a natural beard \u2014 one he had to keep for the entirety of the film's two years of shooting \u2014 he was unable to act in any other films during the production. This put Mifune and his financially strapped production company deeply into debt, creating friction between him and Kurosawa. Although ''Red Beard'' played to packed houses in Japan and Europe, which helped Mifune recoup some of his losses, the ensuing years held varying outcomes for both Mifune and Kurosawa. After the film's release, the careers of each man took different arcs: Mifune continued to enjoy success with a range of samurai and war-themed films (''Rebellion'', ''Samurai Assassin'', ''The Emperor and a General'', among others). In contrast, Kurosawa's output of films dwindled and drew mixed responses. During this time, Kurosawa attempted suicide. In 1980, Mifune experienced popularity with mainstream American audiences through his role as Lord Toranaga in the television miniseries ''[[Sh\u014dgun (1980 miniseries)|Shogun]]''. Yet Kurosawa did not rejoice in his estranged friend's success, and publicly made derisive remarks about ''Shogun''.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Akira Kurosawa Film director shocked by 'Shogun' \u2013 - Lawrence Journal-World Nov. 2, 1980 page 20|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19801102&id=p7pfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YecFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6671,286027&hl=en|accessdate = 2016-07-26}}</ref>\n\nAccording to his daughter, Mifune turned down an offer from [[George Lucas]] to play either [[Darth Vader]] or [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/04/toshiro-mifune-star-wars-turned-down-obi-wan-kenobi-and-darth-vader-roles|newspaper=The Guardian|year=2015|title=Toshiro Mifune turned down Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader roles}}</ref>\n\n== Later life and death ==\nEarly in the 1980s, Mifune founded an [[Drama school|acting school]], Mifune Geijutsu Gakuin ({{lang|ja|\u4e09\u8239\u82b8\u8853\u5b66\u9662}}). The school failed after only three years, due to mismanaged finances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nMifune received wide acclaim in the West after playing [[Tokugawa Ieyasu|Toranaga]] in the 1980 TV miniseries ''[[Sh\u014dgun (1980 miniseries)|Shogun]]''. However, the series' blunt portrayal of the Japanese [[shogunate]] and the greatly [[Abridgement#Abridgement for television|abridged]] version shown in Japan meant that it was not as well received in his homeland.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe relationship between Kurosawa and Mifune remained ambivalent. While Kurosawa made some very uncharitable comments about Mifune's acting, he also admitted in ''Interview'' magazine that \"All the films that I made with Mifune, without him, they would not exist\". He also presented Mifune with the Kawashita award which he himself had won two years prior. They finally made something of a reconciliation in 1993 at the funeral of their friend [[Ishir\u014d Honda]], though they never collaborated again.\n\n[[File:\u4e09\u8239\u654f\u90ce\u306e\u5893\u30fb\u795e\u5948\u5ddd\u770c\u5ddd\u5d0e\u5e02\u30fb\u6625\u79cb\u82d1.JPG|thumb|right|The Mifune family tomb in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa]] ]]\n\nIn 1992, Mifune began suffering from a serious unknown health problem. It has been variously suggested that he destroyed his health with overwork, suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], or experienced a [[stroke]]. For whatever reason, he abruptly retreated from public life and remained largely confined to his home, cared for by his estranged wife Sachiko. When she succumbed to [[pancreatic cancer]] in 1995, Mifune's physical and mental state began to decline rapidly.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1997, he died in [[Mitaka, Tokyo|Mitaka]], [[Tokyo]], of [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failure]] at the age of 77.

It was, above all, the speed with which he expressed himself that was astounding. The ordinary Japanese actor might need ten feet of film to get across an impression; Mifune needed only three. The speed of his movements was such that he said in a single action what took ordinary actors three separate movements to express. He put forth everything directly and boldly, and his sense of timing was the keenest I had ever seen in a Japanese actor. And yet with all his quickness, he also had surprisingly fine sensibilities. \u2013 Akira Kurosawa, ''Something Like an Autobiography''.}}\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n=== Films ===\n\nDue to variations in translation from the Japanese and other factors, there are multiple titles to many of Mifune's films (see IMDB link).

The field for the Derby is limited to 20 horses, with up to four 'also eligibles' in case of a late withdrawal from the field. There are three separate paths for horses to take to qualify for the Derby: the main Road consisting of races in North America (plus one in Dubai), the Japan Road consisting of four races in Japan, and the European Road with seven European races in England, Ireland and France. The top four finishers in the specified races receive points, with higher points awarded in the major prep races in March and April. Earnings in non-restricted stakes races act as a tie breaker.\n\nWhen originally announced in September 2019, the main [[Road to the Kentucky Derby]] would have remained substantially the same as the [[2019 Road to the Kentucky Derby]], consisting of 35 races, 19 races for the '''Kentucky Derby Prep Season''' and 16 races for the '''Kentucky Derby Championship Season'''.<ref name=\"2019Announcement\">{{cite web |title=Road to Kentucky Derby and Oaks Schedule Announced |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/235362/road-to-kentucky-derby-and-oaks-schedule-announced |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref> [[Fair Grounds Race Course]] subsequently made minor changes to the length of the three qualifying races that it hosts: the Lecomte Stakes goes from a mile and 70 yards to {{frac|1|1|16}} miles, the Risen Star from {{frac|1|1|16}} to {{frac|1|1|8}} miles, and the Louisiana Derby goes from {{frac|1|1|8}} to {{frac|1|3|16}} miles.<ref name=\"LongerPreps\">{{cite web |title=Risen Star, Louisiana Derby, Lecomte Will All Be Longer In 2020 |url=https://www.paulickreport.com/news/thoroughbred-racing/risen-star-louisiana-derby-lecomte-will-all-be-longer-in-2020/ |website=Paulick Report |accessdate=25 September 2019 |language=en |date=25 September 2019}}</ref> However in March 2020, the growing coronavirus pandemic prompted the cancellation of several prep races, and the rescheduling of the Derby itself.

The field for the Derby is limited to 20 horses, with up to four 'also eligibles' in case of a late withdrawal from the field. There are three separate paths for horses to take to qualify for the Derby: the main Road consisting of races in North America (plus one in Dubai), the Japan Road consisting of four races in Japan, and the European Road with seven European races in England, Ireland and France. The top four finishers in the specified races receive points, with higher points awarded in the major prep races in March and April. Earnings in non-restricted stakes races act as a tie breaker.\n\nWhen originally announced in September 2019, the main [[Road to the Kentucky Derby]] would have remained substantially the same as the [[2019 Road to the Kentucky Derby]], consisting of 35 races, 19 races for the '''Kentucky Derby Prep Season''' and 16 races for the '''Kentucky Derby Championship Season'''.<ref name=\"2019Announcement\">{{cite web |title=Road to Kentucky Derby and Oaks Schedule Announced |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/235362/road-to-kentucky-derby-and-oaks-schedule-announced |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref> [[Fair Grounds Race Course]] subsequently made minor changes to the length of the three qualifying races that it hosts: the Lecomte Stakes goes from a mile and 70 yards to {{frac|1|1|16}} miles, the Risen Star from {{frac|1|1|16}} to {{frac|1|1|8}} miles, and the Louisiana Derby goes from {{frac|1|1|8}} to {{frac|1|3|16}} miles.<ref name=\"LongerPreps\">{{cite web |title=Risen Star, Louisiana Derby, Lecomte Will All Be Longer In 2020 |url=https://www.paulickreport.com/news/thoroughbred-racing/risen-star-louisiana-derby-lecomte-will-all-be-longer-in-2020/ |website=Paulick Report |accessdate=25 September 2019 |language=en |date=25 September 2019}}</ref> However in March 2020, the growing coronavirus pandemic prompted the cancellation of several prep races, and the rescheduling of the Derby itself.

The constituent [[zooid]]s form a rigid tube, which may be pale pink, yellowish, or bluish. One end of the tube is narrower and is closed, while the other is open and has a strong diaphragm. The outer surface or test is gelatinised and dimpled with backward-pointing, blunt processes. The individual zooids are up to {{cvt|8.5|mm|in}} long and have a broad, rounded branchial sac with [[gill]] slits. Along the side of the branchial sac runs the [[endostyle]], which produces [[mucus]] filters. Water is moved through the gill slits into the centre of the cylinder by [[Cilium|cilia]] pulsating rhythmically. [[Plankton]] and other food particles are caught in mucus filters in the processes as the colony is propelled through the water. ''P. atlanticum'' is bioluminescent and can generate a brilliant blue-green light when stimulated.<ref name=JelliesZone/><ref>[http://species-identification.org/species.php?species_group=zmns&id=588 ''Pyrosoma atlanticum''] Marine Species Identification Portal.

Retrieved 2011-11-17.</ref> The doliolid body is small, typically 1\u20132&nbsp;cm long, and barrel-shaped; it features two wide [[siphon]]s, one at the front and the other at the back end, and eight or nine circular [[muscle]] strands reminiscent of barrel bands. Like all [[tunicate]]s, they are [[filter feeder]]s. They are free-floating; the same forced flow of water through their bodies with which they gather [[plankton]] is used for propulsion - not unlike a tiny [[ramjet]] engine. Doliolids are capable of quick movement. They have a complicated [[biological life cycle|lifecycle]] consisting of sexual and asexual generations. They are nearly exclusively tropical animals, although a few species can be found as far to the north as northern [[California]].\n;Salps ([[Salpida]])\n:The largest salps: ''[[Cyclosalpa bakeri]]''15cm (6ins) long. There are openings at the anterior and posterior ends of the cylinder which can be opened or closed as needed. The bodies have seven transverse bands of muscle interspersed by white, translucent patches. A stolon grows from near the endostyle (an elongated glandular structure producing mucus for trapping food particles). The stolon is a ribbon-like organ on which a batch of aggregate forms of the animal are produced by [[budding]]. The aggregate is the second, colonial form of the salp and is also gelatinous, transparent and flabby. It takes the shape of a radial whorl of individuals up to about 20cm (4in) in diameter. It is formed of approximately 12 [[zooid]]s linked side by side in a shape that resembles a crown.<ref name=JelliesZone>[http://jellieszone.com/pelagic-tunicates/cyclosalpa-bakeri/ ''Cyclosalpa bakeri'' - Ritter, 1905] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321094842/http://jellieszone.com/pelagic-tunicates/cyclosalpa-bakeri/ |date=2016-03-21 }} JelliesZone, by David Wrobel.

Durham arrived in [[Quebec City]] on 29 May.<ref name=canencycdurham>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/john-george-lambton-1st-earl-of-durham Canadian Encyclopedia article on Durham]</ref> He had just been appointed [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] and given special powers as high commissioner of [[British North America]].\n\nOn the first page of his report he stated that \"While the present state of things is allowed to last, the actual inhabitants of these Provinces have no security for person or property\u2014no enjoyment of what they possess\u2014no stimulus to industry.\"<ref name=ecodurham/> He would return to that theme repeatedly throughout his report.\n\n==Inquiry==\nIn [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]], he formed numerous committees consisting of essentially all the opponents of the [[Patriotes]] and made many personal observations of life in the colonies. He also visited the United States. Durham wrote that he had assumed he would find that the rebellions were based on liberalism and economics, but he eventually concluded that the real problem was the  conflict between the traditionalistic French and the modernizing English elements. According to Durham, the French culture in Canada had changed little in 200 years, and showed no sign of the progress British culture had made. His 1838 report contains the famous assessment that Lower Canada consisted of \"two nations warring within the bosom of a single state\".\n\n== The Report ==\nDurham had previously been the Governor General in Lower Canada in 1837, but soon afterward submitted his resignation due to conflict with British Parliament. These conflicts were vastly due to Lord Durham's progressive nature, believing British Parliament should give the colonies more power in their government, namely, a responsible government. Lord Durham was sent back to Canada in 1838 by British Parliament and the Crown to investigate the cause behind the rebellions of both Upper and Lower Canada, and propose suggestions to fix any remaining problems and lessen the chance of future rebellions. \n\nLord Durham found that although the rebellions of Upper and Lower Canada were over, peace and unity were yet to be found in Canada. The people living in both colonies in Canada were struggling as the economic situation in both areas all but collapsed. Poor farming conditions that year led to reduced harvests and increased poverty for farmers. As well as increased political tension and bitterness between parties and races of people, in particular in lower Canada. Upper and Lower Canada were in a state of distress. \n\nLord Durham's report entitled, \"Report on the Affairs of British North America.\" The report at the time was considered controversial as it suggested radical ideas for the time, such as British Parliament granting Upper and Lower Canada a responsible government. \n\nThe two most well known suggestions from Lord Durham's report were the fusion of Upper and Lower Canada, to become a single, unified colony, entitled The Province of Canada, ruled under a single legislature. The second, was to introduce a responsible government into place. A government Durham already believed to be inevitable due to the progressive nature of the colonies neighbour, The United States of America. He believed as these ideas were already available to the people and understood, nothing less would be accepted or tolerated, and so must be embraced as to satisfy the people and maintain the peace. We see this in a quote from his report, \"... establishing representative government in the North American Colonies. That has been irrevocably done and the experiment of depriving the people of their present constitutional power, is not to be thought of.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Lord Durham's Report|last=|first=|publisher=The Canadian Publishers|year=1963|isbn=|editor-last=Craig|editor-first=Gerald M.|location=Toronto|pages=139}}</ref>\n\nDurham also recommended the creation of a municipal government and a supreme court in British North America. He was interested in not only unifying Upper and Lower Canada, but including Nova Scotia and New Brunswick as well. He also wanted to resolve the issue of land over Prince Edward Island. However, these suggestions never came to fruition as the maritime provinces were uninterested in the proposition at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/durham-report|title=Durham Report {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> These suggestions would not be put into place until decades later, due to the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation of Canada.]] \n\n== Important Passages ==\n\"The French complained of the arrogance and injustice of the English; the English accused the French of the vices of a weak and conquered people, and charged them with meanness and perfidy. The entire mistrust which the two races have thus learned to conceive of each other's intentions, induces them to put the worst construction on the most innocent conduct; to judge every word, every act, and every intention unfairly; to attribute the most odious designs, and reject every overture of kindness or fairness, as covering secret designs of treachery and malignity.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lord Durham's Report|last=|first=|publisher=The Canadian Publishers|year=1963|isbn=|editor-last=Craig|editor-first=Gerald M.|location=Toronto|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n\"At first sight is appears must more difficult to form an accurate idea of the state of Upper than of Lower Canada. The visible and broad line of demarcation which separates the parties by distinctive character of race, happily has no existence in the Upper Province. The quarrel is one of an entirely English, if not British population. Like all such quarrels, it has, in fact created, not two but several parties; each of which has some objects in common with some one of those to which it is opposed. They differ on one point and agree on another; the sections, which unite together one day, are strongly opposed the next; and the very party, which acts as one, against a common opponent, is in truth composed of divisions seeking utterly different or incompatible objects. It is very difficult to make out from the avowals o the parties the real objects of their struggles , and still less easy is it to discover any cause of such importance as would account for its uniting any large mass of the people in an attempt to other throw, by forcible means, the existing form of Government.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lord Durham's Report|last=|first=|publisher=The Canadian Publishers|year=1963|isbn=|editor-last=Craig|editor-first=Gerald M.|location=Toronto|pages=77-78}}</ref>\n\n\"We are not now to consider the policy of establishing representative government in the North American Colonies. That has been irrevocably done; and the experiment of depriving the people of their present constitutional power, is not to be thought of. To conduct their Government harmoniously, in accordance with its established principles, is now the business of its rulers; and I know not how it is possible to secure that harmony in any other way, than by administering the Government on those principles which have been found perfectly efficacious in the Great Britain. I would not impair a single prerogative of the Crown; on the contrary, I believe that the interests of the people of these Colonies require the protection of the prerogatives, which have not hitherto been exercised But the Crown must, on the other hand, submit to the necessary consequences of representative institutions and if it has to carry on the Government in unison with a representative body, it must consent to carry it on by means of those in whom that representative body has confidence.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n\"A plan by which it is proposed to ensure the tranquil government of Lower Canada, must include in itself the means of putting an end to the agitation of national disputes in the legislature, by settling, at once and forever, the national character of the Province. I entertain no doubts as to the national character of the Province. I entertain no doubts as to the national character which must be given to Lower Canada; it must be that of the British Empire; that of the majority of the population of British America; that of the great race which must, in the lapse of no long period of time, be predominant over the whole North American Continent. Without effecting the change so rapidly or so roughly as to shock the feelings and trample on the welface of the existing generation, it must henceforth be the first and steady purpose of the British Government to establish an English population, with English laws and language, in this Province, and to trust its government to none but a decidedly English legislature.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lord Durham's Report|last=|first=|publisher=The Canadian Publishers|year=1963|isbn=|editor-last=Craig|editor-first=Gerald M.|location=Toronto|pages=146}}</ref>\n\n==Recommendations==\nDurham made two main recommendations:\n* That [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]] be united into one province, and\n* The introduction of responsible government for all colonies in British North America \n\nThe British Parliament implemented the first point immediately but not the second.

In June, it appeared in Canada in [[Ludger Duvernay]]'s ''La Revue canadienne'' as ''Histoire de l'insurrection du Canada en r\u00e9futation du Rapport de Lord Durham'' (History of the insurrection of Canada in refutation of the Report of Lord Durham). Lord Durham believed to eliminate the possibility of rebellions, they must overwhelm the French Canadians with British culture.\n\nThe assertion that the so-called \"French\" Canadians had no history and no culture and that the conflict was primarily that of two ethnic groups evidently outraged Papineau. It was pointed out that many of the Patriote leaders were of British or British Canadian origin, including among others [[Wolfred Nelson]], hero of the [[Battle of Saint-Denis (1837)|Battle of Saint-Denis]]; [[Robert Nelson (insurrectionist)|Robert Nelson]], author of the [[Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada]], who would have become President of Lower Canada had the second insurrection succeeded; journalist [[Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan]]; and [[Thomas Storrow Brown]], general during the [[Battle of St-Charles]]. It was also pointed out that an uprising had occurred in Upper Canada where there was only one \"race\". According to Papineau and other Patriotes, the analysis of the economic situation of French Canadians was biased. Indeed, from 1791 to the rebellions, the elected representatives of Lower Canada had been demanding the control over the budget of the colony.\n\n== Impact outside Canada ==\nThe general conclusions of the report regarding self-governance eventually spread to various other white settler colonies, including Australia and [[New Zealand]] in the 1850s (with Western Australia receiving self-government in 1890) . The parallel nature of government organization in Australia and Canada to this day is an ongoing proof of the long-enduring effects of the report's recommendations.\n\nThe report did not see any of its recommendations come into force in the African and Asian colonies, but some limited democratic reforms in [[British India|India]] became possible that otherwise would not have been.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Conclusion==\nDurham resigned on 9 October 1838 amid controversy excited in London by his decision of the penal questions<ref name=dcbdurham>[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=3484 Lambton, John George, 1st Earl of Durham, in the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'', University of Toronto, Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2000]</ref> and was soon replaced by [[Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham]], who was responsible for implementing the [[Province of Canada|Union of the Canadas]].

Durham arrived in [[Quebec City]] on 29 May.<ref name=canencycdurham>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/john-george-lambton-1st-earl-of-durham Canadian Encyclopedia article on Durham]</ref> He had just been appointed [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] and given special powers as high commissioner of [[British North America]].\n\nOn the first page of his report he stated that \"While the present state of things is allowed to last, the actual inhabitants of these Provinces have no security for person or property--no enjoyment of what they possess--no stimulus to industry.\"<ref name=ecodurham/> He would return to that theme repeatedly throughout his report.\n\n==Inquiry==\nIn [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]], he formed numerous committees consisting of essentially all the opponents of the [[Patriotes]] and made many personal observations of life in the colonies. He also visited the United States. Durham wrote that he had assumed he would find that the rebellions were based on liberalism and economics, but he eventually concluded that the real problem was the  conflict between the traditionalistic French and the modernizing English elements. According to Durham, the French culture in Canada had changed little in 200 years, and showed no sign of the progress British culture had made. His 1838 report contains the famous assessment that Lower Canada consisted of \"two nations warring within the bosom of a single state\".\n\n== The Report ==\nDurham had previously been the Governor General in Lower Canada in 1837, but soon afterward submitted his resignation due to conflict with British Parliament. These conflicts were vastly due to Lord Durham's progressive nature, believing British Parliament should give the colonies more power in their government, namely, a responsible government. Lord Durham was sent back to Canada in 1838 by British Parliament and the Crown to investigate the cause behind the rebellions of both Upper and Lower Canada, and propose suggestions to fix any remaining problems and lessen the chance of future rebellions. \n\nLord Durham found that although the rebellions of Upper and Lower Canada were over, peace and unity were yet to be found in Canada. The people living in both colonies in Canada were struggling as the economic situation in both areas all but collapsed. Poor farming conditions that year led to reduced harvests and increased poverty for farmers. As well as increased political tension and bitterness between parties and races of people, in particular in lower Canada. Upper and Lower Canada were in a state of distress. \n\nLord Durham's report entitled, \"Report on the Affairs of British North America.\" The report at the time was considered controversial as it suggested radical ideas for the time, such as British Parliament granting Upper and Lower Canada a responsible government. \n\nThe two most well known suggestions from Lord Durham's report were the fusion of Upper and Lower Canada, to become a single, unified colony, entitled The Province of Canada, ruled under a single legislature. The second, was to introduce a responsible government into place. A government Durham already believed to be inevitable due to the progressive nature of the colonies neighbour, The United States of America. He believed as these ideas were already available to the people and understood, nothing less would be accepted or tolerated, and so must be embraced as to satisfy the people and maintain the peace. We see this in a quote from his report, \"... establishing representative government in the North American Colonies. That has been irrevocably done and the experiment of depriving the people of their present constitutional power, is not to be thought of.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Lord Durham's Report|last=|first=|publisher=The Canadian Publishers|year=1963|isbn=|editor-last=Craig|editor-first=Gerald M.|location=Toronto|pages=139}}</ref>\n\nDurham also recommended the creation of a municipal government and a supreme court in British North America. He was interested in not only unifying Upper and Lower Canada, but including Nova Scotia and New Brunswick as well. He also wanted to resolve the issue of land over Prince Edward Island. However, these suggestions never came to fruition as the maritime provinces were uninterested in the proposition at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/durham-report|title=Durham Report {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> These suggestions would not be put into place until decades later, due to the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation of Canada.]] \n\n== Important Passages ==\n\"The French complained of the arrogance and injustice of the English; the English accused the French of the vices of a weak and conquered people, and charged them with meanness and perfidy. The entire mistrust which the two races have thus learned to conceive of each other's intentions, induces them to put the worst construction on the most innocent conduct; to judge every word, every act, and every intention unfairly; to attribute the most odious designs, and reject every overture of kindness or fairness, as covering secret designs of treachery and malignity.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lord Durham's Report|last=|first=|publisher=The Canadian Publishers|year=1963|isbn=|editor-last=Craig|editor-first=Gerald M.|location=Toronto|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n\"At first sight is appears must more difficult to form an accurate idea of the state of Upper than of Lower Canada. The visible and broad line of demarcation which separates the parties by distinctive character of race, happily has no existence in the Upper Province. The quarrel is one of an entirely English, if not British population. Like all such quarrels, it has, in fact created, not two but several parties; each of which has some objects in common with some one of those to which it is opposed. They differ on one point and agree on another; the sections, which unite together one day, are strongly opposed the next; and the very party, which acts as one, against a common opponent, is in truth composed of divisions seeking utterly different or incompatible objects. It is very difficult to make out from the avowals o the parties the real objects of their struggles , and still less easy is it to discover any cause of such importance as would account for its uniting any large mass of the people in an attempt to other throw, by forcible means, the existing form of Government.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lord Durham's Report|last=|first=|publisher=The Canadian Publishers|year=1963|isbn=|editor-last=Craig|editor-first=Gerald M.|location=Toronto|pages=77-78}}</ref>\n\n\"We are not now to consider the policy of establishing representative government in the North American Colonies. That has been irrevocably done; and the experiment of depriving the people of their present constitutional power, is not to be thought of. To conduct their Government harmoniously, in accordance with its established principles, is now the business of its rulers; and I know not how it is possible to secure that harmony in any other way, than by administering the Government on those principles which have been found perfectly efficacious in the Great Britain. I would not impair a single prerogative of the Crown; on the contrary, I believe that the interests of the people of these Colonies require the protection of the prerogatives, which have not hitherto been exercised But the Crown must, on the other hand, submit to the necessary consequences of representative institutions and if it has to carry on the Government in unison with a representative body, it must consent to carry it on by means of those in whom that representative body has confidence.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n\"A plan by which it is proposed to ensure the tranquil government of Lower Canada, must include in itself the means of putting an end to the agitation of national disputes in the legislature, by settling, at once and forever, the national character of the Province. I entertain no doubts as to the national character of the Province. I entertain no doubts as to the national character which must be given to Lower Canada; it must be that of the British Empire; that of the majority of the population of British America; that of the great race which must, in the lapse of no long period of time, be predominant over the whole North American Continent. Without effecting the change so rapidly or so roughly as to shock the feelings and trample on the welface of the existing generation, it must henceforth be the first and steady purpose of the British Government to establish an English population, with English laws and language, in this Province, and to trust its government to none but a decidedly English legislature.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lord Durham's Report|last=|first=|publisher=The Canadian Publishers|year=1963|isbn=|editor-last=Craig|editor-first=Gerald M.|location=Toronto|pages=146}}</ref>\n\n==Recommendations==\nDurham made two main recommendations:\n* That [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]] be united into one province, and\n* The introduction of responsible government for all colonies in British North America \n\nThe British Parliament implemented the first point immediately but not the second.

In 1840, the population of Canada East was estimated at 670,000, while the population of Canada West was estimated to be 480,000.<ref>[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/province-of-canada-1841-67 \"Province of Canada (1841-67)\", ''Canadian Encyclopedia''.]</ref>  Lord Durham had not recommended this approach, and had instead proposed that the representation should be based on the respective populations of the two regions.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lorddurhamsrepor02durhiala/page/324 ''Lord Durham's Report'', pp. 323-324.]</ref> The British government rejected that recommendation and instead implemented equal representation, apparently to give the English-speaking population of the new province a dominant voice in the provincial government, furthering the goal of assimilating the French-speaking population.\n\n==Reactions==\n{{wikisource|History of the Insurrection in Canada in refutation of the report of Lord Durham}}In exile in France, [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] published the ''Histoire de la r\u00e9sistance du Canada au gouvernement anglais'' (History of the resistance of Canada to the English government) in the French ''La Revue du Progr\u00e8s'' in May 1839. In June, it appeared in Canada in [[Ludger Duvernay]]'s ''La Revue canadienne'' as ''Histoire de l'insurrection du Canada en r\u00e9futation du Rapport de Lord Durham'' (History of the insurrection of Canada in refutation of the Report of Lord Durham). Lord Durham believed to eliminate the possibility of rebellions, they must overwhelm the French Canadians with British culture.\n\nThe assertion that the so-called \"French\" Canadians had no history and no culture and that the conflict was primarily that of two ethnic groups evidently outraged Papineau. It was pointed out that many of the Patriote leaders were of British or British Canadian origin, including among others [[Wolfred Nelson]], hero of the [[Battle of Saint-Denis (1837)|Battle of Saint-Denis]]; [[Robert Nelson (insurrectionist)|Robert Nelson]], author of the [[Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada]], who would have become President of Lower Canada had the second insurrection succeeded; journalist [[Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan]]; and [[Thomas Storrow Brown]], general during the [[Battle of St-Charles]]. It was also pointed out that an uprising had occurred in Upper Canada where there was only one \"race\". According to Papineau and other Patriotes, the analysis of the economic situation of French Canadians was biased. Indeed, from 1791 to the rebellions, the elected representatives of Lower Canada had been demanding the control over the budget of the colony.\n\n== Impact outside Canada ==\nThe general conclusions of the report regarding self-governance eventually spread to various other white settler colonies, including Australia and [[New Zealand]] in the 1850s (with Western Australia receiving self-government in 1890) . The parallel nature of government organization in Australia and Canada to this day is an ongoing proof of the long-enduring effects of the report's recommendations.\n\nThe report did not see any of its recommendations come into force in the African and Asian colonies, but some limited democratic reforms in [[British India|India]] became possible that otherwise would not have been.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Conclusion==\nDurham resigned on 9 October 1838 amid controversy excited in London by his decision of the penal questions<ref name=dcbdurham>[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=3484 Lambton, John George, 1st Earl of Durham, in the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'', University of Toronto, Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2000]</ref> and was soon replaced by [[Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham]], who was responsible for implementing the [[Province of Canada|Union of the Canadas]].

National crime statistics are in reality statistics of only selected crime types. Data are collected through various surveying methods that have previously ranged between 15% and 100% coverage of the data.  A 2001 Statistics Canada study concluded that comparisons with the U.S. on homicide rates were the most reliable.  Comparison of rates for six lesser incident crimes was considered possible but subject to more difficulty of interpretation.  For example, types of assaults receive different classifications and laws in Canada and the U.S., making comparisons more difficult than homicides.  At the time, the U.S. crime of aggravated assault could be compared to the sum of three Canadian crimes (aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, and attempted murder). This comparison had a predicted bias that would inflate the Canadian numbers by only 0.1%.  The study also concluded that directly comparing the two countries' reported total crime rate (i.e. total selected crimes) was \"inappropriate\" since the totals include the problem data sets as well as the usable sets.<ref name=statcan2001comp>[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0035x/85f0035x2001000-eng.pdf Feasibility Study on Crime Comparisons Between Canada and the United States] Maire Gannon, Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, Statistics Canada, Cat. no. 85F0035XIE.

For example, in 2000 the United States' rate for robberies was 65 percent higher, its rate for aggravated assault was more than double, and its murder rate was triple that of Canada. However, the rate of some property crime types is lower in the U.S. than in Canada. For example, in 2006, the rates of vehicle theft were 22% higher in Canada than in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|author=Christopher Effgen |url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |title=United States Crime Rates 1960 - 2008 |publisher=Disastercenter.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in recent years,{{When|date=July 2012}} the gap in violent crime rates between the United States and Canada has narrowed due to a precipitous drop in the violent crime rate in the U.S.  For example, while the aggravated assault rate declined for most of the 1990s in the U.S. and was 324 per 100,000 in 2000, the aggravated assault rate in Canada remained relatively steady throughout and was 143 per 100,000 in 2000.

The burglary/break-in rate in the U.S. (670.2) is 33.1% higher than in Canada (503.7), the theft rate in the U.S. (1959.3) is 33.4% higher than in Canada (1468.4), and the auto-theft rate in the U.S. (229.7) is slightly higher than the rate in Canada (223.5).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Crime Stoppers]]\n* [[Block Parent Program]]\n* [[Gangs in Canada]]\n* [[List of Canadian political scandals|Political scandals in Canada]]\n* [[Computer crime in Canada]]\n* [[Terrorism in Canada]]\n* [[Department of Justice (Canada)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Auger, Michel; Edwards, Peter (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wUwBZmE8QJcC&lpg=PA229&dq=Crime%20in%20Canada&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true The encyclopedia of Canadian organized crime: from Captain Kidd to Mom Boucher]'', Marks & Spencer {{ISBN|0-7710-3044-4}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Andr\u00e9 C\u00e9dilot|author2=Andr\u00e9 No\u00ebl|title=Mafia Inc.: The Long, Bloody Reign of Canada's Sicilian Clan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nBI_7N_7eVcC&pg=PP1|year=2011|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-307-36042-7}}\n* {{citation |last = Beare |first =Margaret E |year =2007 |title =Money laundering in Canada: chasing dirty and dangerous dollars |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=rvW_YqtQAAYC&lpg=PA150&dq=Crime%20in%20Canada&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0-8020-9143-7 |accessdate = }}\n* {{citation |last = Doob  |first = Anthony N|year =2004 |title =Responding to youth crime in Canada |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T1osO9jQJa8C&lpg=PP1&dq=Crime%20in%20Canada&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true|publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0-8020-8856-2 |accessdate = }}\n*{{cite book|author=Kyle Grayson|title=Chasing dragons: security, identity, and illicit drugs in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUQHs7XNZ2AC&pg=PP1|date=12 April 2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-9479-7}}\n* {{citation |last = Schneider |first = Stephen|year =2009 |title =Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada\n  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZO8jKSn25DAC&lpg=PP1&dq=Crime%20in%20Canada&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true|publisher=\tMississauga, Ont. : Wiley |isbn= 978-0-470-83500-5|accessdate = }}\n{{refend}}\n* [https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-002-x/2019001/article/00016-eng.htm Homicide in Canada, 2018]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/ Correctional Service Canada] (commonly called Corrections Canada) administers federal prisons and parole boards.\n* [http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/011218/dq011218b-eng.htm Crime comparisons between Canada and the United States]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100608000423/http://www.havocscope.com/regions-main/americas/canada/ Black markets in Canada ]\n\n{{Americas topic|Crime in}}\n{{Canada topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crime In Canada}}\n[[Category:Crime in Canada| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Uniform Crime Reporting Survey\n|province_name = Canada\n|year = 2017\n|homicide = 1.76 (2018 Stat)\n|attempted_murder = 2.25\n|sexual_assault = 67.22 <!-- Sum of codes 1310, 1320, 1330 -->\n|assault = 595.05 <!-- Sum of codes 1410, 1420, 1430 -->\n|aggravated_assault = 150.91 <!-- Sum of codes 1420, 1430 -->\n|robbery = 61.95\n|criminal_harassment = 52.95\n|uttering_threats = 169.10\n|violent_crime = 1098.40 <!-- 0100 -->\n|breaking_and_entering = 438.51\n|motor_vehicle_theft = 231.61\n|theft_over_5000 = 47.01\n|theft_under_5000 = 570.17 <!-- 2140 -->\n|mischief = 713.84\n|property_crime = 3244.76\n|source_url = https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3510017701\n|source_name =  Incident-based crime statistics, by detailed violations\n|notes = {{space}}Census population: 35,151,728<ref>{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada |title=Population size and growth in Canada: Key results from the 2016 Census |date=February 8, 2017 |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/170208/dq170208a-eng.htm |accessdate=February 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210133245/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/170208/dq170208a-eng.htm |archivedate=February 10, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n}}\nUnder the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], the power to establish [[criminal law]] and rules of investigation is vested in the federal Parliament.

One-third of the 2007 murders were stabbings and another third were by firearm. In 2007, there were 190 stabbings and 188 shootings. Handguns were used in two-thirds of all firearm murders. Seventy-four youths were accused of murder, down 11 from the previous year. About eighty-four percent of murders were done by someone known to the victim. Male victims of homicide were most likely to be killed by an acquaintance, someone known to them through a criminal relationship, or a stranger. Female victims of homicide were most frequently killed by a current or former intimate partner, or another [[family]] member.

The United States has one officer per 411.5 persons, and Germany 344.8.\n\nCanada's national police force is the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) which is the main police force in Canada's north, and in rural areas except in [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Those three provinces have their own provincial police forces, although the RCMP still operate throughout rural Newfoundland and also provide specific federal policing services in Ontario and Quebec. Many cities and districts have their own municipal police forces, while others have contracts with the provincial police or RCMP to police their communities.\n\n=== Report rates of crimes ===\nA publication posted on [[Statistics Canada]] reported that in 2009, only a small portion of crimes that happen are reported to the police (31% of all crimes), and this figure has been lowering from 1999 (37%) and 2004 (34%).<ref name=\"MULTI2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2010002/article/11340/tbl/tbl10-eng.htm|title=Table 10 Self-reported victimizations reported to police, 1999, 2004 and 2009|website=Statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> Only 54% of break and enters, 43% of robberies, and 34% of assaults are reported to the police.<ref name=MULTI>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2010002/article/11340-eng.htm#a18|title=Criminal victimization in Canada, 2009|website=Statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref> The most common reason for not reporting a crime was the victim thought it was not important enough (68%).

Globally, the United States was the country with the highest percentage of inmate population (about 0.7% of the total population). The European average is 0.2% of the total population, with [[France]] and [[Germany]] having lower rates than Canada, but with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]] and most of Eastern Europe having higher ones.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Comparisons==\nComparing crime rates between countries is difficult due to the differences in jurisprudence, reporting and crime classifications.  National crime statistics are in reality statistics of only selected crime types. Data are collected through various surveying methods that have previously ranged between 15% and 100% coverage of the data.  A 2001 Statistics Canada study concluded that comparisons with the U.S. on homicide rates were the most reliable.  Comparison of rates for six lesser incident crimes was considered possible but subject to more difficulty of interpretation.  For example, types of assaults receive different classifications and laws in Canada and the U.S., making comparisons more difficult than homicides.  At the time, the U.S. crime of aggravated assault could be compared to the sum of three Canadian crimes (aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, and attempted murder).

For example, in 2000 the United States' rate for robberies was 65 percent higher, its rate for aggravated assault was more than double, and its murder rate was triple that of Canada. However, the rate of some property crime types is lower in the U.S. than in Canada. For example, in 2006, the rates of vehicle theft were 22% higher in Canada than in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|author=Christopher Effgen |url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |title=United States Crime Rates 1960 - 2008 |publisher=Disastercenter.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in recent years,{{When|date=July 2012}} the gap in violent crime rates between the United States and Canada has narrowed due to a precipitous drop in the violent crime rate in the U.S.  For example, while the aggravated assault rate declined for most of the 1990s in the U.S. and was 324 per 100,000 in 2000, the aggravated assault rate in Canada remained relatively steady throughout and was 143 per 100,000 in 2000.  In other areas, the U.S. had a faster decline.

It is the only album released which features [[Jacquie O'Sullivan]], who replaced [[Siobhan Fahey]] in Bananarama upon her departure in 1988. This album marks the end of the group's association with the [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] production team (they produced only two songs) as most of ''Pop Life'' was produced by [[Martin Glover|Youth]] (real name Martin Glover). UK singer [[Zo\u00eb (British singer)|Zo\u00eb]] provided backing vocals on \"[[Long Train Runnin'|Long Train Running]]\". This would be the last album by Bananarama as a trio.\n\nAfter the group's first [[World Tour (Bananarama)|world tour]] in 1989, they started recording their fifth album with producers [[Stock, Aitken and Waterman]], but they were dissatisfied with the results of those sessions, thinking the majority of those songs of sub-par quality, although \"Ain't No Cure\" and \"Heartless\" were eventually released on the album{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}. They started looking for other producers, first working with [[David Z (music producer)|David Z]] with whom they recorded \"Some Boys\", but they felt it was not the direction they wanted to follow and the song remained unreleased until 2013. They then worked with [[Steve Jolley]] who, along with [[Tony Swain (musician)|Tony Swain]], had produced the group's first three records. A song co-written by him, \"Is Your Love Strong Enough\" ended up on the album, while another remains unreleased. The group settled with [[Martin Glover|Youth]], who had been [[Sara Dallin]]'s boyfriend years before and whom the group knew well, to produce the majority of the album.\n\nUpon its release ''Pop Life'' earned positive reviews from critics but was a commercial failure, peaking at number 42 in the UK,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/pop%20life/|title=Official Charts Company > Pop Life|publisher=The Official UK Charts Company|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref> number 37 in Sweden,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Bananarama&titel=Pop+Life&cat=a|title=swedishcharts.com > Bananarama - Pop Life (album)|publisher=Hung Medien|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref> and number 146 in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716153430/http://i.imgur.com/oyPN1pW.jpg|url=http://i.imgur.com/oyPN1pW.jpg|archivedate=16 July 2015|title=Response from ARIA re: chart inquiry, received 15 July 2015|accessdate=2 October 2015|publisher=[[Imgur]]}}</ref> Four mid-charting singles were issued from the album, and following the release of \"Tripping on Your Love\", O'Sullivan left the group, leaving members [[Sara Dallin]] and [[Keren Woodward]] to continue as a duo.\n\nThe album was a departure from their previous albums as it incorporates a much more diverse range of musical genres, including [[flamenco]] guitar (a cover of the [[Doobie Brothers]] song \"Long Train Running\" featuring Alma de Noche, a pseudonym for the [[Gipsy Kings]]), retro-rock (\"[[Only Your Love]]\", \"Outta Sight\"), [[acid house]] (\"[[Tripping on Your Love]]\"), [[reggae]] (\"What Colour R the Skies Where U Live?\"), experimental club (\"Megalomaniac\"), and their hallmark [[Euro disco]] sound (\"[[Preacher Man]]\", \"Ain't No Cure\").\n\nThe track \"Ain't No Cure\" was covered by [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] produced girl group [[Delage (band)|Delage]] in 1991, although it was not released until 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/iYSdnuTvnIA |title=Delage \u2013 Ain't No Cure \u2013 PWL Overdose Mix \u2013 Mixed By DJ JAY &#124; Video Youtube \u2013 NMETV Latest Music Videos and Clips |publisher=Nme.Com |date= |accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2|5}} [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1246|pure_url=yes}} link]\n| noprose = yes\n}}\n\n==Track listing==\n'''CD version'''\n#\"[[Preacher Man]]\" \u2013 3:15 <small>(S.

It is the only album released which features [[Jacquie O'Sullivan]], who replaced [[Siobhan Fahey]] in Bananarama upon her departure in 1988. This album marks the end of the group's association with the [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] production team (they produced only two songs) as most of ''Pop Life'' was produced by [[Martin Glover|Youth]] (real name Martin Glover). UK singer [[Zo\u00eb (British singer)|Zo\u00eb]] provided backing vocals on \"[[Long Train Runnin'|Long Train Running]]\". This would be the last album by Bananarama as a trio.\n\nAfter the group's first [[World Tour (Bananarama)|world tour]] in 1989, they started recording their fifth album with producers [[Stock, Aitken and Waterman]], but they were dissatisfied with the results of those sessions, thinking the majority of those songs of sub-par quality, although \"Ain't No Cure\" and \"Heartless\" were eventually released on the album{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}. They started looking for other producers, first working with [[David Z (music producer)|David Z]] with whom they recorded \"Some Boys\", but they felt it was not the direction they wanted to follow and the song remained unreleased until 2013. They then worked with [[Steve Jolley]] who, along with [[Tony Swain (musician)|Tony Swain]], had produced the group's first three records. A song co-written by him, \"Is Your Love Strong Enough\" ended up on the album, while another remains unreleased. The group settled with [[Martin Glover|Youth]], who had been [[Sara Dallin]]'s boyfriend years before and whom the group knew well, to produce the majority of the album.\n\nUpon its release ''Pop Life'' earned positive reviews from critics but was a commercial failure, peaking at number 42 in the UK,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/pop%20life/|title=Official Charts Company > Pop Life|publisher=The Official UK Charts Company|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref> number 37 in Sweden,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Bananarama&titel=Pop+Life&cat=a|title=swedishcharts.com > Bananarama - Pop Life (album)|publisher=Hung Medien|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref> and number 146 in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716153430/http://i.imgur.com/oyPN1pW.jpg|url=http://i.imgur.com/oyPN1pW.jpg|archivedate=16 July 2015|title=Response from ARIA re: chart inquiry, received 15 July 2015|accessdate=2 October 2015|publisher=[[Imgur]]}}</ref> Four mid-charting singles were issued from the album, and following the release of \"Tripping on Your Love\", O'Sullivan left the group, leaving members [[Sara Dallin]] and [[Keren Woodward]] to continue as a duo.\n\nThe album was a departure from their previous albums as it incorporates a much more diverse range of musical genres, including [[flamenco]] guitar (a cover of the [[Doobie Brothers]] song \"Long Train Running\" featuring Alma de Noche, a pseudonym for the [[Gipsy Kings]]), retro-rock (\"[[Only Your Love]]\", \"Outta Sight\"), [[acid house]] (\"[[Tripping on Your Love]]\"), [[reggae]] (\"What Colour R the Skies Where U Live?\"), experimental club (\"Megalomaniac\"), and their hallmark [[Euro disco]] sound (\"[[Preacher Man]]\", \"Ain't No Cure\").\n\nThe track \"Ain't No Cure\" was covered by [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] produced girl group [[Delage (band)|Delage]] in 1991, although it was not released until 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/iYSdnuTvnIA |title=Delage \u2013 Ain't No Cure \u2013 PWL Overdose Mix \u2013 Mixed By DJ JAY &#124; Video Youtube \u2013 NMETV Latest Music Videos and Clips |publisher=Nme.Com |date= |accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2|5}} [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1246|pure_url=yes}} link]\n| noprose = yes\n}}\n\n==Track listing==\n'''CD version'''\n#\"[[Preacher Man]]\" \u2013 3:15 <small>(S.
