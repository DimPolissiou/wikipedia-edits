{"title_page": "List of African-American inventors and scientists", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{History of science and technology in the United States}}\nThis '''list of African Americans inventors and scientists''' documents many of the African-Americans who have invented a multitude of items or made discoveries in the course of their lives. These have ranged from practical everyday devices to applications and scientific discoveries in diverse fields, including physics, biology, math, plus the medical, nuclear and space science.\n\nAmong the earliest was [[George Washington Carver]], whose reputation was based on his [[research]] into and promotion of alternative crops to cotton, which aided in nutrition for farm families. He wanted poor farmers to grow alternative crops both as a source of their own food and as a source of other products to improve their way of life. The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins for farmers contained 105 food recipes using peanuts.<ref name=\"105ways\">Carver, George Washington. 1916. [http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/fruit-nut/carver-peanut/ \"How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it for Human Consumption\"], Tuskegee Institute Experimental Station Bulletin 31.</ref> He also developed and promoted about 100 products made from peanuts that were useful for the house and farm. He received numerous honors for his work, including the [[Spingarn Medal]] of the [[NAACP]].\n\nA later renowned scientist was [[Percy Lavon Julian]], a research chemist and a pioneer in the [[chemical synthesis]] of medicinal [[medication|drugs]] from plants. He was the first to synthesize the natural product [[physostigmine]], and a pioneer in the industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones, [[steroids]], [[progesterone]], and [[testosterone]], from [[plant sterols]] such as [[stigmasterol]] and sitosterol. His work would lay the foundation for the steroid drug industry's production of [[cortisone]], other [[corticosteroid]]s, and [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]s.\n\nA contemporary example of a modern-day inventor is [[Lonnie Johnson (inventor)|Lonnie George Johnson]], an engineer. Johnson invented the [[Super Soaker]] water gun, which was the top-selling toy in the United States from 1991 to 1992. In 1980 Johnson formed his own law firm and licensed the Super Soaker water gun to [[Larami|Larami Corporation]]. Two years later, the Super Soaker generated over $200&nbsp;million in retail sales and became the best selling toy in America. Larami Corporation was eventually purchased by [[Hasbro]], the second largest toy manufacturer in the world. Over the years, Super Soaker sales have totaled close to one billion dollars. Johnson reinvested a majority of his earnings from the Super Soaker into research and development for his energy technology companies \u2013 \"It's who I am, it's what I do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelifefiles.com/2010/09/22/meet-lonnie-johnson-he-made-millions-selling-water-guns/|title=Interview wp'ith CNBC's \"How I Made my Millions\"|website=thelifefiles.com|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}</ref> Currently,{{When|date=January 2016}} Johnson holds over 80 patents, with over 20 more pending, and is the author of several publications on spacecraft power systems.<ref>Roche, Timothy.

These have ranged from practical everyday devices to applications and scientific discoveries in diverse fields, including physics, biology, math, plus the medical, nuclear and space science.\n\nAmong the earliest was [[George Washington Carver]], whose reputation was based on his [[research]] into and promotion of alternative crops to cotton, which aided in nutrition for farm families. He wanted poor farmers to grow alternative crops both as a source of their own food and as a source of other products to improve their way of life. The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins for farmers contained 105 food recipes using peanuts.<ref name=\"105ways\">Carver, George Washington. 1916. [http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/fruit-nut/carver-peanut/ \"How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it for Human Consumption\"], Tuskegee Institute Experimental Station Bulletin 31.</ref> He also developed and promoted about 100 products made from peanuts that were useful for the house and farm. He received numerous honors for his work, including the [[Spingarn Medal]] of the [[NAACP]].\n\nA later renowned scientist was [[Percy Lavon Julian]], a research chemist and a pioneer in the [[chemical synthesis]] of medicinal [[medication|drugs]] from plants. He was the first to synthesize the natural product [[physostigmine]], and a pioneer in the industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones, [[steroids]], [[progesterone]], and [[testosterone]], from [[plant sterols]] such as [[stigmasterol]] and sitosterol. His work would lay the foundation for the steroid drug industry's production of [[cortisone]], other [[corticosteroid]]s, and [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]s.\n\nA contemporary example of a modern-day inventor is [[Lonnie Johnson (inventor)|Lonnie George Johnson]], an engineer. Johnson invented the [[Super Soaker]] water gun, which was the top-selling toy in the United States from 1991 to 1992. In 1980 Johnson formed his own law firm and licensed the Super Soaker water gun to [[Larami|Larami Corporation]]. Two years later, the Super Soaker generated over $200&nbsp;million in retail sales and became the best selling toy in America. Larami Corporation was eventually purchased by [[Hasbro]], the second largest toy manufacturer in the world. Over the years, Super Soaker sales have totaled close to one billion dollars. Johnson reinvested a majority of his earnings from the Super Soaker into research and development for his energy technology companies \u2013 \"It's who I am, it's what I do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelifefiles.com/2010/09/22/meet-lonnie-johnson-he-made-millions-selling-water-guns/|title=Interview wp'ith CNBC's \"How I Made my Millions\"|website=thelifefiles.com|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}</ref> Currently,{{When|date=January 2016}} Johnson holds over 80 patents, with over 20 more pending, and is the author of several publications on spacecraft power systems.<ref>Roche, Timothy.

Greece play most of their home matches in or near [[Athens]], either in [[Athens]] at the [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Olympic Stadium]] in the [[Maroussi]] section of the city or in the port city of [[Piraeus]] at the [[Karaiskakis Stadium]] just outside Athens. Greece is one of only [[UEFA European Championship#Results|ten national teams]] to have been crowned [[List of UEFA European Championship finals|UEFA European Champions]].\n\nGreece made their first appearance in a major tournament at [[UEFA Euro 1980]] and although they did not make it through the group stage, their qualification to the then eight-team [[UEFA European Championship|tournament]] gave them a position in the top eight European football nations that year. Greece did not qualify for another major tournament until the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] and after an undefeated qualifying campaign, they produced a poor performance in the final tournament, losing all three group matches without scoring.\n\n[[UEFA Euro 2004]] marked a high point in Greece's football history when they were crowned [[UEFA European Championship#Finalists|European champions]] in only their second participation in the tournament. Dismissed as rank outsiders before the tournament, the team defeated some of the favourites in the competition including defending European champions [[France national football team|France]] and hosts [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]. During the tournament, Greece defeated the hosts in both the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Group A#Portugal vs Greece|opening game]] of the tournament and again in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final|final]]. Their triumph earned them a place in the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup]].\n\nIn the decade after the 2004 victory, Greece qualified for the final tournaments of all but one major competitions entered, reaching the [[UEFA Euro 2012 knockout phase#Germany vs Greece|quarter-finals]] at the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Costa Rica vs Greece|round of 16]] at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. During that period, they occupied a place in the top 20 of the [[FIFA World Rankings]] for all but four months, and reached an all-time high of eighth in the world from April to June 2008, as well as in October 2011.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Football in Greece}}\n[[File:Greece football team Inter-Allied Games 1919.jpg|thumb|180px|The national team for the [[Inter-Allied Games]] in [[Paris]], 1919.]]\n[[File:Greece national football team 1920 Olympics.jpg|thumb|180px|Greek squad for the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]].]]\n\n===First years===\nThe first appearance of a Greek national football team was at the [[1906 Intercalated Games]] in [[Athens]]. Later, the Greek team participated in the [[Inter-Allied Games]] in [[Paris]], following the end of [[World War I]], and in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] of [[Antwerp]] (recognized as first official by [[FIFA]]). A notable figure during these years was [[Giorgos Kalafatis]], player and later manager of the team.\n\n===1970 World Cup near miss===\nDuring the next decades, the Greek team did not manage to have any success, despite the passion of the Greek people for football. The country's economical and social problems after [[World War II]], did not allow successful preparation of the national team.\n\nAt its best moment, Greece narrowly missed qualifying for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]], despite a good quality team, including some of the greatest-ever Greek players, such as [[Mimis Domazos]], [[Giorgos Sideris]], [[Giorgos Koudas]] and [[Mimis Papaioannou]].\n\n===Euro 1980===\n[[File:Alketas Panagoulias (1986).jpg|thumb|180px|[[Alketas Panagoulias]] led Greece to the [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].'']]\n\nGreece, under the guidance of [[Alketas Panagoulias]], made its first appearance in a major tournament at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]] in Italy, after [[UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying|qualifying]] top of a group that included the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] and [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], both world football powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sansimera.gr/articles/277|title=Greece is in the Euro, for the first time, 1980|publisher=sansimera.gr|language=Greek}}</ref> In the final tournament, Greece was drawn into group A with [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]], the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], and [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. In their first game, Greece held the Dutch until the only goal of the game was scored with a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] by [[Kees Kist|Kist]], in the 65th minute. Three days later Greece played Czechoslovakia in [[Rome]]. After holding the Czechoslovakians 1\u20131 at the end the first half, Greece eventually lost 3\u20131. In their last game, Greece earned a 0\u20130 draw against eventual winners West Germany, concluding what was considered a decent overall performance in the team's maiden presence in a final phase of any football competition.\n\n===1994 World Cup===\n\nThe team's success in qualifying for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] in the United States, marked the first time they had made it to the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/stili/h-mixani-tou-xronou/article/1009276/o-mahlas-esteile-tin-ellada-sto-proto-tis-moyntial-vid|title=Machlas sent Greece to its first World Cup!|publisher=gazzetta.gr|language=Greek}}</ref> Greece finished first and undefeated in their [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying group]], surpassing [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in the final game. In the final tournament Greece were drawn into [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] with [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]], and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. After the successful qualifying campaign, expectations back in Greece were high as no one could imagine the oncoming astounding failure. Most notable reason for this complete failure was the fact that legendary coach [[Alketas Panagoulias]] opted to take a squad full of those players \u2013 though most of them aging and out of form \u2013 that helped the team in the qualifying instead of new emerging talents seeing it as a reward for their unprecedented success. Furthermore, they had the disadvantage of being drawn into a \"[[group of death]]\", with runners-up at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] Argentina, later semifinalists Bulgaria, and Nigeria, one of the strongest African teams. It is worth mentioning that all players of the squad, including the three goalkeepers, took part in those three games, something very rare. This tournament was humiliating for the Greek squad, though it is understandable given its first maiden appearance. In their first game against Argentina at [[Foxboro Stadium]] just outside Boston, they lost 4\u20130. Four days later Greece suffered another 4\u20130 blow from Bulgaria at [[Soldier Field]] in Chicago, and then, in what would be their final game, they lost to Nigeria 2\u20130 at Foxboro Stadium again. In the end, Greece were eliminated in the first round by losing all three games, scoring no goals and conceding ten.\n\n===Near misses===\nGreece failed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 96|Euro 1996]] finishing third in the group behind [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. In their [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1998 World Cup qualifying tournament]] the team finished only one point shy of second-placed [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] after a 0\u20130 draw by the eventual Group winners, the [[Denmark national football team|Danish]]. In their [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|Euro 2000 qualifying group]], Greece finished again in third place, two points behind second-placed [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in a highly disappointing campaign that saw the team lose at home to [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]]. In the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2002 World Cup qualifying]] Greece finished a disappointing fourth in their group behind [[England national football team|England]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Finland national football team|Finland]], which led to the sacking of coach [[Vassilis Daniil|Vasilis Daniil]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sport-retro.gr/ellada-germania-2-4-ethniki-germany-apovoli-vasilis-daniil/|title=The misconduct that \"dismantled the National Team\"|publisher=sport-retro.gr|language=Greek}}</ref> replaced by [[Otto Rehhagel]]. Highlights of the campaign included a 5\u20131 defeat in Finland and the 2\u20132 draw that followed in England, the first two games of the soon to become legendary German coach at the reins of the Greek national team.\n\n===European Champions: Euro 2004 triumph===\n[[File:Greece 2004 lineup.png|thumb|left|160px|Greece line-up in [[Euro 2004]]]]\n[[File:Tsiartas.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Vassilios Tsiartas|Vasilis Tsiartas]]]]\n[[File:Theodoros Zagorakis.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Theodoros Zagorakis|Thodoris Zagorakis]], captain of the national team and \"player of the tournament\" in Euro 2004.]]\n\n====Qualification====\nGreece started the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 6|qualification]] campaign with defeats at home to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and away to [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], both with a 2\u20130 scoreline. The team went on to win their remaining six games, including a 1\u20130 away win over Spain in [[Zaragoza]], securing first place in the group and an appearance in the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]] finals for the first time in 24 years.\n\n====Before the tournament====\nGreece were the second-least favorite in the competition to win, with [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] being the least favorite.

Greece won with a 25-yard strike by [[Giorgos Karagounis]] and a penalty by [[Angelos Basinas]].

However a sublime diagonal pass by playmaker [[Vassilios Tsiartas|Vasilis Tsiartas]] allowed [[Angelos Charisteas]] to score an equaliser in the second half, giving Greece hope of qualifying. In the final group match Greece fell behind 2\u20130 to Russia (who were already eliminated) within the first ten minutes of the game but managed to pull one back through [[Zisis Vryzas]] and thus progressed to the next round, at the expense of Spain, on goals scored. [[Dmitri Kirichenko]] had the chance to eliminate Greece in the final minutes of this match, but his stretched effort squeezed just wide.\n\n====Quarter-final====\nIn the quarter-finals Greece faced off with the undefeated and reigning champions [[France national football team|France]]. At 65 minutes Greece took the lead. Angelos Basinas played a perfect pass to captain [[Theodoros Zagorakis|Thodoris Zagorakis]], who flicked the ball high in the air, past veteran French defender [[Bixente Lizarazu]], and sent a perfect cross to [[Angelos Charisteas]] for the header and goal. Greece held on to win despite a late French onslaught, with close efforts by [[Thierry Henry]], thus knocking France out of Euro 2004 and becoming the first team ever to defeat both the hosts and defending champions in the same tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/stili/h-mixani-tou-xronou/article/763993/ellada-gallia-1-0-sto-euro-2004|title=Greece - France 1-0 at Euro 2004|publisher=gazzetta.gr|language=Greek}}</ref>\n\n====Semi-final====\nGreece reached the semifinals to face the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], who were the only team to defeat all of their opponents to that point. The Czech record included a convincing 3\u20132 win over the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], a 2\u20131 win over [[Germany national football team|Germany]], and a 3\u20130 win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in the quarter-finals. At this stage in the tournament the Czechs were favourites to take the trophy. The game began nervously for Greece, as the Czech Republic applied much pressure. [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Rosick\u00fd]] hit the bar in the opening minutes, and [[Jan Koller]] had several efforts saved by [[Antonios Nikopolidis|Antonis Nikopolidis]]. The Czechs chances were dealt a blow when influential midfielder [[Pavel Nedv\u011bd]] left the pitch injured in the first half. After 90 minutes the game ended 0\u20130, despite the Czechs having most of the game's missed chances. In the final minute of the first half of extra time, a close range [[silver goal]] header by [[Traianos Dellas]] from a [[Vassilios Tsiartas|Vasilis Tsiartas]] corner ended the Czech campaign, putting Greece into the final of [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] and sending their fans into raptures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/ellada/ethniki_elladas/1-7-2004-gkol-kai-fugame-gia-teliko.4746605.html|title=1/7/2004: Goal and go for the final!|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jul/02/euro2004.sport3|title=Dellas fires the silver bullet|work=The Guardian|accessdate=1 July 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/stili/h-mixani-tou-xronou/article/1245954/san-simera-i-ellada-ston-teliko-toy-euro-2004-pics-vid|title=Greece is in the final of EURO 2004!|publisher=gazzetta.gr|language=Greek}}</ref>\n\n====Final====\n{{main|UEFA Euro 2004 Final}}\n[[File:Charisteas' Siegtreffer im Finale der Euro 2004.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Angelos Charisteas]] scoring Greece's winning goal in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final|Euro 2004 final]].]]\n{{football squad on pitch|align=left\n| GK  = [[Antonis Nikopolidis|'''Nikopolidis''']]\n| RB  = [[Giourkas Seitaridis|'''Seitaridis''']]\n| RCB = [[Michalis Kapsis|'''Kapsis''']]\n| LCB = [[Traianos Dellas|'''Dellas''']]\n| LB  = [[Takis Fyssas|'''Fyssas''']]\n| DM = [[Kostas Katsouranis|'''Katsouranis''']]\n| RCM = [[Theodoros Zagorakis|'''Zagorakis (C)''']]\n| LW  = [[Stelios Giannakopoulos|'''Giannakopoulos''']]\n| LCM  = [[Angelos Basinas|'''Basinas''']]\n| RW  = [[Angelos Charisteas|'''Charisteas''']]\n| CF  = [[Zisis Vryzas|'''Vryzas''']]\n| caption = Greece starting line-up against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] at the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final]].}}\nFor the first time in history the final was a repeat of the opening match, with Greece and hosts Portugal facing off in a rematch.

In the third match against heavily favoured Argentina, Greece needed a combination of results to advance to the next round. As expected, in what would be his final game as Greece's national team head coach, [[Otto Rehhagel]] conjured up a very defensive-minded strategy, leaving [[Georgios Samaras]] with nearly all offensive responsibilities as the lone striker. The strategy nearly paid off in the second half with the score still locked at 0\u20130 when Samaras beat the last Argentine defender on a quick long-ball counter-attack but curled a rushed shot just wide of the far post. The Greeks held the Argentines scoreless until the 77th minute but ultimately lost 2\u20130, finishing third in Group B.\n\nGreece moved from 13th to 12th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] following the tournament.

While Greece's proficiency in stifling opposition attacks seemed to wane toward the end of Rehhagel's tenure, the emergence of Santos seemed to galvanize Greek defending once more. Through seven international friendlies and ten Euro 2012 qualifiers, the Greeks kept nine [[clean sheet]]s and conceded just one goal in each of the remaining eight contests. From start to end of their unbeaten run, Santos' national side moved from No. 12 to No. 8 in FIFA's world rankings, equaling the highest mark in history credited by FIFA to Greece. Only one match from their streak featured a team (other than Greece) that appeared at the 2010 World Cup, a 1\u20130 defeat of Serbia in [[Belgrade]].\n\n===Euro 2012===\n\n====Qualifying====\nWith its late-game comeback victory over [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] in October 2011, Greece padded its historic football tournament r\u00e9sum\u00e9, most importantly by sealing an automatic berth into [[UEFA Euro 2012|UEFA's 2012 European Football Championship tournament]]. For the second time in team history the national side won its qualifying group for a major football tournament without a single loss incurred, as Greece also went undefeated in [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA \u2013 Group 5)|1994 World Cup qualifiers]]. Adding to its [[UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying Group 6|1980]], [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 6|2004]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group C|2008]] Euro qualifying campaigns, the Georgia triumph marked the fifth time overall that Greece has won its qualification group for a major tournament. Although their tendency to produce positive results remained steady throughout qualifying, so too did the Greeks' proclivity to start games slowly and concede early goals. This habit would plague the Greeks through qualifying and eventually tarnish their Euro 2012 performances.\n\nOver two qualifying contests, Greece trailed Georgia on the scoreboard for 130 of 180 minutes and still managed to grab four of six possible points in the standings by way of three late strikes. Goals scored in the dying minutes of games, often coming from defenders, became somewhat of a Greek signature on [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group F|Group F's table]]. In fact Greece was able to take and keep a first-half lead just once in ten games, the 3\u20131 home defeat of [[Malta national football team|Malta]] which was [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying#Seedings|ranked 50th]] of 53 teams in Europe. In Malta, a last-second tie-breaking strike from defender [[Vasilis Torosidis]] pocketed a crucial extra two points in the standings for Greece, the same number of points it held over [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] at the end of qualifying. Despite allowing weaker teams in the group to bring the game to them, the Greeks admirably held powerful Croatia scoreless through two meetings and deservedly won Group F four days after a decisive 2\u20130 home win versus the second-place Croats. [[Theofanis Gekas|Fanis Gekas]], who retired from national team service in 2010 after Fernando Santos' third game as manager, came out of retirement in time to contribute a goal to the result. Gekas was eventually included in Santos's 23-man Euro 2012 roster, leaving out Euro 2004 hero [[Angelos Charisteas]] who scored the group-clinching goal in the aforementioned Greek qualifying victory in Georgia.\n\n====Group stage in Poland====\n[[File:Greece team POL-GRE 8-6-2012.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Greek players singing the [[Hymn to Liberty|Greek national anthem]] in [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] opening match against the hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] (1\u20131).]]\n\n\"Shades of 2004\" was a commonly perceived theme regarding the buildup to Euro 2012 for the Greeks and their progression through the tournament. As in 2004 Greece was drawn into the same group as the host nation, [[Poland national football team|Poland]] on this occasion, and also had the pressure of playing in the tournament's opening match. Two familiar foes from its 2004 championship run, [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], joined Greece and Poland in Group A on 2 December 2011 at the tournament's final draw in Kiev. Upon drawing the lowest-ranked teams from Pots 1 and 2 as well as the second-lowest from Pot 4, Greece's prospects of passing the group stage at Euro 2012 were given a boost.\n\nIdeas of steering \"To Piratiko\" to a dream start in host-nation territory as Greece did in Portugal eight years before, rapidly turned sour during the opening match's first half. From the outset the Greeks appeared uncomfortable holding the ball for long spells and seemed content to allow hosts Poland to push numbers forward with the ball, hoping to score through counter-attacks. However, Poland made the most of its early possession, as top scorer [[Robert Lewandowski]] converted a header from a goal line cross past a scurrying [[Kostas Chalkias]]. Hope and momentum continued to tip in favor of Poland when [[Sokratis Papastathopoulos]] received his second yellow card of the game in just the 44th minute from Spanish referee [[Carlos Velasco Carballo]]. The Greeks, however, began to boss the game after halftime while playing down a man. [[Dimitris Salpingidis]] made the greatest impact on the game for Greece as a second-half substitute, making brilliant penetrating runs behind the Polish defense, eventually bringing the game level 1\u20131 on a mistake by Poland keeper [[Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny]]. Salpingidis was then responsible for levelling up the numbers for the Greeks when Szcz\u0119sny made a red-card foul on Salpingidis' breakaway attempt on goal in the 68th minute. But Greek captain [[Giorgos Karagounis]]' subsequent penalty kick was turned away by substitute keeper [[Przemys\u0142aw Tyto\u0144]]. A second goal by Salpingidis was disallowed as he was assisted by an offside [[Kostas Fortounis]], denying Greece's best opportunity to take three points from what ended as an improbable 1\u20131 draw.\n\nThe Czech Republic exploited Greece's weakness at the left-defender position early in the second group stage match, notching two goals in the first six minutes. Just as Poland had, the Czechs repeatedly penetrated the Greek back line behind left-side defender [[Jos\u00e9 Holebas|Jos\u00e9 Cholevas]], scoring on a through-ball and a cross from Cholevas' side. [[Petr \u010cech]]'s gaffe on a [[Georgios Samaras]] cross in the second half turned into a gift goal for [[Theofanis Gekas|Fanis Gekas]]. The Czechs then eased off on their early pressure, opting to sit back and guard their lead for much of the second half, but Gekas' goal was too little too late. Greece lost the match 2\u20131, placing them at the foot of Group A in need of a victory over the attack-minded Russians to advance to the knockout rounds.\n\nAfter thrashing the Czech Republic 4\u20131 and displaying more offensive potency in a 1\u20131 draw with Poland, the Russians were favored to earn the one point they needed to advance against the Greeks, especially since defeating the team in both of the previous two European Championships. However, Greece delivered a trademark 1\u20130 defensive victory and advanced to the Euro 2012 quarterfinals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/16/euro-2012-greece-russia-live|title=Euro 2012: Greece v Russia - as it happened|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> The Greeks scored when Russian defender [[Sergei Ignashevich]] errantly headed a Greece throw-in behind the Russian defense for Giorgos Karagounis to pounce on. Greece's captain sprinted in on goal and struck the ball at the back post under keeper [[Vyacheslav Malafeev]] in first-half stoppage time to send the Russians reeling into the locker rooms. Ignashevich appeared to have conceded an additional golden scoring opportunity for Greece upon tripping Karagounis in the Russian penalty area early in the second half, but referee [[Jonas Eriksson (referee)|Jonas Eriksson]] instead booked Karagounis for what he believed to be [[Diving (association football)|simulation]]. This being Karagounis' second yellow card of the tournament, Greece was to be without its suspended captain in the next round. With that victory, Greece qualified to the quarterfinals for a second time after their successful Euro 2004 campaign.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\n[[File:Gdansk PGE Arena GER-GRE Euro 2012 17.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Greece played against [[German national football team|Germany]] for a place in the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] but they were eliminated after a 4\u20132 loss in the quarter-final match.]]\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Greece met with a [[German national football team|Germany]] side that won all three of its group matches against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[the Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]]. Greece applied very little pressure in the midfield in the opening period, slowing the tempo of the game and affording the Germans the majority of possession. Young [[Sotiris Ninis]] switched off momentarily in defence, allowing German captain [[Philipp Lahm]] to cut infield and open the scoring with a long-distance strike. Yet the Greeks remained calm as in [[Georgios Samaras]] they carried a constant threat. On the counter-attack, they pulled level early in the second half; regaining possession in their defensive third, [[Georgios Fotakis|Giorgos Fotakis]] found [[Dimitris Salpingidis]] streaking 40 yards deep into German territory. Salpingidis delivered a ball five yards in front of goalkeeper [[Manuel Neuer]], which Samaras was able to meet and power underneath Neuer for the equalizer. Twenty minutes later, however, the Germans led 4\u20131. Greece scored an 89th-minute penalty kick by Salpingidis, but the match ended 4\u20132 to the Germans, ending Greece's Euro 2012 campaign.\n\n=== 2014 World Cup ===\n\n====Qualifying====\n[[File:20130814 AT-GR Nationalteam Griechenland 2414.JPG|thumb|300px|Greek national team in 2013]]\n\nTo reach the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] in Brazil, Greece had to contend with a team on the rise in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and a dangerous [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakian]] side seemingly in decline since its memorable 2010 World Cup qualifying and finals performances. [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]], a familiar qualification foe for Greece in its previous two major tournaments ([[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 2|2010 World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group F|Euro 2012]]), joined the fray as well. Ahead of those aforesaid tournaments, Bosnia twice narrowly missed out on its first major international tournament appearance due to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team#Bla\u017eevi\u0107 leads team to World Cup 2010 play-offs|consecutive playoff defeats]] at the hands of Portugal. No playoff would be necessary for Bosnia in 2013, as it [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group G|won its qualifying group]] over Greece on [[goal difference]]. The decisive match was in Bosnia on 22 March, when Greece succumbed to three set-piece goals (two free-kick headers and one penalty miss rebound) in a 3\u20131 defeat. Greece's defense proved rigid throughout qualifying, conceding zero goals in open play. Four goals were allowed by the Greeks in ten games, the first of which was a penalty by Latvia, and yet four goals were too many for a relatively unproductive Greek attack to overcome. Though Greece was shut out just once, the team only managed to score 12 goals, an output Bosnia reached in its second game.\n\nFollowing group play [[Romania national football team|Romania]], which claimed second place over [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in a group dominated by the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]], awaited Greece in a [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Second Round#Matches|two-legged playoff]]. The last time the two sides met in late 2011, Romania came into Greece and dealt [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]] his first defeat as Greece manager in his 18th game at the helm. The Greeks reversed the prior 3\u20131 result in their favour this time, scoring each goal through skillful one-touch passing and finishing. [[Kostas Mitroglou]] accounted for three of Greece's four goals in a 4\u20132 aggregate playoff victory, though none were actual game-winners. [[Dimitris Salpingidis]] notched the game winner in Athens, while the second leg finished 1\u20131 in [[Bucharest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/24907600|title=Greece booked their place at the 2014 World Cup|publisher=bbc.com|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Finals====\n[[File:Arena das Dunas 19062014.JPG|thumb|240px|right|[[Arena das Dunas]] before the Japan vs Greece match.]]\n\n[[Aracaju]] was chosen as the team's base camp for the tournament in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=1/news=team-base-camps-for-brazil-2014-announced-2267880.html |title=Team Base Camps for Brazil 2014 announced|date=31 January 2014|accessdate=28 May 2014|publisher=FIFA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/se/copa-do-mundo/fotos/2014/06/fotos-confira-como-esta-o-batistao-apos-reformas-para-receber-grecia.html|title=Slideshow|accessdate=7 June 2014|publisher=GE Sergipe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/mg/copa-do-mundo/noticia/2014/06/gregos-de-belo-horizonte-prometem-festa-em-jogo-contra-colombia.html | title = Gregos de Belo Horizonte preparam festa para partida contra a Col\u00f4mbia | date = 4 June 2014 |accessdate=7 June 2014|publisher=GE Sergipe | first = Marco Ant\u00f4nio | last = Astoni | language = Portuguese}}</ref> Greece was drawn into [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group C|Group C]] with [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], [[Ivory Coast national football team|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and ultimately created for itself an extraordinarily similar tournament experience as it did two years prior at Euro 2012. The Greeks were put in an early 1\u20130 hole in their first game against a Colombia team whose exuberant fans generated a hostile away environment. Following its historical penchant, Greece thrived playing from behind as the underdog. [[Panagiotis Kone]] narrowly missed equalizing just one minute after Colombia's fifth-minute goal. Trailing 2\u20130 in the 63rd minute, [[Theofanis Gekas|Fanis Gekas]]' header off a cross six yards from an open goal caromed off the crossbar for Greece's best chance of the match. The Colombians proved to be the more clinical finishers, prevailing over the Europeans 3\u20130 despite an even number of goal shots for both teams and a slight possession advantage in Greece's favor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/statistics/id/383299/statistics.html |title=Greece v Colombia|date=14 June 2014|accessdate=1 August 2014|publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref> To stave off the threat of elimination, the Greeks needed to earn at least a point in their second match with Japan, who sat alongside them at the bottom of Group C. The task grew more difficult once two errant slide tackles by captain [[Kostas Katsouranis]] each drew yellow cards and reduced Greece to ten men in the 38th minute. Eight Greek players on the pitch had endured the same scenario against Poland in 2012 and once again their resolve did not break. Japan controlled much of possession in a 0\u20130 draw and remained tied with Greece on points due to poor finishing from close range. The draw made it necessary for Greece to defeat Ivory Coast in its final group match in order to reach the round of 16 for the first time in its history. Unlike its mirror-scenario final group match against Russia in Euro 2012, the Greeks came out as the aggressors from the outset against Ivory Coast. An early injury to center midfielder Panagiotis Kone brought on young [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]' midfielder [[Andreas Samaris]], who would score his first international goal after intercepting a faulty back-pass by an Ivorian defender. Also unlike its 2012 match with Russia, capitalizing on a first half opponent miscue would not be enough to carry Greece to a needed victory. [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]] striker [[Wilfried Bony]] equalized for Ivory Coast in the 73rd minute. The Ivorians promptly adopted Greece's defensive strategy but could not hold out until the game's end. In the first minute of stoppage time, Ivory Coast striker [[Giovanni Sio]] obstructed a Samaras shot by clipping him from behind in the Ivorian penalty area, resulting in a Greek penalty kick which Samaras converted with 30 seconds remaining in the game, to wild celebrations in Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/6/24/5839030/greece-vs-ivory-coast-2014-world-cup-final-score-result|title=Greece vs. Ivory Coast, 2014 World Cup: Final score 2-1, Greece advances on a stoppage time penalty|publisher=sbnation.com|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs Group C runners-up Greece was paired in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Costa Rica vs Greece|round of 16]] with [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] shock winner [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], who won its first-ever World Cup group stage over former world champions Uruguay, Italy and England. Trailing 1\u20130 but dominating possession due in part to a second yellow card to Costa Rican [[\u00d3scar Duarte (Costa Rican footballer)|\u00d3scar Duarte]], the Greeks forced extra time through a [[Sokratis Papastathopoulos]] equalizer ten seconds into stoppage time. This would prove to be the only goal Costa Rica goalkeeper [[Keylor Navas]] would concede in open play throughout the tournament. Navas stayed strong to turn away several significant opportunities for the Greeks throughout the 30 minutes of extra time, including a [[Theofanis Gekas|Fanis Gekas]]' penalty in the game's concluding penalty shootout. Costa Rica claimed its first World Cup knockout stage victory and denied Greece its first by defeating the Greeks 5\u20133 on penalties.\n\n===Euro 2016 qualifying: Reorganization and decline===\n\nThe team appointed [[Claudio Ranieri]] as head coach in July 2014. He was sacked in November of the same year after a shocking home defeat to the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2835744/Claudio-Ranieri-sacked-manager-Greece-following-shock-defeat-Faroe-Islands-Euro-2016-qualifier.html|title=Claudio Ranieri sacked as manager of Greece following shock defeat to Faroe Islands in Euro 2016 qualifier|publisher=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> [[Sergio Markari\u00e1n]] was appointed in his place, but he too has come under fire, especially after a second loss at the hand of the Faroe Islands and the team's terrible performances in the remaining [[UEFA Euro 2016]] qualifying. The team's form after September 2014 proved to be abysmal, with no wins in over a year, losing to [[Romania national football team|Romania]], the Faroe Islands (twice), [[Finland national football team|Finland]], [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and even [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] in a friendly match over that period. Greece finished in bottom place in their Euro Qualifying group, earning just one victory against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in the final round, and failing to qualify for the tournament. Greece, along with [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were the only nations from [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying#Qualifying group stage|Pot 1]] not to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 2016|finals]]. Those three had taken part in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. Incidentally, the three teams would also fail to qualify for the World Cup in 2018.\n\n===2018 World Cup qualifying: resurgence===\n\nIn attempting to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Greece would suffer a second successive failure to reach a major tournament. They finished second in Group H of the European qualifying stages, nine points behind runaway leaders [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and only two points clear of third placed [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Greece began their qualification campaign well with three straight wins against [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]], [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] and [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], only conceding one goal in the process, and they remained unbeaten for seven matches after drawing their next four games; two of which ended 1\u20131 in succession against Bosnia and Belgium, and the other two ended 0\u20130 in the return fixtures against Bosnia and Estonia. Greece then lost 2\u20131 to group leaders Belgium, but managed to beat Cyprus and Gibraltar to ensure second place in the group, and qualification for the play-off round.\n\nGreece were subsequently drawn against Croatia in the play-off round, where they were knocked out over two legs; a 4\u20131 away defeat set the tone for Greece's campaign, and in the second leg they drew a blank in a 0\u20130 stalemate against the Croats to signify the end of their World Cup hopes. [[Kostas Mitroglou]] finished as Greece's top scorer throughout their campaign, scoring six goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/european-qualifiers/season=2018/teams/team=49/squad/#/|title=Greece 2018 Squad Info|work=UEFA|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2020 Euro qualifying: small rise, fall and promising finish===\n\nGreece's qualification campaign for the [[UEFA Euro 2020]] started well with a 2\u20130 away win against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]] and an away match against Bosnia and Herzegovina that saw Bosnia take a 2\u20130 lead before half time, but Greece scored two goals, leading to a 2\u20132 draw. However, they lost the following two matches, which were both at home, being defeated 0\u20133 by [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and succumbing to a shocking 2\u20133 defeat to [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]]. It got worse for them after a 1\u20130 away loss to [[Finland national football team|Finland]] and a home draw with [[Liechtenstein national football team results|Liechtenstein]]. Due to these disappointing results, [[John van 't Schip]] decided not to call some of the leading members at that time, such as [[Sokratis Papastathopoulos]] and [[Kostas Manolas]], for the remaining games. These decisions might be shocking but a young team with passion was built and the Greek team showed a massive improvement in the attacking and pressing style of play. In the final three games Greece achieved successive victories with a 2\u20131 win against the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team]], a 1\u20130 away victory over Armenia and recovering from a goal down to win 2\u20131 against Finland at home. Greece finished third in the final table but was still not enough to earn a play-off place.\n\n==Stadiums==\n[[File:Argentina Vs Italy 3-0 2004 Olympics Athens.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The [[Karaiskakis Stadium]] in [[Piraeus]], the home ground of Greece from 2004 until 2017.]]\nTraditionally, Greece have spent most of their history playing their home matches in different stadiums primarily in or near [[Athens]], but also in a number of other cities around the country. The home ground of the national team was the [[Karaiskakis Stadium]] in [[Piraeus]], since its reconstruction in 2004 until 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/ellada/ethniki_elladas/ektos-attikhs-oi-agwnes-ths-ethnikhs-elladas.4946988.html4|title=Termination of Karaiskakis Stadium for the Greece national football team|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince their first international game in 1929 and for the next 33 years Greece constantly used as home ground the [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]]. Their first home match away from it was played at the [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]] in 1962, while the Karaiskakis Stadium was used for a first time in 1964, when it was renovated. In 1966, the [[Kaftanzoglio Stadium]] in [[Thessaloniki]] became the first stadium outside of the Athens area to be used. Since then all these stadiums were alternately used until the early 1980s, while some other stadiums were inaugurated by the national team such as the Thessaloniki's [[Toumba Stadium]] and [[Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium|Harilaou Stadium]] in 1975 and 1977 respectively, along with Greece's first visits in 1976 to grounds outside of the two major cities, such as the [[Kostas Davourlis Stadium|Panachaiki Stadium]] in [[Patras]] and the [[Anthi Karagianni Stadium|Kavala Stadium]] in [[Kavala]]. In 1982, the [[Georgios Kamaras Stadium]] was added to the list of home grounds for the national team, the first in Athens out of the three major stadiums.\n\nOn 16 November 1983, the newly built [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]], to date the largest stadium in the country, housed the national team for a first time in a qualifier for [[UEFA Euro 1984]] against Denmark and served as its primary home ground for the rest of the 1980s and the 1990s, until 2001 when it was closed for renovations. Meanwhile, a large number of matches was held in various stadiums including old choices and some new in provincial cities all over the country, something that did not change neither in the early 2000s, when the Athens Olympic Stadium was almost abandoned. Since 2004 and the use mainly of the Karaiskakis Stadium, very few of Greece's matches have occasionally been played in other stadiums as well. They returned to [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|OAKA]] in 2018 for a friendly against Switzerland and announced they will play their home matches for the new UEFA Nations League there, as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/ellada/ethniki_elladas/sto-olympiako-stadio-h-ethnikh-elladas-gia-to-nations-league.5259766.html|title=In Olympic Stadium the matches of Greece national team for the Nations League|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=13 July 2018}}</ref> For the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers, they were slated split time between OAKA in Athens, and the [[Pankritio Stadium]] in [[Heraklion]] on the island of [[Crete]], but with the latter requiring upgrades to be fit for FIFA standards, the entire campaign was held in Athens.\n\n==Team image==\n{{Commons|Greece national football team kits}}\nGreece's traditional colours are blue and white, originating from the [[Flag of Greece|Greek flag]]. Although blue was used as the home kit since the team's inception, white became the primary home color following [[UEFA Euro 2004]]. In recent decades, Greece wear either a set of white jerseys, shorts and socks, or an all-blue combination. Formerly, the kit consisted of a combination of blue jerseys and white shorts and vice versa.

The team is often called ''Galanolefki'' (Sky blue-white) due to the use of the colours of the [[Flag of Greece|Greek flag]] as kit colours. Both nicknames are used for the country's national teams in other sports as well.\n\nDuring the opening ceremony at the [[UEFA Euro 2004]], which took place right before the inaugural game of the tournament between Greece and hosts [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], a replica of a 16th-century ship was used referring to the expeditions of the Portuguese explorers of that time. Greek radio sports journalist [[Georgios Helakis]], while broadcasting the opening match, commented that ''\"since the Portuguese team appeared in such a ship, it's time for us to become pirates and steal the victory\"''. Eventually, Greece beat the hosts and the team was described as ''Piratiko'', meaning the 'Pirate ship', which emerged as the new nickname of the team repeated at every win during the tournament. Especially after the Greek win in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final|final]] to Portugal, the new nickname was established to commemorate the coronation of Greece as [[UEFA European Championship|European champions]].\n\n=== Rivalries ===\n{{main|Greece\u2013Turkey football rivalry}}\nGreece has a historical rivalry with [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]; having played them a total of 13 times, winning three, drawing three and losing seven games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/turkey/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Greece/|title=Turkey national football team: record v Greece|website=www.11v11.com|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> Both countries have been described as \"punching above their weight\"; with Greece winning [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] despite being classified as underdogs prior to the competition, and Turkey followed-up their [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup semi-final appearance in 2002]] by advancing to the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], where they were knocked out by [[Germany national football team|Germany]].

Greece play most of their home matches in or near [[Athens]], either in [[Athens]] at the [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Olympic Stadium]] in the [[Maroussi]] section of the city or in the port city of [[Piraeus]] at the [[Karaiskakis Stadium]] just outside Athens. Greece is one of only [[UEFA European Championship#Results|ten national teams]] to have been crowned [[List of UEFA European Championship finals|UEFA European Champions]].\n\nGreece made their first appearance in a major tournament at [[UEFA Euro 1980]] and although they did not make it through the group stage, their qualification to the then eight-team [[UEFA European Championship|tournament]] gave them a position in the top eight European football nations that year. Greece did not qualify for another major tournament until the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] and after an undefeated qualifying campaign, they produced a poor performance in the final tournament, losing all three group matches without scoring.\n\n[[UEFA Euro 2004]] marked a high point in Greece's football history when they were crowned [[UEFA European Championship#Finalists|European champions]] in only their second participation in the tournament. Dismissed as rank outsiders before the tournament, the team defeated some of the favourites in the competition including defending European champions [[France national football team|France]] and hosts [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]. During the tournament, Greece defeated the hosts in both the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Group A#Portugal vs Greece|opening game]] of the tournament and again in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final|final]]. Their triumph earned them a place in the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup]].\n\nIn the decade after the 2004 victory, Greece qualified for the final tournaments of all but one major competitions entered, reaching the [[UEFA Euro 2012 knockout phase#Germany vs Greece|quarter-finals]] at the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Costa Rica vs Greece|round of 16]] at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. During that period, they occupied a place in the top 20 of the [[FIFA World Rankings]] for all but four months, and reached an all-time high of eighth in the world from April to June 2008, as well as in October 2011.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Football in Greece}}\n[[File:Greece football team Inter-Allied Games 1919.jpg|thumb|180px|The national team for the [[Inter-Allied Games]] in [[Paris]], 1919.]]\n[[File:Greece national football team 1920 Olympics.jpg|thumb|180px|Greek squad for the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]].]]\n\n===First years===\nThe first appearance of a Greek national football team was at the [[1906 Intercalated Games]] in [[Athens]]. Later, the Greek team participated in the [[Inter-Allied Games]] in [[Paris]], following the end of [[World War I]], and in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] of [[Antwerp]] (recognized as first official by [[FIFA]]). A notable figure during these years was [[Giorgos Kalafatis]], player and later manager of the team.\n\n===1970 World Cup near miss===\nDuring the next decades, the Greek team did not manage to have any success, despite the passion of the Greek people for football. The country's economical and social problems after [[World War II]], did not allow successful preparation of the national team.\n\nAt its best moment, Greece narrowly missed qualifying for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]], despite a good quality team, including some of the greatest-ever Greek players, such as [[Mimis Domazos]], [[Giorgos Sideris]], [[Giorgos Koudas]] and [[Mimis Papaioannou]].\n\n===Euro 1980===\n[[File:Alketas Panagoulias (1986).jpg|thumb|180px|[[Alketas Panagoulias]] led Greece to the [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].'']]\n\nGreece, under the guidance of [[Alketas Panagoulias]], made its first appearance in a major tournament at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]] in Italy, after [[UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying|qualifying]] top of a group that included the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] and [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], both world football powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sansimera.gr/articles/277|title=Greece is in the Euro, for the first time, 1980|publisher=sansimera.gr|language=Greek}}</ref> In the final tournament, Greece was drawn into group A with [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]], the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], and [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. In their first game, Greece held the Dutch until the only goal of the game was scored with a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] by [[Kees Kist|Kist]], in the 65th minute. Three days later Greece played Czechoslovakia in [[Rome]]. After holding the Czechoslovakians 1\u20131 at the end the first half, Greece eventually lost 3\u20131. In their last game, Greece earned a 0\u20130 draw against eventual winners West Germany, concluding what was considered a decent overall performance in the team's maiden presence in a final phase of any football competition.\n\n===1994 World Cup===\n\nThe team's success in qualifying for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] in the United States, marked the first time they had made it to the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/stili/h-mixani-tou-xronou/article/1009276/o-mahlas-esteile-tin-ellada-sto-proto-tis-moyntial-vid|title=Machlas sent Greece to its first World Cup!|publisher=gazzetta.gr|language=Greek}}</ref> Greece finished first and undefeated in their [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying group]], surpassing [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in the final game. In the final tournament Greece were drawn into [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] with [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]], and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. After the successful qualifying campaign, expectations back in Greece were high as no one could imagine the oncoming astounding failure. Most notable reason for this complete failure was the fact that legendary coach [[Alketas Panagoulias]] opted to take a squad full of those players \u2013 though most of them aging and out of form \u2013 that helped the team in the qualifying instead of new emerging talents seeing it as a reward for their unprecedented success. Furthermore, they had the disadvantage of being drawn into a \"[[group of death]]\", with runners-up at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] Argentina, later semifinalists Bulgaria, and Nigeria, one of the strongest African teams. It is worth mentioning that all players of the squad, including the three goalkeepers, took part in those three games, something very rare. This tournament was humiliating for the Greek squad, though it is understandable given its first maiden appearance. In their first game against Argentina at [[Foxboro Stadium]] just outside Boston, they lost 4\u20130. Four days later Greece suffered another 4\u20130 blow from Bulgaria at [[Soldier Field]] in Chicago, and then, in what would be their final game, they lost to Nigeria 2\u20130 at Foxboro Stadium again. In the end, Greece were eliminated in the first round by losing all three games, scoring no goals and conceding ten.\n\n===Near misses===\nGreece failed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 96|Euro 1996]] finishing third in the group behind [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. In their [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1998 World Cup qualifying tournament]] the team finished only one point shy of second-placed [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] after a 0\u20130 draw by the eventual Group winners, the [[Denmark national football team|Danish]]. In their [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|Euro 2000 qualifying group]], Greece finished again in third place, two points behind second-placed [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in a highly disappointing campaign that saw the team lose at home to [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]]. In the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2002 World Cup qualifying]] Greece finished a disappointing fourth in their group behind [[England national football team|England]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Finland national football team|Finland]], which led to the sacking of coach [[Vassilis Daniil|Vasilis Daniil]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sport-retro.gr/ellada-germania-2-4-ethniki-germany-apovoli-vasilis-daniil/|title=The misconduct that \"dismantled the National Team\"|publisher=sport-retro.gr|language=Greek}}</ref> replaced by [[Otto Rehhagel]]. Highlights of the campaign included a 5\u20131 defeat in Finland and the 2\u20132 draw that followed in England, the first two games of the soon to become legendary German coach at the reins of the Greek national team.\n\n===European Champions: Euro 2004 triumph===\n[[File:Greece 2004 lineup.png|thumb|left|160px|Greece line-up in [[Euro 2004]]]]\n[[File:Tsiartas.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Vassilios Tsiartas|Vasilis Tsiartas]]]]\n[[File:Theodoros Zagorakis.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Theodoros Zagorakis|Thodoris Zagorakis]], captain of the national team and \"player of the tournament\" in Euro 2004.]]\n\n====Qualification====\nGreece started the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 6|qualification]] campaign with defeats at home to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and away to [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], both with a 2\u20130 scoreline. The team went on to win their remaining six games, including a 1\u20130 away win over Spain in [[Zaragoza]], securing first place in the group and an appearance in the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]] finals for the first time in 24 years.\n\n====Before the tournament====\nGreece were the second-least favorite in the competition to win, with [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] being the least favorite. Greece were also considered as outsiders and underdogs and were given odds of 150\u20131 of winning before the tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4021041.stm|title=Greece defy the odds at Euro 2004|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=20 December 2004}}</ref> They were drawn in Group A, ending up with [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], Spain and [[Russia national football team|Russia]], a \"group of death\"; Portugal, hosts and favourites to win, Spain, former European champions, and Russia, who won the first-ever Euro as the Soviet Union. Very few people expected Greece to proceed to the quarter-finals, let alone win the tournament.\n\n====Group stage====\nIn the opening match against hosts Portugal Greece achieved a surprise 2\u20131 victory,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/football/06/12/euro.greece/index.html|title=Greece shock hosts in Euro opener|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 June 2004}}</ref> receiving the nickname \"pirate ship\" (\u03a4\u03bf \u03a0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc) used by Greek sportscasters in reference to the floating ship used in the tournament's opening ceremony. Greece won with a 25-yard strike by [[Giorgos Karagounis]] and a penalty by [[Angelos Basinas]]. Four days later, Greece stunned Spain in front of a largely Spanish crowd with a 1\u20131 draw after being down 1\u20130 at half time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/3787467.stm|title=Greece 1-1 Spain, Euro 2004|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 June 2004}}</ref> Greece fell behind from a defensive lapse, which allowed [[Fernando Morientes]] to score. However a sublime diagonal pass by playmaker [[Vassilios Tsiartas|Vasilis Tsiartas]] allowed [[Angelos Charisteas]] to score an equaliser in the second half, giving Greece hope of qualifying. In the final group match Greece fell behind 2\u20130 to Russia (who were already eliminated) within the first ten minutes of the game but managed to pull one back through [[Zisis Vryzas]] and thus progressed to the next round, at the expense of Spain, on goals scored. [[Dmitri Kirichenko]] had the chance to eliminate Greece in the final minutes of this match, but his stretched effort squeezed just wide.\n\n====Quarter-final====\nIn the quarter-finals Greece faced off with the undefeated and reigning champions [[France national football team|France]]. At 65 minutes Greece took the lead. Angelos Basinas played a perfect pass to captain [[Theodoros Zagorakis|Thodoris Zagorakis]], who flicked the ball high in the air, past veteran French defender [[Bixente Lizarazu]], and sent a perfect cross to [[Angelos Charisteas]] for the header and goal. Greece held on to win despite a late French onslaught, with close efforts by [[Thierry Henry]], thus knocking France out of Euro 2004 and becoming the first team ever to defeat both the hosts and defending champions in the same tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/stili/h-mixani-tou-xronou/article/763993/ellada-gallia-1-0-sto-euro-2004|title=Greece - France 1-0 at Euro 2004|publisher=gazzetta.gr|language=Greek}}</ref>\n\n====Semi-final====\nGreece reached the semifinals to face the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], who were the only team to defeat all of their opponents to that point. The Czech record included a convincing 3\u20132 win over the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], a 2\u20131 win over [[Germany national football team|Germany]], and a 3\u20130 win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in the quarter-finals. At this stage in the tournament the Czechs were favourites to take the trophy. The game began nervously for Greece, as the Czech Republic applied much pressure. [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Rosick\u00fd]] hit the bar in the opening minutes, and [[Jan Koller]] had several efforts saved by [[Antonios Nikopolidis|Antonis Nikopolidis]].

In the third match against heavily favoured Argentina, Greece needed a combination of results to advance to the next round. As expected, in what would be his final game as Greece's national team head coach, [[Otto Rehhagel]] conjured up a very defensive-minded strategy, leaving [[Georgios Samaras]] with nearly all offensive responsibilities as the lone striker. The strategy nearly paid off in the second half with the score still locked at 0\u20130 when Samaras beat the last Argentine defender on a quick long-ball counter-attack but curled a rushed shot just wide of the far post. The Greeks held the Argentines scoreless until the 77th minute but ultimately lost 2\u20130, finishing third in Group B.\n\nGreece moved from 13th to 12th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] following the tournament. Russia, Croatia and France dropped lower than Greece while Uruguay and Chile jumped ahead of the Greeks.\n\n====Transition from Rehhagel to Santos====\n[[File:20150616 - Portugal - Italie - Gen\u00e8ve - Fernando Santos.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]]]]\n\nTwenty-four hours removed from Greece's World Cup loss to Argentina, Otto Rehhagel stepped away from his post as Greek national team manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8755226.stm|title=World Cup 2010: Otto Rehhagel quits as Greece coach|date=24 June 2010|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> Eight days later a new era in Greek football was ushered in as the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] named former [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[PAOK FC|PAOK]] boss [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]] the new manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8780517.stm|title=World Cup 2012 (sic): Fernando Santos named new Greece coach|date=1 July 2010|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> Under Santos the Greeks immediately went to work on an unprecedented streak of success, setting a senior-club record by going unbeaten in Santos' first seventeen matches as manager. While Greece's proficiency in stifling opposition attacks seemed to wane toward the end of Rehhagel's tenure, the emergence of Santos seemed to galvanize Greek defending once more. Through seven international friendlies and ten Euro 2012 qualifiers, the Greeks kept nine [[clean sheet]]s and conceded just one goal in each of the remaining eight contests. From start to end of their unbeaten run, Santos' national side moved from No. 12 to No. 8 in FIFA's world rankings, equaling the highest mark in history credited by FIFA to Greece. Only one match from their streak featured a team (other than Greece) that appeared at the 2010 World Cup, a 1\u20130 defeat of Serbia in [[Belgrade]].\n\n===Euro 2012===\n\n====Qualifying====\nWith its late-game comeback victory over [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] in October 2011, Greece padded its historic football tournament r\u00e9sum\u00e9, most importantly by sealing an automatic berth into [[UEFA Euro 2012|UEFA's 2012 European Football Championship tournament]]. For the second time in team history the national side won its qualifying group for a major football tournament without a single loss incurred, as Greece also went undefeated in [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA \u2013 Group 5)|1994 World Cup qualifiers]]. Adding to its [[UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying Group 6|1980]], [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 6|2004]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group C|2008]] Euro qualifying campaigns, the Georgia triumph marked the fifth time overall that Greece has won its qualification group for a major tournament. Although their tendency to produce positive results remained steady throughout qualifying, so too did the Greeks' proclivity to start games slowly and concede early goals. This habit would plague the Greeks through qualifying and eventually tarnish their Euro 2012 performances.\n\nOver two qualifying contests, Greece trailed Georgia on the scoreboard for 130 of 180 minutes and still managed to grab four of six possible points in the standings by way of three late strikes. Goals scored in the dying minutes of games, often coming from defenders, became somewhat of a Greek signature on [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group F|Group F's table]]. In fact Greece was able to take and keep a first-half lead just once in ten games, the 3\u20131 home defeat of [[Malta national football team|Malta]] which was [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying#Seedings|ranked 50th]] of 53 teams in Europe. In Malta, a last-second tie-breaking strike from defender [[Vasilis Torosidis]] pocketed a crucial extra two points in the standings for Greece, the same number of points it held over [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] at the end of qualifying. Despite allowing weaker teams in the group to bring the game to them, the Greeks admirably held powerful Croatia scoreless through two meetings and deservedly won Group F four days after a decisive 2\u20130 home win versus the second-place Croats. [[Theofanis Gekas|Fanis Gekas]], who retired from national team service in 2010 after Fernando Santos' third game as manager, came out of retirement in time to contribute a goal to the result. Gekas was eventually included in Santos's 23-man Euro 2012 roster, leaving out Euro 2004 hero [[Angelos Charisteas]] who scored the group-clinching goal in the aforementioned Greek qualifying victory in Georgia.\n\n====Group stage in Poland====\n[[File:Greece team POL-GRE 8-6-2012.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Greek players singing the [[Hymn to Liberty|Greek national anthem]] in [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] opening match against the hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] (1\u20131).]]\n\n\"Shades of 2004\" was a commonly perceived theme regarding the buildup to Euro 2012 for the Greeks and their progression through the tournament. As in 2004 Greece was drawn into the same group as the host nation, [[Poland national football team|Poland]] on this occasion, and also had the pressure of playing in the tournament's opening match. Two familiar foes from its 2004 championship run, [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], joined Greece and Poland in Group A on 2 December 2011 at the tournament's final draw in Kiev. Upon drawing the lowest-ranked teams from Pots 1 and 2 as well as the second-lowest from Pot 4, Greece's prospects of passing the group stage at Euro 2012 were given a boost.\n\nIdeas of steering \"To Piratiko\" to a dream start in host-nation territory as Greece did in Portugal eight years before, rapidly turned sour during the opening match's first half. From the outset the Greeks appeared uncomfortable holding the ball for long spells and seemed content to allow hosts Poland to push numbers forward with the ball, hoping to score through counter-attacks. However, Poland made the most of its early possession, as top scorer [[Robert Lewandowski]] converted a header from a goal line cross past a scurrying [[Kostas Chalkias]]. Hope and momentum continued to tip in favor of Poland when [[Sokratis Papastathopoulos]] received his second yellow card of the game in just the 44th minute from Spanish referee [[Carlos Velasco Carballo]]. The Greeks, however, began to boss the game after halftime while playing down a man. [[Dimitris Salpingidis]] made the greatest impact on the game for Greece as a second-half substitute, making brilliant penetrating runs behind the Polish defense, eventually bringing the game level 1\u20131 on a mistake by Poland keeper [[Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny]]. Salpingidis was then responsible for levelling up the numbers for the Greeks when Szcz\u0119sny made a red-card foul on Salpingidis' breakaway attempt on goal in the 68th minute. But Greek captain [[Giorgos Karagounis]]' subsequent penalty kick was turned away by substitute keeper [[Przemys\u0142aw Tyto\u0144]]. A second goal by Salpingidis was disallowed as he was assisted by an offside [[Kostas Fortounis]], denying Greece's best opportunity to take three points from what ended as an improbable 1\u20131 draw.\n\nThe Czech Republic exploited Greece's weakness at the left-defender position early in the second group stage match, notching two goals in the first six minutes. Just as Poland had, the Czechs repeatedly penetrated the Greek back line behind left-side defender [[Jos\u00e9 Holebas|Jos\u00e9 Cholevas]], scoring on a through-ball and a cross from Cholevas' side. [[Petr \u010cech]]'s gaffe on a [[Georgios Samaras]] cross in the second half turned into a gift goal for [[Theofanis Gekas|Fanis Gekas]]. The Czechs then eased off on their early pressure, opting to sit back and guard their lead for much of the second half, but Gekas' goal was too little too late. Greece lost the match 2\u20131, placing them at the foot of Group A in need of a victory over the attack-minded Russians to advance to the knockout rounds.\n\nAfter thrashing the Czech Republic 4\u20131 and displaying more offensive potency in a 1\u20131 draw with Poland, the Russians were favored to earn the one point they needed to advance against the Greeks, especially since defeating the team in both of the previous two European Championships. However, Greece delivered a trademark 1\u20130 defensive victory and advanced to the Euro 2012 quarterfinals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/16/euro-2012-greece-russia-live|title=Euro 2012: Greece v Russia - as it happened|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> The Greeks scored when Russian defender [[Sergei Ignashevich]] errantly headed a Greece throw-in behind the Russian defense for Giorgos Karagounis to pounce on. Greece's captain sprinted in on goal and struck the ball at the back post under keeper [[Vyacheslav Malafeev]] in first-half stoppage time to send the Russians reeling into the locker rooms. Ignashevich appeared to have conceded an additional golden scoring opportunity for Greece upon tripping Karagounis in the Russian penalty area early in the second half, but referee [[Jonas Eriksson (referee)|Jonas Eriksson]] instead booked Karagounis for what he believed to be [[Diving (association football)|simulation]]. This being Karagounis' second yellow card of the tournament, Greece was to be without its suspended captain in the next round. With that victory, Greece qualified to the quarterfinals for a second time after their successful Euro 2004 campaign.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\n[[File:Gdansk PGE Arena GER-GRE Euro 2012 17.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Greece played against [[German national football team|Germany]] for a place in the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] but they were eliminated after a 4\u20132 loss in the quarter-final match.]]\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Greece met with a [[German national football team|Germany]] side that won all three of its group matches against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[the Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]]. Greece applied very little pressure in the midfield in the opening period, slowing the tempo of the game and affording the Germans the majority of possession. Young [[Sotiris Ninis]] switched off momentarily in defence, allowing German captain [[Philipp Lahm]] to cut infield and open the scoring with a long-distance strike. Yet the Greeks remained calm as in [[Georgios Samaras]] they carried a constant threat. On the counter-attack, they pulled level early in the second half; regaining possession in their defensive third, [[Georgios Fotakis|Giorgos Fotakis]] found [[Dimitris Salpingidis]] streaking 40 yards deep into German territory. Salpingidis delivered a ball five yards in front of goalkeeper [[Manuel Neuer]], which Samaras was able to meet and power underneath Neuer for the equalizer. Twenty minutes later, however, the Germans led 4\u20131. Greece scored an 89th-minute penalty kick by Salpingidis, but the match ended 4\u20132 to the Germans, ending Greece's Euro 2012 campaign.\n\n=== 2014 World Cup ===\n\n====Qualifying====\n[[File:20130814 AT-GR Nationalteam Griechenland 2414.JPG|thumb|300px|Greek national team in 2013]]\n\nTo reach the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] in Brazil, Greece had to contend with a team on the rise in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and a dangerous [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakian]] side seemingly in decline since its memorable 2010 World Cup qualifying and finals performances. [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]], a familiar qualification foe for Greece in its previous two major tournaments ([[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 2|2010 World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group F|Euro 2012]]), joined the fray as well. Ahead of those aforesaid tournaments, Bosnia twice narrowly missed out on its first major international tournament appearance due to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team#Bla\u017eevi\u0107 leads team to World Cup 2010 play-offs|consecutive playoff defeats]] at the hands of Portugal. No playoff would be necessary for Bosnia in 2013, as it [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group G|won its qualifying group]] over Greece on [[goal difference]]. The decisive match was in Bosnia on 22 March, when Greece succumbed to three set-piece goals (two free-kick headers and one penalty miss rebound) in a 3\u20131 defeat. Greece's defense proved rigid throughout qualifying, conceding zero goals in open play. Four goals were allowed by the Greeks in ten games, the first of which was a penalty by Latvia, and yet four goals were too many for a relatively unproductive Greek attack to overcome. Though Greece was shut out just once, the team only managed to score 12 goals, an output Bosnia reached in its second game.\n\nFollowing group play [[Romania national football team|Romania]], which claimed second place over [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in a group dominated by the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]], awaited Greece in a [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Second Round#Matches|two-legged playoff]]. The last time the two sides met in late 2011, Romania came into Greece and dealt [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]] his first defeat as Greece manager in his 18th game at the helm. The Greeks reversed the prior 3\u20131 result in their favour this time, scoring each goal through skillful one-touch passing and finishing. [[Kostas Mitroglou]] accounted for three of Greece's four goals in a 4\u20132 aggregate playoff victory, though none were actual game-winners. [[Dimitris Salpingidis]] notched the game winner in Athens, while the second leg finished 1\u20131 in [[Bucharest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/24907600|title=Greece booked their place at the 2014 World Cup|publisher=bbc.com|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Finals====\n[[File:Arena das Dunas 19062014.JPG|thumb|240px|right|[[Arena das Dunas]] before the Japan vs Greece match.]]\n\n[[Aracaju]] was chosen as the team's base camp for the tournament in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=1/news=team-base-camps-for-brazil-2014-announced-2267880.html |title=Team Base Camps for Brazil 2014 announced|date=31 January 2014|accessdate=28 May 2014|publisher=FIFA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/se/copa-do-mundo/fotos/2014/06/fotos-confira-como-esta-o-batistao-apos-reformas-para-receber-grecia.html|title=Slideshow|accessdate=7 June 2014|publisher=GE Sergipe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/mg/copa-do-mundo/noticia/2014/06/gregos-de-belo-horizonte-prometem-festa-em-jogo-contra-colombia.html | title = Gregos de Belo Horizonte preparam festa para partida contra a Col\u00f4mbia | date = 4 June 2014 |accessdate=7 June 2014|publisher=GE Sergipe | first = Marco Ant\u00f4nio | last = Astoni | language = Portuguese}}</ref> Greece was drawn into [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group C|Group C]] with [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], [[Ivory Coast national football team|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and ultimately created for itself an extraordinarily similar tournament experience as it did two years prior at Euro 2012. The Greeks were put in an early 1\u20130 hole in their first game against a Colombia team whose exuberant fans generated a hostile away environment. Following its historical penchant, Greece thrived playing from behind as the underdog. [[Panagiotis Kone]] narrowly missed equalizing just one minute after Colombia's fifth-minute goal. Trailing 2\u20130 in the 63rd minute, [[Theofanis Gekas|Fanis Gekas]]' header off a cross six yards from an open goal caromed off the crossbar for Greece's best chance of the match. The Colombians proved to be the more clinical finishers, prevailing over the Europeans 3\u20130 despite an even number of goal shots for both teams and a slight possession advantage in Greece's favor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/statistics/id/383299/statistics.html |title=Greece v Colombia|date=14 June 2014|accessdate=1 August 2014|publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref> To stave off the threat of elimination, the Greeks needed to earn at least a point in their second match with Japan, who sat alongside them at the bottom of Group C. The task grew more difficult once two errant slide tackles by captain [[Kostas Katsouranis]] each drew yellow cards and reduced Greece to ten men in the 38th minute. Eight Greek players on the pitch had endured the same scenario against Poland in 2012 and once again their resolve did not break. Japan controlled much of possession in a 0\u20130 draw and remained tied with Greece on points due to poor finishing from close range. The draw made it necessary for Greece to defeat Ivory Coast in its final group match in order to reach the round of 16 for the first time in its history. Unlike its mirror-scenario final group match against Russia in Euro 2012, the Greeks came out as the aggressors from the outset against Ivory Coast. An early injury to center midfielder Panagiotis Kone brought on young [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]' midfielder [[Andreas Samaris]], who would score his first international goal after intercepting a faulty back-pass by an Ivorian defender. Also unlike its 2012 match with Russia, capitalizing on a first half opponent miscue would not be enough to carry Greece to a needed victory. [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]] striker [[Wilfried Bony]] equalized for Ivory Coast in the 73rd minute. The Ivorians promptly adopted Greece's defensive strategy but could not hold out until the game's end. In the first minute of stoppage time, Ivory Coast striker [[Giovanni Sio]] obstructed a Samaras shot by clipping him from behind in the Ivorian penalty area, resulting in a Greek penalty kick which Samaras converted with 30 seconds remaining in the game, to wild celebrations in Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/6/24/5839030/greece-vs-ivory-coast-2014-world-cup-final-score-result|title=Greece vs. Ivory Coast, 2014 World Cup: Final score 2-1, Greece advances on a stoppage time penalty|publisher=sbnation.com|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs Group C runners-up Greece was paired in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Costa Rica vs Greece|round of 16]] with [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] shock winner [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], who won its first-ever World Cup group stage over former world champions Uruguay, Italy and England. Trailing 1\u20130 but dominating possession due in part to a second yellow card to Costa Rican [[\u00d3scar Duarte (Costa Rican footballer)|\u00d3scar Duarte]], the Greeks forced extra time through a [[Sokratis Papastathopoulos]] equalizer ten seconds into stoppage time. This would prove to be the only goal Costa Rica goalkeeper [[Keylor Navas]] would concede in open play throughout the tournament. Navas stayed strong to turn away several significant opportunities for the Greeks throughout the 30 minutes of extra time, including a [[Theofanis Gekas|Fanis Gekas]]' penalty in the game's concluding penalty shootout. Costa Rica claimed its first World Cup knockout stage victory and denied Greece its first by defeating the Greeks 5\u20133 on penalties.\n\n===Euro 2016 qualifying: Reorganization and decline===\n\nThe team appointed [[Claudio Ranieri]] as head coach in July 2014. He was sacked in November of the same year after a shocking home defeat to the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2835744/Claudio-Ranieri-sacked-manager-Greece-following-shock-defeat-Faroe-Islands-Euro-2016-qualifier.html|title=Claudio Ranieri sacked as manager of Greece following shock defeat to Faroe Islands in Euro 2016 qualifier|publisher=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> [[Sergio Markari\u00e1n]] was appointed in his place, but he too has come under fire, especially after a second loss at the hand of the Faroe Islands and the team's terrible performances in the remaining [[UEFA Euro 2016]] qualifying. The team's form after September 2014 proved to be abysmal, with no wins in over a year, losing to [[Romania national football team|Romania]], the Faroe Islands (twice), [[Finland national football team|Finland]], [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and even [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] in a friendly match over that period. Greece finished in bottom place in their Euro Qualifying group, earning just one victory against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in the final round, and failing to qualify for the tournament. Greece, along with [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were the only nations from [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying#Qualifying group stage|Pot 1]] not to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 2016|finals]]. Those three had taken part in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. Incidentally, the three teams would also fail to qualify for the World Cup in 2018.\n\n===2018 World Cup qualifying: resurgence===\n\nIn attempting to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Greece would suffer a second successive failure to reach a major tournament. They finished second in Group H of the European qualifying stages, nine points behind runaway leaders [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and only two points clear of third placed [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Greece began their qualification campaign well with three straight wins against [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]], [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] and [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], only conceding one goal in the process, and they remained unbeaten for seven matches after drawing their next four games; two of which ended 1\u20131 in succession against Bosnia and Belgium, and the other two ended 0\u20130 in the return fixtures against Bosnia and Estonia. Greece then lost 2\u20131 to group leaders Belgium, but managed to beat Cyprus and Gibraltar to ensure second place in the group, and qualification for the play-off round.\n\nGreece were subsequently drawn against Croatia in the play-off round, where they were knocked out over two legs; a 4\u20131 away defeat set the tone for Greece's campaign, and in the second leg they drew a blank in a 0\u20130 stalemate against the Croats to signify the end of their World Cup hopes. [[Kostas Mitroglou]] finished as Greece's top scorer throughout their campaign, scoring six goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/european-qualifiers/season=2018/teams/team=49/squad/#/|title=Greece 2018 Squad Info|work=UEFA|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2020 Euro qualifying: small rise, fall and promising finish===\n\nGreece's qualification campaign for the [[UEFA Euro 2020]] started well with a 2\u20130 away win against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]] and an away match against Bosnia and Herzegovina that saw Bosnia take a 2\u20130 lead before half time, but Greece scored two goals, leading to a 2\u20132 draw. However, they lost the following two matches, which were both at home, being defeated 0\u20133 by [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and succumbing to a shocking 2\u20133 defeat to [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]]. It got worse for them after a 1\u20130 away loss to [[Finland national football team|Finland]] and a home draw with [[Liechtenstein national football team results|Liechtenstein]]. Due to these disappointing results, [[John van 't Schip]] decided not to call some of the leading members at that time, such as [[Sokratis Papastathopoulos]] and [[Kostas Manolas]], for the remaining games. These decisions might be shocking but a young team with passion was built and the Greek team showed a massive improvement in the attacking and pressing style of play. In the final three games Greece achieved successive victories with a 2\u20131 win against the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team]], a 1\u20130 away victory over Armenia and recovering from a goal down to win 2\u20131 against Finland at home. Greece finished third in the final table but was still not enough to earn a play-off place.\n\n==Stadiums==\n[[File:Argentina Vs Italy 3-0 2004 Olympics Athens.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The [[Karaiskakis Stadium]] in [[Piraeus]], the home ground of Greece from 2004 until 2017.]]\nTraditionally, Greece have spent most of their history playing their home matches in different stadiums primarily in or near [[Athens]], but also in a number of other cities around the country. The home ground of the national team was the [[Karaiskakis Stadium]] in [[Piraeus]], since its reconstruction in 2004 until 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/ellada/ethniki_elladas/ektos-attikhs-oi-agwnes-ths-ethnikhs-elladas.4946988.html4|title=Termination of Karaiskakis Stadium for the Greece national football team|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince their first international game in 1929 and for the next 33 years Greece constantly used as home ground the [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]]. Their first home match away from it was played at the [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]] in 1962, while the Karaiskakis Stadium was used for a first time in 1964, when it was renovated. In 1966, the [[Kaftanzoglio Stadium]] in [[Thessaloniki]] became the first stadium outside of the Athens area to be used. Since then all these stadiums were alternately used until the early 1980s, while some other stadiums were inaugurated by the national team such as the Thessaloniki's [[Toumba Stadium]] and [[Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium|Harilaou Stadium]] in 1975 and 1977 respectively, along with Greece's first visits in 1976 to grounds outside of the two major cities, such as the [[Kostas Davourlis Stadium|Panachaiki Stadium]] in [[Patras]] and the [[Anthi Karagianni Stadium|Kavala Stadium]] in [[Kavala]]. In 1982, the [[Georgios Kamaras Stadium]] was added to the list of home grounds for the national team, the first in Athens out of the three major stadiums.\n\nOn 16 November 1983, the newly built [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]], to date the largest stadium in the country, housed the national team for a first time in a qualifier for [[UEFA Euro 1984]] against Denmark and served as its primary home ground for the rest of the 1980s and the 1990s, until 2001 when it was closed for renovations. Meanwhile, a large number of matches was held in various stadiums including old choices and some new in provincial cities all over the country, something that did not change neither in the early 2000s, when the Athens Olympic Stadium was almost abandoned. Since 2004 and the use mainly of the Karaiskakis Stadium, very few of Greece's matches have occasionally been played in other stadiums as well. They returned to [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|OAKA]] in 2018 for a friendly against Switzerland and announced they will play their home matches for the new UEFA Nations League there, as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/ellada/ethniki_elladas/sto-olympiako-stadio-h-ethnikh-elladas-gia-to-nations-league.5259766.html|title=In Olympic Stadium the matches of Greece national team for the Nations League|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=13 July 2018}}</ref> For the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers, they were slated split time between OAKA in Athens, and the [[Pankritio Stadium]] in [[Heraklion]] on the island of [[Crete]], but with the latter requiring upgrades to be fit for FIFA standards, the entire campaign was held in Athens.\n\n==Team image==\n{{Commons|Greece national football team kits}}\nGreece's traditional colours are blue and white, originating from the [[Flag of Greece|Greek flag]]. Although blue was used as the home kit since the team's inception, white became the primary home color following [[UEFA Euro 2004]]. In recent decades, Greece wear either a set of white jerseys, shorts and socks, or an all-blue combination. Formerly, the kit consisted of a combination of blue jerseys and white shorts and vice versa. Meanwhile, Greece's kit has occasionally featured stripes, crosses or other designs, as well as various values of blue.\n\nOn 10 April 2013, the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] announced a partnership with American manufacturer [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], which is Greece's current official supplier, with their first kit debuting on 7 June 2013 in the away match to [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nikeinc.com/news/nike-and-hellenic-football-federation-announce-partnership|title=Nike and Hellenic Football Federation announce partnership|date=10 April 2013|accessdate=3 July 2014|publisher=[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]|language=English, Greek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/ellada/ethniki_elladas/anakoinwthhke-h-symfwnia-ths-epo-me-th-nike.2204732.html|title=The agreement with NIKE was announced|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref> On 4 March 2014, Greece unveiled their latest kit also worn at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nikeinc.com/news/greece-unveils-2014-national-team-kit-with-nike#/inline/27802|title=Greece unveils 2014 national team kit with Nike|date=4 March 2014|accessdate=3 July 2014|publisher=[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]}}</ref>\n\nThe crest (''\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03cc\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf'' means \"national sign\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/diethnes-podosfairo/kremasan-thn-fanela-me-to-ethnoshmo.2960968.html|script-title=el:\u0397 \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03cc\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek}}</ref> which is used in the kit, is the official emblem of the national team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ethnikiomada|title=Greece national football team Official Facebook page|publisher=facebook.com}}</ref>\n\n===Kit manufacturers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The team is often called ''Galanolefki'' (Sky blue-white) due to the use of the colours of the [[Flag of Greece|Greek flag]] as kit colours. Both nicknames are used for the country's national teams in other sports as well.\n\nDuring the opening ceremony at the [[UEFA Euro 2004]], which took place right before the inaugural game of the tournament between Greece and hosts [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], a replica of a 16th-century ship was used referring to the expeditions of the Portuguese explorers of that time. Greek radio sports journalist [[Georgios Helakis]], while broadcasting the opening match, commented that ''\"since the Portuguese team appeared in such a ship, it's time for us to become pirates and steal the victory\"''. Eventually, Greece beat the hosts and the team was described as ''Piratiko'', meaning the 'Pirate ship', which emerged as the new nickname of the team repeated at every win during the tournament. Especially after the Greek win in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final|final]] to Portugal, the new nickname was established to commemorate the coronation of Greece as [[UEFA European Championship|European champions]].\n\n=== Rivalries ===\n{{main|Greece\u2013Turkey football rivalry}}\nGreece has a historical rivalry with [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]; having played them a total of 13 times, winning three, drawing three and losing seven games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/turkey/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Greece/|title=Turkey national football team: record v Greece|website=www.11v11.com|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> Both countries have been described as \"punching above their weight\"; with Greece winning [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] despite being classified as underdogs prior to the competition, and Turkey followed-up their [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup semi-final appearance in 2002]] by advancing to the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], where they were knocked out by [[Germany national football team|Germany]].

As a child, she trained as an Olympic gymnast and as a dancer. Her father died when she was 6. She moved to Texas with her family as a teenager in 1992 where she lived for one year. She and her family moved back to Guadalajara, and in 1994 Elis moved to Quer\u00e9taro Mexico to her aunt's. \nShe shortened her name to Elis, inspired by [[Elis Regina]].\n\n== Learning music ==\nAfter moving to Quer\u00e9taro, her aunt and uncle started her in music lessons, as all of her cousins studied music. Elis has been known to say that what she really wanted was to continue with her dancing in the hopes of becoming a professional dancer. She learned to play the Saxophone and music in general, but by a twist of fate some of her friends signed her up (unbeknownst to her) for a singing contest at school in Quer\u00e9taro, where she ended up in second place. It was there she realized that she wanted a career as a singer.\nElis then moved back to Guadalajara where, a year later, she started singing for the local band La Verdad No Importa, from where she was later fired because she \"didn\u2019t sing that good\". After that rejection she took singing and guitar lessons in order to start writing her own songs.\nIn 2000, after being in a couple of more local bands, she started formal music studies at CEDART for a couple of years. While studying there, she held a job doing press and PR for different concert promoters in Guadalajara.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 2002-2003: First demos ===\nShe interrupted her studies in 2002 and moved to [[London]] England for one year, where she began writing some of the songs she would later release as Elis Paprika. She held a job as a waitress during her stay in London. She returned to Guadalajara M\u00e9xico in 2003 where she started a band called The Paprikas, with a local musician named Raul Velazquez (not to be confused with Ra\u00fal \"Rul\" Velazquez, who would later be Elis\u2019 guitar player in The Black Pilgrims). At that point people began referring to her as \"Elis from the Paprikas\" or \"Elis Paprika\", the name she later adopted. After a few tries with The Paprikas, Elis recorded a demo for the song \"Sunny Day\", working with Shaboomy (later guitar player for [[Azul Violeta]]), and Eric Diaz, guitar player and bass player respectively from the band The Waitress<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/thewaitress The Waitress official band page]</ref> from Guadalajara M\u00e9xico. The Waitress was originally Elis\u2019 first solo project. The name of the band was inspired by her time working as a waitress in London and Guadalajara before making music. Once she began to be recognized as \"Elis Paprika\" and making more music apart from her project, Elis left The Waitress. The other members of The Waitress continued without her.\n\n=== 2004: ''Elis Paprika'' ===\nIn February 2004, Elis\u2019 showed the demo of \"Sunny Day\", to Luke Castillo, who was then playing guitar and singing for the band Becker. Luke liked what he heard and they started working together, and this is where Elis Paprika was formally established, with Luke Castillo on Guitar, Richo Acosta on Guitar, Chumino on Bass, and Chicho (also playing with the band Plastiko), on Drums. With this lineup, Elis recorded the demo for the song \"Give Me Love\". \nChicho left the band and Arnold Benz briefly became the drummer. They recorded demo versions of the songs \"Bitch\" and \"Texas\" with him.\nArnold left the band and Richo Acosta called Willy Gonzalez, from another band he played in, to take over the drums.\nLater, Jorge \"Gordo\" Miramontes came in on bass after Chumino left the band. At this point, and with this lineup, they all decided to work as a band instead of Elis being a solo artist. Elis Paprika then became the name of the band. \nTheir first live show as Elis Paprika took place in Guadalajara Jalisco M\u00e9xico, on December 14, 2004 at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara.\n\n=== 2005-2006: ''Give Me Love'' ===\nElis Paprika began playing in several venues and quickly ascended in Guadalajara's rock scene. They played Sol Radiante Festival, Zapopum Festival, and the Hard Rock Live at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara on several occasions. It was during one of these performances that people from Suave Records became interested in Elis Paprika, signing them in 2005. Under this label, Elis Paprika released the record ''Give Me Love'' in 2006, produced by Luke Castillo and Richo Acosta, and was licensed to [[Sony Music Mexico]] for its distribution in Mexico.\n\nThe first single, \"Give Me Love\", had a fast and big acceptance, and consequently Elis was invited to play at the Festival Vive Latino in 2006 and [[Corona Capital]], also in 2006. In August of that same year, Elis Paprika was named \"Band of the Month\" on [[MTV]]. After this, MTV invited Elis Paprika to perform live for a recording of the program ''Alerta''.\n\nThe song \"No Puedo\" was released as the second single in October 2006. In November 2006 [[Julieta Venegas]] invited Elis Paprika to play on her first [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] performance in Mexico City.\n\nAs all of this was taking place, contractual problems began to surface between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records.\n\n=== 2007\u20132008: ''EP2'', and Juan Gabriel tribute ===\nAfter the success of ''Give Me Love'', problems between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records increased to the point where the impulse the band had, came to a halt.\n\nIn early 2007, Elis requested Suave Records to release her, resulting in a lawsuit.\n\nLuke Castillo decided to leave the band to concentrate on his other band Becker, and Ram\u00f3n \"Zacky\" Velarde took his place in the band.\n\nElis recorded her voice for the original score of short film ''Jacinta'', winner of the Festival de Cine de Morelia, from director Karla Casta\u00f1eda, with music by Gilberto Cervantes. ''Jacinta'' was also shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] that same year.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1206015/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast IMDb page for Jacinta Full Cast and Crew, mentioning Elis Paprika as singer for original score]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.moreliafilmfest.com/ficha.php?id=991 |title=Morelia Film Festival official web page |access-date=2012-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513191359/http://moreliafilmfest.com/ficha.php?id=991 |archive-date=2012-05-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh18GDdwhTc Jacinta Short Film. Final credits mention Elis Paprika as \"Vocal Interpretation\"]</ref>\n\nElis Paprika recorded ''EP2'' in 2007, but this second record did not see a formal release due to the lawsuit with Suave Records. EP2 was released that same year, but only through free download on the [[Internet]].\n\nEarly in 2008, Elis Paprika was invited to be a part of the [[Juan Gabriel]] tribute album called ''Amo al Divo de Ju\u00e1rez''. For this, Elis recorded her own version of the Juan Gabriel song \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\". The record came out, with her version of the song as one of the official singles.\n\nElis Paprika played on December 8, 2006 for a [[Green Peace]] event in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in a campaign against illegal fishing in protected waters.<ref>[https://www.proceso.com.mx/223794/garantizan-elizondo-y-cardenas-la-proteccion-del-golfo-de-california-greenpeace Link to article by Proceso Magazine about this Greenpeace event in Puerto Vallarta]</ref>\n\nIn late 2008 Elis and Suave Records settled their lawsuit, and the band was released from their contract with Suave Records, allowing Elis to concentrate on her band and performances. She signed under new management with Zepeda Bros.\n\n=== 2009: ''Express'' ===\nAt the beginning of 2009, \"Gordo\" quit the band, and was replaced by Omar \u201cLa Do\u00f1a\u201d Gil on bass, who stayed with the band until early 2010.\n\nElis Paprika began 2009 with new live performances and writing new songs, and in May of that year, entered the studio to record the songs that would eventually become her album \"Maldito\", produced by Guido Laris. Originally intended to be released as two separate EP's, the songs were recorded at Montecristo Studios in Mexico City, but once they were ready, it wouldn't be released until some time later, due to differences with her management over the way to handle promotion as an independent release, or through a label.\n\nThat summer, Sony Music M\u00e9xico invited Elis Paprika to be a part of ''Tributo A: Ana Jos\u00e9 Nacho (Mecano)'', a Mecano Tribute record, where she recorded her version of the song \"No Tienes Nada Que Perder\".\n\n[[Juan Gabriel]] invited Elis to perform live with him on one of his concerts at [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] in Mexico City, to sing her version of \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\" live.<ref>Video of Elis Paprika performing with Juan Gabriel at Auditorio Nacional Mexico [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9BXKpo83zc]</ref>\n\nAfter not being able to release the songs she recorded that May, Elis Paprika entered the studio once more in Guadalajara at Richo Acosta's studio to record new and previously unreleased songs. ''Express'' was released, produced by Richo Acosta, and licensed to EMI Music M\u00e9xico for distribution, in October 2009, being this her first record to officially be promoted since ''Give Me Love'' in 2006. The first single from ''Express'' was \"Tarde o Temprano\".\n\n=== 2010-2011: ''Maldito'' ===\nAfter differences with her bandmates, Elis decided in early 2010, in the middle of promoting ''Express'', not to continue working with the same musicians in her band. They went their separate ways and Elis went back to being a solo artist. This interrupted the promotion of ''Express''.\n \nLuke Castillo came back to play and support Elis on guitars, and had a major role in putting a band back together. Luke invited [[Paul Richards (artist)|Paul Richards]] to play bass, and two other members of the band Aurum from Guadalajara, Vela and Luis Angel, to play guitar and drums respectively.\n \nIn May 2010, Elis moved to Mexico City in order to continue and better the handling of her career and to promote future plans. Working with Zepeda Bros. Elis decided to finally use the songs that had been recorded a year before, and since these songs had been on hold for over a year, it was decided to released them as one LP, instead of the two EPs they were originally meant for. It was because of all the time that these songs were on hold, that she named the LP ''Maldito'', which in Spanish means \"Cursed\".\n\nMeanwhile, Elis began to make new acoustic performances of her songs in unplugged shows, featuring Ernesto \"Arbol\" Licona, and Ana L\u00eda Perez, on guitars. Ernesto Licona has been constantly playing guitar on Elis\u2019 performances ever since.\n \nThat August, Vela and Luis Angel retook their labors with Aurum, and Elis invited Raul \"Rul\" Velazquez to play guitar, and Jimmy Strike, from the band Cherry Strike from Guadalajara to play drums. With this lineup, Elis played the 212 Festival by RMX, in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico, on September 12, 2010. This concert marked the beginning of her \"Maldito Tour\".\n\nThat October, after a couple of shows, Jimmy left the band to retake activities with Cherry Strike, and Cachi Zazueta became the permanent drummer.\n \nMaldito was officially released in late November 2010 under Zepeda Bros., Warner Chappell M\u00e9xico, and Dr\u00e1gora Records. It hit stores nationwide in Mexico, and on [[iTunes]] internationally.\n\nThe Maldito Tour went on until mid-2011, reaching most of Mexico. During this tour, Elis played the [[Vive Latino]] Festival for the second time, on March 8, 2011.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esCfj-psnao Video of Elis Paprika performing at Vive Latino 2011]</ref> Maldito became the record to reposition her in Mexico's Rock scene.\n\nAt the end of the Maldito Tour, in July 2011, Elis ended her working relationship with, her then management office, Zepeda Bros. and continued as a completely independent artist, handling her own office. Elis recorded the single \"Love Love Love\" at Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco, produced by Luke Castillo, which was officially released on August 4, 2011, initially as a free download through [[SoundCloud]], as a \"thank you\" to all of her fans for the success of Maldito. \"Love Love Love\" is part of the Chilean movie ''Que Pena Tu Boda''{{'}}s soundtrack, as the main credits theme,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924354/soundtrack?ref_=tt_ql_trv_7 IMDb page for Que Pena Tu Boda soundtracks]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |title=Que Pena Tu Boda the movie\u2019s official web page |access-date=2012-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904215142/http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> making this Elis' debut in South America.\n\nIn October 2011, Elis along with Rul and Cachi, from her band, got together in Guadalajara to begin writing ''Animal''. That same month, they entered Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco to record the songs, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez.\n\n=== 2012-2013: ''Animal'' ===\nElis released ''Animal'' in February 2012, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez, under Dr\u00e1gora Records. For this record, her band since the Maldito Tour of 2010-2011, adopted the name The Black Pilgrims. The song \"Animal\" was the first single.\n\nIn January 2012, Luke Castillo left the band once again, to concentrate on studio work, and was replaced by Stepha Campbell on guitars. In July 2012, Paul Richards left the band.

As a child, she trained as an Olympic gymnast and as a dancer. Her father died when she was 6. She moved to Texas with her family as a teenager in 1992 where she lived for one year. She and her family moved back to Guadalajara, and in 1994 Elis moved to Quer\u00e9taro Mexico to her aunt's. \nShe shortened her name to Elis, inspired by [[Elis Regina]].\n\n== Learning music ==\nAfter moving to Quer\u00e9taro, her aunt and uncle started her in music lessons, as all of her cousins studied music. Elis has been known to say that what she really wanted was to continue with her dancing in the hopes of becoming a professional dancer. She learned to play the Saxophone and music in general, but by a twist of fate some of her friends signed her up (unbeknownst to her) for a singing contest at school in Quer\u00e9taro, where she ended up in second place. It was there she realized that she wanted a career as a singer.\nElis then moved back to Guadalajara where, a year later, she started singing for the local band La Verdad No Importa, from where she was later fired because she \"didn\u2019t sing that good\". After that rejection she took singing and guitar lessons in order to start writing her own songs.\nIn 2000, after being in a couple of more local bands, she started formal music studies at CEDART for a couple of years. While studying there, she held a job doing press and PR for different concert promoters in Guadalajara.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 2002-2003: First demos ===\nShe interrupted her studies in 2002 and moved to [[London]] England for one year, where she began writing some of the songs she would later release as Elis Paprika. She held a job as a waitress during her stay in London. She returned to Guadalajara M\u00e9xico in 2003 where she started a band called The Paprikas, with a local musician named Raul Velazquez (not to be confused with Ra\u00fal \"Rul\" Velazquez, who would later be Elis\u2019 guitar player in The Black Pilgrims). At that point people began referring to her as \"Elis from the Paprikas\" or \"Elis Paprika\", the name she later adopted. After a few tries with The Paprikas, Elis recorded a demo for the song \"Sunny Day\", working with Shaboomy (later guitar player for [[Azul Violeta]]), and Eric Diaz, guitar player and bass player respectively from the band The Waitress<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/thewaitress The Waitress official band page]</ref> from Guadalajara M\u00e9xico. The Waitress was originally Elis\u2019 first solo project. The name of the band was inspired by her time working as a waitress in London and Guadalajara before making music. Once she began to be recognized as \"Elis Paprika\" and making more music apart from her project, Elis left The Waitress. The other members of The Waitress continued without her.\n\n=== 2004: ''Elis Paprika'' ===\nIn February 2004, Elis\u2019 showed the demo of \"Sunny Day\", to Luke Castillo, who was then playing guitar and singing for the band Becker. Luke liked what he heard and they started working together, and this is where Elis Paprika was formally established, with Luke Castillo on Guitar, Richo Acosta on Guitar, Chumino on Bass, and Chicho (also playing with the band Plastiko), on Drums. With this lineup, Elis recorded the demo for the song \"Give Me Love\". \nChicho left the band and Arnold Benz briefly became the drummer. They recorded demo versions of the songs \"Bitch\" and \"Texas\" with him.\nArnold left the band and Richo Acosta called Willy Gonzalez, from another band he played in, to take over the drums.\nLater, Jorge \"Gordo\" Miramontes came in on bass after Chumino left the band. At this point, and with this lineup, they all decided to work as a band instead of Elis being a solo artist. Elis Paprika then became the name of the band. \nTheir first live show as Elis Paprika took place in Guadalajara Jalisco M\u00e9xico, on December 14, 2004 at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara.\n\n=== 2005-2006: ''Give Me Love'' ===\nElis Paprika began playing in several venues and quickly ascended in Guadalajara's rock scene. They played Sol Radiante Festival, Zapopum Festival, and the Hard Rock Live at the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] Guadalajara on several occasions. It was during one of these performances that people from Suave Records became interested in Elis Paprika, signing them in 2005. Under this label, Elis Paprika released the record ''Give Me Love'' in 2006, produced by Luke Castillo and Richo Acosta, and was licensed to [[Sony Music Mexico]] for its distribution in Mexico.\n\nThe first single, \"Give Me Love\", had a fast and big acceptance, and consequently Elis was invited to play at the Festival Vive Latino in 2006 and [[Corona Capital]], also in 2006. In August of that same year, Elis Paprika was named \"Band of the Month\" on [[MTV]]. After this, MTV invited Elis Paprika to perform live for a recording of the program ''Alerta''.\n\nThe song \"No Puedo\" was released as the second single in October 2006. In November 2006 [[Julieta Venegas]] invited Elis Paprika to play on her first [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] performance in Mexico City.\n\nAs all of this was taking place, contractual problems began to surface between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records.\n\n=== 2007\u20132008: ''EP2'', and Juan Gabriel tribute ===\nAfter the success of ''Give Me Love'', problems between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records increased to the point where the impulse the band had, came to a halt.\n\nIn early 2007, Elis requested Suave Records to release her, resulting in a lawsuit.\n\nLuke Castillo decided to leave the band to concentrate on his other band Becker, and Ram\u00f3n \"Zacky\" Velarde took his place in the band.\n\nElis recorded her voice for the original score of short film ''Jacinta'', winner of the Festival de Cine de Morelia, from director Karla Casta\u00f1eda, with music by Gilberto Cervantes. ''Jacinta'' was also shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] that same year.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1206015/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast IMDb page for Jacinta Full Cast and Crew, mentioning Elis Paprika as singer for original score]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.moreliafilmfest.com/ficha.php?id=991 |title=Morelia Film Festival official web page |access-date=2012-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513191359/http://moreliafilmfest.com/ficha.php?id=991 |archive-date=2012-05-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh18GDdwhTc Jacinta Short Film. Final credits mention Elis Paprika as \"Vocal Interpretation\"]</ref>\n\nElis Paprika recorded ''EP2'' in 2007, but this second record did not see a formal release due to the lawsuit with Suave Records. EP2 was released that same year, but only through free download on the [[Internet]].\n\nEarly in 2008, Elis Paprika was invited to be a part of the [[Juan Gabriel]] tribute album called ''Amo al Divo de Ju\u00e1rez''. For this, Elis recorded her own version of the Juan Gabriel song \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\". The record came out, with her version of the song as one of the official singles.\n\nElis Paprika played on December 8, 2006 for a [[Green Peace]] event in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in a campaign against illegal fishing in protected waters.<ref>[https://www.proceso.com.mx/223794/garantizan-elizondo-y-cardenas-la-proteccion-del-golfo-de-california-greenpeace Link to article by Proceso Magazine about this Greenpeace event in Puerto Vallarta]</ref>\n\nIn late 2008 Elis and Suave Records settled their lawsuit, and the band was released from their contract with Suave Records, allowing Elis to concentrate on her band and performances. She signed under new management with Zepeda Bros.\n\n=== 2009: ''Express'' ===\nAt the beginning of 2009, \"Gordo\" quit the band, and was replaced by Omar \u201cLa Do\u00f1a\u201d Gil on bass, who stayed with the band until early 2010.\n\nElis Paprika began 2009 with new live performances and writing new songs, and in May of that year, entered the studio to record the songs that would eventually become her album \"Maldito\", produced by Guido Laris. Originally intended to be released as two separate EP's, the songs were recorded at Montecristo Studios in Mexico City, but once they were ready, it wouldn't be released until some time later, due to differences with her management over the way to handle promotion as an independent release, or through a label.\n\nThat summer, Sony Music M\u00e9xico invited Elis Paprika to be a part of ''Tributo A: Ana Jos\u00e9 Nacho (Mecano)'', a Mecano Tribute record, where she recorded her version of the song \"No Tienes Nada Que Perder\".\n\n[[Juan Gabriel]] invited Elis to perform live with him on one of his concerts at [[National Auditorium|Auditorio Nacional]] in Mexico City, to sing her version of \"[[Hasta Que Te Conoc\u00ed]]\" live.<ref>Video of Elis Paprika performing with Juan Gabriel at Auditorio Nacional Mexico [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9BXKpo83zc]</ref>\n\nAfter not being able to release the songs she recorded that May, Elis Paprika entered the studio once more in Guadalajara at Richo Acosta's studio to record new and previously unreleased songs. ''Express'' was released, produced by Richo Acosta, and licensed to EMI Music M\u00e9xico for distribution, in October 2009, being this her first record to officially be promoted since ''Give Me Love'' in 2006. The first single from ''Express'' was \"Tarde o Temprano\".\n\n=== 2010-2011: ''Maldito'' ===\nAfter differences with her bandmates, Elis decided in early 2010, in the middle of promoting ''Express'', not to continue working with the same musicians in her band. They went their separate ways and Elis went back to being a solo artist. This interrupted the promotion of ''Express''.\n \nLuke Castillo came back to play and support Elis on guitars, and had a major role in putting a band back together. Luke invited [[Paul Richards (artist)|Paul Richards]] to play bass, and two other members of the band Aurum from Guadalajara, Vela and Luis Angel, to play guitar and drums respectively.\n \nIn May 2010, Elis moved to Mexico City in order to continue and better the handling of her career and to promote future plans. Working with Zepeda Bros. Elis decided to finally use the songs that had been recorded a year before, and since these songs had been on hold for over a year, it was decided to released them as one LP, instead of the two EPs they were originally meant for. It was because of all the time that these songs were on hold, that she named the LP ''Maldito'', which in Spanish means \"Cursed\".\n\nMeanwhile, Elis began to make new acoustic performances of her songs in unplugged shows, featuring Ernesto \"Arbol\" Licona, and Ana L\u00eda Perez, on guitars. Ernesto Licona has been constantly playing guitar on Elis\u2019 performances ever since.\n \nThat August, Vela and Luis Angel retook their labors with Aurum, and Elis invited Raul \"Rul\" Velazquez to play guitar, and Jimmy Strike, from the band Cherry Strike from Guadalajara to play drums. With this lineup, Elis played the 212 Festival by RMX, in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico, on September 12, 2010. This concert marked the beginning of her \"Maldito Tour\".\n\nThat October, after a couple of shows, Jimmy left the band to retake activities with Cherry Strike, and Cachi Zazueta became the permanent drummer.\n \nMaldito was officially released in late November 2010 under Zepeda Bros., Warner Chappell M\u00e9xico, and Dr\u00e1gora Records. It hit stores nationwide in Mexico, and on [[iTunes]] internationally.\n\nThe Maldito Tour went on until mid-2011, reaching most of Mexico. During this tour, Elis played the [[Vive Latino]] Festival for the second time, on March 8, 2011.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esCfj-psnao Video of Elis Paprika performing at Vive Latino 2011]</ref> Maldito became the record to reposition her in Mexico's Rock scene.\n\nAt the end of the Maldito Tour, in July 2011, Elis ended her working relationship with, her then management office, Zepeda Bros. and continued as a completely independent artist, handling her own office. Elis recorded the single \"Love Love Love\" at Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco, produced by Luke Castillo, which was officially released on August 4, 2011, initially as a free download through [[SoundCloud]], as a \"thank you\" to all of her fans for the success of Maldito. \"Love Love Love\" is part of the Chilean movie ''Que Pena Tu Boda''{{'}}s soundtrack, as the main credits theme,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924354/soundtrack?ref_=tt_ql_trv_7 IMDb page for Que Pena Tu Boda soundtracks]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |title=Que Pena Tu Boda the movie\u2019s official web page |access-date=2012-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904215142/http://www.quepenatuboda.com/ |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> making this Elis' debut in South America.\n\nIn October 2011, Elis along with Rul and Cachi, from her band, got together in Guadalajara to begin writing ''Animal''. That same month, they entered Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco to record the songs, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez.\n\n=== 2012-2013: ''Animal'' ===\nElis released ''Animal'' in February 2012, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez, under Dr\u00e1gora Records. For this record, her band since the Maldito Tour of 2010-2011, adopted the name The Black Pilgrims. The song \"Animal\" was the first single.\n\nIn January 2012, Luke Castillo left the band once again, to concentrate on studio work, and was replaced by Stepha Campbell on guitars. In July 2012, Paul Richards left the band.

He was best known for driving the No. 28 [[Texaco]]-[[Havoline]] [[Ford]] for [[Robert Yates Racing]] in the [[Winston Cup Series]] (now the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR Cup Series]]). Born in [[Hollywood, Florida]], he was the oldest of four children born to [[Bobby Allison|Bobby and Judy Allison]]. The family moved to [[Hueytown, Alabama]], and along with Bobby Allison\u2019s brother, [[Donnie Allison|Donnie]], [[Red Farmer]] and [[Neil Bonnett]], became known as the [[Alabama Gang]].\n\n==Early career==\nGrowing up, Allison participated in athletics, preferring football, but settled upon automobile racing. He began working for his father's [[NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] team after graduating high school, and built a race car of his own, a Chevy Nova, with friends known as the \"Peach Fuzz Gang\". He began his career in 1979 at [[Birmingham International Raceway]] and won his first race in his sixth start. He became a regular winner at BIR, and by 1983 was racing in the [[Automobile Racing Club of America]] (ARCA) series. Allison won two ARCA events at his home track, [[Talladega Superspeedway]], in 1983, and was named ARCA Rookie of the Year in 1984, placing second in the series title. That same year he married his first wife, Deborah.\n\nAllison continued racing in the ARCA series in 1985, winning eight races in the series, four at [[Talladega Superspeedway]]. He competed in some of [[NASCAR]]'s lower divisions, and in July 1985, car owner [[Hoss Ellington]] gave Allison an opportunity to drive a [[NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] car in the [[Good Sam Club 500|Talladega 500]]. Allison qualified 22nd In Ellington's [[Chevrolet]] and finished 10th in his first [[Winston Cup]] start. The wins earned Allison more [[NASCAR Cup Series]] opportunities in 1986, when he made 4 starts in the No. 95 Sadler Racing Chevrolet entry with [[Tom Pistone]] serving as crew chief. Davey later substituted for injured racer [[Neil Bonnett]] in [[Junior Johnson]]'s No. 12 [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] [[Chevy]], starting and finishing 7th in the [[1000Bulbs.com 500|Talladega 500]].\n\n==Early Winston Cup career==\nPrior to the 1987 season, car owner [[Harry Ranier]] tapped Davey to replace veteran driver [[Cale Yarborough]] in the [[Ranier-Lundy]] No. 28 [[Ford Thunderbird]].  Yarborough was leaving the [[Ranier-Lundy]] team to start his own operation along with the team's sponsor, [[Hardee's]].  Ranier negotiated a sponsorship deal with [[Texaco]]'s [[Havoline]] motor oil brand, a deal that was signed during the [[NASCAR]] edition of [[Speedweeks]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]].  On qualifying day, Davey signalled that he was in [[Winston Cup]] to stay when he qualified an unmarked, but Texaco-Havoline painted No. 28 Thunderbird second for the 1987 [[Daytona 500]], becoming the first rookie ever to start on the front row for [[NASCAR]]'s most prestigious event.  A pit miscue which allowed a rear tire to fall off on the track ended his hopes of a good finish in the race, but success for Davey Allison would be just around the corner.\n\nMay 3, 1987 would become an infamous day in [[NASCAR]] history.  Earlier in the week, [[Bill Elliott]] had qualified his No. 9 [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]]-[[Melling Racing|Melling]] Ford Thunderbird at a record 212.809&nbsp;mph (a record which still stands today) for the [[Aaron's 499|Winston 500]] at the unlighted [[Talladega Superspeedway]].  Davey Allison would qualify third, while father Bobby would start second alongside Elliott in the [[Stavola Brothers Racing|Stavola Brothers]] No. 22 [[Miller]] [[Buick]].  On lap 22 of the event, [[Bobby Allison]] ran over a piece of debris, cutting his right-rear tire.  The car turned sideways, lifted into the air, became airborne, and crashed vertically into the frontstretch spectator fence near the start finish line.  The car landed back on the track and collected a number of other competitors.  Davey was ahead of his father at the time and saw the crash unfold in his mirror.  [[Bobby Allison]] was not injured, but the crash slightly injured several spectators and the race was red-flagged for two hours and thirty-eight minutes. It was this event that triggered the requirement of smaller [[carburetor]]s, and later,  carburetor [[restrictor plate]]s on engines at Daytona and Talladega to reduce the top speeds.\n\nWhen the race resumed, Davey continued to run up front and when Elliott exited the race with engine failure, Davey's toughest competition was eliminated.  With darkness falling on the [[Talladega Superspeedway]] during a late caution flag, the decision was made to end the race 10 laps short of its 188 lap distance.  Running second on the restart, Davey passed leader [[Dale Earnhardt]] on the backstretch and pulled away for his first [[Winston Cup]] win.  In winning the race, Davey became the first rookie since [[Ron Bouchard]] in 1981 to win a [[Winston Cup]] event.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caraviello|first=David|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/20/top-10-nascar-rookies-tony-stewart-jimmie-johnson-dale-earnhardt.html|title=TOP 10 ROOKIE CAMPAIGNS AT NASCAR'S HIGHEST LEVEL|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=January 20, 2014|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDavey would better that feat just 28 days later by winning the [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] 500 at [[Dover International Speedway]] (then the Dover Downs International Speedway), becoming, at the time, the only rookie to win two [[Winston Cup]] events.  In all, Davey started 22 of the 29 [[Winston Cup]] races in 1987, winning twice, and scoring nine top-five and 10 top-ten finishes.  He also won five poles in his rookie season.\n\nThe 1988 season started with much promise.  Davey again started outside the front row for the [[Daytona 500]], the first modern day race utilizing the [[NASCAR]] mandated carburetor [[restrictor plate]].  While father Bobby was battling up front early in the race, Davey and his team struggled with a car that was repaired during the early morning hours following a crash in the final practice session.  But as the race came to a conclusion, Davey found himself running second, just behind his legendary father.  [[Bobby Allison]] would go on to hold off his son and win his third [[Daytona 500]].  Father and son would celebrate their one-and-two finish in victory lane. Both would consider this the greatest moment of their lives.\n\nBut Davey would struggle through much of the first half of the 1988 season as he ran some of the [[Winston Cup]] short tracks for the first time.  The team was also suffering from engine failures and now sole-owner [[Harry Ranier]] was looking to sell the team.  Crew chief [[Joey Knuckles]] was fired and engine builder [[Robert Yates (NASCAR owner)|Robert Yates]] replaced him.  Then on June 19, at [[Pocono International Raceway]] came his father's near-fatal, career-ending crash at Pocono.\n\nWith his father clinging to life in a [[Pennsylvania]] hospital, Davey Allison raced on but failed to finish the next three events.  The team rebounded when the series returned to Pocono in July with Davey scoring a third-place finish.  Back at Talladega, the No. 28 [[Ford]] again suffered engine failure but Davey would drive his father's car later in the race when relief driver [[Mike Alexander (racing driver)|Mike Alexander]] was overcome by heat.  Two races later, Davey would score his first win of the season at [[Michigan International Speedway]].  The win changed the fortunes for the financially strapped team and after a series of top-5 and top-10 finishes, Davey would win the inaugural race at the new [[Richmond International Raceway]]. On October 1, 1988, Ranier sold the team to Yates, who temporarily remained as Allison's crew chief for the balance of the season, before undertaking full ownership. The rest of the season was a mixed bag but Davey would finish the season with a third-place finish at [[Phoenix International Raceway]], and a second at the season ending [[Atlanta Journal 500]] at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]].  He would finish eighth in the final [[Winston Cup]] standings.  But the roller coaster 1988 [[Winston Cup]] season had taken a toll on Davey Allison's marriage and he and Deborah quietly divorced during the offseason.\n\n==Initial years with Robert Yates Racing, 1989\u20131990==\n[[File:DaveyAllison28racecar1989.jpg|thumb|right|Allison's 1989 car]]\nDavey Allison's 1989 season did not start well.  A year after he and his father's one-two [[Daytona 500]] finish, Davey started at 16th, then was involved in an early incident with [[Geoff Bodine]] that sent his car careening into the sand bar separating the track's backstretch from [[Lake Lloyd]].  The car made one slow, complete, roll-over with Davey eventually restarting the car and driving it back to the pits.  He drove the damaged, hood-less car to a 25th-place finish and had a heated exchange with Bodine following the race (the first of several exchanges with other drivers during his career).\n\nThe team rebounded at Rockingham and when the series moved to Talladega in May for the [[Aaron's 499|Winston 500]], Davey had scored one top-10 and three top-5 finishes.  Davey started on the pole at Talladega and got his first win of 1989, his second victory in Talladega's spring event.  After the race, Davey stood sixth in the [[Winston Cup Championship]] standings, but did not win again until the next [[restrictor plate]] race, the [[Pepsi 400]] at Daytona, his last win of the season.  By the end of the season, Davey had collected seven top-five and 13 top-ten finishes along with one pole position to go with the two wins.  He slipped to 11th in the final [[Winston Cup]] standings.  However, Davey would marry his second wife, Liz, during the season, and their first child, Krista, was born prior to the 1990 season.\n[[File:DaveyAllisonSigningAutographs.jpg|thumb|left|Allison signing autographs]]\nThe 1990 season did not start much better than the 1989 season and by the sixth race at Bristol, Davey was a 17th in the [[Winston Cup]] standings.  A poor qualifying run had the team pitting in the backstretch pits, which usually doomed a team's chances of winning the race.  But Robert Yates decided against pitting on the final caution flag and Davey scored his second short-track win in a thrilling photo-finish with [[Mark Martin]], winning by just eight inches.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caraviello|first=David|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/3/12/top-10-spring-battles-at-bristol-sprint-cup-nationwide.html|title=TOP 10 SPRING BATTLES AT BRISTOL|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=March 12, 2014|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}</ref>  But the win did not change the team's fortunes and after an ill-handling car at Dover required Davey to ask for relief from fellow Alabama driver [[Hut Stricklin]], Robert Yates decided to hire \"Suitcase\" [[Jake Elder]] as the team's crew chief.  Davey won the fall event at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] but finished the season 13th in the final [[Winston Cup]] standings.  He again posted two wins, but only five top-five and 10 top-ten finishes.\n\n==1991 and the hiring of Larry McReynolds==\nThe 1991 season began with much promise.  Davey won the pole for the [[Daytona 500]] and was in contention for the win until the final laps.  After a late race restart, eventual winner [[Ernie Irvan]] passed [[Dale Earnhardt]] for the lead.  Davey tried to follow Irvan around Earnhardt but could not make the pass and the two drivers battled side-by-side for a few laps.  As the cars came off turn two, Earnhardt's car spun, collecting Allison and [[Kyle Petty]].  Davey was unable to continue and finished 15th.  From there, things went downhill. Davey finished 12th at Richmond, 16th at Rockingham, then crashed hard early in the [[Motorcraft 500]] at Atlanta, finishing 40th.  Davey was openly feuding with crew chief Elder, and Allison threatened to quit the team if Elder stayed. After the poor result at Atlanta, Robert Yates decided that he had to make a change at crew chief.\n\nElder was fired, and [[Larry McReynolds]] was hired away from the [[Kenny Bernstein]] team to replace him. In his first race with McReynolds at the helm, Allison finished second at the 1991 Transouth 400.  A third-place finish followed at Bristol, then a sixth at North Wilkesboro and an eighth at Martinsville.  The team finished 22nd at Talladega due to a large accident triggered by [[Ernie Irvan]] but there was no doubt the team was much improved and was destined for bigger things.\n\nTwo weeks later, Davey dominated [[The Winston]] all-star race at Charlotte, and continued his domination by winning the [[Coca-Cola 600]] the following week, leading 263 of the race's 400 laps.  Two races later, Davey won his first [[road course]] event at then Sears Point International Raceway where he was awarded the victory after [[Ricky Rudd]] was penalized by NASCAR for spinning Allison out on the final lap.<ref>1991 Save Mart 300 Allison wins after Rudd penalty</ref> He won again at Michigan then finished third in the [[Pepsi 400]] at Daytona.  At the halfway point of the 1991 season, Davey had climbed to fifth in the [[Winston Cup]] point standings.\n\nAfter finishing 14th at Pocono, the series moved to Talladega.  As the race wound down, Davey Allison was poised for yet another win behind leader [[Dale Earnhardt]].  But Davey was unable to get [[drafting (racing)|drafting]] help from fellow [[Ford Motor Company]] drivers and he slipped to ninth place after attempting to pass Earnhardt for the lead. In his post-race interview, Allison stated \"All we needed was three inches to clear Earnhardt, when you can't get help from a fellow Ford driver, that's pitiful\".<ref>The NASCAR Chronicle \"1991\"</ref> In a fit of rage after the race, Allison punched a wall in the team's transporter, breaking his wrist.  The injury failed to slow him down, however as he finished a remarkable 10th on the [[road course]] at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]], then was second at Michigan, a photo-finish in which [[Dale Jarrett]] scored his first [[Winston Cup]] victory. Davey scored back-to-back victories at Rockingham and Phoenix and entered the final race at Atlanta second in the [[Winston Cup]] standings. But a dead battery in that race relegated him to a 17th-place finish, dropping him to third in the final standings, only four points behind [[Ricky Rudd]]. [[Dale Earnhardt]] won the championship.  The final tally of the 1991 season for Davey Allison; five wins, 12 top-five and 16 top-ten finishes, and three pole positions.  It was also during the 1991 season that Davey and Liz welcomed their second child, a son, Robert Grey Allison. With Larry McReynolds at the helm, Davey Allison entered the 1992 season as a legitimate championship contender.\n\n==1992==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nStatistically, 1992 was Davey Allison's best season in [[Winston Cup]] racing. Davey started sixth in the [[1992 Daytona 500]] but was probably not quite as fast as the [[Junior Johnson]] teammates of [[Bill Elliott]] and [[Sterling Marlin]]. But the race would change dramatically on lap 92 when Elliott, Marlin, and [[Ernie Irvan]] triggered a multi-car crash at the front of the pack. Fourteen cars were eliminated, but Allison\u2014and eventual runner-up [[Morgan Shepherd]]\u2014somehow made it through the mess.  He would dominate the event, lead 127 laps to join his father as a [[Daytona 500]] winner. Allison also held the distinction of being the only driver to lead the Daytona 500 at halfway and go on to win, something not repeated until [[Denny Hamlin]] won the 2016 running of the race.<ref>NASCAR Facts and Figues, the Daytona 500</ref>\n\n[[Bill Elliott]] would rebound to win the next four events, but Allison was not far behind in each event, posting four top-five finishes to maintain his lead in the points. A hard crash in the Food City 500 at Bristol left him with a bruised shoulder, but the following weekend he had Jimmy Hensley on hand for relief just in case Allison could not go the distance. Allison managed to race through the pain and go the distance and won at North Wilkesboro after beating [[Rusty Wallace]] and [[Geoffrey Bodine]] off of pit road with a fast pit stop and leading the remaining laps en route to victory.<ref>1992 First Union 400</ref> Another hard crash at Martinsville re-injured his ribs, but Allison rebounded yet again, leading a contingent of [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]] to victory in the [[Aaron's 499|Winston 500]] at Talladega using the same car that he won the Daytona 500 with.<ref>The winning car was sold by Robert Yates at the Barrett Jackson car Auction</ref> It would be his third victory at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]].  The win also put him in position to win the [[Winston Million]] if he could finish off the \"small slam\" with a win in either the [[Coca-Cola 600]] at Charlotte, or the [[Bojangles' Southern 500|Southern 500]] at Darlington.\n\nNext up was [[1992 The Winston|The Winston]] all-star race.  One year removed from his domination of that event and the Coca-Cola 600, Davey was ready to take the spotlight again.  But this time around, there was more focus on the event itself.  Over the winter, the [[Musco Lighting]] company had installed a state-of-the-art lighting system at then Charlotte Motor Speedway.  Billed as \"One Hot Night\" by [[The Nashville Network]], which was to broadcast the event, The Winston was the first superspeedway race to be held under the lights. Davey would drive the same car that he used to dominate the event one year earlier, affectionately known as \"007\".\n\nIn the final, 10-lap segment of the race, [[Dale Earnhardt]] led, followed by [[Kyle Petty]] and Davey.  In the third turn on the final lap, Petty got under Earnhardt's car and the [[GM Goodwrench]] [[Chevrolet]] spun.  Davey took advantage of this and jumped into the lead.  But Petty charged back and as Davey crossed the start-finish line to win the race, the two cars came together, sending the driver's side of Davey's car hard into the outside wall in a shower of sparks. An unconscious Allison was taken from his car and airlifted to a Charlotte hospital. The crash left him with a concussion, bruised lung, and a battered and bruised body.\n\nHis car, \"007\", was totaled. Allison would later claim to have sustained an [[out-of-body experience]] after the crash. He claimed to have awoke to see his crashed car below him as he rose away from it, and to have turned his attention away from the frantic work of the emergency workers to a bright light above, which faded and left him in darkness until he awoke later in the hospital. McReynolds stated during the FOX telecasts that the first words from Allison when he awoke in the hospital were \"did we win\"? McReynolds told Allison \"Yes, Davey, we won\". Victory celebrations went on even though the driver was not present and all crew members later went to the hospital to be with their driver.\n\nThe wreck did not deter Allison.  He finished fourth in the Coca-Cola 600 the following week despite the injuries and maintained his points lead.  He then finished 11th at Dover, 28th at Sears Point, and fifth at Pocono.  Still hanging onto the points lead and his body healing, Davey won the pole and dominated the [[Heluva Good! Sour Cream Dips 400|Miller Genuine Draft 400]] at Michigan, leading 158 of the race's 200 laps.  The first half of the season ended with Davey posting a 10th-place finish in the [[Coke Zero Sugar 400|Pepsi 400]] at Daytona.  At the halfway point of the season, Allison had a 46-point lead over second place [[Bill Elliott]] and a 134-point lead over third place [[Alan Kulwicki]], and had held the points lead since the first race of the season, despite the injuries and setbacks.\n\nThat would all change as the series went back to Pocono.  Davey won the pole for the event and led 115 of the first 149 laps.  But a lengthy pit stop during a caution flag sent him to the middle of the pack.  On lap 150, Allison was charging back through the pack, followed closely by [[Darrell Waltrip]].  The two cars made contact and Davey went sliding into the grass off Pocono's \"tunnel turn\".  The car went airborne and began a series of violent flips before landing on top of an infield guardrail.  Miraculously, Davey survived the crash.  He was airlifted to the hospital with a severe concussion, along with a broken arm, wrist, and collar bone.  His 33rd-place finish left him nine points behind [[Bill Elliott]] for the series title, but that seemed insignificant at the moment. Especially traumatizing was the fact that Pocono was the site of Davey's father Bobby's career-ending crash a few years earlier (see above). In fact, many worried fans wondered if the younger Allison's career was over.\n\nDavey arrived at Talladega the following week wearing dark shades to hide eyes severely bruised in the Pocono crash, Allison famously told a reporter asking to see his eyes at the press conference, \"You can see it, but its ugly\". His arm was in a cast that allowed him to drive, and velcro attachments to his glove and the car's shifter knob helped him drive with less exertion, but [[Bobby Hillin, Jr.]] would relieve Davey after the initial laps of the [[Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500|DieHard 500]].  Under NASCAR rules, the driver who takes the green flag is the one assigned to the points for all drivers that drive that car during the race.  Hillin drove the No. 28 [[Texaco-Havoline]] [[Ford Thunderbird]] to a third-place finish at Talladega, helping Davey and the team keep pace with Elliott.  The team was a strong contender for the win until suffering a jack failure on a pit stop. The following week, veteran road racer [[Dorsey Schroeder]] would relieve Allison, but he could only manage a 20th-place finish.\n\nWith his body healed enough to allow him to drive an entire race, Davey headed to Michigan where he had dominated the track's earlier event.  But tragedy struck as the Michigan events began.  While practicing for [[Carfax 250|the weekend's Busch Series race]], Davey's younger brother, [[Clifford Allison|Clifford]] crashed hard in the third and fourth turns of [[Michigan International Speedway]].  He would die en route to the hospital. Davey drove to a fifth-place finish in the [[Champion Spark Plug 400]], then went home to Hueytown for Clifford's funeral. The following weekend, he crashed again at Bristol, finishing 30th. Although still in second place in the [[Winston Cup]] standings, he now trailed leader [[Bill Elliott]] by 109 points.\n\nDavey's chance to win the [[Winston Million]] was up next as the series headed to Darlington for the [[Mountain Dew Southern 500]], which was worth both a million dollar bonus if he could win the Small Slam, but moreover, become the fourth driver to win the Career Grand Slam. There was a promotion for the event as fake Million Dollar Bills were printed with Allison's face on them were handed out for fans. Davey led 72 laps of the event and was in contention to win, but soon after the leaders pitted for tires and fuel, rain halted the race with 69 laps left. Instead it was [[Darrell Waltrip]], gambling that the rains would come, did not pit and was leading the race when it was red flagged.  He was declared the winner as darkness fell and the rains continued. Waltrip, who had long feuded with the entire Allison clan (Bobby and Donnie;  ironically, Waltrip had replaced Donnie Allison with the [[DiGard Motorsports|DiGard]] team in 1975 and was a relief driver for one of Donnie's wins at Talladega), sat next to his car on pit road in lawn chair and held a colorful umbrella, gleefully joking that the rain shower was worth \"one million dollars\" to him as he became the fourth driver to finish a Career Grand Slam. (This was the second time Waltrip prevented a driver from clinching a Small Slam; in 1985, he stopped Bill Elliott's 1985 run at a Small Slam at Charlotte and Elliott has yet to win that leg of the Grand Slam; Elliott would take the Small Slam at Darlington in September; [[Dale Earnhardt]] stopped Waltrip's Small Slam and Career Grand Slam attempt three years previously at Darlington.) Davey finished fifth and was now 119 points behind Elliott, who finished third.\n\nAllison and Elliott continued their drive for the championship after Darlington as the two kept pace with each other. But beginning with the [[Tums Fast Relief 500|Goody's 500]] at Martinsville on September 28, Elliott's hold on the points lead began to slip. He finished 30th in that event while Allison finished 16th. Then at North Wilkesboro, Allison posted an 11th-place finish, while Elliott finished 26th. Back at Charlotte, Allison finished a 19th, but Elliott finished 30th and there were now four drivers within 100 points of Elliott...Allison, Alan Kulwicki, Mark Martin, and Harry Gant. Martin and Kulwicki finished first and second respectively at Charlotte, and Kulwicki was continuing a late season charge. Three races prior to Charlotte, Kulwicki had crashed and finished 34th at Dover leaving him 278 points behind Elliott and in fourth place in the standings.\n\nElliott's skid stopped temporarily at Rockingham where he finished fourth.  Davey finished 10th and Kulwicki 12th and entering the final two races of the 1992 season, Davey was 70 points behind Elliott in second, with Kulwicki 85 points behind in third. But Davey's fortunes changed dramatically at Phoenix as he won the event by beating his closest rivals off of pit road, and Elliott finished 31st.  Davey now had the points lead for the first time since his violent Pocono crash, and was 30 points ahead of Kulwicki, and 40 ahead of Elliott, who had slipped to third in the standings. Also in contention to win the championship as the series moved to the final race at Atlanta were Harry Gant (fourth place, 97 points behind), Kyle Petty (fifth place, 98 points behind), and Mark Martin (sixth place, 113 points behind).\n\nThe [[1992 Hooters 500]] would be a milestone race in [[NASCAR]] [[Winston Cup]] history. It would be the final race of [[Richard Petty]]'s career, as well as the first for future [[Winston Cup]] Champion [[Jeff Gordon]].  Couple that with the closest championship race in history, and the race was destined to be a classic. Davey Allison entered the race needing only to finish fifth or better to win the [[Winston Cup]]. A first lap incident involving [[Rick Mast]] caused minor damage to Davey's car, and he battled through much of the race to stay in the top ten.\n\nMeanwhile, Elliott and Kulwicki were staging a battle for the ages, battling for and swapping the lead through much of the event. Late in the race, Davey had finally managed to reach the top five and was in position to win the championship when [[Ernie Irvan]] lost control of his car on the frontstretch on lap 286.  Davey could not avoid Irvan's spinning car and plowed into the No. 4 [[Kodak]] [[Chevrolet Lumina]].  Allison's tumultuous 1992 season was over, his championship hopes lost as Elliott and Kulwicki finished first and second in the race respectively.  Kulwicki, an independent driver who had turned down offers to drive for other teams, including [[Junior Johnson]], won the championship by leading one more lap than Elliott (103 to 102).\n\n==1993==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nThough 1992 had been a heartbreaking year for Davey Allison and the [[Robert Yates Racing]] team in more ways than one, they had to be encouraged by their run for the championship.  But 1993 opened on a sour note with Allison finishing 28th at Daytona.  That finish was followed by a 16th at Rockingham, but Davey rebounded to win at Richmond the following week. The next race at Atlanta was delayed a week by a blizzard that blanketed much of the Southeast.  [[Morgan Shepherd]] won the race and Davey finished 13th.  He then posted an 11th at Darlington. Despite the early season struggles, Davey was sixth in the [[Winston Cup]] standings, while defending series champ Kulwicki was ninth.\n\nDavey Allison had debuted in the [[International Race of Champions]] (IROC) in 1992, but his injuries forced him to miss the last two races.\n\nThree days after Kulwicki's death in an airplane crash, Davey Allison finished fifth in an emotional race at Bristol. He followed that finish with a fourth at North Wilkesboro, second at Martinsville, seventh at Talladega, and 15th at Sears Point. He finished a 30th in the [[Coca-Cola 600]] at Charlotte, but rebounded at Dover, finishing third. He was sixth at Pocono, but finished 35th at Michigan and 31st at Daytona. Halfway through the 1993 season, Davey was fifth in the point standings, but was 323 points behind leader [[Dale Earnhardt]].  Still, Davey and the Robert Yates team were confident that they could put their early season struggles and inconsistency behind them and could make a run for the championship in the second half. The inaugural race at [[New Hampshire International Speedway]] proved the team's optimism was not unfounded. Davey led 38 laps of the event and finished third behind [[Rusty Wallace]] and [[Mark Martin]].\n\n==Death==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2015}}\nOn July 12, 1993, Allison boarded his newly acquired [[MD Helicopters MD 500|Hughes 369HS]] helicopter to fly to [[Talladega Superspeedway]] to watch family friend [[Neil Bonnett]] and his son David test a car for David's [[Busch Series]] debut. He picked up another family friend, racer [[Red Farmer]], en route to the track. Allison was attempting to land the helicopter inside a fenced-in area of the track infield when the craft nosed up suddenly, then crashed. The [[National Transportation Safety Board]]<ref>https://app.ntsb.gov/pdfgenerator/ReportGeneratorFile.ashx?EventID=20001211X12761&AKey=1&RType=HTML&IType=FA</ref> (NTSB) blamed the crash on Allison's inexperience in helicopters, coupled with the decision to attempt a landing. Neil Bonnett freed the semi-conscious Farmer from the wreckage, but Allison was unresponsive and could not be freed until paramedics arrived. Farmer went on to a lengthy but successful recovery, but Allison never regained consciousness after sustaining a critical head injury. He was pronounced dead at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. the next morning by a neurosurgeon at [[Carraway Methodist Medical Center]] in Birmingham after a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain proved unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Siano|first1=Joseph|title=Davey Allison, Stock-Car Driver, Dies at 32 After Helicopter Crash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/14/obituaries/davey-allison-stock-car-driver-dies-at-32-after-helicopter-crash.html|accessdate=17 January 2015|work=The New York Times|date=July 14, 1993}}</ref>\n\nThousands packed the auditorium at St. Aloysious Church in [[Bessemer, Alabama]], to pay their respects at his funeral.

In his short [[NASCAR]] [[Winston Cup]] career, Allison posted 19 wins, 66 top-five finishes, and 92 top-ten finishes. He also won 14 poles and earned $6,724,174.  He is survived by his wife, Liz, and two children: daughter Krista Marie and son Robert \"Robbie\" Grey.\n\n==Tribute==\n{{one source|section|date=June 2015}}\nTen years after Allison's first win, Texaco debuted the throwback Battlestar paint scheme in his memory. It ran two races, but in the second, at the 1997 DieHard 500 in October, [[Ernie Irvan]] put the throwback Battlestar on the pole. Later, Texaco would often use the throwback paint scheme for their drivers at the track until they discontinued sponsorship.\n\nThe R. K. Allen Oil Company, the Talladega-based distributor for Texaco in the area, remembered the legacy of Allison with the Talladega-Texaco Walk of Fame in Talladega, where fans vote drivers, past and present, to a specially themed \"hall of fame\" for drivers.

The Walk of Fame induction was moved from July to October in 1997, and was in September in 2003.\n\n2.  Hamilton was voted by fans to the Walk of Fame in 2000;  the Board of Directors did not want the retiring Waltrip, whose 84 wins was the most by a driver who started his career after 1972 (when the schedule was reduced to the current format) to be inducted as an inactive driver, so he was automatically inducted by the board.  It should be known Waltrip was very unpopular at Talladega in his prime for his feuds with all three Allisons, starting when he replaced Donnie in the DiGard racing car in 1975;  ironically, it was Waltrip who was a relief driver driving when Donnie won the [[1977 Talladega 500]].  Also, Waltrip's associate sponsor was the Havoline brand of oil in 2000 (Texaco was associated with Kmart-sponsored cars during the 1990s).\n\n3.  The Board of Directors of the Talladega-Texaco Walk of Fame inducted the inaugural class by decree in 1994.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nAllison was leading the [[International Race of Champions|IROC]] series championship at the time of his death, with one race remaining in the four race series. [[Terry Labonte]] drove the final race in place of Allison and secured the championship for him. His championship money, $175,000, was set up as a trust fund for his children. Allison finished 31st in the final 1993 NASCAR Championship Standings and earned officially half of the 1993 owner points fund for the #28 team.<ref>NASCAR '94 Preview and Press Guide Final Points Standings 1993</ref>\n\n[[Racing Champions]] produced a die-cast model of Allison's 1989 Texaco car as a tribute after his death, as well as his standard 1993 scheme in the main line of die-cast.<ref>Davey Allison Racing Champions 1993 Edition/Racing Champions Premier</ref> Racing Champions also made die-cast replicas of cars Allison drove during his career in the Racing Champions Premier line, with a trading card that read \"Champion Forever\".<ref>Racing Champions Premier Card says \"Champion Forever\"</ref> A promotional die-cast 28 car was released with Allison's replacement, [[Ernie Irvan]] listed as driver to pay tribute to the team's win at Martinsville in the fall of 1993. Only 20,000 of them were released.<ref>Ernie Irvan Racing Champions diecast trading card \"1 of 20,000\"</ref>\n\nAllison was posthumously inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] in 1998, and in 2018 he was announced as an inductee of the [[NASCAR Hall of Fame]] where he was formally inducted in 2019.\n\nAllison became a figure in a controversy as his widow became involved with country music star [[Joe Diffie]] shortly after Allison's death. Tabloid television programs and newspapers gave much coverage to the story at the time, with some claiming that the two had been lovers before Allison's death.  Liz has openly discussed her relationship with Diffie, most recently on the Paul Finebaum Radio Network during the week of the 2006 race at Talladega. Liz expressed some regret over the relationship and mentioned that she and Diffie were band-aids for each other, and band aids were not meant to be permanent.\n\nLiz Allison and their two children moved to Nashville and she married physical therapist Ryan Hackett on May 13, 2000. After being divorced for four years, Bobby and Judy Allison reunited at the wedding, after nearly seven years of tragedy had separated them.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/457/v-print/story/773539.html NASCAR legend Bobby Allison relives glory, sorrow], ''The Miami Herald'', November 15, 2008.</ref>\n\nOn April 28, 2003, the mayor of Hueytown, Alabama, declared it Davey Allison Day and is celebrated on the weekend of the [[Aaron's 499|springtime Talladega race]].\n\nDue to Allison's death, Robert Yates initially chose not to field a car at the 1993 Miller Genuine Draft 400, stating \"It's hard to race with tears in your eyes\". Yates would return to Talladega with [[Robby Gordon]] replacing Allison in the No. 28, but he lost control of the Texaco/Havoline Ford early in the race and crashed and finished last. [[Lake Speed]] would take over driving duties until the 1993 Southern 500. [[Ernie Irvan]], would later take over the ride at the Mountain Dew Southern 500 and won the Goody's 500 at Martinsville Speedway and it was a heartwarming time for Irvan's crew as it marked their first time back to victory lane since Allison's death. Irvan would also win the Mello Yello 500 at Charlotte as well. Racing Champions ran the No. 28 Havoline Ford with Ernie Irvan replacing Allison as the driver in tribute of the win.\n\nAllison also had his own brand of [[chili con carne|chili]] by Bunker Hill with his face on the can.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[Stuart Ashen|Ashen, Stuart]] |date=March 19, 2017 |title=32 Year Old Chili and 38 Year Old Beer |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jq81Ckwdtk |access-date=March 19, 2017 |ref=ashens}}</ref> Allison also had a [[comic book]] printed about him during his racing days.<ref name=\"comicbookdb\">{{cite web |url=http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=249998 |title=NASCAR Adventures (1991)&nbsp;\u2013 #4 \"Davey Allison\" |work=ComicBookDB.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20170320033252/http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=249998 |archivedate=2017-03-20 |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}</ref>\n\nA road called \"Allison-Bonnett Memorial Drive\" in his hometown is honored by him, along with fellow native Neil Bonnett, who died a year after Davey.\n\nIn the videogames ''[[NASCAR 99]]'' and ''[[NASCAR 2000]]'', he appears as an unlockable NASCAR Legend with his Texaco Ford that he drove from 1987\u20131989.\n\nAllison's livery style has been used as tributes by Ford (Robert Yates NASCAR Hall of Fame), Dr. Pepper / 7 Up Group (an associate sponsor of Allison in 1992 and 93), and Chevron (at least two occasions, primarily at Talladega, the Battlestar livery has been used as a retro livery).  Most notably, Irvan put the 1987 Battlestar livery on the pole at the October 1997 Talladega race, much to the delight of fans.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Allison''' (February 25, 1961&nbsp;\u2013 July 13, 1993) was an American [[NASCAR]] driver. He was best known for driving the No. 28 [[Texaco]]-[[Havoline]] [[Ford]] for [[Robert Yates Racing]] in the [[Winston Cup Series]] (now the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR Cup Series]]). Born in [[Hollywood, Florida]], he was the oldest of four children born to [[Bobby Allison|Bobby and Judy Allison]]. The family moved to [[Hueytown, Alabama]], and along with Bobby Allison\u2019s brother, [[Donnie Allison|Donnie]], [[Red Farmer]] and [[Neil Bonnett]], became known as the [[Alabama Gang]].\n\n==Early career==\nGrowing up, Allison participated in athletics, preferring football, but settled upon automobile racing. He began working for his father's [[NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] team after graduating high school, and built a race car of his own, a Chevy Nova, with friends known as the \"Peach Fuzz Gang\". He began his career in 1979 at [[Birmingham International Raceway]] and won his first race in his sixth start. He became a regular winner at BIR, and by 1983 was racing in the [[Automobile Racing Club of America]] (ARCA) series. Allison won two ARCA events at his home track, [[Talladega Superspeedway]], in 1983, and was named ARCA Rookie of the Year in 1984, placing second in the series title. That same year he married his first wife, Deborah.\n\nAllison continued racing in the ARCA series in 1985, winning eight races in the series, four at [[Talladega Superspeedway]]. He competed in some of [[NASCAR]]'s lower divisions, and in July 1985, car owner [[Hoss Ellington]] gave Allison an opportunity to drive a [[NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] car in the [[Good Sam Club 500|Talladega 500]]. Allison qualified 22nd In Ellington's [[Chevrolet]] and finished 10th in his first [[Winston Cup]] start. The wins earned Allison more [[NASCAR Cup Series]] opportunities in 1986, when he made 4 starts in the No. 95 Sadler Racing Chevrolet entry with [[Tom Pistone]] serving as crew chief. Davey later substituted for injured racer [[Neil Bonnett]] in [[Junior Johnson]]'s No. 12 [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] [[Chevy]], starting and finishing 7th in the [[1000Bulbs.com 500|Talladega 500]].\n\n==Early Winston Cup career==\nPrior to the 1987 season, car owner [[Harry Ranier]] tapped Davey to replace veteran driver [[Cale Yarborough]] in the [[Ranier-Lundy]] No. 28 [[Ford Thunderbird]].  Yarborough was leaving the [[Ranier-Lundy]] team to start his own operation along with the team's sponsor, [[Hardee's]].  Ranier negotiated a sponsorship deal with [[Texaco]]'s [[Havoline]] motor oil brand, a deal that was signed during the [[NASCAR]] edition of [[Speedweeks]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]].  On qualifying day, Davey signalled that he was in [[Winston Cup]] to stay when he qualified an unmarked, but Texaco-Havoline painted No. 28 Thunderbird second for the 1987 [[Daytona 500]], becoming the first rookie ever to start on the front row for [[NASCAR]]'s most prestigious event.  A pit miscue which allowed a rear tire to fall off on the track ended his hopes of a good finish in the race, but success for Davey Allison would be just around the corner.\n\nMay 3, 1987 would become an infamous day in [[NASCAR]] history.  Earlier in the week, [[Bill Elliott]] had qualified his No. 9 [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]]-[[Melling Racing|Melling]] Ford Thunderbird at a record 212.809&nbsp;mph (a record which still stands today) for the [[Aaron's 499|Winston 500]] at the unlighted [[Talladega Superspeedway]].  Davey Allison would qualify third, while father Bobby would start second alongside Elliott in the [[Stavola Brothers Racing|Stavola Brothers]] No. 22 [[Miller]] [[Buick]].  On lap 22 of the event, [[Bobby Allison]] ran over a piece of debris, cutting his right-rear tire.  The car turned sideways, lifted into the air, became airborne, and crashed vertically into the frontstretch spectator fence near the start finish line.  The car landed back on the track and collected a number of other competitors.  Davey was ahead of his father at the time and saw the crash unfold in his mirror.  [[Bobby Allison]] was not injured, but the crash slightly injured several spectators and the race was red-flagged for two hours and thirty-eight minutes. It was this event that triggered the requirement of smaller [[carburetor]]s, and later,  carburetor [[restrictor plate]]s on engines at Daytona and Talladega to reduce the top speeds.\n\nWhen the race resumed, Davey continued to run up front and when Elliott exited the race with engine failure, Davey's toughest competition was eliminated.  With darkness falling on the [[Talladega Superspeedway]] during a late caution flag, the decision was made to end the race 10 laps short of its 188 lap distance.  Running second on the restart, Davey passed leader [[Dale Earnhardt]] on the backstretch and pulled away for his first [[Winston Cup]] win.  In winning the race, Davey became the first rookie since [[Ron Bouchard]] in 1981 to win a [[Winston Cup]] event.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caraviello|first=David|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/20/top-10-nascar-rookies-tony-stewart-jimmie-johnson-dale-earnhardt.html|title=TOP 10 ROOKIE CAMPAIGNS AT NASCAR'S HIGHEST LEVEL|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=January 20, 2014|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDavey would better that feat just 28 days later by winning the [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] 500 at [[Dover International Speedway]] (then the Dover Downs International Speedway), becoming, at the time, the only rookie to win two [[Winston Cup]] events.  In all, Davey started 22 of the 29 [[Winston Cup]] races in 1987, winning twice, and scoring nine top-five and 10 top-ten finishes.  He also won five poles in his rookie season.\n\nThe 1988 season started with much promise.  Davey again started outside the front row for the [[Daytona 500]], the first modern day race utilizing the [[NASCAR]] mandated carburetor [[restrictor plate]].  While father Bobby was battling up front early in the race, Davey and his team struggled with a car that was repaired during the early morning hours following a crash in the final practice session.  But as the race came to a conclusion, Davey found himself running second, just behind his legendary father.  [[Bobby Allison]] would go on to hold off his son and win his third [[Daytona 500]].  Father and son would celebrate their one-and-two finish in victory lane. Both would consider this the greatest moment of their lives.\n\nBut Davey would struggle through much of the first half of the 1988 season as he ran some of the [[Winston Cup]] short tracks for the first time.  The team was also suffering from engine failures and now sole-owner [[Harry Ranier]] was looking to sell the team.  Crew chief [[Joey Knuckles]] was fired and engine builder [[Robert Yates (NASCAR owner)|Robert Yates]] replaced him.  Then on June 19, at [[Pocono International Raceway]] came his father's near-fatal, career-ending crash at Pocono.\n\nWith his father clinging to life in a [[Pennsylvania]] hospital, Davey Allison raced on but failed to finish the next three events.  The team rebounded when the series returned to Pocono in July with Davey scoring a third-place finish.  Back at Talladega, the No. 28 [[Ford]] again suffered engine failure but Davey would drive his father's car later in the race when relief driver [[Mike Alexander (racing driver)|Mike Alexander]] was overcome by heat.  Two races later, Davey would score his first win of the season at [[Michigan International Speedway]].  The win changed the fortunes for the financially strapped team and after a series of top-5 and top-10 finishes, Davey would win the inaugural race at the new [[Richmond International Raceway]]. On October 1, 1988, Ranier sold the team to Yates, who temporarily remained as Allison's crew chief for the balance of the season, before undertaking full ownership. The rest of the season was a mixed bag but Davey would finish the season with a third-place finish at [[Phoenix International Raceway]], and a second at the season ending [[Atlanta Journal 500]] at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]].  He would finish eighth in the final [[Winston Cup]] standings.  But the roller coaster 1988 [[Winston Cup]] season had taken a toll on Davey Allison's marriage and he and Deborah quietly divorced during the offseason.\n\n==Initial years with Robert Yates Racing, 1989\u20131990==\n[[File:DaveyAllison28racecar1989.jpg|thumb|right|Allison's 1989 car]]\nDavey Allison's 1989 season did not start well.  A year after he and his father's one-two [[Daytona 500]] finish, Davey started at 16th, then was involved in an early incident with [[Geoff Bodine]] that sent his car careening into the sand bar separating the track's backstretch from [[Lake Lloyd]].  The car made one slow, complete, roll-over with Davey eventually restarting the car and driving it back to the pits.  He drove the damaged, hood-less car to a 25th-place finish and had a heated exchange with Bodine following the race (the first of several exchanges with other drivers during his career).\n\nThe team rebounded at Rockingham and when the series moved to Talladega in May for the [[Aaron's 499|Winston 500]], Davey had scored one top-10 and three top-5 finishes.  Davey started on the pole at Talladega and got his first win of 1989, his second victory in Talladega's spring event.  After the race, Davey stood sixth in the [[Winston Cup Championship]] standings, but did not win again until the next [[restrictor plate]] race, the [[Pepsi 400]] at Daytona, his last win of the season.  By the end of the season, Davey had collected seven top-five and 13 top-ten finishes along with one pole position to go with the two wins.  He slipped to 11th in the final [[Winston Cup]] standings.  However, Davey would marry his second wife, Liz, during the season, and their first child, Krista, was born prior to the 1990 season.\n[[File:DaveyAllisonSigningAutographs.jpg|thumb|left|Allison signing autographs]]\nThe 1990 season did not start much better than the 1989 season and by the sixth race at Bristol, Davey was a 17th in the [[Winston Cup]] standings.  A poor qualifying run had the team pitting in the backstretch pits, which usually doomed a team's chances of winning the race.  But Robert Yates decided against pitting on the final caution flag and Davey scored his second short-track win in a thrilling photo-finish with [[Mark Martin]], winning by just eight inches.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caraviello|first=David|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/3/12/top-10-spring-battles-at-bristol-sprint-cup-nationwide.html|title=TOP 10 SPRING BATTLES AT BRISTOL|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=March 12, 2014|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}</ref>  But the win did not change the team's fortunes and after an ill-handling car at Dover required Davey to ask for relief from fellow Alabama driver [[Hut Stricklin]], Robert Yates decided to hire \"Suitcase\" [[Jake Elder]] as the team's crew chief.  Davey won the fall event at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] but finished the season 13th in the final [[Winston Cup]] standings.  He again posted two wins, but only five top-five and 10 top-ten finishes.\n\n==1991 and the hiring of Larry McReynolds==\nThe 1991 season began with much promise.  Davey won the pole for the [[Daytona 500]] and was in contention for the win until the final laps.  After a late race restart, eventual winner [[Ernie Irvan]] passed [[Dale Earnhardt]] for the lead.  Davey tried to follow Irvan around Earnhardt but could not make the pass and the two drivers battled side-by-side for a few laps.  As the cars came off turn two, Earnhardt's car spun, collecting Allison and [[Kyle Petty]].  Davey was unable to continue and finished 15th.  From there, things went downhill. Davey finished 12th at Richmond, 16th at Rockingham, then crashed hard early in the [[Motorcraft 500]] at Atlanta, finishing 40th.  Davey was openly feuding with crew chief Elder, and Allison threatened to quit the team if Elder stayed. After the poor result at Atlanta, Robert Yates decided that he had to make a change at crew chief.\n\nElder was fired, and [[Larry McReynolds]] was hired away from the [[Kenny Bernstein]] team to replace him. In his first race with McReynolds at the helm, Allison finished second at the 1991 Transouth 400.  A third-place finish followed at Bristol, then a sixth at North Wilkesboro and an eighth at Martinsville.  The team finished 22nd at Talladega due to a large accident triggered by [[Ernie Irvan]] but there was no doubt the team was much improved and was destined for bigger things.\n\nTwo weeks later, Davey dominated [[The Winston]] all-star race at Charlotte, and continued his domination by winning the [[Coca-Cola 600]] the following week, leading 263 of the race's 400 laps.  Two races later, Davey won his first [[road course]] event at then Sears Point International Raceway where he was awarded the victory after [[Ricky Rudd]] was penalized by NASCAR for spinning Allison out on the final lap.<ref>1991 Save Mart 300 Allison wins after Rudd penalty</ref> He won again at Michigan then finished third in the [[Pepsi 400]] at Daytona.  At the halfway point of the 1991 season, Davey had climbed to fifth in the [[Winston Cup]] point standings.\n\nAfter finishing 14th at Pocono, the series moved to Talladega.  As the race wound down, Davey Allison was poised for yet another win behind leader [[Dale Earnhardt]].  But Davey was unable to get [[drafting (racing)|drafting]] help from fellow [[Ford Motor Company]] drivers and he slipped to ninth place after attempting to pass Earnhardt for the lead. In his post-race interview, Allison stated \"All we needed was three inches to clear Earnhardt, when you can't get help from a fellow Ford driver, that's pitiful\".<ref>The NASCAR Chronicle \"1991\"</ref> In a fit of rage after the race, Allison punched a wall in the team's transporter, breaking his wrist.  The injury failed to slow him down, however as he finished a remarkable 10th on the [[road course]] at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]], then was second at Michigan, a photo-finish in which [[Dale Jarrett]] scored his first [[Winston Cup]] victory. Davey scored back-to-back victories at Rockingham and Phoenix and entered the final race at Atlanta second in the [[Winston Cup]] standings. But a dead battery in that race relegated him to a 17th-place finish, dropping him to third in the final standings, only four points behind [[Ricky Rudd]]. [[Dale Earnhardt]] won the championship.  The final tally of the 1991 season for Davey Allison; five wins, 12 top-five and 16 top-ten finishes, and three pole positions.  It was also during the 1991 season that Davey and Liz welcomed their second child, a son, Robert Grey Allison. With Larry McReynolds at the helm, Davey Allison entered the 1992 season as a legitimate championship contender.\n\n==1992==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nStatistically, 1992 was Davey Allison's best season in [[Winston Cup]] racing. Davey started sixth in the [[1992 Daytona 500]] but was probably not quite as fast as the [[Junior Johnson]] teammates of [[Bill Elliott]] and [[Sterling Marlin]]. But the race would change dramatically on lap 92 when Elliott, Marlin, and [[Ernie Irvan]] triggered a multi-car crash at the front of the pack. Fourteen cars were eliminated, but Allison\u2014and eventual runner-up [[Morgan Shepherd]]\u2014somehow made it through the mess.  He would dominate the event, lead 127 laps to join his father as a [[Daytona 500]] winner. Allison also held the distinction of being the only driver to lead the Daytona 500 at halfway and go on to win, something not repeated until [[Denny Hamlin]] won the 2016 running of the race.<ref>NASCAR Facts and Figues, the Daytona 500</ref>\n\n[[Bill Elliott]] would rebound to win the next four events, but Allison was not far behind in each event, posting four top-five finishes to maintain his lead in the points. A hard crash in the Food City 500 at Bristol left him with a bruised shoulder, but the following weekend he had Jimmy Hensley on hand for relief just in case Allison could not go the distance. Allison managed to race through the pain and go the distance and won at North Wilkesboro after beating [[Rusty Wallace]] and [[Geoffrey Bodine]] off of pit road with a fast pit stop and leading the remaining laps en route to victory.<ref>1992 First Union 400</ref> Another hard crash at Martinsville re-injured his ribs, but Allison rebounded yet again, leading a contingent of [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]] to victory in the [[Aaron's 499|Winston 500]] at Talladega using the same car that he won the Daytona 500 with.<ref>The winning car was sold by Robert Yates at the Barrett Jackson car Auction</ref> It would be his third victory at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]].  The win also put him in position to win the [[Winston Million]] if he could finish off the \"small slam\" with a win in either the [[Coca-Cola 600]] at Charlotte, or the [[Bojangles' Southern 500|Southern 500]] at Darlington.\n\nNext up was [[1992 The Winston|The Winston]] all-star race.  One year removed from his domination of that event and the Coca-Cola 600, Davey was ready to take the spotlight again.  But this time around, there was more focus on the event itself.  Over the winter, the [[Musco Lighting]] company had installed a state-of-the-art lighting system at then Charlotte Motor Speedway.  Billed as \"One Hot Night\" by [[The Nashville Network]], which was to broadcast the event, The Winston was the first superspeedway race to be held under the lights. Davey would drive the same car that he used to dominate the event one year earlier, affectionately known as \"007\".\n\nIn the final, 10-lap segment of the race, [[Dale Earnhardt]] led, followed by [[Kyle Petty]] and Davey.  In the third turn on the final lap, Petty got under Earnhardt's car and the [[GM Goodwrench]] [[Chevrolet]] spun.  Davey took advantage of this and jumped into the lead.  But Petty charged back and as Davey crossed the start-finish line to win the race, the two cars came together, sending the driver's side of Davey's car hard into the outside wall in a shower of sparks. An unconscious Allison was taken from his car and airlifted to a Charlotte hospital. The crash left him with a concussion, bruised lung, and a battered and bruised body.\n\nHis car, \"007\", was totaled. Allison would later claim to have sustained an [[out-of-body experience]] after the crash. He claimed to have awoke to see his crashed car below him as he rose away from it, and to have turned his attention away from the frantic work of the emergency workers to a bright light above, which faded and left him in darkness until he awoke later in the hospital. McReynolds stated during the FOX telecasts that the first words from Allison when he awoke in the hospital were \"did we win\"? McReynolds told Allison \"Yes, Davey, we won\". Victory celebrations went on even though the driver was not present and all crew members later went to the hospital to be with their driver.\n\nThe wreck did not deter Allison.  He finished fourth in the Coca-Cola 600 the following week despite the injuries and maintained his points lead.  He then finished 11th at Dover, 28th at Sears Point, and fifth at Pocono.  Still hanging onto the points lead and his body healing, Davey won the pole and dominated the [[Heluva Good! Sour Cream Dips 400|Miller Genuine Draft 400]] at Michigan, leading 158 of the race's 200 laps.  The first half of the season ended with Davey posting a 10th-place finish in the [[Coke Zero Sugar 400|Pepsi 400]] at Daytona.  At the halfway point of the season, Allison had a 46-point lead over second place [[Bill Elliott]] and a 134-point lead over third place [[Alan Kulwicki]], and had held the points lead since the first race of the season, despite the injuries and setbacks.\n\nThat would all change as the series went back to Pocono.  Davey won the pole for the event and led 115 of the first 149 laps.  But a lengthy pit stop during a caution flag sent him to the middle of the pack.  On lap 150, Allison was charging back through the pack, followed closely by [[Darrell Waltrip]].  The two cars made contact and Davey went sliding into the grass off Pocono's \"tunnel turn\".  The car went airborne and began a series of violent flips before landing on top of an infield guardrail.  Miraculously, Davey survived the crash.  He was airlifted to the hospital with a severe concussion, along with a broken arm, wrist, and collar bone.  His 33rd-place finish left him nine points behind [[Bill Elliott]] for the series title, but that seemed insignificant at the moment. Especially traumatizing was the fact that Pocono was the site of Davey's father Bobby's career-ending crash a few years earlier (see above). In fact, many worried fans wondered if the younger Allison's career was over.\n\nDavey arrived at Talladega the following week wearing dark shades to hide eyes severely bruised in the Pocono crash, Allison famously told a reporter asking to see his eyes at the press conference, \"You can see it, but its ugly\". His arm was in a cast that allowed him to drive, and velcro attachments to his glove and the car's shifter knob helped him drive with less exertion, but [[Bobby Hillin, Jr.]] would relieve Davey after the initial laps of the [[Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500|DieHard 500]].  Under NASCAR rules, the driver who takes the green flag is the one assigned to the points for all drivers that drive that car during the race.  Hillin drove the No. 28 [[Texaco-Havoline]] [[Ford Thunderbird]] to a third-place finish at Talladega, helping Davey and the team keep pace with Elliott.  The team was a strong contender for the win until suffering a jack failure on a pit stop. The following week, veteran road racer [[Dorsey Schroeder]] would relieve Allison, but he could only manage a 20th-place finish.\n\nWith his body healed enough to allow him to drive an entire race, Davey headed to Michigan where he had dominated the track's earlier event.  But tragedy struck as the Michigan events began.  While practicing for [[Carfax 250|the weekend's Busch Series race]], Davey's younger brother, [[Clifford Allison|Clifford]] crashed hard in the third and fourth turns of [[Michigan International Speedway]].  He would die en route to the hospital. Davey drove to a fifth-place finish in the [[Champion Spark Plug 400]], then went home to Hueytown for Clifford's funeral. The following weekend, he crashed again at Bristol, finishing 30th. Although still in second place in the [[Winston Cup]] standings, he now trailed leader [[Bill Elliott]] by 109 points.\n\nDavey's chance to win the [[Winston Million]] was up next as the series headed to Darlington for the [[Mountain Dew Southern 500]], which was worth both a million dollar bonus if he could win the Small Slam, but moreover, become the fourth driver to win the Career Grand Slam. There was a promotion for the event as fake Million Dollar Bills were printed with Allison's face on them were handed out for fans. Davey led 72 laps of the event and was in contention to win, but soon after the leaders pitted for tires and fuel, rain halted the race with 69 laps left. Instead it was [[Darrell Waltrip]], gambling that the rains would come, did not pit and was leading the race when it was red flagged.  He was declared the winner as darkness fell and the rains continued. Waltrip, who had long feuded with the entire Allison clan (Bobby and Donnie;  ironically, Waltrip had replaced Donnie Allison with the [[DiGard Motorsports|DiGard]] team in 1975 and was a relief driver for one of Donnie's wins at Talladega), sat next to his car on pit road in lawn chair and held a colorful umbrella, gleefully joking that the rain shower was worth \"one million dollars\" to him as he became the fourth driver to finish a Career Grand Slam. (This was the second time Waltrip prevented a driver from clinching a Small Slam; in 1985, he stopped Bill Elliott's 1985 run at a Small Slam at Charlotte and Elliott has yet to win that leg of the Grand Slam; Elliott would take the Small Slam at Darlington in September; [[Dale Earnhardt]] stopped Waltrip's Small Slam and Career Grand Slam attempt three years previously at Darlington.) Davey finished fifth and was now 119 points behind Elliott, who finished third.\n\nAllison and Elliott continued their drive for the championship after Darlington as the two kept pace with each other. But beginning with the [[Tums Fast Relief 500|Goody's 500]] at Martinsville on September 28, Elliott's hold on the points lead began to slip. He finished 30th in that event while Allison finished 16th. Then at North Wilkesboro, Allison posted an 11th-place finish, while Elliott finished 26th. Back at Charlotte, Allison finished a 19th, but Elliott finished 30th and there were now four drivers within 100 points of Elliott...Allison, Alan Kulwicki, Mark Martin, and Harry Gant. Martin and Kulwicki finished first and second respectively at Charlotte, and Kulwicki was continuing a late season charge. Three races prior to Charlotte, Kulwicki had crashed and finished 34th at Dover leaving him 278 points behind Elliott and in fourth place in the standings.\n\nElliott's skid stopped temporarily at Rockingham where he finished fourth.  Davey finished 10th and Kulwicki 12th and entering the final two races of the 1992 season, Davey was 70 points behind Elliott in second, with Kulwicki 85 points behind in third. But Davey's fortunes changed dramatically at Phoenix as he won the event by beating his closest rivals off of pit road, and Elliott finished 31st.  Davey now had the points lead for the first time since his violent Pocono crash, and was 30 points ahead of Kulwicki, and 40 ahead of Elliott, who had slipped to third in the standings. Also in contention to win the championship as the series moved to the final race at Atlanta were Harry Gant (fourth place, 97 points behind), Kyle Petty (fifth place, 98 points behind), and Mark Martin (sixth place, 113 points behind).\n\nThe [[1992 Hooters 500]] would be a milestone race in [[NASCAR]] [[Winston Cup]] history. It would be the final race of [[Richard Petty]]'s career, as well as the first for future [[Winston Cup]] Champion [[Jeff Gordon]].  Couple that with the closest championship race in history, and the race was destined to be a classic. Davey Allison entered the race needing only to finish fifth or better to win the [[Winston Cup]]. A first lap incident involving [[Rick Mast]] caused minor damage to Davey's car, and he battled through much of the race to stay in the top ten.\n\nMeanwhile, Elliott and Kulwicki were staging a battle for the ages, battling for and swapping the lead through much of the event. Late in the race, Davey had finally managed to reach the top five and was in position to win the championship when [[Ernie Irvan]] lost control of his car on the frontstretch on lap 286.  Davey could not avoid Irvan's spinning car and plowed into the No. 4 [[Kodak]] [[Chevrolet Lumina]].  Allison's tumultuous 1992 season was over, his championship hopes lost as Elliott and Kulwicki finished first and second in the race respectively.  Kulwicki, an independent driver who had turned down offers to drive for other teams, including [[Junior Johnson]], won the championship by leading one more lap than Elliott (103 to 102).\n\n==1993==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nThough 1992 had been a heartbreaking year for Davey Allison and the [[Robert Yates Racing]] team in more ways than one, they had to be encouraged by their run for the championship.  But 1993 opened on a sour note with Allison finishing 28th at Daytona.  That finish was followed by a 16th at Rockingham, but Davey rebounded to win at Richmond the following week. The next race at Atlanta was delayed a week by a blizzard that blanketed much of the Southeast.  [[Morgan Shepherd]] won the race and Davey finished 13th.  He then posted an 11th at Darlington. Despite the early season struggles, Davey was sixth in the [[Winston Cup]] standings, while defending series champ Kulwicki was ninth.\n\nDavey Allison had debuted in the [[International Race of Champions]] (IROC) in 1992, but his injuries forced him to miss the last two races.\n\nThree days after Kulwicki's death in an airplane crash, Davey Allison finished fifth in an emotional race at Bristol. He followed that finish with a fourth at North Wilkesboro, second at Martinsville, seventh at Talladega, and 15th at Sears Point. He finished a 30th in the [[Coca-Cola 600]] at Charlotte, but rebounded at Dover, finishing third. He was sixth at Pocono, but finished 35th at Michigan and 31st at Daytona. Halfway through the 1993 season, Davey was fifth in the point standings, but was 323 points behind leader [[Dale Earnhardt]].  Still, Davey and the Robert Yates team were confident that they could put their early season struggles and inconsistency behind them and could make a run for the championship in the second half. The inaugural race at [[New Hampshire International Speedway]] proved the team's optimism was not unfounded. Davey led 38 laps of the event and finished third behind [[Rusty Wallace]] and [[Mark Martin]].\n\n==Death==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2015}}\nOn July 12, 1993, Allison boarded his newly acquired [[MD Helicopters MD 500|Hughes 369HS]] helicopter to fly to [[Talladega Superspeedway]] to watch family friend [[Neil Bonnett]] and his son David test a car for David's [[Busch Series]] debut. He picked up another family friend, racer [[Red Farmer]], en route to the track. Allison was attempting to land the helicopter inside a fenced-in area of the track infield when the craft nosed up suddenly, then crashed. The [[National Transportation Safety Board]]<ref>https://app.ntsb.gov/pdfgenerator/ReportGeneratorFile.ashx?EventID=20001211X12761&AKey=1&RType=HTML&IType=FA</ref> (NTSB) blamed the crash on Allison's inexperience in helicopters, coupled with the decision to attempt a landing. Neil Bonnett freed the semi-conscious Farmer from the wreckage, but Allison was unresponsive and could not be freed until paramedics arrived. Farmer went on to a lengthy but successful recovery, but Allison never regained consciousness after sustaining a critical head injury. He was pronounced dead at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. the next morning by a neurosurgeon at [[Carraway Methodist Medical Center]] in Birmingham after a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain proved unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Siano|first1=Joseph|title=Davey Allison, Stock-Car Driver, Dies at 32 After Helicopter Crash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/14/obituaries/davey-allison-stock-car-driver-dies-at-32-after-helicopter-crash.html|accessdate=17 January 2015|work=The New York Times|date=July 14, 1993}}</ref>\n\nThousands packed the auditorium at St. Aloysious Church in [[Bessemer, Alabama]], to pay their respects at his funeral.

In his short [[NASCAR]] [[Winston Cup]] career, Allison posted 19 wins, 66 top-five finishes, and 92 top-ten finishes. He also won 14 poles and earned $6,724,174.  He is survived by his wife, Liz, and two children: daughter Krista Marie and son Robert \"Robbie\" Grey.\n\n==Tribute==\n{{one source|section|date=June 2015}}\nTen years after Allison's first win, Texaco debuted the throwback Battlestar paint scheme in his memory. It ran two races, but in the second, at the 1997 DieHard 500 in October, [[Ernie Irvan]] put the throwback Battlestar on the pole. Later, Texaco would often use the throwback paint scheme for their drivers at the track until they discontinued sponsorship.\n\nThe R. K. Allen Oil Company, the Talladega-based distributor for Texaco in the area, remembered the legacy of Allison with the Talladega-Texaco Walk of Fame in Talladega, where fans vote drivers, past and present, to a specially themed \"hall of fame\" for drivers. The induction ceremony takes place at the [[1000Bulbs.com 500]] weekend.\n\n===Talladega Walk of Fame members===\nNote: Starting in 2003, only one inactive driver was voted, unlike the past, when two were voted.

The Walk of Fame induction was moved from July to October in 1997, and was in September in 2003.\n\n2.  Hamilton was voted by fans to the Walk of Fame in 2000;  the Board of Directors did not want the retiring Waltrip, whose 84 wins was the most by a driver who started his career after 1972 (when the schedule was reduced to the current format) to be inducted as an inactive driver, so he was automatically inducted by the board.  It should be known Waltrip was very unpopular at Talladega in his prime for his feuds with all three Allisons, starting when he replaced Donnie in the DiGard racing car in 1975;  ironically, it was Waltrip who was a relief driver driving when Donnie won the [[1977 Talladega 500]].  Also, Waltrip's associate sponsor was the Havoline brand of oil in 2000 (Texaco was associated with Kmart-sponsored cars during the 1990s).\n\n3.

Tabloid television programs and newspapers gave much coverage to the story at the time, with some claiming that the two had been lovers before Allison's death.  Liz has openly discussed her relationship with Diffie, most recently on the Paul Finebaum Radio Network during the week of the 2006 race at Talladega. Liz expressed some regret over the relationship and mentioned that she and Diffie were band-aids for each other, and band aids were not meant to be permanent.\n\nLiz Allison and their two children moved to Nashville and she married physical therapist Ryan Hackett on May 13, 2000. After being divorced for four years, Bobby and Judy Allison reunited at the wedding, after nearly seven years of tragedy had separated them.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/457/v-print/story/773539.html NASCAR legend Bobby Allison relives glory, sorrow], ''The Miami Herald'', November 15, 2008.</ref>\n\nOn April 28, 2003, the mayor of Hueytown, Alabama, declared it Davey Allison Day and is celebrated on the weekend of the [[Aaron's 499|springtime Talladega race]].\n\nDue to Allison's death, Robert Yates initially chose not to field a car at the 1993 Miller Genuine Draft 400, stating \"It's hard to race with tears in your eyes\". Yates would return to Talladega with [[Robby Gordon]] replacing Allison in the No. 28, but he lost control of the Texaco/Havoline Ford early in the race and crashed and finished last. [[Lake Speed]] would take over driving duties until the 1993 Southern 500. [[Ernie Irvan]], would later take over the ride at the Mountain Dew Southern 500 and won the Goody's 500 at Martinsville Speedway and it was a heartwarming time for Irvan's crew as it marked their first time back to victory lane since Allison's death. Irvan would also win the Mello Yello 500 at Charlotte as well. Racing Champions ran the No. 28 Havoline Ford with Ernie Irvan replacing Allison as the driver in tribute of the win.\n\nAllison also had his own brand of [[chili con carne|chili]] by Bunker Hill with his face on the can.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[Stuart Ashen|Ashen, Stuart]] |date=March 19, 2017 |title=32 Year Old Chili and 38 Year Old Beer |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jq81Ckwdtk |access-date=March 19, 2017 |ref=ashens}}</ref> Allison also had a [[comic book]] printed about him during his racing days.<ref name=\"comicbookdb\">{{cite web |url=http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=249998 |title=NASCAR Adventures (1991)&nbsp;\u2013 #4 \"Davey Allison\" |work=ComicBookDB.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20170320033252/http://comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=249998 |archivedate=2017-03-20 |accessdate=2017-03-19 }}</ref>\n\nA road called \"Allison-Bonnett Memorial Drive\" in his hometown is honored by him, along with fellow native Neil Bonnett, who died a year after Davey.\n\nIn the videogames ''[[NASCAR 99]]'' and ''[[NASCAR 2000]]'', he appears as an unlockable NASCAR Legend with his Texaco Ford that he drove from 1987\u20131989.\n\nAllison's livery style has been used as tributes by Ford (Robert Yates NASCAR Hall of Fame), Dr. Pepper / 7 Up Group (an associate sponsor of Allison in 1992 and 93), and Chevron (at least two occasions, primarily at Talladega, the Battlestar livery has been used as a retro livery).  Most notably, Irvan put the 1987 Battlestar livery on the pole at the October 1997 Talladega race, much to the delight of fans.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

On knowing about Arjuna's penance, [[Duryodhana]] sent a demon Mookasura to kill Arjuna. Demon Mookasura took the form of a wild boar to interrupt Arjuna's worship. On knowing this, Lord Shiva appeared there in the form of a hunter. It is also believed that the four [[Vedas]] followed the lord in the form of dogs to protect Arjuna.  The lord shot an arrow on the boar and killed it. At the same time, Arjuna had also released an arrow from his bow. Thereafter a scuffle arose between the two as to whose arrow had killed the boar. The scuffle leads to a fight and [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] broke Arjuna's bow.\n\nAngered by this, Arjuna hit Lord Shiva with his broken bow. This beating was felt throughout the world. The lord then kicked Arjuna and he went flying in the air. But because of the mercy of Goddess Parvathi, he fell in the temple's sacred tank. Arjuna then realised that the hunter was none other than Lord Shiva himself and begged his pardon. Lord Shiva and Goddess [[Parvati|Parvathi]] gave darshan to Arjuna and blessed him with the Paasupathasthiram (an arrow).\n\nAfter Shiva left, the [[Lokapalas]] appeared before Arjuna and then [[Kubera]], [[Yama]], and [[Varuna]] also blessed each of their potent weapons to Arjuna.
