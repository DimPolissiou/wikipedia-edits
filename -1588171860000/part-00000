The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marian Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter is a spoof of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' when Marian's niece Raven (played by guest [[Bernadette Peters]]) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marian assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marian meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marian forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marian also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marian's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marian who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|Oldest Man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marian's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".

It was one of the largest [[landslide]]s in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the [[rubble]]. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a constant state of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.\n\nThe railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened.  The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in 1911 amid fears that another slide was possible. The town's population nearly doubled its pre-slide population by 1906, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in 1917. The community is now part of the [[Crowsnest Pass, Alberta|Municipality of Crowsnest Pass]] in the Province of [[Alberta]] and has a population around 200. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination.  It has been designated a [[Provincial Historic Sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site of Alberta]] and is home to an [[interpretation centre|interpretive centre]] that receives over 100,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Background==\nThe town of [[Frank, Alberta|Frank]] was founded in the southwestern corner of the [[District of Alberta]], a subdivision of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1901. A location was chosen near the base of [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]] in the [[Crowsnest Pass]], where coal had been discovered one year earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=55}}</ref> It was named after [[Henry Frank]] who, along with [[Samuel Gebo]], owned the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company, which operated the mine that the town was created to support.<ref name=\"Anderson56\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=6}}</ref> The pair celebrated the founding of the town on September 10, 1901, with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders, sporting events, a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community.  The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) ran special trains that brought over 1,400 people from neighbouring communities to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Anderson56\" /> By April 1903, the permanent population had reached 600,<ref name=\"EpochTimes109\">{{citation |last=Reichel |first=Justina |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/canada/frank-slide-remembered-227569.html |title=Frank Slide remembered |work=The Epoch Times |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> and the town featured a two-storey school and four hotels.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=57}}</ref>\n\nTurtle Mountain stands immediately south of Frank.

A. G. Haultain|Frederick Haultain]] arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had investigated the top of Turtle Mountain.  Though new fissures had formed at the peak, they felt there was limited further risk to the town; nevertheless, the CPR's chief engineer felt that Frank was in imminent danger from another slide.  Siding with the latter, Haultain ordered the town evacuated,<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=91}}</ref> and the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC) sent two of its top geologists to investigate further.  They reported that the slide had created two new peaks on the mountain and that the north peak, overlooking the town, was not in imminent danger of collapse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=33}}</ref>  As a result, the evacuation order was lifted on May 10 and Frank's citizens returned.<ref name=\"Anderson93\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=93}}</ref>  The [[North-West Mounted Police]], reinforced by officers who arrived from [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Macleod]] and [[Calgary]], kept tight control of the town and ensured that no cases of [[looting]] occurred during the evacuation.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=92}}</ref>\n\nClearing the Canadian Pacific Railway line was of paramount importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=30}}</ref> Approximately {{convert|2|km|mi}} of the main line had been buried under the slide, along with part of an auxiliary line.<ref name=\"FSICFAQ\" />  The CPR had the line cleared and rebuilt within three weeks.<ref name=\"CBCArchives\" /> Intent on reopening the mine, workers opened passageways to the old mine works by May 30.

A prism connected to cables monitors the mountain for movement.]]\nAn unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, was also a factor. Water in the mountain's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports.<ref name=\"vanHerk385\" /> Heavy snowfall in the region in March was followed by a warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" />  GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide.  The crew of the freight train that arrived at Frank shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter, with overnight temperatures falling below {{convert|\u221218|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. Geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures, causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Anderson96\" />\n\nThough the GSC concluded that mining activities contributed to the slide, the facility's owners disagreed. Their engineers claimed that the mine bore no responsibility.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=38}}</ref>  Later studies suggested that the mountain had been at a point of \"equilibrium\"; even a small deformation such as that caused by the mine's existence would have helped trigger a slide.<ref>{{harvnb|Benko|Stead|1998|p=311}}</ref> The mine was quickly re-opened, even though rock continued to tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" /> Coal production at Frank peaked in 1910,<ref name=\"Kerr36\">{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=36}}</ref> but the mine was permanently closed in 1917 after it became unprofitable.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" />\n\nThe slide created two new peaks on the mountain; the south peak stands {{convert|2200|m|ft}} high and the north peak {{convert|2100|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"FrankSlideFacts\">{{citation |url=https://frankslide.ca/sites/frankslide/files/editor_files/Frank_Slide_Facts%20(1).pdf |title=Frank Slide facts |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=2019-04-29}}</ref> Geologists believe that another slide is inevitable, though not imminent.

Around {{convert|110|e6t|e6ST|abbr=none}} of [[limestone]] rock slid down [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]].<ref name=\"FrankSlideFacts\" /> Witnesses reported that within 100 seconds the rock reached up the opposing hills, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest [[landslide]]s in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the [[rubble]]. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a constant state of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.\n\nThe railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened.  The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in 1911 amid fears that another slide was possible. The town's population nearly doubled its pre-slide population by 1906, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in 1917. The community is now part of the [[Crowsnest Pass, Alberta|Municipality of Crowsnest Pass]] in the Province of [[Alberta]] and has a population around 200. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination.  It has been designated a [[Provincial Historic Sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site of Alberta]] and is home to an [[interpretation centre|interpretive centre]] that receives over 100,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Background==\nThe town of [[Frank, Alberta|Frank]] was founded in the southwestern corner of the [[District of Alberta]], a subdivision of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1901. A location was chosen near the base of [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]] in the [[Crowsnest Pass]], where coal had been discovered one year earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=55}}</ref> It was named after [[Henry Frank]] who, along with [[Samuel Gebo]], owned the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company, which operated the mine that the town was created to support.<ref name=\"Anderson56\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=6}}</ref> The pair celebrated the founding of the town on September 10, 1901, with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders, sporting events, a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community.  The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) ran special trains that brought over 1,400 people from neighbouring communities to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Anderson56\" /> By April 1903, the permanent population had reached 600,<ref name=\"EpochTimes109\">{{citation |last=Reichel |first=Justina |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/canada/frank-slide-remembered-227569.html |title=Frank Slide remembered |work=The Epoch Times |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> and the town featured a two-storey school and four hotels.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=57}}</ref>\n\nTurtle Mountain stands immediately south of Frank.

A. G. Haultain|Frederick Haultain]] arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had investigated the top of Turtle Mountain.  Though new fissures had formed at the peak, they felt there was limited further risk to the town; nevertheless, the CPR's chief engineer felt that Frank was in imminent danger from another slide.  Siding with the latter, Haultain ordered the town evacuated,<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=91}}</ref> and the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC) sent two of its top geologists to investigate further.  They reported that the slide had created two new peaks on the mountain and that the north peak, overlooking the town, was not in imminent danger of collapse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=33}}</ref>  As a result, the evacuation order was lifted on May 10 and Frank's citizens returned.<ref name=\"Anderson93\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=93}}</ref>  The [[North-West Mounted Police]], reinforced by officers who arrived from [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Macleod]] and [[Calgary]], kept tight control of the town and ensured that no cases of [[looting]] occurred during the evacuation.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=92}}</ref>\n\nClearing the Canadian Pacific Railway line was of paramount importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=30}}</ref> Approximately {{convert|2|km|mi}} of the main line had been buried under the slide, along with part of an auxiliary line.<ref name=\"FSICFAQ\" />  The CPR had the line cleared and rebuilt within three weeks.<ref name=\"CBCArchives\" /> Intent on reopening the mine, workers opened passageways to the old mine works by May 30.

A prism connected to cables monitors the mountain for movement.]]\nAn unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, was also a factor. Water in the mountain's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports.<ref name=\"vanHerk385\" /> Heavy snowfall in the region in March was followed by a warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" />  GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide.

Over the next few years, he laid the foundation for the modern theme park by installing various permanent rides and developing areas of the grounds in progressive stages. In the 1980s, Broome opened a succession of rides and roller coasters around the park, including [[Corkscrew (Alton Towers)|Corkscrew]], Pirate Ship (now The Blade), [[Alpine Bobsleigh]], [[The Flume (Alton Towers)|The Flume]], and [[Black Hole (roller coaster)|The Black Hole]].\n\nBroome sold Alton Towers to [[The Tussauds Group]], then a division of [[Pearson plc]], in 1990, after encountering financial troubles in attempting to develop the former [[Battersea Power Station]] into a similar theme park. The change of ownership brought an era of major redevelopment and promotion, involving the opening of large themed areas and new attractions, such as [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] (1992), [[Duel - The Haunted House Strikes Back!|The Haunted House]] (1992), [[Toyland Tours]] (1994), and [[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]] (1994). Later, [[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]] (1998) and Air (2002, now [[Galactica (roller coaster)|Galactica]]) saw the park sustain its reputation for major roller coasters, both marketed as 'World First' rides. Tussauds' park development team from 1990 to 2002 included well-known attraction producer [[John Wardley]], among experienced others.\n\nThe Tussauds Group was sold to venture capitalist firm Charterhouse in 1998, then to [[Dubai International Capital]] (DIC) for \u00a3800 million in 2005.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Dubai firm buys Tussauds\n| work=BBC News\n| date=23 March 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4375219.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref> The Tussauds Group was then bought by [[Merlin Entertainments]] in March 2007 for over \u00a31billion from DIC, placing Alton Towers under their control.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Tussauds firm bought in \u00a31bn deal\n| work=BBC News\n| date=23 March 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6419019.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2007, [[The Blackstone Group]] purchased [[The Tussauds Group]] for US$1.9 billion and merged it into [[Merlin Entertainments]] with management by Merlin.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2812377/Merlin-conjures-up-leaseback-deal.html|title=Merlin conjures up leaseback deal|date=17 July 2007|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/05/AR2007030501369.html|title=Blackstone Buys Madame Tussauds Chain|first=David|last=Cho|date=6 March 2007|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> Dubai International Capital also gained 20% of Merlin Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6419019.stm |work=BBC News| title=Tussauds firm bought in \u00a31bn deal | date=5 March 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 July 2007, Alton Towers was sold to private investor [[Nick Leslau]]'s investment firm Prestbury under a sale and leaseback agreement.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6902797.stm |work=BBC News| title=Alton Towers sold in \u00a3622m deal | date=17 July 2007}}</ref> Merlin continues to operate the site under a renewable 35-year lease.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> As of 2016, the property is now transferred to Secure Income REIT Plc, of which Nick Leslau is a non-executive director.<ref name=\"Secure Income REIT Plc\" />\n\n== Rides and attractions ==\n\n=== Roller coasters ===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n!

Themed loosely as a town street, it leads to views of the gardens and the Towers across the lake in the distance. Along the pathway are the park's jumping frog fountains and a lawn where seasonal events take place. The first ''SkyRide'' station is located nearby, which is a 1048&nbsp;m long [[Aerial lift|cable car]] transport that opened in 1987, and was refurbished 2009. The [[monorail]] moves guests from the three on-site hotels and the water park to the theme park; it opened 1987 and was refurbished in 2008. In this area during the hour before the park's daily closure, departing guests are entertained by three people wearing police costumes, two of them riding [[Segway]]-like vehicles which play party music and the third standing with an old-fashioned megaphone that is unused, and a man riding a miniature ship while dressed as a sea captain.\n\n=== Katanga Canyon ===\nThemed as an African village; created in 1992 and incorporated existing rapids ride. Rides include the roller coaster [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] and [[Congo River Rapids (Alton Towers)|Congo River Rapids]]. Both are well-established rides in the park whose ride tracks share a tunnel. Congo River Rapids is a river rapids ride that opened 1986, as The Grand Canyon Rapids, and was refurbished in 1992. A 735 m long wild river rapids ride down the Congo River that lasts six minutes. Runaway Mine Train is a steel sit down powered coaster that reaches a speed of 22&nbsp;mph (36&nbsp;km/h) on a 1000&nbsp;ft long track (305 m) and height of {{convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}}; height limit 90&nbsp;cm. It was designed by [[John Wardley]] for Tussauds and manufactured by [[Mack Rides]].\n\n=== Gloomy Wood ===\nGloomy Wood serves as the area for the dark ride ''[[Duel (ride)|Duel - The Haunted House Strikes Back!]]'', originally ''The Haunted House''. Opening in 1992, this was originally Europe's largest haunted dark ride, but was significantly altered with interactive laser guns in 2003. Each player's shooting score is recorded on a display in the ride car, as guests shoot targets around the ride.\n\nIn 2007, a themed footpath through the woods was added to the area, named ''Haunted Hollow''. The pathway follows the route formerly used by the park's old scenic railway, linking from Mutiny Bay. ''Haunted Hollow'' includes tombstones, statues and other features, some of which interact with guests using sound effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altontowers.com/rides-and-attractions/fun-rides/haunted-hollow/|title=Haunted Hollow - Theme Park Experience at Alton Towers Resort|website=www.altontowers.com}}</ref> In July 2015, Nitrogenie opened and replaced the old Waffles and Ices, a shop producing ice cream using liquid [[nitrogen]]. Gloomy Wood was suggested by the 2017 park map to be home to the new ''Wicker Man'' wooden coaster, opening 2018. However, the park later stated that the ride was in Mutiny Bay.\n\n=== Forbidden Valley ===\n[[File:Alton Towers Forbidden Valley ride signs.jpg|thumb|Theming and signs in Forbidden Valley]]\nForbidden Valley is set in a '[[post-apocalyptic]]' landscape, with [[standing stones]] and rustic structures populating the 'valley'. A ''SkyRide'' station also serves this area of the park.\n\nThe area's principal attraction is ''[[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]]'', opened in 1994. ''Nemesis'' is a steel inverted coaster that reaches a speed of 50&nbsp;mph (81&nbsp;km) with four inversions, set in a rocky quarry over waterfalls. The ride is built down into excavated ground and was designed by Tussauds, primarily [[John Wardley]]. The attraction is themed as an alien creature inhabiting the quarry where the coaster is situated. \n\n''The Blade'' is a Huss Pirate Boat modified with a pendulum blade. It opened in 1980, and was relocated to the area in 1997 from Fantasy World. The Blade currently operates as the only flat ride in Forbidden Valley since the removal of ''[[Ripsaw (Alton Towers)|Ripsaw]]''. However, in October 2019, The Blade was dismantled to be 'Resharpened by the Phalanx' and has been added back to the Alton Towers app hinting it\u2019s return.\n\n[[Galactica (roller coaster)|Galactica]] is a B&M flying coaster, originally opening as ''Air'' in 2002. Air was loosely themed as a peaceful landscape, distanced from the 'apocalyptic' look of Nemesis. Air was redesigned as Galactica in 2016, adopting [[virtual reality]] headsets and a space travel theme. The VR headsets have since been removed due to feedback from customers.<ref name=\"Twitter170320191501\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/altontowers/status/1107295909078097923|date=17 March 2019|accessdate=18 March 2019|title=Reply to user @Ev_Jay|quote=Galactica no longer features VR due to guest feedback regarding their experience on the ride.|publisher=Alton Towers official Twitter account}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, the '[[Rollercoaster Restaurant]]' opened, offering a dining experience where guests have their food delivered by looping rails.

The ride originally had this name, until 2010 when it was known as ''Sonic Spinball'' until the name change back in 2016 when a contract ended with SEGA after six years. The ride is a Maurer S\u00f6hne spinning roller coaster, in which riders sit in cars that can spin on their base whilst travelling at speed around the track. For the park map, Spinball Whizzer is listed as being in The Towers area.\n\nAdventure Land is named after the adventure play ground which previously sat on the site. The former play area was one of the attractions of a larger area called Kiddies Kingdom. In 1996, Kiddies Kingdom was split into Adventure Land and Storybook Land.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adventure Land |url=https://towersstreet.com/theme-park/area/adventure-land/#areahistory |website=towersstreet.com |accessdate=17 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== X-Sector ===\n[[File:Oblivion2015.JPG|thumb|View of Oblivion]]\nX-Sector is themed as a secretive industrial complex, suggested to be subjecting park guests to experimental testing.\n\nThe area currently contains three thrill rides. The steel dive coaster ''[[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]]'' which opened in 1998 as \"the world's first vertical drop rollercoaster\", designed by Tussauds and manufactured by [[Bolliger & Mabillard]]. The cars are held over the edge of the drop for three seconds, before diving into a deep tunnel. ''[[The Smiler]]'' is a [[Gerstlauer]] [[Infinity Coaster]] which opened in May 2013 and currently holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster at 14.<ref name=\"Uttoxeter Advertiser\"/>  ''Enterprise'' is a standard HUSS [[Enterprise (ride)|Enterprise]] model which opened in 1984, spinning riders 360 degrees and giving the illusion of defying gravity. The area layout was partially altered in 2013 season to accommodate the opening of The Smiler.\n\nPrevious rides in X-Sector include The [[Black Hole (roller coaster)|Black Hole]], which was a Jet Star 2 coaster enclosed in a tent, where The Smiler is located today. [[Boneshaker (Alton Towers)|Energizer]] (later renamed Boneshaker) was a swinging gondola flat ride. It was replaced by [[Submission (Alton Towers)|Submission]] in 2001, a \"Chance Double Inverter\" flat ride, which was itself removed in 2014.\n\n=== Mutiny Bay ===\n[[File:Alton Towers 05.jpg|thumb|Mutiny Bay's pirates]]\nMutiny Bay is a pirate-themed family area, which opened in 2008.<ref name=\"Attractions2009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iaapa.org/ |title=International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions |date=January 2009 |publisher=IAAPA |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> the area was a retheme for Merrie England.\n\nAttractions in Mutiny Bay include: ''[[Battle Galleons]]'', an interactive \"Splash Battle\" boat ride, where guests sit in tracked boats while soaking other riders with water cannons.

'' The Flume'' was a [[Mack Rides|Mack]] log flume ride that opened in 1981 and was rethemed in 2004 with a sponsorship from Imperial Leather alongside the bubbleworks at Chessington world of adventure. Upon opening, it was the longest flume ride in the world at {{Convert|886|m}}.<ref name=\"Attractions2009\" /> Late in the 2015 season, the ride and the neighboring tavern closed and were removed in 2016 to make way for the [[Wicker Man (roller coaster)|Wicker Man]] roller coaster and the \"Welcome Inn\" bar which shares the coaster's theme.\n\nIn 2009, a [[Sea Life Centres|Sea Life Centre]] named ''Sharkbait Reef'' opened in the location previously home to the 3-D Cinema.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for 3-D Cinema replacement|date=March 2020}} This includes \"touch pools\" for interacting with underwater species and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} underwater tunnel.<ref name=\"Sharkbait Reef Info\">{{cite web |title=Sharkbait Reef by SEA LIFE |url=https://www.towerstimes.co.uk/theme-park/mutiny-bay/sharkbait-reef-by-sea-life/ |website=TowersTimes |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== The World of David Walliams ===\n[[File:Alton Towers - Circuit voitures pour enfants.jpg|thumb|Driving School attraction in Cloud Cuckoo Land]]\nThe World of David Walliams is aimed at younger children aged 7-11, featuring bright colours and fantasy decor.

Prior to this, it was first built as \"Talbot Street\" in 1981, becoming the park's first themed area, home to the ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (Alton Towers)|Around The World in 80 Days]]'' and ''[[Doom & Sons]]'' dark rides.\n\nOn 21 July 2009, a fire broke out in the Sky Ride station for this area, caused by a faulty vending machine. The station was completely destroyed and didn't reopen until the 2010 season.\n<ref name=\"towerstimes.co.uk\">https://www.towerstimes.co.uk/theme-park/transportation/skyride/</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, it was announced that Cloud Cuckoo Land will be replaced by \"The World of [[David Walliams]]\" for the 2020 season, which will feature attractions based around Walliams' series of [[children's books]].<ref>https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/alton-towers-open-new-world-17094301</ref>\n\n=== Dark Forest ===\nThe Dark Forest is themed as a supernatural woodland area; to coincide with the opening of ''[[Thirteen (roller coaster)|TH13TEEN]]'', a steel family coaster themed as a haunted [[crypt]], that opened on 20 March 2010. Th13teen, features the \"world's first freefall drop on a roller coaster\" - an indoor, vertically dropping track element.

Rita used to be themed around drag racing but was changed with the opening of Th13teen and the Dark Forest. With the opening of ''Th13teen'', the area was renamed as Dark Forest and further altered with a new colour scheme and entrance feature. ''Rita'' was also given a repainted control cabin and trains, shortening its name from \"Rita - Queen of Speed\".<ref name=\"thirteen\">{{cite web|title=SW6 Revealed: TH13TEEN|url=http://towersnerd.com/news/item.php?id=193|accessdate=1 December 2009|publisher=Towers Nerd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605233654/http://towersnerd.com/news/item.php?id=193|archive-date=5 June 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== CBeebies Land ===\n{{Main|CBeebies#CBeebies Land|l1=CBeebies: CBeebies Land}}\n\nCBeebies Land is based on the [[BBC]] children's TV channel: [[CBeebies]].

They belonged to the Talbot family as a stately home until 1924 and largely designed by [[Augustus Pugin]], also noted for his work on the [[Palace of Westminster]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|website=Explore Parliament}}</ref> The Towers are now in a state of disrepair following decades of neglect. The ruins are open to the public during most of the open season. However, some areas are closed off as part of a \u00a31.1 million project in place to restore the oldest parts of the Towers. Key areas of The Towers include the banqueting hall, the chapel, conservatories, and Her Ladyship's Gardens.\n\n''[[Hex \u2013 The Legend of the Towers]]'', a walk-through dark ride based within the ruins themselves, opened in 2000. The finale to the ride is a Vekoma [[Madhouse (ride)|Madhouse]] located away from the real Towers but themed as a secret vault. The storyline is based on a local legend about the [[chained oak]] tree, located in a nearby forest, and makes use of the history of the Towers. It draws its theme from the legend of the 15th Earl of Shrewsbury who was said to be cursed by a beggar woman to suffer death every time a branch falls from an old oak tree.\n\nDuring the park's Halloween 'Scarefest' event multiple scare mazes operate within the Towers themselves. For 2018's Scarefest event these were; Sub Species: the End Games, and Altonville Mine Tours.\n\n=== The Gardens ===\n[[File:Alton Towers gardens - geograph.org.uk - 1464404.jpg|thumb|Gardens created by the eccentric 15th [[Earl of Shrewsbury]]]]\n\nNear the garden entrance is a [[cenotaph]] to the 15th Earl, a marble bust with an inscription reading \"He made the desert smile\". Landmarks include a Chinese Pagoda Fountain, The Swiss Cottage, Miniature 'Stonehenge', a Greek Choragic Monument, and orangeries.\n\n== Alton Towers Waterpark ==\n{{Main|Alton Towers Waterpark}}\n[[File:Alton Towers Waterpark1.JPG|thumbnail|left|Alton Towers Waterpark]]\nThe Alton Towers Waterpark, formerly known as Cariba Creek, opened alongside the Splash Landings Hotel in 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Making a splash with a 'waterpark hotel'\n |work        = Daily Mail\n |url         = http://www.altontowers.com/waterpark/openingpricing.asp\n |access-date = 14 January 2014\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070325013647/http://www.altontowers.com/waterpark/openingpricing.asp\n |archivedate = 25 March 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> It is a large (with 7 pools and 10 water slides), part-indoor and part outdoor waterpark themed as a tropical Caribbean lagoon. The waterpark features several fast slides, a [[lazy river]], a giant tipping bucket and many other water features. Also located there are two food and drink venues: Adventures Cave and Ice Cream Shack. Unlike [[Chessington Zoo]] at the also [[Merlin Entertainments|Merlin]] operated [[Chessington World of Adventures Resort]], a separate ticket is needed for waterpark access as it is not included with the theme park entrance price.\n\nAttractions include ''Lagoona Bay'', which is the main tropical pool, with water cannons, geysers and waterfalls. ''The Little Leak'' is a paddling pool for young children with two small slides and interactive pipes to play with, while ''Wacky Waterworks Treehouse'' is a wooden 'treehouse' with water cannons, and other interactive features to squirt passing people with.\n\nThe largest ride in the Waterpark is the [[Water Coaster (Mack Rides)|water coaster]] ''The Master Blaster'', with uphill sections similar to the ''Master Blaster'' at [[Sandcastle Water Park (Blackpool)|Sandcastle Waterpark]], ''Blackpool'' and ''Nucleus'' at [[Water World, Stoke-on-Trent]]. ''The Master Blaster'' is a high speed water flume that contains sharp turns, drops and dark sections, and has views of the entire indoor area of the waterpark.\n\nOther rides include ''Rush & Rampage'', twin racing slides where riders experience wide turns. This attraction requires rubber rings. ''Lazy River (Calypso Creek)'' is a slow-moving water circuit, taking riders underneath spraying water jets and tipping buckets of water. Rubber rings are available. ''The Tipping Bucket'' is a container filled with 1000 litres of water which regularly tips its contents over people standing below. ''Flash Floods'' are tiered outdoor pools with two slides leading to the middle pool and three leading to the bottom. Other swimming pools include ''Volcanic Springs'', and indoor heated hot pool, and ''Bubbly Wubbly Pool'', an outdoor heated pool and whirlpool.\n\nThe indoor section of the water park operates 12 months a year excluding Christmas Day and Boxing Day, although it closes for winter maintenance for around 2 weeks each January.\n\n== Resort accommodation ==\n[[File:Alton Towers Hotel, Staffordshire - geograph.org.uk - 6099.jpg|thumb|The fountain at the entrance to Alton Towers Hotel]]\n\n=== Alton Towers Hotel ===\nThe Alton Towers Hotel opened on 10 April 1996 and is themed to the eccentric fictional character Sir Algenon Alton and his travels. The rooms are decorated in a quirky English style with pictures of Sir Algenon's inventions. The hotel is four star and has 180 rooms. The hotel was the first phase in a plan to turn the theme park into a multi-day resort.\n\nThe Alton Towers Hotel is currently undergoing a long term phased refurbishment to theme each floor to a different setting. So far, the plan has produced the Moon Voyage Bedrooms and Arctic Explorer Bedrooms.\n\n=== Splash Landings Hotel ===\nThe Splash Landings Hotel opened in 2003. The hotel has a relaxed Caribbean theme and is attached to the [[Alton Towers Waterpark]]. It is also four star and it has 216 rooms with a choice of six-room types, Family of 4 'Beachcomber' room, Family of 6 'Beachcomber' room, The Ice Age Suites, The Pirate Suites, Interconnected Family of 4 'Beachcomber' room and, Interconnected Family of 3 'Beachcomber' Room. The interconnected rooms are all on the ground floor and the family of 3 rooms are also disabled accessible. The rooms are numbered in the ranges of 1101 to 1159, 1201 to 1259, 1301 to 1359 and, 1401 to 1459, there are a few room numbers that are not used due to the shape of the hotel, these are 27, 29, 31, 33 and 35 on each floor.\n\n=== Enchanted Village ===\nThe Enchanted Village is made up of 120 lodges and 5 secluded treehouses set in the fictional ''Enchanted Forest'' woodland. Situated next to the Alton Towers hotel, it features new recreational activities, such as various playgrounds for children and an archery range, which is available to use at no extra cost. The site is also home to \"The Crooked Spoon\" restaurant, and also an additional shop which sells alcohol and outdoor activity toys.\n\nThe Enchanted Village opened to the public on 18 April 2015.\n\nAlton Towers have submitted planning application to expand the Enchanted Village in several phases. The application has been approved and if the plans go ahead, construction on the first phase will commence in 2018 with a scheduled opening of March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.towerstimes.co.uk/enchanted-village/ |title=Enchanted Village |publisher=TowersTimes |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== CBeebies Land Hotel ===\nThe CBeebies Land Hotel opened on 8 July 2017, the hotel has a total of 76 themed rooms: 42 standard rooms (themed to the CBeebies Bugbies) and 34 premium rooms themed to different CBeebies shows, such as ''Something Special'' and ''Swashbuckle''. Room amenities include child-friendly features, such as steps up to the sink and children's toilet seats. The hotel features CBeebies-themed shows and entertainment, which run every day of the year, as well as the \"Windmill Restaurant\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.altontowers.com/2017/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827103207/https://www.altontowers.com/2017/ |archive-date=27 August 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Stargazing Pods ===\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\nAlthough Alton Towers had previously gained the necessary permits to expand the Enchanted Village, these plans were eventually scrapped and reduced into a \"pod\"-style accommodation option. 102 individual pods were constructed, each sleeping up to four people.\n\nThe proposals have faced some critical views from the public, with many criticisms being raised over the capacity of bathroom facilities as well as how the resort will cope with the increased demand in food and beverages, as the Stargazing Pods will not have its own restaurant or bar facilities. The council even initially rejected the application citing lack of imagination and \"magic\", although the plans were granted permission the second time without making any notable improvements.\n\nThe Stargazing Pods opened on 12 April 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altontowers.com/short-breaks/stargazing-pods/|title=Stargazing Pods|website=www.altontowers.com|language=en|access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recreation ==\n\n=== Alton Towers Spa ===\nAlton Towers Spa is part of the Alton Towers Hotel and opened in 2004. It includes relaxation and treatment rooms and an adults only swimming pool. Despite being inside the Alton Towers Hotel, non-hotel guests are able to use the Spa.\n\n=== Extraordinary Golf ===\nOpened in 2007, the Extraordinary Golf mini-golf attraction is themed to different rides and attractions at the park, some of which, are from the park's history. Extraordinary Golf is located to the west of the Splash Landings Hotel. Extraordinary Golf was refreshed for 2016 including the addition of a Galactica themed hole.\n\n=== Tree Top Quest ===\nOpened May 2015, the Enchanted Forest Tree Top Quest is a high ropes course near the Enchanted Village. The attraction opened shortly after, and accompanies, the Enchanted Village development. There is also a low ropes course. Tree Top Quest did not open for the 2018 season or the start of the 2019 season due to budget cuts by parent company, Merlin Entertainments. It is expected to reopen on 13 July 2019.<ref>https://www.altontowers.com/activities/tree-top-quest/</ref>\n\n== Future developments ==\nAlton Towers is working with children's author [[David Walliams]] to develop a new themed area, 'World of David Walliams', replacing Cloud Cuckoo Land in Spring 2020, the new area will feature a dark ride themed to the author's [[Gangsta Granny]] children's book.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chamberlain |first1=Zoe |title=Alton Towers to open new 'World of David Walliams' attraction |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/alton-towers-open-new-world-17094301 |website=Birmingham Mail |accessdate=11 November 2019 |date=17 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlton Towers is located in a [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|Conservation Area]], which puts restrictions on its permissible development, notably that no structures in the park should be built above tree line and if so should be disguised from external views of the park; this can be seen on the ride [[Rita (roller coaster)|Rita]], where the highest sections of track are camouflaged green.\n\nNoise pollution is also a problem for the park due to the close proximity to the villages of Alton and Farley and the town of [[Cheadle, Staffordshire|Cheadle]]. There have been several cases where Alton Towers have been taken to court over the noise levels emitted from the park and have been served noise abatement orders in 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n\n== Secret Weapon roller coasters ==\nAlton Towers has a tradition of codenaming its new roller coaster developments as \"Secret Weapon\", or \"SW\", followed by a number. The name is associated with the park's inclination to promote its rides as holding \"world first\" or in some way \"innovative\" features and records. However the naming tradition actually began for unrelated reasons, since \"Secret Weapon\" was the working title of a roller coaster that was ultimately never commissioned.\n\nSW1 was a [[pipeline roller coaster]], planned to open in around 1992, on what later became the Nemesis site. It was provisionally titled the \"Secret Weapon\", with the intention of theming the ride as an ambiguous weapon testing facility.<ref name=\"The Secret Wepons\">{{cite web|title=The Secret Weapons - Developing the Magic|url=http://old.towerstimes.co.uk/history/articles/secretweapons.htm|website=towerstimes.co.uk|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131104102401/http://old.towerstimes.co.uk/history/articles/secretweapons.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref> [[John Wardley]] rode the [[Arrow Dynamics]] prototype of their pipeline coaster, but stated \"it was very slow and rather boring\",<ref name=\"The creation of Nemesis\">{{cite web|last1=Wardley|first1=John|title=The creation of Nemesis|url=http://www.towersalmanac.com/features/multimedia.php?id=19|website=Alton Towers Almanac|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref> as well as the requirement for such a high lift hill being unsuitable for the park's planning restrictions. After a second layout revision, labelled \"SW2\", the ride was scrapped and development on SW3 ([[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]]) began.<ref name=\"The Secret Wepons\"/><ref name=\"The creation of Nemesis\"/> The code name subsequently became the standard preliminary name for major roller coaster projects at the park.\n\nThe naming convention was briefly dropped while the Tussauds Group changed ownership under [[Dubai International Capital]], before being continued by Merlin Entertainments.\n\n== Events ==\n{{Overly detailed|date=January 2019}}\nPrior to the main open season, Alton Towers held the February Half-Term event which saw a selected ride offering opened for the week before the start of the main season in March, however the event was cancelled for 2016; with the exception of Sharkbait Reef which was open for Pirate and Princess Week held at the Resort hotels.\n\n=== Concerts ===\nAlton Towers has a history of hosting concerts since the 1960s. Concerts in recent years have included the Alton Towers Live event in 2011 and 2013. In 2010, there was an 80s concert for the 30th Anniversary featuring [[Rick Astley]] and [[Bananarama]] and also that year hosted a [[P!nk]] concert. In the past these concerts were often held in the car park at an additional fee, however more recently concerts have been held within the theme park. Artists that have performed there include [[Tina Turner]] and [[The Black Eyed Peas]].\n\n=== Oktoberfest ===\nThe \"Alton Towers Oktoberfest\" is a new event scheduled to take place in weekends during late September and early October 2020. It is based on the German festival of [[Oktoberfest]] held traditionally in Munich, Germany. The event will involve themed food and drink, entertainment and extended evening hours with selected rides open.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Oktoberfest? |url=https://support.altontowers.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006001078-What-is-Oktoberfest- |website=Alton Towers Resort |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Scarefest ===\n''Scarefest'' is the resort's largest annual event. It celebrates [[Halloween]] with a number of temporary scare maze attractions, scare zones, costumed characters and extended opening hours. Rides and areas are lit with coloured lighting at night, with most rides and attractions continuing to operate until 9pm. The Scarefest event has been running since 2007, although the park started celebrating Halloween with decoration several years before and has operated the ''Terror of the Towers'' scaremaze since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/alton-towers-scarefest-2016-you-10099966|title=Alton Towers reveals plans for Scarefest 2017 with a new addition|first=Steve|last=Wollaston|date=31 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/trips-and-breaks/review-alton-towers-scarefest-2017-12034148|title=Travel review: Alton Towers Scarefest 2016|first=Justin|last=Connolly|date=15 October 2016}}</ref> The scare mazes are [[upcharge attraction]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Timeline of Halloween scare mazes\n!

A family of inbred hillbillies are outcast due to their hideous disfigurement and warped way of life. Through desperation they begin capturing townsfolk, before removing their skin and stitching it into their own in a hope that this may finally give them the beauty they so desire.\n\n* ''Sub Species: The End Games'', a live action horror maze returning in 2018, which will push the boundaries of Scarefest's mazes with multiple routes. A post-apocalyptic, sewer dwelling community have been infested by a species from another world. In order to survive, they appease the creature's hunger by sacrificing innocent people from the surface. However, over time, insanity has twisted the feeding ritual into a sick contest.

According to local legend, she tries to avenge the death of her charges by taking the spirits of the living as penance - will you be her next victim?\n\n==== Past seasonal Scarefest attractions ====\n* ''Terror of the Towers''. The first incarnation of this long-running annual scare maze was introduced in 2002, and was located in the Towers ruins themselves. Many scenes from the original maze are still used. Visitors walked through the long, winding corridors of the Towers, through themed scenes while being pursued by live actors. The finale featured a winding pathway around actors behind fences, who lunged towards visitors, accompanied with heavy strobe effects. For 2003 it was restructured and given the tagline and theme \"Bloodfest Banquet\".\n\n* \"TH13TEEN: After Dark\" has an enhanced queue line for Alton Towers' newest roller coaster, using fog and lighting effects as well as live actors. This attraction did not return for 2012.\n\n* ''Terror of the Towers&nbsp;\u2013 Bloodfest Banquet'' was a new version of the Terror of the Towers scare maze, running from 2003 to 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-bloodfest-banquet-alton-towers/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194338/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-bloodfest-banquet-alton-towers/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> It retained much of the original version, but featured new scenes that included scripted dialogue from the several characters, and a new storyline was added. The strobe maze finale was moved to another point in the maze and replaced by a new ending, in which visitors become trapped in a small room with cages on every side, as actors reach for them through the metal bars for almost a minute. Every year, Terror of the Towers kept changing slightly with revised scenes and new scares.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-2008-readers-review-2008/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194427/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-2008-readers-review-2008/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> However, for the 2009 Scarefest event, Terror of the Towers was once again completely rethought, with the tagline \"What Lies Within\". The new incarnation drops the scripted scenes and characters; meaning it is similar to the original Terror of Towers of 2002. The whole layout for the maze was also reversed, with what was previously the entrance becoming the exit.\n\n* ''Room 13'' was first introduced in 2006 and was located in the conference room of the Alton Towers Hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61:alton-towers-hotel-room-13&catid=75&Itemid=126 |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325224813/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61%3Aalton-towers-hotel-room-13&catid=75&Itemid=126 |archivedate=25 March 2012 }}</ref> It was only available to guests of the hotel, who were led around the maze as many live actors appeared to scare them. Room 13 had positive reviews and returned in 2007, but was replaced by The Boiler House in 2008.\n\n* ''Field of 1000 Screams'' was first introduced in the 2007 Scarefest event and was the first maze at Alton Towers not situated inside a pre-existing building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/alton-towers-scarefest-maze-reviews-2007/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194613/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/alton-towers-scarefest-maze-reviews-2007/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The Field was located entirely outdoors in a moderately sized field of [[maize]], which had to be planted especially for the event several months earlier. It purported to be a fictional village called Altonville that had become overrun by zombies. Visitors walked down a long pathway cut through the corn, and encountered characters and scares along the way, before the finale took place. The Field of 1000 Screams did not return for the 2010 event.\n\n* ''Haunted Hollow Live'' was first seen in 2007 and consisted of several sinister, costumed actors performing along the Haunted Hollow walkway in Gloomy Wood. The attraction was similar to Duel Live, which was introduced the year later. Haunted Hollow Live returned for the 2008 Scarefest event, but was cancelled for 2009.\n\n* ''Duel Live'' was first introduced in the 2008 Scarefest event. Throughout this period, the park's haunted house dark ride, [[Duel (ride)|Duel]], became host to this attraction, which included live actors situated around the ride circuit. Duel was available to ride normally until 12&nbsp;pm, when the laser guns and LED targets were switched and the actors took their positions. This was changed in 2009, when Duel Live took place throughout the whole day and many more actors than the previous year were present. Duel Live was aimed at the family audience, and included such features as new music playing throughout the ride (instead of the usual Duel theme music), as well as a butler or maid who would welcome you inside the house. The attraction was changed slightly for the 2010 season and featured the park's Scarefest mascots.\n\n* ''Skelvin's Haunted Adventure'' was a newer version of [[Duel (ride)#Duel: Live!|Duel Live]], introduced in 2010, and took over [[Duel (ride)|Duel \u2013 The Haunted House Strikes Back!]] throughout Scarefest. As in previous years, the attraction included live actors situated at different points around the ride. The laser guns and LED targets were switched off during this time. The ride featured the Scarefest mascots, notably the character of \"Skelvin\".\n\n* ''The Boiler House'' was a scare maze first introduced in 2008, and was situated next to the Alton Towers Hotel. Originally, the scare maze was set in an abandoned industrial facility and featured live actors in make up. This was changed in 2009, when a new storyline was added. The scare maze later featured the fictional \"Hamble Twins\" serial killers hiding in the industrial building, and visitors have to escape them as they are chased through the scenes. Visitors queued outside, past a van labelled \"Alton News 24\", from which television screens play news reports on the activity of the serial killers. Guests then walk through a covered walkway, which hides the marquee that the maze is contained in from view. Once inside, a man appears and warns guests about the dangers of coming inside. The murderers then appear and kill him, before chasing visitors away. Each of the Twins are played by two different actors wearing the same grotesque, latex mask. They appear at different points in the maze, creating the illusion that one character is in several places at once. Dim lighting and scent effects are heavily used. For the 2011 Scarefest, The Boiler House moved along with the Carnival of Screams to the X Sector, where they both shared the old Black Hole tent. After three years it did not return for the 2012 season.\n\n* ''Carnival of Screams'' was a scare maze that debuted for the 2010 Scarefest event. During its debut it shared the same temporary building as the Boiler House. John Wardley contributed to the development of ''Carnival of Screams'', which was entered through a large clown face with horrific features. For 2011 it and the Boiler House were relocated to the X-Sector area. The maze is a mixture of humor and serious scares, and the music used is the former ''Toy Land Tours'' attraction theme music warped for dramatic effect. From 2012 onwards, the attraction was situated opposite the hospitality suite, with the exit inside the Goal Striker unit. In 2013 and its final incarnation, the maze gained a theatrical ending involving a knife thrower.\n\n* ''The Sanctuary'' was new for the 2012 Scarefest event and returned in 2013 and 2014. The attraction was set in a research facility operated by \"The Ministry of Joy\". Alton Towers released the following description at the time: \"Lost your Smile? Then check yourself in for a refreshing check up at The Sanctuary. After being closed for new patients for almost 50 years The Sanctuary, The Ministry of Joy\u2019s earliest establishment, is now holding important trials searching for 'Advocates' for its 2013 project.\" It was revealed to be part of marketing for ''[[The Smiler (roller coaster)|The Smiler]]'' roller coaster, which opened in 2013.<ref name=\"The Sanctuary\">{{cite web|title=The Sanctuary new for 2012|url=http://www.towerstimes.co.uk/scarefest/attractions/the-sanctuary/|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=TowersTimes}}</ref>\n\n* ''Scary Tales Scare Zone'' was a walk through scare zone that ran for the 2014 event. The attraction setting revolved around fairy tale stories that were rewritten in a nightmarish manner.\n\n* ''The Haunting of Molly Crowe'', a multi-sensory maze set in the Towers ruins. The maze was based on the old and abandoned house of Molly Crowe, who was last seen engulfed in flames in the cellar of her house, emitting a scream of non-human origin. This ran for the 2015 event.\n\n* ''Nox:Infernus Scare Zone'', a scare zone which ran for the 2015 event, set in the Dark Forest. The underworld rises again - Will you join the Cult or face the end of the world as we know it?\n\n* ''Dark Apocalypse Scare Zone'', a scare zone which was first introduced for the 2015 event and returning in 2016. A deadly virus has spread across Forbidden Valley. The infected show signs of highly aggressive behavior and rapid physical decomposition. Phalanx control has quarantined the area however, a recent security breach has questioned their ability to contain the virus and keep society safe.\n\n* ''Terror of the Towers&nbsp;\u2013 What Lies Within'', the signature maze situated inside the Towers themselves, first introduced in 2002. A new format was introduced in the 2009 Scarefest event, along with the new tagline \"What Lies Within\" replacing \"Bloodfest Banquet\". Visitors queue outside in Her Ladyship's Gardens, and the attraction itself starts in the derelict Conservatories. Batches of guests watch a short video showing two men exploring the Towers for ghosts. The video then cuts short, and guests enter the Towers to find the men. At certain points in the maze, the bodies of the two men are each seen hanging from a noose. Visitors become lost in the lengthy corridors and themed scenes in the Towers, with live actors pursuing them in every room. The finale to the attraction is a maze-like walkway that winds around actors in cages, with strobe effects.\n\n=== Fireworks ===\nFor the last days of the season, Alton Towers host [[Fireworks|firework]] Shows, these have been running annually since the 1990s on the Great Lawns. The displays were considered disruptive by some local residents, which led to formal complaints. Two local residents decided to take the theme park to court regarding this issue. The court issued Alton Towers with a noise abatement order in October 2005 which restricted the theme park to three shows a year, previously five, with noise readings not exceeding 40 decibels outside the park.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Fireworks go-ahead for theme park\n| work=BBC News\n| date=14 October 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/4342978.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref> In 2006, the display was rebranded as Electric Towers, but then discontinued. However, the fireworks and laser show was reinstated in 2010 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the theme park and has returned to being an annual event.\n\n=== Other events ===\nDuring the closed season months Alton Towers holds regular ''Pirate & Princess Weekends''. The event entails decorations, and themed activities for children in the Hotels and the waterpark. The theme park's Sharkbait Reef aquarium also opens for the event.\n\nDuring December, the ''Santa's Sleepover'' event takes place. Both resort hotels are decorated for the event and a pantomime takes place. The Alton Towers Theme Park also opens for Christmas with a small number of rides open as well as a Santa's Grotto. The event is largely aimed at children. In 2015, the theme park permitted entry to non-hotel guests for the first time however the event reverted to hotel guests only in 2016. Festive Breaks continue from 27 December 2018 to 6 January 2019 with a similar lineup to the Santa's Sleepovers.\n\nSince 2015 Alton Towers have opened the park for a ''Services Day''; a day where a limited quantity of discounted tickets (fewer than on a usual season day) are sold to those who work in public services<ref name=\"ServicesDay\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bluelightcard.co.uk/newsletters/4thjanuary2017/4thjanuary2017-fjknkwjneuwuwn.php?mid=466017&nid=250|title=Blue Light Card Newsletter|publisher=Blue Light Card|date=4 January 2017|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref> such as the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|Police]], [[NHS]], [[Fire brigade]], [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|Prison service]], [[British Army|Army]], [[RAF]], [[Royal Navy]] and other similar services.

The damage was reparable and had to be closed for six months before reopening midway through the 2008 season. Nobody was harmed.<ref name=\"towerstimes.co.uk\"/>\n\nAnother fire happened to the ride this time in the [[Alton Towers#Cloud Cuckoo Land|Cloud Cuckoo Land]] station in the 2009 season, due to a faulty vending machine, on 21 July 2009. The fire completely destroyed the whole station. Over the following season, the station was rebuilt, ready for the 2010 season.\n\n=== Runaway Mine Train ===\n{{Main|Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)}}\nOn 20 July 2006, when the train was entering the tunnel section of its course, two carriages uncoupled, with the front half of the train continuing up the slope while the rear half remained stuck in the tunnel. The front half failed to make it over the hill, rolled back and crashed into the rear half which had remained stuck in the tunnel. Six people were taken to hospital and 23 others were treated for cuts and bruises. Following the incident the [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] was closed for the rest of the season.

The couple have been in a legal battle with the park for nearly a decade, and during this period succeeded in a noise abatement order on the theme park which led to the audio from the top of the [[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]] drop being removed, and Alton Towers having to limit the amount of annual fireworks displays to only three a year.\n\nStephen and Suzanne Roper, who live only 100 yards from the park, say that their lives have been made a misery by the noise of the screams as well as fireworks displays and music. They launched their legal fight in 2002, but after years of wrangling, their claim for an injunction and damages was thrown out in January 2011. Judge [[Gary Hickinbottom|Mr Justice Hickinbottom]] later overturned that decision, bringing the claim back. This now paves the way for a full court hearing. The Ropers will seek an injunction forcing the park owners to close or relocate some rides and an order forcing them to pay damages for noise suffered from 1998 to the present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Theme-park-noise-battle-reignited/story-15990916-detail/story.html |title=Theme park noise battle is reignited |publisher=This is Staffordshire |date=3 May 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Incidents at European amusement parks]]\n* [[List of theme parks in the United Kingdom]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!--\n**************************************************************** \nPlease DO NOT add fansites here.

Over the next few years, he laid the foundation for the modern theme park by installing various permanent rides and developing areas of the grounds in progressive stages. In the 1980s, Broome opened a succession of rides and roller coasters around the park, including [[Corkscrew (Alton Towers)|Corkscrew]], Pirate Ship (now The Blade), [[Alpine Bobsleigh]], [[The Flume (Alton Towers)|The Flume]], and [[Black Hole (roller coaster)|The Black Hole]].\n\nBroome sold Alton Towers to [[The Tussauds Group]], then a division of [[Pearson plc]], in 1990, after encountering financial troubles in attempting to develop the former [[Battersea Power Station]] into a similar theme park. The change of ownership brought an era of major redevelopment and promotion, involving the opening of large themed areas and new attractions, such as [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] (1992), [[Duel - The Haunted House Strikes Back!|The Haunted House]] (1992), [[Toyland Tours]] (1994), and [[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]] (1994). Later, [[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]] (1998) and Air (2002, now [[Galactica (roller coaster)|Galactica]]) saw the park sustain its reputation for major roller coasters, both marketed as 'World First' rides. Tussauds' park development team from 1990 to 2002 included well-known attraction producer [[John Wardley]], among experienced others.\n\nThe Tussauds Group was sold to venture capitalist firm Charterhouse in 1998, then to [[Dubai International Capital]] (DIC) for \u00a3800 million in 2005.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Dubai firm buys Tussauds\n| work=BBC News\n| date=23 March 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4375219.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref> The Tussauds Group was then bought by [[Merlin Entertainments]] in March 2007 for over \u00a31billion from DIC, placing Alton Towers under their control.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Tussauds firm bought in \u00a31bn deal\n| work=BBC News\n| date=23 March 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6419019.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2007, [[The Blackstone Group]] purchased [[The Tussauds Group]] for US$1.9 billion and merged it into [[Merlin Entertainments]] with management by Merlin.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2812377/Merlin-conjures-up-leaseback-deal.html|title=Merlin conjures up leaseback deal|date=17 July 2007|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/05/AR2007030501369.html|title=Blackstone Buys Madame Tussauds Chain|first=David|last=Cho|date=6 March 2007|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> Dubai International Capital also gained 20% of Merlin Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6419019.stm |work=BBC News| title=Tussauds firm bought in \u00a31bn deal | date=5 March 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 July 2007, Alton Towers was sold to private investor [[Nick Leslau]]'s investment firm Prestbury under a sale and leaseback agreement.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6902797.stm |work=BBC News| title=Alton Towers sold in \u00a3622m deal | date=17 July 2007}}</ref> Merlin continues to operate the site under a renewable 35-year lease.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> As of 2016, the property is now transferred to Secure Income REIT Plc, of which Nick Leslau is a non-executive director.<ref name=\"Secure Income REIT Plc\" />\n\n== Rides and attractions ==\n\n=== Roller coasters ===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n!

Themed loosely as a town street, it leads to views of the gardens and the Towers across the lake in the distance. Along the pathway are the park's jumping frog fountains and a lawn where seasonal events take place. The first ''SkyRide'' station is located nearby, which is a 1048&nbsp;m long [[Aerial lift|cable car]] transport that opened in 1987, and was refurbished 2009. The [[monorail]] moves guests from the three on-site hotels and the water park to the theme park; it opened 1987 and was refurbished in 2008. In this area during the hour before the park's daily closure, departing guests are entertained by three people wearing police costumes, two of them riding [[Segway]]-like vehicles which play party music and the third standing with an old-fashioned megaphone that is unused, and a man riding a miniature ship while dressed as a sea captain.\n\n=== Katanga Canyon ===\nThemed as an African village; created in 1992 and incorporated existing rapids ride. Rides include the roller coaster [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] and [[Congo River Rapids (Alton Towers)|Congo River Rapids]]. Both are well-established rides in the park whose ride tracks share a tunnel. Congo River Rapids is a river rapids ride that opened 1986, as The Grand Canyon Rapids, and was refurbished in 1992. A 735 m long wild river rapids ride down the Congo River that lasts six minutes. Runaway Mine Train is a steel sit down powered coaster that reaches a speed of 22&nbsp;mph (36&nbsp;km/h) on a 1000&nbsp;ft long track (305 m) and height of {{convert|36|ft|m|abbr=on}}; height limit 90&nbsp;cm. It was designed by [[John Wardley]] for Tussauds and manufactured by [[Mack Rides]].\n\n=== Gloomy Wood ===\nGloomy Wood serves as the area for the dark ride ''[[Duel (ride)|Duel - The Haunted House Strikes Back!]]'', originally ''The Haunted House''. Opening in 1992, this was originally Europe's largest haunted dark ride, but was significantly altered with interactive laser guns in 2003. Each player's shooting score is recorded on a display in the ride car, as guests shoot targets around the ride.\n\nIn 2007, a themed footpath through the woods was added to the area, named ''Haunted Hollow''. The pathway follows the route formerly used by the park's old scenic railway, linking from Mutiny Bay. ''Haunted Hollow'' includes tombstones, statues and other features, some of which interact with guests using sound effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altontowers.com/rides-and-attractions/fun-rides/haunted-hollow/|title=Haunted Hollow - Theme Park Experience at Alton Towers Resort|website=www.altontowers.com}}</ref> In July 2015, Nitrogenie opened and replaced the old Waffles and Ices, a shop producing ice cream using liquid [[nitrogen]]. Gloomy Wood was suggested by the 2017 park map to be home to the new ''Wicker Man'' wooden coaster, opening 2018. However, the park later stated that the ride was in Mutiny Bay.\n\n=== Forbidden Valley ===\n[[File:Alton Towers Forbidden Valley ride signs.jpg|thumb|Theming and signs in Forbidden Valley]]\nForbidden Valley is set in a '[[post-apocalyptic]]' landscape, with [[standing stones]] and rustic structures populating the 'valley'. A ''SkyRide'' station also serves this area of the park.\n\nThe area's principal attraction is ''[[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]]'', opened in 1994. ''Nemesis'' is a steel inverted coaster that reaches a speed of 50&nbsp;mph (81&nbsp;km) with four inversions, set in a rocky quarry over waterfalls. The ride is built down into excavated ground and was designed by Tussauds, primarily [[John Wardley]]. The attraction is themed as an alien creature inhabiting the quarry where the coaster is situated. \n\n''The Blade'' is a Huss Pirate Boat modified with a pendulum blade. It opened in 1980, and was relocated to the area in 1997 from Fantasy World. The Blade currently operates as the only flat ride in Forbidden Valley since the removal of ''[[Ripsaw (Alton Towers)|Ripsaw]]''. However, in October 2019, The Blade was dismantled to be 'Resharpened by the Phalanx' and has been added back to the Alton Towers app hinting it\u2019s return.\n\n[[Galactica (roller coaster)|Galactica]] is a B&M flying coaster, originally opening as ''Air'' in 2002. Air was loosely themed as a peaceful landscape, distanced from the 'apocalyptic' look of Nemesis. Air was redesigned as Galactica in 2016, adopting [[virtual reality]] headsets and a space travel theme. The VR headsets have since been removed due to feedback from customers.<ref name=\"Twitter170320191501\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/altontowers/status/1107295909078097923|date=17 March 2019|accessdate=18 March 2019|title=Reply to user @Ev_Jay|quote=Galactica no longer features VR due to guest feedback regarding their experience on the ride.|publisher=Alton Towers official Twitter account}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, the '[[Rollercoaster Restaurant]]' opened, offering a dining experience where guests have their food delivered by looping rails. The restaurant is open daily from 10am - 9:30pm; available to guests without theme park admission after the park has closed, except during Scarefest and Fireworks events.\n\n=== Adventure Land ===\nAdventure Land is a small family area featuring ''[[Spinball Whizzer (roller coaster)|Spinball Whizzer]]'';<ref>{{cite web|title=Theme Park|url=https://www.altontowers.com/theme-park/|website=Alton Towers|accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> based on a pinball machine in which the car is the ball whizzing around the machine. The ride originally had this name, until 2010 when it was known as ''Sonic Spinball'' until the name change back in 2016 when a contract ended with SEGA after six years. The ride is a Maurer S\u00f6hne spinning roller coaster, in which riders sit in cars that can spin on their base whilst travelling at speed around the track. For the park map, Spinball Whizzer is listed as being in The Towers area.\n\nAdventure Land is named after the adventure play ground which previously sat on the site. The former play area was one of the attractions of a larger area called Kiddies Kingdom. In 1996, Kiddies Kingdom was split into Adventure Land and Storybook Land.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adventure Land |url=https://towersstreet.com/theme-park/area/adventure-land/#areahistory |website=towersstreet.com |accessdate=17 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== X-Sector ===\n[[File:Oblivion2015.JPG|thumb|View of Oblivion]]\nX-Sector is themed as a secretive industrial complex, suggested to be subjecting park guests to experimental testing.\n\nThe area currently contains three thrill rides. The steel dive coaster ''[[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]]'' which opened in 1998 as \"the world's first vertical drop rollercoaster\", designed by Tussauds and manufactured by [[Bolliger & Mabillard]]. The cars are held over the edge of the drop for three seconds, before diving into a deep tunnel. ''[[The Smiler]]'' is a [[Gerstlauer]] [[Infinity Coaster]] which opened in May 2013 and currently holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster at 14.<ref name=\"Uttoxeter Advertiser\"/>  ''Enterprise'' is a standard HUSS [[Enterprise (ride)|Enterprise]] model which opened in 1984, spinning riders 360 degrees and giving the illusion of defying gravity. The area layout was partially altered in 2013 season to accommodate the opening of The Smiler.\n\nPrevious rides in X-Sector include The [[Black Hole (roller coaster)|Black Hole]], which was a Jet Star 2 coaster enclosed in a tent, where The Smiler is located today. [[Boneshaker (Alton Towers)|Energizer]] (later renamed Boneshaker) was a swinging gondola flat ride. It was replaced by [[Submission (Alton Towers)|Submission]] in 2001, a \"Chance Double Inverter\" flat ride, which was itself removed in 2014.\n\n=== Mutiny Bay ===\n[[File:Alton Towers 05.jpg|thumb|Mutiny Bay's pirates]]\nMutiny Bay is a pirate-themed family area, which opened in 2008.<ref name=\"Attractions2009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iaapa.org/ |title=International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions |date=January 2009 |publisher=IAAPA |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> the area was a retheme for Merrie England.\n\nAttractions in Mutiny Bay include: ''[[Battle Galleons]]'', an interactive \"Splash Battle\" boat ride, where guests sit in tracked boats while soaking other riders with water cannons. Also in the area is the rocking boat ride, ''Heave Ho''. The park's original teacups ride was re-themed to become ''[[Marauder's Mayhem (Alton Towers)|Marauders Mayhem]]'', with the tea cup cars being redesigned as gunpowder barrels. '' The Flume'' was a [[Mack Rides|Mack]] log flume ride that opened in 1981 and was rethemed in 2004 with a sponsorship from Imperial Leather alongside the bubbleworks at Chessington world of adventure. Upon opening, it was the longest flume ride in the world at {{Convert|886|m}}.<ref name=\"Attractions2009\" /> Late in the 2015 season, the ride and the neighboring tavern closed and were removed in 2016 to make way for the [[Wicker Man (roller coaster)|Wicker Man]] roller coaster and the \"Welcome Inn\" bar which shares the coaster's theme.\n\nIn 2009, a [[Sea Life Centres|Sea Life Centre]] named ''Sharkbait Reef'' opened in the location previously home to the 3-D Cinema.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for 3-D Cinema replacement|date=March 2020}} This includes \"touch pools\" for interacting with underwater species and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} underwater tunnel.<ref name=\"Sharkbait Reef Info\">{{cite web |title=Sharkbait Reef by SEA LIFE |url=https://www.towerstimes.co.uk/theme-park/mutiny-bay/sharkbait-reef-by-sea-life/ |website=TowersTimes |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== The World of David Walliams ===\n[[File:Alton Towers - Circuit voitures pour enfants.jpg|thumb|Driving School attraction in Cloud Cuckoo Land]]\nThe World of David Walliams is aimed at younger children aged 7-11, featuring bright colours and fantasy decor. Attractions include ''Raj's Bouncy Bottom Burp'' (the former Frog Hopper) and ''Royal Carousel'' (previously Galloper's Carousel). ''[[Driving School (Alton Towers)|Cuckoo Cars Driving School]]'' allows children to drive miniature electric cars around a themed road layout, featuring visual jokes along the way.<ref>{{cite news | title=Coming soon \u2026 the first 'drive of your life' | publisher=easier.com | date=10 July 2006 | url=http://www.easier.com/view/News/Motoring/Peugeot/article-59601.html | accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref> A SkyRide station is located nearby Fountain Square, giving access to other areas of the park.\nThe area was previously known as \"Cred Street\" and \"The Land of Make Believe\", with a cartoon-inspired look, mainly featuring ''[[Toyland Tours]]''. Prior to this, it was first built as \"Talbot Street\" in 1981, becoming the park's first themed area, home to the ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (Alton Towers)|Around The World in 80 Days]]'' and ''[[Doom & Sons]]'' dark rides.\n\nOn 21 July 2009, a fire broke out in the Sky Ride station for this area, caused by a faulty vending machine. The station was completely destroyed and didn't reopen until the 2010 season.\n<ref name=\"towerstimes.co.uk\">https://www.towerstimes.co.uk/theme-park/transportation/skyride/</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, it was announced that Cloud Cuckoo Land will be replaced by \"The World of [[David Walliams]]\" for the 2020 season, which will feature attractions based around Walliams' series of [[children's books]].<ref>https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/alton-towers-open-new-world-17094301</ref>\n\n=== Dark Forest ===\nThe Dark Forest is themed as a supernatural woodland area; to coincide with the opening of ''[[Thirteen (roller coaster)|TH13TEEN]]'', a steel family coaster themed as a haunted [[crypt]], that opened on 20 March 2010. Th13teen, features the \"world's first freefall drop on a roller coaster\" - an indoor, vertically dropping track element. The ride replaced the ''[[Corkscrew (Alton Towers)|Corkscrew]]''; the park's first roller coaster, which opened in 1980. ''[[Rita (roller coaster)|Rita]]'' is a hydraulically launched steel sit-down coaster that reaches a top speed of 62&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km) that is now themed around an abandoned [[Drag racing|drag racer]] that is used to escape the Dark Forest.\n\nThe area was previously a cartoon prehistoric area named Ug Land, which opened in 1999, but was half-demolished to make way for Rita's construction in 2005. Rita used to be themed around drag racing but was changed with the opening of Th13teen and the Dark Forest. With the opening of ''Th13teen'', the area was renamed as Dark Forest and further altered with a new colour scheme and entrance feature. ''Rita'' was also given a repainted control cabin and trains, shortening its name from \"Rita - Queen of Speed\".<ref name=\"thirteen\">{{cite web|title=SW6 Revealed: TH13TEEN|url=http://towersnerd.com/news/item.php?id=193|accessdate=1 December 2009|publisher=Towers Nerd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605233654/http://towersnerd.com/news/item.php?id=193|archive-date=5 June 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== CBeebies Land ===\n{{Main|CBeebies#CBeebies Land|l1=CBeebies: CBeebies Land}}\n\nCBeebies Land is based on the [[BBC]] children's TV channel: [[CBeebies]].

They belonged to the Talbot family as a stately home until 1924 and largely designed by [[Augustus Pugin]], also noted for his work on the [[Palace of Westminster]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|website=Explore Parliament}}</ref> The Towers are now in a state of disrepair following decades of neglect. The ruins are open to the public during most of the open season. However, some areas are closed off as part of a \u00a31.1 million project in place to restore the oldest parts of the Towers. Key areas of The Towers include the banqueting hall, the chapel, conservatories, and Her Ladyship's Gardens.\n\n''[[Hex \u2013 The Legend of the Towers]]'', a walk-through dark ride based within the ruins themselves, opened in 2000. The finale to the ride is a Vekoma [[Madhouse (ride)|Madhouse]] located away from the real Towers but themed as a secret vault. The storyline is based on a local legend about the [[chained oak]] tree, located in a nearby forest, and makes use of the history of the Towers. It draws its theme from the legend of the 15th Earl of Shrewsbury who was said to be cursed by a beggar woman to suffer death every time a branch falls from an old oak tree.\n\nDuring the park's Halloween 'Scarefest' event multiple scare mazes operate within the Towers themselves. For 2018's Scarefest event these were; Sub Species: the End Games, and Altonville Mine Tours.\n\n=== The Gardens ===\n[[File:Alton Towers gardens - geograph.org.uk - 1464404.jpg|thumb|Gardens created by the eccentric 15th [[Earl of Shrewsbury]]]]\n\nNear the garden entrance is a [[cenotaph]] to the 15th Earl, a marble bust with an inscription reading \"He made the desert smile\". Landmarks include a Chinese Pagoda Fountain, The Swiss Cottage, Miniature 'Stonehenge', a Greek Choragic Monument, and orangeries.\n\n== Alton Towers Waterpark ==\n{{Main|Alton Towers Waterpark}}\n[[File:Alton Towers Waterpark1.JPG|thumbnail|left|Alton Towers Waterpark]]\nThe Alton Towers Waterpark, formerly known as Cariba Creek, opened alongside the Splash Landings Hotel in 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Making a splash with a 'waterpark hotel'\n |work        = Daily Mail\n |url         = http://www.altontowers.com/waterpark/openingpricing.asp\n |access-date = 14 January 2014\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070325013647/http://www.altontowers.com/waterpark/openingpricing.asp\n |archivedate = 25 March 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> It is a large (with 7 pools and 10 water slides), part-indoor and part outdoor waterpark themed as a tropical Caribbean lagoon. The waterpark features several fast slides, a [[lazy river]], a giant tipping bucket and many other water features. Also located there are two food and drink venues: Adventures Cave and Ice Cream Shack. Unlike [[Chessington Zoo]] at the also [[Merlin Entertainments|Merlin]] operated [[Chessington World of Adventures Resort]], a separate ticket is needed for waterpark access as it is not included with the theme park entrance price.\n\nAttractions include ''Lagoona Bay'', which is the main tropical pool, with water cannons, geysers and waterfalls. ''The Little Leak'' is a paddling pool for young children with two small slides and interactive pipes to play with, while ''Wacky Waterworks Treehouse'' is a wooden 'treehouse' with water cannons, and other interactive features to squirt passing people with.\n\nThe largest ride in the Waterpark is the [[Water Coaster (Mack Rides)|water coaster]] ''The Master Blaster'', with uphill sections similar to the ''Master Blaster'' at [[Sandcastle Water Park (Blackpool)|Sandcastle Waterpark]], ''Blackpool'' and ''Nucleus'' at [[Water World, Stoke-on-Trent]]. ''The Master Blaster'' is a high speed water flume that contains sharp turns, drops and dark sections, and has views of the entire indoor area of the waterpark.\n\nOther rides include ''Rush & Rampage'', twin racing slides where riders experience wide turns. This attraction requires rubber rings. ''Lazy River (Calypso Creek)'' is a slow-moving water circuit, taking riders underneath spraying water jets and tipping buckets of water. Rubber rings are available. ''The Tipping Bucket'' is a container filled with 1000 litres of water which regularly tips its contents over people standing below. ''Flash Floods'' are tiered outdoor pools with two slides leading to the middle pool and three leading to the bottom. Other swimming pools include ''Volcanic Springs'', and indoor heated hot pool, and ''Bubbly Wubbly Pool'', an outdoor heated pool and whirlpool.\n\nThe indoor section of the water park operates 12 months a year excluding Christmas Day and Boxing Day, although it closes for winter maintenance for around 2 weeks each January.\n\n== Resort accommodation ==\n[[File:Alton Towers Hotel, Staffordshire - geograph.org.uk - 6099.jpg|thumb|The fountain at the entrance to Alton Towers Hotel]]\n\n=== Alton Towers Hotel ===\nThe Alton Towers Hotel opened on 10 April 1996 and is themed to the eccentric fictional character Sir Algenon Alton and his travels. The rooms are decorated in a quirky English style with pictures of Sir Algenon's inventions. The hotel is four star and has 180 rooms. The hotel was the first phase in a plan to turn the theme park into a multi-day resort.\n\nThe Alton Towers Hotel is currently undergoing a long term phased refurbishment to theme each floor to a different setting. So far, the plan has produced the Moon Voyage Bedrooms and Arctic Explorer Bedrooms.\n\n=== Splash Landings Hotel ===\nThe Splash Landings Hotel opened in 2003. The hotel has a relaxed Caribbean theme and is attached to the [[Alton Towers Waterpark]]. It is also four star and it has 216 rooms with a choice of six-room types, Family of 4 'Beachcomber' room, Family of 6 'Beachcomber' room, The Ice Age Suites, The Pirate Suites, Interconnected Family of 4 'Beachcomber' room and, Interconnected Family of 3 'Beachcomber' Room. The interconnected rooms are all on the ground floor and the family of 3 rooms are also disabled accessible. The rooms are numbered in the ranges of 1101 to 1159, 1201 to 1259, 1301 to 1359 and, 1401 to 1459, there are a few room numbers that are not used due to the shape of the hotel, these are 27, 29, 31, 33 and 35 on each floor.\n\n=== Enchanted Village ===\nThe Enchanted Village is made up of 120 lodges and 5 secluded treehouses set in the fictional ''Enchanted Forest'' woodland. Situated next to the Alton Towers hotel, it features new recreational activities, such as various playgrounds for children and an archery range, which is available to use at no extra cost. The site is also home to \"The Crooked Spoon\" restaurant, and also an additional shop which sells alcohol and outdoor activity toys.\n\nThe Enchanted Village opened to the public on 18 April 2015.\n\nAlton Towers have submitted planning application to expand the Enchanted Village in several phases. The application has been approved and if the plans go ahead, construction on the first phase will commence in 2018 with a scheduled opening of March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.towerstimes.co.uk/enchanted-village/ |title=Enchanted Village |publisher=TowersTimes |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== CBeebies Land Hotel ===\nThe CBeebies Land Hotel opened on 8 July 2017, the hotel has a total of 76 themed rooms: 42 standard rooms (themed to the CBeebies Bugbies) and 34 premium rooms themed to different CBeebies shows, such as ''Something Special'' and ''Swashbuckle''. Room amenities include child-friendly features, such as steps up to the sink and children's toilet seats. The hotel features CBeebies-themed shows and entertainment, which run every day of the year, as well as the \"Windmill Restaurant\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.altontowers.com/2017/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827103207/https://www.altontowers.com/2017/ |archive-date=27 August 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Stargazing Pods ===\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\nAlthough Alton Towers had previously gained the necessary permits to expand the Enchanted Village, these plans were eventually scrapped and reduced into a \"pod\"-style accommodation option. 102 individual pods were constructed, each sleeping up to four people.\n\nThe proposals have faced some critical views from the public, with many criticisms being raised over the capacity of bathroom facilities as well as how the resort will cope with the increased demand in food and beverages, as the Stargazing Pods will not have its own restaurant or bar facilities. The council even initially rejected the application citing lack of imagination and \"magic\", although the plans were granted permission the second time without making any notable improvements.\n\nThe Stargazing Pods opened on 12 April 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altontowers.com/short-breaks/stargazing-pods/|title=Stargazing Pods|website=www.altontowers.com|language=en|access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recreation ==\n\n=== Alton Towers Spa ===\nAlton Towers Spa is part of the Alton Towers Hotel and opened in 2004. It includes relaxation and treatment rooms and an adults only swimming pool. Despite being inside the Alton Towers Hotel, non-hotel guests are able to use the Spa.\n\n=== Extraordinary Golf ===\nOpened in 2007, the Extraordinary Golf mini-golf attraction is themed to different rides and attractions at the park, some of which, are from the park's history. Extraordinary Golf is located to the west of the Splash Landings Hotel. Extraordinary Golf was refreshed for 2016 including the addition of a Galactica themed hole.\n\n=== Tree Top Quest ===\nOpened May 2015, the Enchanted Forest Tree Top Quest is a high ropes course near the Enchanted Village. The attraction opened shortly after, and accompanies, the Enchanted Village development. There is also a low ropes course. Tree Top Quest did not open for the 2018 season or the start of the 2019 season due to budget cuts by parent company, Merlin Entertainments. It is expected to reopen on 13 July 2019.<ref>https://www.altontowers.com/activities/tree-top-quest/</ref>\n\n== Future developments ==\nAlton Towers is working with children's author [[David Walliams]] to develop a new themed area, 'World of David Walliams', replacing Cloud Cuckoo Land in Spring 2020, the new area will feature a dark ride themed to the author's [[Gangsta Granny]] children's book.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chamberlain |first1=Zoe |title=Alton Towers to open new 'World of David Walliams' attraction |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/alton-towers-open-new-world-17094301 |website=Birmingham Mail |accessdate=11 November 2019 |date=17 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlton Towers is located in a [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|Conservation Area]], which puts restrictions on its permissible development, notably that no structures in the park should be built above tree line and if so should be disguised from external views of the park; this can be seen on the ride [[Rita (roller coaster)|Rita]], where the highest sections of track are camouflaged green.\n\nNoise pollution is also a problem for the park due to the close proximity to the villages of Alton and Farley and the town of [[Cheadle, Staffordshire|Cheadle]]. There have been several cases where Alton Towers have been taken to court over the noise levels emitted from the park and have been served noise abatement orders in 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n\n== Secret Weapon roller coasters ==\nAlton Towers has a tradition of codenaming its new roller coaster developments as \"Secret Weapon\", or \"SW\", followed by a number. The name is associated with the park's inclination to promote its rides as holding \"world first\" or in some way \"innovative\" features and records. However the naming tradition actually began for unrelated reasons, since \"Secret Weapon\" was the working title of a roller coaster that was ultimately never commissioned.\n\nSW1 was a [[pipeline roller coaster]], planned to open in around 1992, on what later became the Nemesis site. It was provisionally titled the \"Secret Weapon\", with the intention of theming the ride as an ambiguous weapon testing facility.<ref name=\"The Secret Wepons\">{{cite web|title=The Secret Weapons - Developing the Magic|url=http://old.towerstimes.co.uk/history/articles/secretweapons.htm|website=towerstimes.co.uk|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131104102401/http://old.towerstimes.co.uk/history/articles/secretweapons.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref> [[John Wardley]] rode the [[Arrow Dynamics]] prototype of their pipeline coaster, but stated \"it was very slow and rather boring\",<ref name=\"The creation of Nemesis\">{{cite web|last1=Wardley|first1=John|title=The creation of Nemesis|url=http://www.towersalmanac.com/features/multimedia.php?id=19|website=Alton Towers Almanac|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref> as well as the requirement for such a high lift hill being unsuitable for the park's planning restrictions. After a second layout revision, labelled \"SW2\", the ride was scrapped and development on SW3 ([[Nemesis (roller coaster)|Nemesis]]) began.<ref name=\"The Secret Wepons\"/><ref name=\"The creation of Nemesis\"/> The code name subsequently became the standard preliminary name for major roller coaster projects at the park.\n\nThe naming convention was briefly dropped while the Tussauds Group changed ownership under [[Dubai International Capital]], before being continued by Merlin Entertainments.\n\n== Events ==\n{{Overly detailed|date=January 2019}}\nPrior to the main open season, Alton Towers held the February Half-Term event which saw a selected ride offering opened for the week before the start of the main season in March, however the event was cancelled for 2016; with the exception of Sharkbait Reef which was open for Pirate and Princess Week held at the Resort hotels.\n\n=== Concerts ===\nAlton Towers has a history of hosting concerts since the 1960s. Concerts in recent years have included the Alton Towers Live event in 2011 and 2013. In 2010, there was an 80s concert for the 30th Anniversary featuring [[Rick Astley]] and [[Bananarama]] and also that year hosted a [[P!nk]] concert. In the past these concerts were often held in the car park at an additional fee, however more recently concerts have been held within the theme park. Artists that have performed there include [[Tina Turner]] and [[The Black Eyed Peas]].\n\n=== Oktoberfest ===\nThe \"Alton Towers Oktoberfest\" is a new event scheduled to take place in weekends during late September and early October 2020. It is based on the German festival of [[Oktoberfest]] held traditionally in Munich, Germany. The event will involve themed food and drink, entertainment and extended evening hours with selected rides open.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Oktoberfest? |url=https://support.altontowers.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006001078-What-is-Oktoberfest- |website=Alton Towers Resort |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Scarefest ===\n''Scarefest'' is the resort's largest annual event. It celebrates [[Halloween]] with a number of temporary scare maze attractions, scare zones, costumed characters and extended opening hours. Rides and areas are lit with coloured lighting at night, with most rides and attractions continuing to operate until 9pm. The Scarefest event has been running since 2007, although the park started celebrating Halloween with decoration several years before and has operated the ''Terror of the Towers'' scaremaze since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/alton-towers-scarefest-2016-you-10099966|title=Alton Towers reveals plans for Scarefest 2017 with a new addition|first=Steve|last=Wollaston|date=31 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/trips-and-breaks/review-alton-towers-scarefest-2017-12034148|title=Travel review: Alton Towers Scarefest 2016|first=Justin|last=Connolly|date=15 October 2016}}</ref> The scare mazes are [[upcharge attraction]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Timeline of Halloween scare mazes\n!

A family of inbred hillbillies are outcast due to their hideous disfigurement and warped way of life. Through desperation they begin capturing townsfolk, before removing their skin and stitching it into their own in a hope that this may finally give them the beauty they so desire.\n\n* ''Sub Species: The End Games'', a live action horror maze returning in 2018, which will push the boundaries of Scarefest's mazes with multiple routes. A post-apocalyptic, sewer dwelling community have been infested by a species from another world. In order to survive, they appease the creature's hunger by sacrificing innocent people from the surface. However, over time, insanity has twisted the feeding ritual into a sick contest.

According to local legend, she tries to avenge the death of her charges by taking the spirits of the living as penance - will you be her next victim?\n\n==== Past seasonal Scarefest attractions ====\n* ''Terror of the Towers''. The first incarnation of this long-running annual scare maze was introduced in 2002, and was located in the Towers ruins themselves. Many scenes from the original maze are still used. Visitors walked through the long, winding corridors of the Towers, through themed scenes while being pursued by live actors. The finale featured a winding pathway around actors behind fences, who lunged towards visitors, accompanied with heavy strobe effects. For 2003 it was restructured and given the tagline and theme \"Bloodfest Banquet\".\n\n* \"TH13TEEN: After Dark\" has an enhanced queue line for Alton Towers' newest roller coaster, using fog and lighting effects as well as live actors. This attraction did not return for 2012.\n\n* ''Terror of the Towers&nbsp;\u2013 Bloodfest Banquet'' was a new version of the Terror of the Towers scare maze, running from 2003 to 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-bloodfest-banquet-alton-towers/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194338/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-bloodfest-banquet-alton-towers/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> It retained much of the original version, but featured new scenes that included scripted dialogue from the several characters, and a new storyline was added. The strobe maze finale was moved to another point in the maze and replaced by a new ending, in which visitors become trapped in a small room with cages on every side, as actors reach for them through the metal bars for almost a minute. Every year, Terror of the Towers kept changing slightly with revised scenes and new scares.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-2008-readers-review-2008/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194427/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/terror-of-the-towers-2008-readers-review-2008/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> However, for the 2009 Scarefest event, Terror of the Towers was once again completely rethought, with the tagline \"What Lies Within\". The new incarnation drops the scripted scenes and characters; meaning it is similar to the original Terror of Towers of 2002. The whole layout for the maze was also reversed, with what was previously the entrance becoming the exit.\n\n* ''Room 13'' was first introduced in 2006 and was located in the conference room of the Alton Towers Hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61:alton-towers-hotel-room-13&catid=75&Itemid=126 |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325224813/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61%3Aalton-towers-hotel-room-13&catid=75&Itemid=126 |archivedate=25 March 2012 }}</ref> It was only available to guests of the hotel, who were led around the maze as many live actors appeared to scare them. Room 13 had positive reviews and returned in 2007, but was replaced by The Boiler House in 2008.\n\n* ''Field of 1000 Screams'' was first introduced in the 2007 Scarefest event and was the first maze at Alton Towers not situated inside a pre-existing building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/alton-towers-scarefest-maze-reviews-2007/ |title=Scare Attractions UK \u2013 promoting and supporting the UK scare entertainment industry since 2006 |publisher=Scareattractions.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226194613/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/alton-towers-scarefest-maze-reviews-2007/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The Field was located entirely outdoors in a moderately sized field of [[maize]], which had to be planted especially for the event several months earlier. It purported to be a fictional village called Altonville that had become overrun by zombies. Visitors walked down a long pathway cut through the corn, and encountered characters and scares along the way, before the finale took place. The Field of 1000 Screams did not return for the 2010 event.\n\n* ''Haunted Hollow Live'' was first seen in 2007 and consisted of several sinister, costumed actors performing along the Haunted Hollow walkway in Gloomy Wood. The attraction was similar to Duel Live, which was introduced the year later. Haunted Hollow Live returned for the 2008 Scarefest event, but was cancelled for 2009.\n\n* ''Duel Live'' was first introduced in the 2008 Scarefest event. Throughout this period, the park's haunted house dark ride, [[Duel (ride)|Duel]], became host to this attraction, which included live actors situated around the ride circuit. Duel was available to ride normally until 12&nbsp;pm, when the laser guns and LED targets were switched and the actors took their positions. This was changed in 2009, when Duel Live took place throughout the whole day and many more actors than the previous year were present. Duel Live was aimed at the family audience, and included such features as new music playing throughout the ride (instead of the usual Duel theme music), as well as a butler or maid who would welcome you inside the house. The attraction was changed slightly for the 2010 season and featured the park's Scarefest mascots.\n\n* ''Skelvin's Haunted Adventure'' was a newer version of [[Duel (ride)#Duel: Live!|Duel Live]], introduced in 2010, and took over [[Duel (ride)|Duel \u2013 The Haunted House Strikes Back!]] throughout Scarefest. As in previous years, the attraction included live actors situated at different points around the ride. The laser guns and LED targets were switched off during this time. The ride featured the Scarefest mascots, notably the character of \"Skelvin\".\n\n* ''The Boiler House'' was a scare maze first introduced in 2008, and was situated next to the Alton Towers Hotel. Originally, the scare maze was set in an abandoned industrial facility and featured live actors in make up. This was changed in 2009, when a new storyline was added. The scare maze later featured the fictional \"Hamble Twins\" serial killers hiding in the industrial building, and visitors have to escape them as they are chased through the scenes. Visitors queued outside, past a van labelled \"Alton News 24\", from which television screens play news reports on the activity of the serial killers. Guests then walk through a covered walkway, which hides the marquee that the maze is contained in from view. Once inside, a man appears and warns guests about the dangers of coming inside. The murderers then appear and kill him, before chasing visitors away. Each of the Twins are played by two different actors wearing the same grotesque, latex mask. They appear at different points in the maze, creating the illusion that one character is in several places at once. Dim lighting and scent effects are heavily used. For the 2011 Scarefest, The Boiler House moved along with the Carnival of Screams to the X Sector, where they both shared the old Black Hole tent. After three years it did not return for the 2012 season.\n\n* ''Carnival of Screams'' was a scare maze that debuted for the 2010 Scarefest event. During its debut it shared the same temporary building as the Boiler House. John Wardley contributed to the development of ''Carnival of Screams'', which was entered through a large clown face with horrific features. For 2011 it and the Boiler House were relocated to the X-Sector area. The maze is a mixture of humor and serious scares, and the music used is the former ''Toy Land Tours'' attraction theme music warped for dramatic effect. From 2012 onwards, the attraction was situated opposite the hospitality suite, with the exit inside the Goal Striker unit. In 2013 and its final incarnation, the maze gained a theatrical ending involving a knife thrower.\n\n* ''The Sanctuary'' was new for the 2012 Scarefest event and returned in 2013 and 2014. The attraction was set in a research facility operated by \"The Ministry of Joy\". Alton Towers released the following description at the time: \"Lost your Smile? Then check yourself in for a refreshing check up at The Sanctuary. After being closed for new patients for almost 50 years The Sanctuary, The Ministry of Joy\u2019s earliest establishment, is now holding important trials searching for 'Advocates' for its 2013 project.\" It was revealed to be part of marketing for ''[[The Smiler (roller coaster)|The Smiler]]'' roller coaster, which opened in 2013.<ref name=\"The Sanctuary\">{{cite web|title=The Sanctuary new for 2012|url=http://www.towerstimes.co.uk/scarefest/attractions/the-sanctuary/|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=TowersTimes}}</ref>\n\n* ''Scary Tales Scare Zone'' was a walk through scare zone that ran for the 2014 event. The attraction setting revolved around fairy tale stories that were rewritten in a nightmarish manner.\n\n* ''The Haunting of Molly Crowe'', a multi-sensory maze set in the Towers ruins. The maze was based on the old and abandoned house of Molly Crowe, who was last seen engulfed in flames in the cellar of her house, emitting a scream of non-human origin. This ran for the 2015 event.\n\n* ''Nox:Infernus Scare Zone'', a scare zone which ran for the 2015 event, set in the Dark Forest. The underworld rises again - Will you join the Cult or face the end of the world as we know it?\n\n* ''Dark Apocalypse Scare Zone'', a scare zone which was first introduced for the 2015 event and returning in 2016. A deadly virus has spread across Forbidden Valley. The infected show signs of highly aggressive behavior and rapid physical decomposition. Phalanx control has quarantined the area however, a recent security breach has questioned their ability to contain the virus and keep society safe.\n\n* ''Terror of the Towers&nbsp;\u2013 What Lies Within'', the signature maze situated inside the Towers themselves, first introduced in 2002. A new format was introduced in the 2009 Scarefest event, along with the new tagline \"What Lies Within\" replacing \"Bloodfest Banquet\". Visitors queue outside in Her Ladyship's Gardens, and the attraction itself starts in the derelict Conservatories. Batches of guests watch a short video showing two men exploring the Towers for ghosts. The video then cuts short, and guests enter the Towers to find the men. At certain points in the maze, the bodies of the two men are each seen hanging from a noose. Visitors become lost in the lengthy corridors and themed scenes in the Towers, with live actors pursuing them in every room. The finale to the attraction is a maze-like walkway that winds around actors in cages, with strobe effects.\n\n=== Fireworks ===\nFor the last days of the season, Alton Towers host [[Fireworks|firework]] Shows, these have been running annually since the 1990s on the Great Lawns. The displays were considered disruptive by some local residents, which led to formal complaints. Two local residents decided to take the theme park to court regarding this issue. The court issued Alton Towers with a noise abatement order in October 2005 which restricted the theme park to three shows a year, previously five, with noise readings not exceeding 40 decibels outside the park.<ref>{{cite news\n| title=Fireworks go-ahead for theme park\n| work=BBC News\n| date=14 October 2005\n| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/4342978.stm\n| accessdate=13 July 2006}}</ref> In 2006, the display was rebranded as Electric Towers, but then discontinued. However, the fireworks and laser show was reinstated in 2010 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the theme park and has returned to being an annual event.\n\n=== Other events ===\nDuring the closed season months Alton Towers holds regular ''Pirate & Princess Weekends''. The event entails decorations, and themed activities for children in the Hotels and the waterpark. The theme park's Sharkbait Reef aquarium also opens for the event.\n\nDuring December, the ''Santa's Sleepover'' event takes place. Both resort hotels are decorated for the event and a pantomime takes place. The Alton Towers Theme Park also opens for Christmas with a small number of rides open as well as a Santa's Grotto. The event is largely aimed at children. In 2015, the theme park permitted entry to non-hotel guests for the first time however the event reverted to hotel guests only in 2016. Festive Breaks continue from 27 December 2018 to 6 January 2019 with a similar lineup to the Santa's Sleepovers.\n\nSince 2015 Alton Towers have opened the park for a ''Services Day''; a day where a limited quantity of discounted tickets (fewer than on a usual season day) are sold to those who work in public services<ref name=\"ServicesDay\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bluelightcard.co.uk/newsletters/4thjanuary2017/4thjanuary2017-fjknkwjneuwuwn.php?mid=466017&nid=250|title=Blue Light Card Newsletter|publisher=Blue Light Card|date=4 January 2017|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref> such as the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|Police]], [[NHS]], [[Fire brigade]], [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|Prison service]], [[British Army|Army]], [[RAF]], [[Royal Navy]] and other similar services. Services Day is usually held approximately two weeks prior to the start of the new season, which usually begins mid-March. Due to the success of the 2015, '16 and '17 Services Days, a two-day weekend of Services Days was planned for 3 and 4 March 2018, however this was postponed to 11 March [[2018 Great Britain and Ireland cold wave|due to weather conditions]]. Another two-day event took place on 16\u201317 March 2019. Services Days are open to holders of a Blue Light Card or a Defence Discount Service Card.<ref name=\"ServicesDay\" />\n\n== Incidents ==\n{{main|Incidents at European amusement parks#Alton Towers}}\n\n=== The Smiler ===\n{{For|additional information and incidents|The Smiler#Incidents}}\nIn June 2015, sixteen people were injured on The Smiler ride, with two individuals requiring leg amputations. Merlin Entertainments originally released a press release blaming the crash on \"human error\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-34911943|title=Alton Towers crash due to 'human error'|date=24 November 2015|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/27/alton-towers-owner-fined-smiler-rollercaster-crash</ref> but later retracted this statement.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-37481825</ref> The Health & Safety Executive (HSE) concluded the crash occurred because \"Merlin failed to put in place systems that allowed their engineers to work safely on the ride while it was running\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-37481825|title=Alton Towers operator fined \u00a35m|date=27 September 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> During the subsequent court case, Merlin retracted their statement and pleaded guilty to a breach of health and safety law.

About 80 people were on the ride, and nine people had to be rescued by being [[Abseiling|abseiled]] down {{convert|200|foot|m}} cables.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/3851957.stm\n|title=Park investigates ride failure\n|publisher=BBC\n|date=30 June 2004\n|accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2007 [[Alton Towers#Scarefest|Scarefest]] season, a fire broke out in the [[Alton Towers#Forbidden Valley|Forbidden Valley]] section of the park due to a halogen lamp that damaged the roof and mechanics of the ride. The damage was reparable and had to be closed for six months before reopening midway through the 2008 season. Nobody was harmed.<ref name=\"towerstimes.co.uk\"/>\n\nAnother fire happened to the ride this time in the [[Alton Towers#Cloud Cuckoo Land|Cloud Cuckoo Land]] station in the 2009 season, due to a faulty vending machine, on 21 July 2009. The fire completely destroyed the whole station. Over the following season, the station was rebuilt, ready for the 2010 season.\n\n=== Runaway Mine Train ===\n{{Main|Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)}}\nOn 20 July 2006, when the train was entering the tunnel section of its course, two carriages uncoupled, with the front half of the train continuing up the slope while the rear half remained stuck in the tunnel. The front half failed to make it over the hill, rolled back and crashed into the rear half which had remained stuck in the tunnel. Six people were taken to hospital and 23 others were treated for cuts and bruises. Following the incident the [[Runaway Mine Train (Alton Towers)|Runaway Mine Train]] was closed for the rest of the season. The train was only returned to full length operation in June the following year.<ref name=\"Train\">{{cite news\n |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/5198728.stm\n |title = Dozens hurt on Alton Towers ride\n |work = BBC News\n |date = 20 July 2006\n |accessdate = 11 August 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n== Court cases ==\nOn 3 May 2012 a couple from the local village of Farley won the rights to a full High Court trial on the amount of noise generated by the park. The couple have been in a legal battle with the park for nearly a decade, and during this period succeeded in a noise abatement order on the theme park which led to the audio from the top of the [[Oblivion (roller coaster)|Oblivion]] drop being removed, and Alton Towers having to limit the amount of annual fireworks displays to only three a year.\n\nStephen and Suzanne Roper, who live only 100 yards from the park, say that their lives have been made a misery by the noise of the screams as well as fireworks displays and music. They launched their legal fight in 2002, but after years of wrangling, their claim for an injunction and damages was thrown out in January 2011. Judge [[Gary Hickinbottom|Mr Justice Hickinbottom]] later overturned that decision, bringing the claim back. This now paves the way for a full court hearing. The Ropers will seek an injunction forcing the park owners to close or relocate some rides and an order forcing them to pay damages for noise suffered from 1998 to the present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Theme-park-noise-battle-reignited/story-15990916-detail/story.html |title=Theme park noise battle is reignited |publisher=This is Staffordshire |date=3 May 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Incidents at European amusement parks]]\n* [[List of theme parks in the United Kingdom]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!--\n**************************************************************** \nPlease DO NOT add fansites here.
