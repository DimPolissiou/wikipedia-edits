The biggest challenge fish face when exposed to low oxygen conditions is maintaining metabolic energy balance, as 95% of the oxygen consumed by fish is used for [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production releasing the chemical energy of O<sub>2</sub> through the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[electron transport chain]].<ref name= \"Richards\">{{Cite book | doi=10.1016/S1546-5098(08)00010-1|chapter = Chapter 10 Metabolic and Molecular Responses of Fish to Hypoxia|title = Hypoxia| volume=27| pages=443\u2013485|series = Fish Physiology|year = 2009|last1 = Richards|first1 = Jeffrey G.| isbn=9780123746320}}</ref> <ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20\"> Schmidt-Rohr, K.

This article is a review of the effects of hypoxia on all aspects of fish, ranging from behavior down to genes.\n\n==Hypoxia tolerance==\nA fish's hypoxia tolerance can be represented in different ways. A commonly used representation is the critical O<sub>2</sub> tension (P<sub>crit</sub>), which is the lowest water O<sub>2</sub> tension (P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) at which a fish can maintain a stable O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate (M<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Claireaux|first1=G.|last2=Chabot|first2=D.|title=Responses by fishes to environmental hypoxia: integration through Fry's concept of aerobic metabolic scope|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=2016|volume=88|issue=1|pages=232\u2013251|doi=10.1111/jfb.12833|pmid=26768976}}</ref> A fish with a lower P<sub>crit</sub> is therefore thought to be more hypoxia-tolerant than a fish with a higher P<sub>crit</sub>. But while P<sub>crit</sub> is often used to represent hypoxia tolerance, it more accurately represents the ability to take up environmental O<sub>2</sub>  at hypoxic P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>s and does not incorporate the significant contributions of [[anaerobic glycolysis]] and metabolic suppression to hypoxia tolerance (see below). P<sub>crit</sub> is nevertheless closely tied to a fish's hypoxia tolerance,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mandic|first1=M.|last2=Speers-Roesch|first2=B.|last3=Richards|first3=J.G.|title=Hypoxia tolerance in sculpins is associated with high anaerobic enzyme activity in brain but not in liver or muscle|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology|date=2012|volume=86|issue=1|pages=92\u2013105|doi=10.1086/667938|pmid=23303324}}</ref> in part because some fish prioritize their use of aerobic metabolism over anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Regan|first1=M.D.|last2=Gill|first2=I.S.|last3=Richards|first3=J.G.|title=Calorespirometry reveals that goldfish prioritize aerobic metabolism over metabolic rate depression in all but near-anoxic environments|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|date=2017|volume=220|issue=4|pages=564\u2013572|doi=10.1242/jeb.145169|pmid=27913601|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/220/4/564.full.pdf}}</ref> It therefore remains a widely used hypoxia tolerance metric.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=N.J.|last2=Urbina|first2=M.A.|last3=Reardon|first3=E.E.|last4=McKenzie|first4=D.J.|last5=Wilson|first5=R.J.|title=A new analysis of hypoxia tolerance in fishes using a database of critical oxygen level (P crit)|journal=Conservation Physiology|date=2016|volume=1|issue=4|doi=10.1093/conphys/cow012|pmid=27293760|pmc=4849809|page=cow012}}</ref>\n\nA fish's hypoxia tolerance can also be represented as the amount of time it can spend at a particular hypoxic P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> before it loses dorsal-ventral equilibrium (called time-to-LOE), or the P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> at which it loses equilibrium when P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is decreased from normoxia to anoxia at some set rate (called P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>-of-LOE). A higher time-to-LOE value or a lower P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>-of-LOE value therefore imply enhanced hypoxia tolerances. In either case, LOE is a more holistic representation of overall hypoxia tolerance because it incorporates all contributors to hypoxia tolerance, including aerobic metabolism, anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression.\n[[File:Pcrit.png|thumb|Oxygen consumption rate decreases with decreasing environmental oxygen tension (P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) when P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>< P<sub>crit</sub>.

Once NEC of the [[zebrafish]] [[gills]] come in contact with either environmental or [[aortic]] [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], an outward K<sup>+</sup>  \"leak\" channel is inhibited.  It remains unclear how these K<sup>+</sup> channels are inhibited by a shortage of oxygen because there are yet to be any known direct binding sites for \"a lack of oxygen\", only whole cell and ion channel responses to hypoxia.  K<sup>+</sup>  \"leak\" channels are two-pore-domain [[ion channels]] that are open at the resting [[membrane potential]] of the cell and play a major role in setting the equilibrium resting membrane potential of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Lesage | first1=F | last2=Lazdunski | first2=M | year=2000 | title=Molecular and functional properties of two-pore-domain potassium channels | journal=Am J Physiol | volume=279 | pages=F793\u2013F801 | pmid=11053038 | issue=5| doi=10.1152/ajprenal.2000.279.5.F793 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3bc333bf22f88d60e57db19d3fe1e38a44a0272c }}</ref>  Once this \"leak\" channel is closed, the K<sup>+</sup> is no longer able to freely flow out of the cell, and the membrane potential of the NEC increases; the cell becomes depolarized.  This [[depolarization]] causes voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to open, and for [[extracellular]] Ca<sup>2+</sup> to flow down its concentration gradient into the cell causing the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to greatly increase.  Once the Ca<sup>2+</sup> is inside the cell, it binds to the [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicle]] release machinery and facilitates binding of the [[SNARE|t-snare]] complex on the vesicle to the [[SNARE|s-snare]] complex on the NEC cell membrane which initiates the release of [[neurotransmitters]] into the [[Chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]].\n\n===Signal transduction up to higher brain centres===\nIf the post-synaptic cell is a sensory neuron, then an increased firing rate in that neuron will transmit the signal to the central nervous system for integration.  Whereas, if the post-synaptic cell is a connective pillar cell or a [[vascular smooth muscle]] cell, then the [[serotonin]] will cause [[vasoconstriction]] and previously unused lamellae will be recruited through recruitment of more [[capillary]] beds, and the total surface area for gas exchange per lamella will be increased.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Farrell | first1=AP | last2=Daxboeck | first2=C | last3=Randall | first3=DJ | year=1979 | title=The effect of input pressure and flow on the pattern and resistance to flow in the isolated perfused gill of a teleost fish | journal=J Comp Physiol | volume=133 | pages=233\u2013240 | doi=10.1007/BF00691471 | issue=3}}</ref>\n\nIn fish, the hypoxic signal is carried up to the brain for processing by the [[Glossopharyngeal nerve|glossopharyngeal]] (cranial nerve IX) and [[Vagus nerve|vagus]] (cranial nerve X) nerves. The first [[Pharyngeal arch|branchial arch]] is [[innervated]] by the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX); however all four arches are innervated by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X).  Both the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves carry sensory nerve fibres into the brain and central nervous system.\n\n===Locations of oxygen sensors===\nThrough studies using mammalian model organisms, there are two main [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] for the location of oxygen sensing in chemoreceptor cells: the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] hypothesis and the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] hypothesis.  The membrane hypothesis was proposed for the [[carotid body]] in mice,<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Lopez-Barneo | first1=J | last2=Lopez-Lopez | first2=JR | last3=Urena | first3=J | last4=Gonzalez | first4=C | year=1988 | title=Chemotransduction in the carotid body: K+ current modulated by PO2 in type I chemoreceptor cells | journal=Science | volume=241 | pages=580\u2013582 | pmid=2456613 | doi=10.1126/science.2456613 | issue=4865}}</ref> and it predicts that oxygen sensing is an ion balance initiated process.  The mitochondrial hypothesis was also proposed for the carotid body of mice, but it relies on the levels of [[oxidative phosphorylation]] and/or [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) production as a cue for hypoxia.  Specifically, the oxygen sensitive K<sup>+</sup>  currents are inhibited by [[Hydrogen peroxide|H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]] and [[NADPH oxidase]] activation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Fu | first1=XW | last2=Wang | first2=D | last3=Nurse | first3=CA | last4=Dinauer | first4=MC | last5=Cutz | first5=E | year=2000 | title=NADPH oxidase is an O2 sensor in airway chemoreceptors: Evidence from K+ current modulation in wild-type and oxidase-deficient mice | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume=97 | pages=4374\u20134379 | pmid=10760304 | issue=8 | pmc=18249 | doi=10.1073/pnas.97.8.4374}}</ref>  There is evidence for both of these hypotheses depending on the species used for the study.  For the neuroepithelial cells in the zebrafish gills, there is strong evidence supporting the \"membrane hypothesis\" due to their capacity to respond to hypoxia after removal of the contents of the cell.  However, there is no evidence against multiple sites for oxygen sensing in organisms.\n\n==Acute responses to hypoxia==\nMany hypoxic environments never reach the level of [[Anoxic waters|anoxia]] and most fish are able to cope with this stress using different [[Physiology|physiological]] and behavioural strategies.  Fish that use air breathing organs (ABO) tend to live in environments with highly variable oxygen content and rely on aerial respiration during times when there is not enough oxygen to support water-breathing.<ref>{{citation | pmid =21056112 | doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2010.10.029 | title=Hypoxia tolerance and partitioning of bimodal respiration in the striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) | journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A | date=2011 | volume=158 | issue=2 | pages=207\u2013214 | first=Sjannie | last=Lefevre}}</ref>  Though all [[teleosts]] have some form of [[swim bladder]], many of them are not capable of breathing air, and they rely on aquatic surface respiration as a supply of more oxygenated water at the surface of the water.

The anodic isoforms have low oxygen affinities (high P50) and marked Bohr effects, while the cathodic lack significant pH effects and are therefore thought to confer hypoxia tolerance.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tamburrini | first1 = M | last2 = Verde | first2 = C | last3 = Olianas | first3 = A | last4 = Giardina | first4 = B | last5 = Corda | first5 = M | last6 = Sanna | first6 = MT | last7 = Fais | first7 = A | last8 = Deiana | first8 = AM | last9 = Prisco | first9 = G | last10 = Pellegrini | first10 = M | year = 2001 | title = The hemoglobin system of the brown moray Gymnothorax unicolor: Structure/function relationships | url = | journal = Eur J Biochem | volume = 268 | issue = 14| pages = 4104\u20134111 | pmid = 11454005 | doi=10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02333.x}}</ref>  Several species of African cichlids raised from early stage development under either hypoxic or normoxic conditions were contrasted in an attempt to compare Hb isoforms.

The ability to decrease energy demand by metabolic suppression is essential to ensure hypoxic survival due to the limited efficiency of anaerobic ATP production.\n\n===Switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism===\nAerobic respiration, in which oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptor, is crucial to all water-breathing fish.  When fish are deprived of oxygen, they require other ways to produce ATP.  Thus, a switch from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic metabolism occurs at the onset of hypoxia.  [[Glycolysis]] and [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] are used as alternative pathways for ATP production.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21818543 | doi=10.1007/s10695-011-9542-8 | volume=38 | issue=3 | title=Effects of dissolved oxygen on glycolytic enzyme specific activities in liver and skeletal muscle of Fundulus heteroclitus | date=June 2012 | pages=615\u201324 | journal=Fish Physiology and Biochemistry | last1 = Abbaraju | first1 = NV | last2 = Rees | first2 = BB}}</ref>  However, these pathways are much less efficient than aerobic metabolism.  For example, when using the same substrate, the total yield of ATP in anaerobic metabolism is 15 times lower than in aerobic metabolism.  This level of ATP production is not sufficient to maintain a high metabolic rate, therefore, the only survival strategy for fish is to alter their metabolic demands.\n\n===Metabolic suppression===\nMetabolic suppression is the regulated and reversible reduction of metabolic rate below [[basal metabolic rate]] (called standard metabolic rate in ectothermic animals).<ref name=\"Richards\" /> This reduces the fish's rate of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] use, which prolongs its survival time at severely hypoxic sub-P<sub>crit</sub> P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>s by reducing the rate at which the fish's finite anaerobic fuel stores ([[glycogen]]) are used. Metabolic suppression also reduces the accumulation rate of deleterious anaerobic end-products ([[lactic acid|lactate]] and protons), which delays their negative impact on the fish.\n\nThe mechanisms that fish use to suppress metabolic rate occur at behavioral, physiological and biochemical levels. Behaviorally, metabolic rate can be lowered through reduced locomotion, feeding, courtship, and mating.<ref name=\"Nilsson et al.

Furthermore, the severely limited energetic scope that comes with a metabolically suppressed state means that the fish is unable to complete critical tasks such a predator avoidance and reproduction.

Fish respond to [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] with varied behavioral, physiological, and cellular responses in order to maintain [[homeostasis]] and organism function in an oxygen-depleted environment. The biggest challenge fish face when exposed to low oxygen conditions is maintaining metabolic energy balance, as 95% of the oxygen consumed by fish is used for [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production releasing the chemical energy of O<sub>2</sub> through the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[electron transport chain]].<ref name= \"Richards\">{{Cite book | doi=10.1016/S1546-5098(08)00010-1|chapter = Chapter 10 Metabolic and Molecular Responses of Fish to Hypoxia|title = Hypoxia| volume=27| pages=443\u2013485|series = Fish Physiology|year = 2009|last1 = Richards|first1 = Jeffrey G.| isbn=9780123746320}}</ref> <ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20\"> Schmidt-Rohr, K.

This article is a review of the effects of hypoxia on all aspects of fish, ranging from behavior down to genes.\n\n==Hypoxia tolerance==\nA fish's hypoxia tolerance can be represented in different ways. A commonly used representation is the critical O<sub>2</sub> tension (P<sub>crit</sub>), which is the lowest water O<sub>2</sub> tension (P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) at which a fish can maintain a stable O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate (M<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Claireaux|first1=G.|last2=Chabot|first2=D.|title=Responses by fishes to environmental hypoxia: integration through Fry's concept of aerobic metabolic scope|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=2016|volume=88|issue=1|pages=232\u2013251|doi=10.1111/jfb.12833|pmid=26768976}}</ref> A fish with a lower P<sub>crit</sub> is therefore thought to be more hypoxia-tolerant than a fish with a higher P<sub>crit</sub>.

P<sub>crit</sub> is nevertheless closely tied to a fish's hypoxia tolerance,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mandic|first1=M.|last2=Speers-Roesch|first2=B.|last3=Richards|first3=J.G.|title=Hypoxia tolerance in sculpins is associated with high anaerobic enzyme activity in brain but not in liver or muscle|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology|date=2012|volume=86|issue=1|pages=92\u2013105|doi=10.1086/667938|pmid=23303324}}</ref> in part because some fish prioritize their use of aerobic metabolism over anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Regan|first1=M.D.|last2=Gill|first2=I.S.|last3=Richards|first3=J.G.|title=Calorespirometry reveals that goldfish prioritize aerobic metabolism over metabolic rate depression in all but near-anoxic environments|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|date=2017|volume=220|issue=4|pages=564\u2013572|doi=10.1242/jeb.145169|pmid=27913601|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/220/4/564.full.pdf}}</ref> It therefore remains a widely used hypoxia tolerance metric.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=N.J.|last2=Urbina|first2=M.A.|last3=Reardon|first3=E.E.|last4=McKenzie|first4=D.J.|last5=Wilson|first5=R.J.|title=A new analysis of hypoxia tolerance in fishes using a database of critical oxygen level (P crit)|journal=Conservation Physiology|date=2016|volume=1|issue=4|doi=10.1093/conphys/cow012|pmid=27293760|pmc=4849809|page=cow012}}</ref>\n\nA fish's hypoxia tolerance can also be represented as the amount of time it can spend at a particular hypoxic P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> before it loses dorsal-ventral equilibrium (called time-to-LOE), or the P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> at which it loses equilibrium when P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> is decreased from normoxia to anoxia at some set rate (called P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>-of-LOE). A higher time-to-LOE value or a lower P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>-of-LOE value therefore imply enhanced hypoxia tolerances. In either case, LOE is a more holistic representation of overall hypoxia tolerance because it incorporates all contributors to hypoxia tolerance, including aerobic metabolism, anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression.\n[[File:Pcrit.png|thumb|Oxygen consumption rate decreases with decreasing environmental oxygen tension (P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) when P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>< P<sub>crit</sub>.

Once NEC of the [[zebrafish]] [[gills]] come in contact with either environmental or [[aortic]] [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], an outward K<sup>+</sup>  \"leak\" channel is inhibited.  It remains unclear how these K<sup>+</sup> channels are inhibited by a shortage of oxygen because there are yet to be any known direct binding sites for \"a lack of oxygen\", only whole cell and ion channel responses to hypoxia.  K<sup>+</sup>  \"leak\" channels are two-pore-domain [[ion channels]] that are open at the resting [[membrane potential]] of the cell and play a major role in setting the equilibrium resting membrane potential of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Lesage | first1=F | last2=Lazdunski | first2=M | year=2000 | title=Molecular and functional properties of two-pore-domain potassium channels | journal=Am J Physiol | volume=279 | pages=F793\u2013F801 | pmid=11053038 | issue=5| doi=10.1152/ajprenal.2000.279.5.F793 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3bc333bf22f88d60e57db19d3fe1e38a44a0272c }}</ref>  Once this \"leak\" channel is closed, the K<sup>+</sup> is no longer able to freely flow out of the cell, and the membrane potential of the NEC increases; the cell becomes depolarized.  This [[depolarization]] causes voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to open, and for [[extracellular]] Ca<sup>2+</sup> to flow down its concentration gradient into the cell causing the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to greatly increase.  Once the Ca<sup>2+</sup> is inside the cell, it binds to the [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicle]] release machinery and facilitates binding of the [[SNARE|t-snare]] complex on the vesicle to the [[SNARE|s-snare]] complex on the NEC cell membrane which initiates the release of [[neurotransmitters]] into the [[Chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]].\n\n===Signal transduction up to higher brain centres===\nIf the post-synaptic cell is a sensory neuron, then an increased firing rate in that neuron will transmit the signal to the central nervous system for integration.  Whereas, if the post-synaptic cell is a connective pillar cell or a [[vascular smooth muscle]] cell, then the [[serotonin]] will cause [[vasoconstriction]] and previously unused lamellae will be recruited through recruitment of more [[capillary]] beds, and the total surface area for gas exchange per lamella will be increased.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Farrell | first1=AP | last2=Daxboeck | first2=C | last3=Randall | first3=DJ | year=1979 | title=The effect of input pressure and flow on the pattern and resistance to flow in the isolated perfused gill of a teleost fish | journal=J Comp Physiol | volume=133 | pages=233\u2013240 | doi=10.1007/BF00691471 | issue=3}}</ref>\n\nIn fish, the hypoxic signal is carried up to the brain for processing by the [[Glossopharyngeal nerve|glossopharyngeal]] (cranial nerve IX) and [[Vagus nerve|vagus]] (cranial nerve X) nerves. The first [[Pharyngeal arch|branchial arch]] is [[innervated]] by the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX); however all four arches are innervated by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X).  Both the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves carry sensory nerve fibres into the brain and central nervous system.\n\n===Locations of oxygen sensors===\nThrough studies using mammalian model organisms, there are two main [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] for the location of oxygen sensing in chemoreceptor cells: the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] hypothesis and the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] hypothesis.  The membrane hypothesis was proposed for the [[carotid body]] in mice,<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Lopez-Barneo | first1=J | last2=Lopez-Lopez | first2=JR | last3=Urena | first3=J | last4=Gonzalez | first4=C | year=1988 | title=Chemotransduction in the carotid body: K+ current modulated by PO2 in type I chemoreceptor cells | journal=Science | volume=241 | pages=580\u2013582 | pmid=2456613 | doi=10.1126/science.2456613 | issue=4865}}</ref> and it predicts that oxygen sensing is an ion balance initiated process.  The mitochondrial hypothesis was also proposed for the carotid body of mice, but it relies on the levels of [[oxidative phosphorylation]] and/or [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) production as a cue for hypoxia.  Specifically, the oxygen sensitive K<sup>+</sup>  currents are inhibited by [[Hydrogen peroxide|H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]] and [[NADPH oxidase]] activation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Fu | first1=XW | last2=Wang | first2=D | last3=Nurse | first3=CA | last4=Dinauer | first4=MC | last5=Cutz | first5=E | year=2000 | title=NADPH oxidase is an O2 sensor in airway chemoreceptors: Evidence from K+ current modulation in wild-type and oxidase-deficient mice | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume=97 | pages=4374\u20134379 | pmid=10760304 | issue=8 | pmc=18249 | doi=10.1073/pnas.97.8.4374}}</ref>  There is evidence for both of these hypotheses depending on the species used for the study.  For the neuroepithelial cells in the zebrafish gills, there is strong evidence supporting the \"membrane hypothesis\" due to their capacity to respond to hypoxia after removal of the contents of the cell.  However, there is no evidence against multiple sites for oxygen sensing in organisms.\n\n==Acute responses to hypoxia==\nMany hypoxic environments never reach the level of [[Anoxic waters|anoxia]] and most fish are able to cope with this stress using different [[Physiology|physiological]] and behavioural strategies.  Fish that use air breathing organs (ABO) tend to live in environments with highly variable oxygen content and rely on aerial respiration during times when there is not enough oxygen to support water-breathing.<ref>{{citation | pmid =21056112 | doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2010.10.029 | title=Hypoxia tolerance and partitioning of bimodal respiration in the striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) | journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A | date=2011 | volume=158 | issue=2 | pages=207\u2013214 | first=Sjannie | last=Lefevre}}</ref>  Though all [[teleosts]] have some form of [[swim bladder]], many of them are not capable of breathing air, and they rely on aquatic surface respiration as a supply of more oxygenated water at the surface of the water.

The ability to decrease energy demand by metabolic suppression is essential to ensure hypoxic survival due to the limited efficiency of anaerobic ATP production.\n\n===Switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism===\nAerobic respiration, in which oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptor, is crucial to all water-breathing fish.  When fish are deprived of oxygen, they require other ways to produce ATP.  Thus, a switch from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic metabolism occurs at the onset of hypoxia.  [[Glycolysis]] and [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] are used as alternative pathways for ATP production.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21818543 | doi=10.1007/s10695-011-9542-8 | volume=38 | issue=3 | title=Effects of dissolved oxygen on glycolytic enzyme specific activities in liver and skeletal muscle of Fundulus heteroclitus | date=June 2012 | pages=615\u201324 | journal=Fish Physiology and Biochemistry | last1 = Abbaraju | first1 = NV | last2 = Rees | first2 = BB}}</ref>  However, these pathways are much less efficient than aerobic metabolism.  For example, when using the same substrate, the total yield of ATP in anaerobic metabolism is 15 times lower than in aerobic metabolism.  This level of ATP production is not sufficient to maintain a high metabolic rate, therefore, the only survival strategy for fish is to alter their metabolic demands.\n\n===Metabolic suppression===\nMetabolic suppression is the regulated and reversible reduction of metabolic rate below [[basal metabolic rate]] (called standard metabolic rate in ectothermic animals).<ref name=\"Richards\" /> This reduces the fish's rate of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] use, which prolongs its survival time at severely hypoxic sub-P<sub>crit</sub> P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>s by reducing the rate at which the fish's finite anaerobic fuel stores ([[glycogen]]) are used. Metabolic suppression also reduces the accumulation rate of deleterious anaerobic end-products ([[lactic acid|lactate]] and protons), which delays their negative impact on the fish.\n\nThe mechanisms that fish use to suppress metabolic rate occur at behavioral, physiological and biochemical levels. Behaviorally, metabolic rate can be lowered through reduced locomotion, feeding, courtship, and mating.<ref name=\"Nilsson et al.

In the philosophy of science, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are logical constructions that do not have to be factual.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was not factual, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nIt differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology. The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of less formal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply this distinction to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper is aware that we have a lot of problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. He says that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.  The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be factual. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications.  He says that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Yet another example is \"this angel has large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

In the philosophy of science, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are logical constructions that do not have to be factual.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was not factual, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nIt differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology. The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of less formal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply it to the specific term \"falsifiability\", this distinction corresponds to two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper is aware that we have a lot of problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. He says that \"falsifiability\" should only be interpreted in the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.  Popper says that we do not have the same problem in the logical side of science, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because the basic statements are not required to be factual. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications on the methodological side.  He says that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Yet another example is \"this angel has large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

It is characterized by muscle hyperexcitability or weakness which, exacerbated by [[potassium]], heat or cold, can lead to uncontrolled shaking followed by [[paralysis]]. Onset usually occurs in early childhood, but it still occurs with adults.\n\nThe [[mutation]] which causes this disorder is [[dominant gene|dominant]] on SCN4A with linkage to the [[sodium channel]] expressed in [[muscle]].  The mutation causes single [[amino acid]] changes in parts of the channel which are important for inactivation.  These mutations impair \"ball and chain\" fast inactivation of SCN4A following an action potential.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nHyperkalemic periodic paralysis causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness, with attacks often beginning in childhood.<ref name=\"medlineplus\" /> Depending on the type and severity of the HyperKPP, it can increase or stabilize until the fourth or fifth decade where attacks may cease, decline, or, depending on the type, continue on into old age. Factors that can trigger attacks include rest after exercise, potassium-rich foods, stress, fatigue, weather changes, certain pollutants (e.g., cigarette smoke) and fasting. Muscle strength often improves between attacks, although many affected people may have increasing bouts of muscle weakness as the disorder progresses (abortive attacks). Sometimes with HyperKPP those affected may experience degrees of muscle stiffness and spasms ([[myotonia]]) in the affected muscles. This can be caused by the same things that trigger the paralysis, dependent on the type of myotonia.\n\nSome people with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis have increased levels of potassium in their blood ([[hyperkalemia]]) during attacks. In other cases, attacks are associated with normal blood potassium levels (normokalemia). Ingesting potassium can trigger attacks in affected individuals, even if blood potassium levels do not rise in response.\n\nIn contrast to HyperKPP, [[hypokalemic periodic paralysis]] (noted in humans) refers to loss-of-function mutations in channels that prevent muscle depolarisation and therefore are aggravated by low potassium ion concentrations.\n\n==Genetics==\nIn humans, the most common underlying genetic cause is one of several possible [[point mutation]]s in the [[gene]] ''[[SCN4A]]''.<ref>{{OMIM|17050|Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis; HYPP}}</ref> This gene codes for a [[voltage-gated sodium channel]] Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 found at the [[neuromuscular junction]]. This condition is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause it.\n\n[[Action potential]]s from the central nervous system cause [[end-plate potential]]s at the NMJ which causes sodium [[ion]]s to enter by Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 and depolarise the muscle cells. This depolarisation triggers the entry of calcium from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] to cause contraction (tensing) of the muscle. To prevent the muscle from being perpetually contracted, the channel contains a fast inactivation gate that plugs the sodium pore very quickly after it opens. This prevents further entry of sodium. In time, potassium ions will leave the muscle cells, repolarising the cells and causing the pumping of calcium away from the contractile apparatus to relax the muscle.\n\nMutations altering the usual structure and function of this sodium channel therefore disrupt regulation of muscle contraction, leading to episodes of severe muscle weakness or paralysis. Mutations have been identified in residues between transmembrane domains III and IV which make up the fast inactivation gate of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4. Mutations have been found on the cytoplasmic loops between the S4 and S5 helices of domains II, III and IV, which are the binding sites of the inactivation gate.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rojas CV, Wang JZ, Schwartz LS, Hoffman EP, Powell BR, Brown RH |title=A Met-to-Val mutation in the skeletal muscle Na+ channel alpha-subunit in hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis |journal=Nature |volume=354 |issue=6352 |pages=387\u20139 |date=December 1991 |pmid=1659668 |doi=10.1038/354387a0 |bibcode=1991Natur.354..387R }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bendahhou S, Cummins TR, Kula RW, Fu YH, Pt\u00e1cek LJ |title=Impairment of slow inactivation as a common mechanism for periodic paralysis in DIIS4-S5 |journal=Neurology |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=1266\u201372 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11971097 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11971097 |doi=10.1212/wnl.58.8.1266}}</ref>\n\nThe pathological mechanism of SCN4A mutations in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is complex, but explains the autosomal dominant and hyperkalemia-related aspects of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cannon |first1=Stephen C. |title=Sodium Channelopathies of Skeletal Muscle |journal=Voltage-gated Sodium Channels: Structure, Function and Channelopathies |date=2018 |pages=309\u2013330 |doi=10.1007/164_2017_52 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/164_2017_52 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=en|pmc=5866235 }}</ref> In patients with mutations in SCN4A, not all copies of the channel inactivate following the action potential.

However, the country continues to restrict [[human rights]] in significant ways. Extensive nationwide protests, partly over these restrictions, have been raging since 2010.\n\nPerhaps the most serious challenges to '''human rights in Algeria''' are the substantial restrictions on freedom of association and of [[Freedom of Assembly|assembly]]. There are also serious controls on freedom of expression and of the press. Other issues include extensive corruption, official impunity, the overuse of pretrial detention, substandard prison conditions, prisoner abuse, the absence of a free judiciary, restrictions on freedom of movement, violence and discrimination against women, limited workers' rights, and the commission by government agents of arbitrary killings.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref> According to the [[Human Rights Watch]] report from 2017, Algerian authorities increasingly resorted to criminal prosecutions in 2016 against [[Blog|bloggers]], [[Journalist|journalists]], and media figures for peaceful speech, using articles in the penal code criminalizing \"offending the president\", \"insulting state officials\" or \"denigrating Islam\". The report added that they have also prosecuted labor activists who organized or called for peaceful [[demonstration (protest)|demonstration]]s on charges such as \"unauthorized gathering\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/algeria |title=Algeria Events of 2016 |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\n\nAlgeria has been categorized by [[Freedom House]] as \"not free\" since it began publishing such ratings in 1972, with the exception of 1989, 1990, and 1991, when the country was labeled \"partly free\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world|work=Freedom House|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref> To the extent that there is democracy in today's Algeria, it is founded in three pieces of legislation:\n\n* The Political Parties Act (1989, amended 1997), which allowed multiple political parties\n* The Associations Act (1987, amended 1990), which permitted establishment of associations\n* The Information Act (1990), which paved the way for independent news media\n\nFree elections were held in the country beginning in 1988, but a victory by the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) in the 1991 parliamentary ballot sparked a military coup d'\u00e9tat and the imposition, in February 1992, of a state of emergency under which basic human rights were suspended. Freedom of expression, association, and assembly were severely restricted, and many individuals were arrested without charge and held without trial. A [[civil war]] raged from 1991 to 1999, and since its end there have been no proper official investigations into the massive human-rights violations that took place during the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|title=Algeria Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/algeria|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe government's main opponent in the war was the [[Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA), an Islamic terrorist organization and [[Al Qaeda]] affiliate that was described by John R. Schindler in The National Interest in July 2012 as \"supremely violent\" and as the perpetrator of \"a wave of bombings in Paris in the summer of 1995\" that were \"Al Qaeda's first attacks on the West\". Schindler notes that \"Algeria's nightmare years of 1993\u20131997 were a focus of the international human-rights community\" but that \"the terrible fratricide [of] the 1990s got little coverage in Western media, despite the fact that it probably claimed twice as many lives as the Bosnian conflict, which ran concurrently and received nonstop Western attention.\" Schindler added that \"Algeria's bloody civil war, which began twenty years ago, never really ended.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Schindler|first=John|title=The Ugly Truth about Algeria|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-ugly-truth-about-algeria-7146|work=The National Interest|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDecember 2010 marked the beginning of a period of frequent and nationwide protests inspired by the so-called \"Arab Spring\" and sparked by widespread anger over high unemployment, a serious housing shortage, high food prices, extensive corruption, and severe restrictions on freedom of expression and other human rights.\n\nThe National Coordination Committee for Change and Democracy (CNCD) is an umbrella group of opposition parties, unions, and human-rights groups that was formed in January 2011 in the wake of the violent suppression of protests in which several people were killed and hundreds injured or arrested.<ref>{{cite web|title=Algeria Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/algeria|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe CNCD planned a march in Algiers on January 21, 2011, to demand an end to the state of emergency and a restoration of democracy and freedom. The government sought to prevent the demonstration by blocking roads to Algiers, stopping trains to Algiers, setting up checkpoints and barricades within Algiers, refusing visas to representatives of the international media, detaining government opponents and journalists, and shutting down the Internet. Still, the protest went on, with authorities estimating the number of participants at 800 and the organizers estimating the number at 2000.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nicholson|first=Catherine|title=Defying a ban, protesters rally in heavily policed Algiers|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110212-algeria-protest-defy-ban-demonstration-clash-police-algiers-bouteflika-egypt|work=France 24|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref> \\ Many protesters were beaten and cameras confiscated.\n\nThe state of emergency was lifted in February 2011, but extensive restrictions on human rights remain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Algeria Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/algeria|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe following chart shows Algeria's ratings since 1972 in the [[Freedom in the World]] reports, published annually by [[Freedom House]].

rights==\n\nDiscrimination based on birth, race, gender, and a number of other attributes is illegal, although women, in particular, face considerable and systematic discrimination.\nAlthough it is unconstitutional, the government monitors the communications of its political opponents, the news media, human-rights organizations, and terrorist suspects. Homes are searched without warrants. The constitution also guarantees freedom of speech and of the press, but with various caveats. Public comments about the conduct of government forces during the 1990s are illegal, as are criticism of Islam, speech that insults government leaders, or anything that threatens \"national unity\" or offends against \"individual dignity\".\n\nPressure is exerted by the government on the news media, largely by arresting journalists for defamation, which is defined broadly and punished harshly under Algerian law. Self-censorship by some journalists is common, although other journalists do not hesitate to criticize the government openly. Radio and TV, which are entirely state-owned, provide slanted coverage and deny access to opponents of the regime. Most newspapers are printed at government-owned presses, and the regime uses this fact to exert influence on editors and reporters. It also exerts influence by wielding the power of the government-owned advertising company to place or not place ads in various publications.\n\nInternet access is usually not a problem, although the government monitors e-mail accounts and chat rooms. Academic conferences and the like are sometimes subject to governmental interference, with visas sometimes being denied to foreign scholars who have been invited to participate in such events.\nAlgerian academics require official approval before attending conferences abroad, and are often denied that approval.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThough Algeria's constitution guarantees freedom of worship, it also declares Islam the state religion and prohibits activities incompatible with Islamic morals, and in reality religious liberty for non-Muslims is limited by a number of laws and practices. Registering non-Muslim groups is difficult, proselytizing is punishable by up to three years in jail, and Christian groups often have trouble obtaining visas, although this last problem has apparently eased in recent years. In general, non-Muslims are socially tolerated, but some discrimination and abuse exists, and many Christians keep a low profile.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2011|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the rights of assembly and of association are guaranteed by the constitution, they are severely curtailed in practice. Demonstrations have been banned in Algiers since 2000. Permits are required for public meetings, and are often difficult to obtain. Official approval is required in order to form political parties and many other types of organizations, such as NGOs.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhile congratulating Algeria for lifting the state of emergency in February 2011, Human Rights Watch urged that the government still needed to \"restore basic liberties\" by amending \"numerous repressive laws and end various arbitrary practices that have no legal basis\". Sarah Leah Whitson of HRW said that lifting the state of emergency had had \"very little impact on civil liberties because a whole range of laws is on the books that can be just as repressive, or applied in a repressive manner\". Freedom of assembly, HRW noted, was \"still stifled in Algiers, and inconsistently and selectively observed in the provinces\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Algeria: Restore Civil Liberties|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/04/06/algeria-restore-civil-liberties|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, HRW complained that the Algerian government had been using \"arrests and other tactics to keep people from demonstrating in the capital in the period leading up to the May 10, 2012 elections\". Peaceful demonstrators in Algiers, including at least one candidate for election, were being detained, and some individuals had been prevented from entering the city. HRW noted that while the state of emergency had technically been lifted February 2011, security forces were still enforcing \"repressive laws on public gatherings, including a ban on gatherings in Algiers\". HRW described these laws as being \"contrary to Algeria's binding human rights obligations under international law\" and called on the country's government to \"end its unjustified restrictions on freedom of assembly in Algiers\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Algeria: Crackdown on Protest as Election Nears|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/05/09/algeria-crackdown-protest-election-nears|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, although the constitution guarantees free movement, this, too, is restricted in practice. There are limits on travel to and through the country's southern provinces. The minister of interior is empowered to place people under house arrest. Young men who still owe the country military service cannot leave the country without permission. Married women cannot travel abroad without their husbands' permission.\n\nA 1992 state of emergency law remains in effect, and the government is especially concerned with enforcing the restrictions on assembly and association. These restrictions, which are used to limit the activities of opposition political parties and other opponents of the regime, are among the major human-rights problems in Algeria.\n\n==Women's rights==\n\nThe Algerian Family Code of 1984, according to Amnesty International, \"imposed many serious limitations on women's rights, including the right to equality before the law and the right of self-determination\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Algeria Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/algeria|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nUnder Algerian law, nonspousal rape is illegal, but spousal rape is not. Women often choose to report their rapes, but convictions can be difficult to obtain, things have improved on these fronts since a 2007-2011 nationwide program to combat violence against women. Women abused by their husbands cannot file charges unless they can provide medical confirmation that they have been incapacitated for at least 15 days. A number of women's groups run rape-crisis centers and provide counseling to abused women, but have limited resources and have trouble getting spousal abuse taken seriously. Sexual harassment is a crime punishable by a fine. Women receive decent medical care during pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nAlthough the sexes are equal under the constitution, there are discriminatory elements of sharia in Algerian law. Muslim women cannot marry non-Muslims, for example. Women have the ability to get a divorce and are usually awarded child custody, although certain decisions about children's lives remain in the father's hands. Men can marry up to four women, although this is supposedly allowed only if the first wife approves and if the man can afford it. Women can choose their own husbands. Daughters inherit less than their brothers by law. Women are discriminated against in employment. In cities, women are encouraged to seek an education, and more girls than boys actually make it through secondary school. The majority of health-care and media professionals are women, as are many judges and business owners.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2012 report, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women called on Algeria to take action to \"promote gender equality and eliminate patriarchal attitudes and deeprooted discriminatory stereotypes concerning the roles and responsibilities of women and men in the family and society\". It asked Algeria specifically to promote equal opportunity in the workplace, to eliminate sexual stereotypes from school curricula, in the media, and among the judiciary, to pass legislation on violence against women, ensure that the definition of rape includes spousal rape.<ref>{{cite web|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/co/CEDAW-C-DZA-CO-3-4.pdf|work=United Nations|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Children's rights==\n\nA child can inherit Algerian nationality from either parent. The child of a Muslim father is automatically Muslim. Education through high school is free and, up to age 16, compulsory. Although illegal, child abuse is a problem, attributed to a \"culture of violence\". Child sexual abuse is technically punishable by 10\u201320 years in prison but offenders rarely receive such long sentences. Algeria is not a signatory of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere is no organized system of adoption in Algeria, and orphans and other children are placed with guardians in accordance with the so-called \"Kafala\" system, under which the children are in a \"precarious\" situation, with very little in the way of individual rights, according to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. The system is inconsistent with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.<ref>{{cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC_C_DZA_CO_3-4.pdf|work=United Nations|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Freedom of Assembly ==\n[[Human Rights Watch]] said in its annual report -2015-2016- that Algerian authorities continued to suppress peaceful protests by prohibiting all kind of gatherings held without prior approval. According to Article 97 of the penal code, organizing or participating in an unauthorized gathering, even if it is peaceful, is regarding a crime and imposes a penalty of up to one year in prison. In February, a court sentenced eight members of the National Committee for the Defense of the Rights of Unemployed Workers to one-year prison after convicting them of \"unauthorized gathering\" and \"exercising pressure on the decisions of magistrates\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/algeria|title=Algeria|date=2016-01-11|access-date=2016-08-25}}</ref>\n\n==Disabled people's rights==\n\nDiscrimination on the basis of disability is illegal, but this law is not well enforced, and social prejudice is common.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==LGBT rights==\n{{main|LGBT rights in Algeria}}\nHomosexuality and lesbianism are punishable by up to 3 years imprisonment with fines up to 10,000 dinars <ref>http://ilga.org/downloads/2017/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2017_WEB.pdf</ref>, torture<ref>https://www.humandignitytrust.org/country-profile/algeria/</ref>, beatings<ref>https://www.refworld.org/docid/474e895c1e.html</ref>, or vigilante execution<ref name=\"maskorg\">[http://www.mask.org.za/article.php?cat=Algeria&id=61 gay man seeks asylum in uk<!--Bot-generated title-->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429235309/http://www.mask.org.za/article.php?cat=Algeria&id=61|date=29 April 2010}}</ref>.

The Ministry of Labor is supposed to enforce the ban on child labor, but 1.5 million Algerian children work, mostly on farms and in shops. There is a low minimum wage, but enforcement of it is inconsistent. however, the Algerian government is helping the workers with benefirs There are rules about work hours and the like which are better enforced in the public than in the private sector. Occupational health and safety standards are not enforced effectively, either.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Rights of persons under arrest==\n\nArbitrary arrest and detention is unconstitutional in Algeria, but there is nonetheless frequent use of pretrial detention. A 2009 report noted that suspects were subjected to \"physical abuse and other brutalities\" while in pretrial detention and during questioning. A summons is required to compel a suspect to preliminary questioning and to compel defendants and plaintiffs to appear in court. Warrantless arrests may be made by police who have witnessed an offense. There are also rules indicating how long suspects may be held without charge, These procedures are usually followed. A major problem, however, is that suspects are often held before trial for very long periods. Prosecutors' requests to extend preventive detention are rarely denied by judges. There is no bail, but defendants are often released pending trial, and must report regularly to the police. The right to legal representation, and to government-paid counsel if one cannot afford to pay, is respected.\n\nTorture is sometimes used to obtain confessions from terrorist suspects and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Rights of persons on trial==\n\nAlthough Algeria's constitution stipulates that the judiciary is to be independent and provide fair trials, the president has ultimate power over the courts and defendants' rights are not always respected. Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence, the right to present witnesses and evidence, the right to appeal, and other rights, and these rights are generally respected. But verdicts are often influenced by family connections and status.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHuman Rights Watch complained in June 2012 about the cases of eight terror suspects who had been detained secretly for several years and who faced \"trials of questionable fairness because the judges refuse to allow an important witness to testify\". These cases, according to HRW, underscore \"the continuing obstacles faced by those charged with terrorist offenses, even after authorities lifted a state of emergency in 2011, to obtaining justice that is both prompt and fair\". Sarah Leah Whitson of HRW said that \"President Abdelaziz Bouteflika speaks often about judicial reform, but when it comes to trying suspected militants, reform does not yet mean fairness.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Algeria: Long Delays Tainting Terrorism Trials|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/06/18/algeria-long-delays-tainting-terrorism-trials|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Rights of prisoners==\n\nAs a rule, prison conditions are below international standards, and human-rights groups are not allowed to inspect many facilities. Overcrowding is a widespread problem, as are poor lighting, ventilation, food, and hygiene. Prisoners are allowed regular family visits and private worship. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both complained that members of radical Islamic groups are treated more harshly in prison than others.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Rights of journalists ==\nIn December 2016, the [[Euro-med HRM- Geneva|Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor]] issued a report regarding violation of [[media freedom]] in [[Algeria]]. Death of the journalist Mohammed Tamalt, 42, is an example of using the government its power to silence the individuals whose writing insulted the president of republic and the official bodies. He died after three- month hunger strike in Algeria prison in 11 December. He was sentenced two years and started his hunger the same day. He spent his three months in intensive care unit in a [[coma]] since he was suffering severe lung inflammation. He was deprived of his family and his lawyer visits. In addition, it showed that detention of a journalist because of his writing criticizing the government and not paying attention to their health are considered as violation of [[human rights]]. In July 2014, he was accused of being convicted committing crimes against the government by the Algerian court. As a result, he was sentenced two years as well as a payment of a fine equal 1,800 $. Finally, it clarified that the Algerian government imposed restriction on [[freedom of the press]]; expression; and right to peaceful demonstration, protest and assembly as well as intensified censorship of the [[Broadcast media|media]] and websites. Due to the fact that the journalists and activists criticize the ruling government, some media organizations' licenses are canceled.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1629/Algeria-must-stop-crushing-dissent-by-imprisoning-journalists-and-activists|title=Algeria must stop crushing dissent by imprisoning journalists and activists|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|newspaper=Euro-Mediterranean|language=en|access-date=2017-01-29}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Censorship in Algeria]]\n*[[Freedom of religion in Algeria]]\n*[[Human trafficking in Algeria]]\n*[[LGBT rights in Algeria]]\n*[[Politics of Algeria]]\n\n== Notes ==\n:1.{{note|a}}Note that the \"Year\" signifies the \"Year covered\".

Extensive nationwide protests, partly over these restrictions, have been raging since 2010.\n\nPerhaps the most serious challenges to '''human rights in Algeria''' are the substantial restrictions on freedom of association and of [[Freedom of Assembly|assembly]]. There are also serious controls on freedom of expression and of the press.

rights==\n\nDiscrimination based on birth, race, gender, and a number of other attributes is illegal, although women, in particular, face considerable and systematic discrimination.\nAlthough it is unconstitutional, the government monitors the communications of its political opponents, the news media, human-rights organizations, and terrorist suspects. Homes are searched without warrants. The constitution also guarantees freedom of speech and of the press, but with various caveats. Public comments about the conduct of government forces during the 1990s are illegal, as are criticism of Islam, speech that insults government leaders, or anything that threatens \"national unity\" or offends against \"individual dignity\".\n\nPressure is exerted by the government on the news media, largely by arresting journalists for defamation, which is defined broadly and punished harshly under Algerian law. Self-censorship by some journalists is common, although other journalists do not hesitate to criticize the government openly. Radio and TV, which are entirely state-owned, provide slanted coverage and deny access to opponents of the regime. Most newspapers are printed at government-owned presses, and the regime uses this fact to exert influence on editors and reporters. It also exerts influence by wielding the power of the government-owned advertising company to place or not place ads in various publications.\n\nInternet access is usually not a problem, although the government monitors e-mail accounts and chat rooms. Academic conferences and the like are sometimes subject to governmental interference, with visas sometimes being denied to foreign scholars who have been invited to participate in such events.\nAlgerian academics require official approval before attending conferences abroad, and are often denied that approval.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThough Algeria's constitution guarantees freedom of worship, it also declares Islam the state religion and prohibits activities incompatible with Islamic morals, and in reality religious liberty for non-Muslims is limited by a number of laws and practices. Registering non-Muslim groups is difficult, proselytizing is punishable by up to three years in jail, and Christian groups often have trouble obtaining visas, although this last problem has apparently eased in recent years. In general, non-Muslims are socially tolerated, but some discrimination and abuse exists, and many Christians keep a low profile.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2011|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the rights of assembly and of association are guaranteed by the constitution, they are severely curtailed in practice. Demonstrations have been banned in Algiers since 2000. Permits are required for public meetings, and are often difficult to obtain. Official approval is required in order to form political parties and many other types of organizations, such as NGOs.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhile congratulating Algeria for lifting the state of emergency in February 2011, Human Rights Watch urged that the government still needed to \"restore basic liberties\" by amending \"numerous repressive laws and end various arbitrary practices that have no legal basis\". Sarah Leah Whitson of HRW said that lifting the state of emergency had had \"very little impact on civil liberties because a whole range of laws is on the books that can be just as repressive, or applied in a repressive manner\". Freedom of assembly, HRW noted, was \"still stifled in Algiers, and inconsistently and selectively observed in the provinces\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Algeria: Restore Civil Liberties|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/04/06/algeria-restore-civil-liberties|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, HRW complained that the Algerian government had been using \"arrests and other tactics to keep people from demonstrating in the capital in the period leading up to the May 10, 2012 elections\". Peaceful demonstrators in Algiers, including at least one candidate for election, were being detained, and some individuals had been prevented from entering the city. HRW noted that while the state of emergency had technically been lifted February 2011, security forces were still enforcing \"repressive laws on public gatherings, including a ban on gatherings in Algiers\". HRW described these laws as being \"contrary to Algeria's binding human rights obligations under international law\" and called on the country's government to \"end its unjustified restrictions on freedom of assembly in Algiers\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Algeria: Crackdown on Protest as Election Nears|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/05/09/algeria-crackdown-protest-election-nears|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, although the constitution guarantees free movement, this, too, is restricted in practice. There are limits on travel to and through the country's southern provinces. The minister of interior is empowered to place people under house arrest. Young men who still owe the country military service cannot leave the country without permission. Married women cannot travel abroad without their husbands' permission.\n\nA 1992 state of emergency law remains in effect, and the government is especially concerned with enforcing the restrictions on assembly and association. These restrictions, which are used to limit the activities of opposition political parties and other opponents of the regime, are among the major human-rights problems in Algeria.\n\n==Women's rights==\n\nThe Algerian Family Code of 1984, according to Amnesty International, \"imposed many serious limitations on women's rights, including the right to equality before the law and the right of self-determination\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Algeria Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/algeria|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nUnder Algerian law, nonspousal rape is illegal, but spousal rape is not. Women often choose to report their rapes, but convictions can be difficult to obtain, things have improved on these fronts since a 2007-2011 nationwide program to combat violence against women. Women abused by their husbands cannot file charges unless they can provide medical confirmation that they have been incapacitated for at least 15 days. A number of women's groups run rape-crisis centers and provide counseling to abused women, but have limited resources and have trouble getting spousal abuse taken seriously. Sexual harassment is a crime punishable by a fine. Women receive decent medical care during pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nAlthough the sexes are equal under the constitution, there are discriminatory elements of sharia in Algerian law. Muslim women cannot marry non-Muslims, for example. Women have the ability to get a divorce and are usually awarded child custody, although certain decisions about children's lives remain in the father's hands. Men can marry up to four women, although this is supposedly allowed only if the first wife approves and if the man can afford it. Women can choose their own husbands. Daughters inherit less than their brothers by law. Women are discriminated against in employment. In cities, women are encouraged to seek an education, and more girls than boys actually make it through secondary school. The majority of health-care and media professionals are women, as are many judges and business owners.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2012 report, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women called on Algeria to take action to \"promote gender equality and eliminate patriarchal attitudes and deeprooted discriminatory stereotypes concerning the roles and responsibilities of women and men in the family and society\". It asked Algeria specifically to promote equal opportunity in the workplace, to eliminate sexual stereotypes from school curricula, in the media, and among the judiciary, to pass legislation on violence against women, ensure that the definition of rape includes spousal rape.<ref>{{cite web|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/co/CEDAW-C-DZA-CO-3-4.pdf|work=United Nations|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Children's rights==\n\nA child can inherit Algerian nationality from either parent. The child of a Muslim father is automatically Muslim. Education through high school is free and, up to age 16, compulsory. Although illegal, child abuse is a problem, attributed to a \"culture of violence\". Child sexual abuse is technically punishable by 10\u201320 years in prison but offenders rarely receive such long sentences. Algeria is not a signatory of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere is no organized system of adoption in Algeria, and orphans and other children are placed with guardians in accordance with the so-called \"Kafala\" system, under which the children are in a \"precarious\" situation, with very little in the way of individual rights, according to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. The system is inconsistent with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.<ref>{{cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC_C_DZA_CO_3-4.pdf|work=United Nations|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Freedom of Assembly ==\n[[Human Rights Watch]] said in its annual report -2015-2016- that Algerian authorities continued to suppress peaceful protests by prohibiting all kind of gatherings held without prior approval. According to Article 97 of the penal code, organizing or participating in an unauthorized gathering, even if it is peaceful, is regarding a crime and imposes a penalty of up to one year in prison. In February, a court sentenced eight members of the National Committee for the Defense of the Rights of Unemployed Workers to one-year prison after convicting them of \"unauthorized gathering\" and \"exercising pressure on the decisions of magistrates\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/algeria|title=Algeria|date=2016-01-11|access-date=2016-08-25}}</ref>\n\n==Disabled people's rights==\n\nDiscrimination on the basis of disability is illegal, but this law is not well enforced, and social prejudice is common.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==LGBT rights==\n{{main|LGBT rights in Algeria}}\nHomosexuality and lesbianism are punishable by up to 3 years imprisonment with fines up to 10,000 dinars <ref>http://ilga.org/downloads/2017/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2017_WEB.pdf</ref>, torture<ref>https://www.humandignitytrust.org/country-profile/algeria/</ref>, beatings<ref>https://www.refworld.org/docid/474e895c1e.html</ref>, or vigilante execution<ref name=\"maskorg\">[http://www.mask.org.za/article.php?cat=Algeria&id=61 gay man seeks asylum in uk<!--Bot-generated title-->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429235309/http://www.mask.org.za/article.php?cat=Algeria&id=61|date=29 April 2010}}</ref>.

Strikes are permitted, but require government approval, and are only allowed after two weeks of mediation or conciliation. Collective bargaining is permitted. Forced labor is prohibited. The Ministry of Labor is supposed to enforce the ban on child labor, but 1.5 million Algerian children work, mostly on farms and in shops. There is a low minimum wage, but enforcement of it is inconsistent. however, the Algerian government is helping the workers with benefirs There are rules about work hours and the like which are better enforced in the public than in the private sector. Occupational health and safety standards are not enforced effectively, either.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Rights of persons under arrest==\n\nArbitrary arrest and detention is unconstitutional in Algeria, but there is nonetheless frequent use of pretrial detention. A 2009 report noted that suspects were subjected to \"physical abuse and other brutalities\" while in pretrial detention and during questioning. A summons is required to compel a suspect to preliminary questioning and to compel defendants and plaintiffs to appear in court. Warrantless arrests may be made by police who have witnessed an offense. There are also rules indicating how long suspects may be held without charge, These procedures are usually followed. A major problem, however, is that suspects are often held before trial for very long periods. Prosecutors' requests to extend preventive detention are rarely denied by judges. There is no bail, but defendants are often released pending trial, and must report regularly to the police. The right to legal representation, and to government-paid counsel if one cannot afford to pay, is respected.\n\nTorture is sometimes used to obtain confessions from terrorist suspects and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Rights of persons on trial==\n\nAlthough Algeria's constitution stipulates that the judiciary is to be independent and provide fair trials, the president has ultimate power over the courts and defendants' rights are not always respected. Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence, the right to present witnesses and evidence, the right to appeal, and other rights, and these rights are generally respected. But verdicts are often influenced by family connections and status.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHuman Rights Watch complained in June 2012 about the cases of eight terror suspects who had been detained secretly for several years and who faced \"trials of questionable fairness because the judges refuse to allow an important witness to testify\". These cases, according to HRW, underscore \"the continuing obstacles faced by those charged with terrorist offenses, even after authorities lifted a state of emergency in 2011, to obtaining justice that is both prompt and fair\". Sarah Leah Whitson of HRW said that \"President Abdelaziz Bouteflika speaks often about judicial reform, but when it comes to trying suspected militants, reform does not yet mean fairness.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Algeria: Long Delays Tainting Terrorism Trials|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/06/18/algeria-long-delays-tainting-terrorism-trials|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Rights of prisoners==\n\nAs a rule, prison conditions are below international standards, and human-rights groups are not allowed to inspect many facilities. Overcrowding is a widespread problem, as are poor lighting, ventilation, food, and hygiene. Prisoners are allowed regular family visits and private worship. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both complained that members of radical Islamic groups are treated more harshly in prison than others.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Algeria|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Rights of journalists ==\nIn December 2016, the [[Euro-med HRM- Geneva|Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor]] issued a report regarding violation of [[media freedom]] in [[Algeria]]. Death of the journalist Mohammed Tamalt, 42, is an example of using the government its power to silence the individuals whose writing insulted the president of republic and the official bodies. He died after three- month hunger strike in Algeria prison in 11 December. He was sentenced two years and started his hunger the same day. He spent his three months in intensive care unit in a [[coma]] since he was suffering severe lung inflammation. He was deprived of his family and his lawyer visits. In addition, it showed that detention of a journalist because of his writing criticizing the government and not paying attention to their health are considered as violation of [[human rights]]. In July 2014, he was accused of being convicted committing crimes against the government by the Algerian court. As a result, he was sentenced two years as well as a payment of a fine equal 1,800 $. Finally, it clarified that the Algerian government imposed restriction on [[freedom of the press]]; expression; and right to peaceful demonstration, protest and assembly as well as intensified censorship of the [[Broadcast media|media]] and websites. Due to the fact that the journalists and activists criticize the ruling government, some media organizations' licenses are canceled.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1629/Algeria-must-stop-crushing-dissent-by-imprisoning-journalists-and-activists|title=Algeria must stop crushing dissent by imprisoning journalists and activists|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|newspaper=Euro-Mediterranean|language=en|access-date=2017-01-29}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Censorship in Algeria]]\n*[[Freedom of religion in Algeria]]\n*[[Human trafficking in Algeria]]\n*[[LGBT rights in Algeria]]\n*[[Politics of Algeria]]\n\n== Notes ==\n:1.{{note|a}}Note that the \"Year\" signifies the \"Year covered\".
