SPEBSQSA has since changed its name to the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]].\n\nBy year's end, the first chapter incorporated in Oklahoma with Anderson as its president. It had 85 members and a chapter name, Atomaton (for \"an atom of an idea and a ton of energy\") that recognized the [[Atomic Age]].\n\nSweet Adelines went international on March 23, 1953 when the first chapter outside the U.S. was chartered in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada. Even though there were international chapters, it wasn't until May 1991 that the name officially changed to Sweet Adelines International.\n\nIn 1957, [[Harmony, Incorporated]] split from Sweet Adelines over a dispute regarding admission of black members.

A contest was held for the best female barbershop quartet in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The winners that first year were the Decaturettes from [[Decatur, Illinois]].  The members were Viola Phillips singing Tenor, Mary Minton singing Lead, Myrtle Vest singing Baritone, and Eva Adams singing Bass.\n\nIn 1973, the organization held its first international chorus competition in [[Washington, D.C.]] The contest presented a new and exciting experience for all competing Sweet Adelines. With 64 members on stage singing ''Heart of My Heart/That Old Gang of Mine medley'' and ''There's a New Gang on the Corner'', Racine Chorus from [[Racine, Wisconsin]] were the first chorus to receive the \"international champion chorus\" title.

SPEBSQSA has since changed its name to the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]].\n\nBy year's end, the first chapter incorporated in Oklahoma with Anderson as its president. It had 85 members and a chapter name, Atomaton (for \"an atom of an idea and a ton of energy\") that recognized the [[Atomic Age]].\n\nSweet Adelines went international on March 23, 1953 when the first chapter outside the U.S. was chartered in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada. Even though there were international chapters, it wasn't until May 1991 that the name officially changed to Sweet Adelines International.\n\nIn 1957, [[Harmony, Incorporated]] split from Sweet Adelines over a dispute regarding admission of black members.

The County made no use of the property, and the building was later leased to a start-up cable network for a token sum of a dollar per year. During the ensuing court case, the plaintiff alleged that, as part of a questionable relationship, Paulk arranged for a sexual encounter between Jones and one of Paulk's former mistresses. When deposed, Jones refused to answer questions relating to that incident, as well as a number of other questions involving his dealings with Paulk. That case was ultimately withdrawn by the plaintiff's attorney, Louis Levenson, who felt that the judge in the case was biased against his client.

That case was ultimately withdrawn by the plaintiff's attorney, Louis Levenson, who felt that the judge in the case was biased against his client.
