He decides to come back to high school as a science teacher to live the high school \"experience\". He reunites with childhood best friend Derby ([[Gig Morton]]) and encounters the school bully, Slab (Kurt Ostlund), and a student in his class whom he has a crush on, named Echo ([[Matreya Fedor]]). However, because he is only 14, his students have little respect for him, and he often gets into trouble with the principal for his childlike behaviour.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Mr. Young episodes}}\n{{:List of Mr. Young episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Brendan Meyer]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ytv.com/shows/97/mr-young/characters/40/adam-young.aspx |title=YTV Shows: Top Kids Shows and Movies from YTV |publisher=YTV.com |accessdate=2012-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222012517/http://www.ytv.com/shows/97/mr-young/characters/40/adam-young.aspx |archive-date=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as Adam Young. He is teaching science class at Finnegan High School. He wants to relive his life in high school because he graduated early and couldn't go to high school. But for him, life in high school is very difficult, as he lacks adequate social skills. He is also in love with one of his students, Echo. In almost every episode, Derby tries to help Adam impress Echo which all fail from Derby's impulsivity. Adam and Echo kiss in the 90 minute special (after a lot of work that makes him go back to or refer to previous episodes, such as Mr. Elephant, Mr. Magic and Mr. Dance), Mr. First Impression. In the finale, he's no longer in Finnegan and begins work at a local university as a professor. Adam Young is similar to [[Doogie Howser, M.D.]], who also graduated from high school and college at a young age.  He started out as a science teacher at 15.\n* [[Matreya Fedor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ytv.com/shows/97/mr-young/characters/42/echo.aspx |title=YTV Shows: Top Kids Shows and Movies from YTV |publisher=YTV.com |accessdate=2012-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211223657/http://www.ytv.com/shows/97/mr-young/characters/42/echo.aspx |archive-date=2012-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as Echo Zizzleswift. Echo is a student at Finnegan High School. She is in Adam's science class. Echo also cares deeply about the environment and other people. She is thoughtful, socially aware, a tad bit gullible, and secretly likes all things to do with science-fiction. She is good friends and sometimes enemies with Adam, Ivy, Derby and Slab. Adam has a crush on her, but she seems completely unaware of this (until in Mr. Double Date, where she discovers their mutual attraction). They kissed in the 90 minute special, Mr. First Impression. Her last name was announced in \"Mr. College\". She has a pet hamster named Mr. Tickleschmootz who later mated with Slab's hamster Slab Jr. In the finale, she graduates Finnegan and attends Adam's science class at a local university. \n* [[Gig Morton]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ytv.com/shows/97/mr-young/characters/44/derby.aspx |title=YTV Shows: Top Kids Shows and Movies from YTV |publisher=YTV.com |accessdate=2012-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211223705/http://www.ytv.com/shows/97/mr-young/characters/44/derby.aspx |archive-date=2012-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as Derby von Derbotsford. Derby is a dimwitted student at Finnegan High School. He has a crush on Ivy, Adam's sister, but is always rejected and ignored by her. He also has a tendency to wear and provide costumes and hosts a radio show called \"Drive Time with Derby\" Derby is Adam's best friend and also his student, a line that Derby's more than happy to blur; almost every time Adam teaches, he falls asleep as do many of the other students. Derby is a class clown and is skilled in pranking, with an alter ego \"Gagmeister General\". Principal Tater doesn't know the true identity of the \"Gagmeister\", even after Derby admitted to being him. In the 90-minute special, Mr. First Impression, he sings a song named \"Derby Style\", a parody of [[Gangnam Style]].

Slab is the doltish bully of Finnegan High School. Though his behavior is aggressive, \"Slab\" likes doing ballet, looking at the stars, and friendship. Though he tends to pull pranks on people, and bullies nerds specifically, he says he does it to conceal his feelings. Even though he bullies Derby often by putting him in trash cans, he occasionally helps him out.

He is also afraid of cinnamon, after an incident during his childhood, and refers to his mother as \"mommy\". He is also disrespected by many students. It is implied that he may be the father of Adam and Ivy, due to their hair loss in an episode with a video in which Tater and their mother, Rachel, appear together. In the finale, after Adam revealed he was leaving Finnegan, he admitted he enjoyed Adam's teaching and making high school fun.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Raugi Yu]] as Dang. Dang is the school's janitor. He usually appears out of nowhere when people mention his name due to his sheer speed, whenever someone is  in outer [[space]], a closet, or even inside a video game, which allows him to perform actions, such as playing beach volleyball, with himself. He is very skilled at martial arts and is also shown to have a passion for leaf monkeys, Halloween, and says the word \"demon\" for things like robots, calling them \"steel demons\". Occasionally he wears a giant purple cowboy hat with feathers, which he calls his \"Fancy Hat\". He lives at Finnegan High and almost never wants to leave because leaf monkeys do not live there, who would steal his fancy hat. Dang has a twin brother named Ding that he disliked because Ding married a duck named Shirley. Dang forgave his brother who was Echo disguised as Dang (Dang could not tell the difference between the disguised Echo and his brother) because he saw Slab's mother and exclaimed, \"There are worse things to marry than duck!\". In the finale, he finally earned his high school diploma from his final science project (his amazing speeding ability) and currently attends Adam's science class at a local university. \n* [[Paula Shaw]] as Ms. Byrne. Ms. Byrne is an elderly, clueless history teacher who is in charge of the science club and school newspaper. She has very bad memory, often shown to forget things that she saw or heard a few seconds ago. She always teaches the same thing every class: [[The War of 1812]], always starting off with the question \"Who has heard of the War of 1812?\" before all the students raise their hands. It has also been suggested in several episodes that she is extremely old, though she disagrees. Notable examples include \"Mr. Younger Man\" where she claims to have seen [[Halley's Comet]] 6 times already, \"Mr. Discovery,\" where she is shown being alive in the prehistoric ages, and in \"Mr. Servant\", where she is seen to have been \"Miss [[Constantinople]]. \"Mr Summer Vacation\" showed her complaining about having to put on sunscreen, causing Adam to ask if it was because she was born before people knew about the dangers of the sun, to which Ms. Byrne replied \"No, before there was a sun!\". She also uses ancient tools (for example, a 4000-year abacus instead of a computer, being seemingly ignorant of modern technology). It is revealed that her mother and even her grandmother are still alive and she also has many elderly grandchildren. In the finale, she swallowed some water from the Fountain of Youth, appearing young for a while. After it wore off, she began a relationship with Dang's mentor in Vietnam. \n* [[Anna Galvin]] as Rachel Young. Rachel is Ivy's and Adam's mother. She delivers meals to seniors and can sometimes be helpful. She can be overtly dishonest, claiming during the school carnival that there was a \"giant man-eating chicken\" in her booth when in reality there was only a tall man eating from a bucket of chicken. Rachel is shown on occasion to be indifferent to Adam's feelings, once selling his comic book collection without his knowledge. She was schoolmates with Principal Tater once and was framed and suspended for putting glue in the mascot costume which made Tater bald. She was also once a cheerleader at Finnegan High.\n\n==Production==\nThe series was created and executive produced by [[Dan Signer]].

He decides to come back to high school as a science teacher to live the high school \"experience\". He reunites with childhood best friend Derby ([[Gig Morton]]) and encounters the school bully, Slab (Kurt Ostlund), and a student in his class whom he has a crush on, named Echo ([[Matreya Fedor]]). However, because he is only 14, his students have little respect for him, and he often gets into trouble with the principal for his childlike behaviour.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Mr. Young episodes}}\n{{:List of Mr. Young episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Brendan Meyer]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ytv.com/shows/97/mr-young/characters/40/adam-young.aspx |title=YTV Shows: Top Kids Shows and Movies from YTV |publisher=YTV.com |accessdate=2012-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222012517/http://www.ytv.com/shows/97/mr-young/characters/40/adam-young.aspx |archive-date=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as Adam Young. He is teaching science class at Finnegan High School. He wants to relive his life in high school because he graduated early and couldn't go to high school. But for him, life in high school is very difficult, as he lacks adequate social skills. He is also in love with one of his students, Echo. In almost every episode, Derby tries to help Adam impress Echo which all fail from Derby's impulsivity. Adam and Echo kiss in the 90 minute special (after a lot of work that makes him go back to or refer to previous episodes, such as Mr. Elephant, Mr. Magic and Mr. Dance), Mr. First Impression. In the finale, he's no longer in Finnegan and begins work at a local university as a professor. Adam Young is similar to [[Doogie Howser, M.D.]], who also graduated from high school and college at a young age.

Adam has a crush on her, but she seems completely unaware of this (until in Mr. Double Date, where she discovers their mutual attraction). They kissed in the 90 minute special, Mr. First Impression. Her last name was announced in \"Mr. College\".

He also has a tendency to wear and provide costumes and hosts a radio show called \"Drive Time with Derby\" Derby is Adam's best friend and also his student, a line that Derby's more than happy to blur; almost every time Adam teaches, he falls asleep as do many of the other students. Derby is a class clown and is skilled in pranking, with an alter ego \"Gagmeister General\". Principal Tater doesn't know the true identity of the \"Gagmeister\", even after Derby admitted to being him.

He is the Captain of the King [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]'s Archers.<ref>The [[Garde du Corps (France)#2nd Company (1st French Company)|true Captain]] in 1482 was [[Jacques Ier de Crussol]], vicomte d'Uz\u00e8s.</ref> His name comes from [[Phoebus]], the [[Greek god]] of the sun (also called [[Apollo]]).\n\n==In the novel==\nIn the original novel, Phoebus is an [[antagonist]]. Despite being of noble birth and very handsome, he is also vain, untrustworthy, and a [[womanizing|womanizer]]. He saves [[Esm\u00e9ralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda]] from [[Quasimodo]] and she falls in love with him. Phoebus makes a convincing show of returning her affections, but merely wants a night of passion. Esmeralda arranges to meet Phoebus and tells him of her love for him, and he convinces her that he feels the same way about her. He is in fact engaged to his cousin, Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier, who is a spiteful socialite and jealous of Esmeralda's beauty. Not only that, he has agreed to let Archdeacon [[Claude Frollo]] spy on his meeting with Esmeralda.\n\nThis decision proves his undoing, since as the couple prepare to have sex, the jealous Frollo attacks Phoebus by stabbing him in the back. Frollo makes a quick get-away and Phoebus is presumed dead with Esmeralda, being the only one present, presumed to be the killer. Phoebus, however, is not dead and soon recovers from his injury. But this does not stop Esmeralda from being tried and sentenced to death for his attempted murder as well as for witchcraft. Phoebus could have proven her innocence, but he remained silent. In the end of the novel, he marries Fleur-de-Lys, and watches Esmeralda's execution with apparently little or no remorse. Whilst being one of the few characters to survive in the novel, Hugo implies that his marriage will not be a romantic or happy one.\n\n==Adaptations==\nAmong the actors who have played Phoebus over the years in each adaptation of the novel are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

He was voiced by [[Kevin Kline]] and animated by [[Russ Edmonds]]. He returns to Paris from the wars to be Captain of the Guard under Frollo, who is portrayed as a judge in this version, because his predecessor was a \"bit of a disappointment\" to Frollo. However, Phoebus begins to harbor a great dislike towards Frollo for his harsh methods, and displays sympathy towards the downtrodden and poor, shown when he steps in to stop two of Frollo's thugs from arresting Esmeralda for stealing money (which was honestly obtained), and requests to stop the citizens from torturing Quasimodo at the Festival of Fools. He becomes fond of Esmeralda, such as complimenting her for fighting as well as a man, and the two truly fall in love (unlike the Phoebus from the novel, who only wanted passion from Esmeralda). Midway through the film, as Frollo descends into a homicidal madness and burns down almost half the city in his ruthless manhunt for Esmeralda, after developing a lust for her, Phoebus finally rebels against Frollo when he objects to burning an innocent family's house with them inside just because they had given shelter to gypsies in the past with no evidence that they have any knowledge of Esmeralda's current whereabouts. He is immediately sentenced to death for his rebellion and, after attempting to escape from Frollo and his men, is almost killed by being struck by an arrow and falling into the River Seine, but is rescued by Esmeralda from drowning. Esmeralda takes him to Notre Dame and leaves him in Quasimodo's care. Despite Quasimodo distrusting him, he and Phoebus join forces to find the Court of Miracles, the gypsy hideout, before Frollo attacks, but they are all captured when it is revealed that Frollo tricked them into helping him find the Court.\n\nIn the climactic battle, Phoebus escapes captivity to rally the French citizens to fight against Frollo's thugs and liberate their city. He pursues Frollo into the cathedral and witnesses both Frollo and Quasimodo fall from the balcony, catching Quasimodo in time to save his life. In the aftermath, Phoebus steps down to let Quasimodo have his turn with Esmeralda, but then Quasimodo finally accepts Phoebus as a good friend and blesses his romance with Esmeralda, to the couple's delight.\n\n===In the second film===\nIn Disney's 2002 direct-to-video sequel, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]'', Phoebus (again voiced by Kline) is married to Esmeralda and has a young son, Zephyr, who resembles him, with her. He continues to serve as Captain of the Guard under the new Minister of Justice, and investigates a series of thefts throughout Paris which coincide with the arrival of a gypsy circus troupe, led by Sarousch. His investigation leads him to conclude that Sarousch and his accomplice, Madelleine, are the culprits, putting a strain on his friendship with Quasimodo, who is developing a budding relationship with Madelleine. Sarousch fools Phoebus into thinking Madelleine is the sole thief so that he can steal La Fid\u00e8le, Notre Dame's most valuable bell. However, in the process, Zephyr is kidnapped. Phoebus leads the city guard to trap Sarousch, who almost escapes by holding Zephyr hostage. When Madelleine and Quasimodo rescue Zephyr, Phoebus and his men arrest Sarousch. At the Festival of Romance, he loudly declares his enduring love for his wife.\n\n===Later Disney appearances===\nThis incarnation of Phoebus makes his debut appearance in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', but voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. His role in the game is identical to the first film.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|France|Literature}}\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/characters.html The Hunchback of Notre Dame: Characters] at [[Spark Notes|SparkNotes.com]]\n* Rebello, Stephen.
