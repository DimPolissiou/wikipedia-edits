The story is notable for several major plot developments regarding [[Superman]]: the death of Superman's adopted father [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Jonathan Kent]], the return of the pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' bottled city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], and the return of the original [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] incarnation of the supervillain [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. It also serves as a prelude to the \"[[Superman: New Krypton]]\" storyarc.\n\n==Plot==\nIn flashback, [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] is shown stealing the city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]]. In the present, the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' is having a staff meeting attended by [[Perry White]], [[Lois Lane]], [[Clark Kent]], [[Jimmy Olsen]], and [[Ron Troupe]]. Also present are [[Cat Grant]] and [[Steve Lombard]], who have recently returned to the staff. Clark hears a mysterious noise with his super hearing and investigates as [[Superman]].  He discovers the noise is a Brainiac drone, sent to locate Superman. Superman promptly defeats the drone and takes it back to the [[Fortress of Solitude]]. With help from [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] it is revealed that Superman has never fought the real Brainiac, as all earlier encounters Superman had with Brainiac were with one of his probes. It is also revealed that Supergirl was on [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] when Kandor was stolen, and because of this is terrified of Brainiac.\n\nAfter visiting [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|the Kents]], Superman flies all through the galaxy in an attempt to track down Brainiac. He discovers his probes on one planet, and witnesses Brainiac capture a city as he did with Kandor. Brainiac then fires a missile into that planet's sun, causing the sun to explode and destroy the planet.  The explosion knocks Superman unconscious and he is brought upon Brainiac's ship. When Superman awakes he escapes and makes his way around Brainiac's ship. There he discovers a room full of thousands of bottled cities, including Kandor. At this point the true Brainiac reveals himself. It is revealed that Brainiac has been collecting information on all the planets he has been destroying and the next planet he will attack is Earth, including capturing Superman and Supergirl as the last remnants of Krypton.\n\nBrainiac's ship arrives over [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and sends out probes which everyone, including Supergirl, does their best to fend off. Meanwhile, Superman fights with Brainiac. After knocking him out, Superman hears a voice that sounds distinctly like his father; it is actually the voice of his uncle [[Zor-El]], who is alive inside the bottled city of Kandor (along with his wife [[Alura (DC Comics)|Alura]]). As Superman and Zor-El talk, Brainiac attacks Superman from behind. Supergirl is also caught at this point and brought to Brainiac's ship just as Metropolis is encased in a bottle and a solar-aggressor missile is fired towards the sun.\n\nSuperman is unconscious and hooked up to all the bottled cities, which allow him to hear their cries for help. Superman escapes and attacks Brainiac, before taking the bottled Metropolis and Kandor.  He frees Supergirl and convinces her to stop the solar-aggressor from hitting the sun. Superman then attacks Brainiac and knocks him out of the ship, forcing Brainiac to land on Earth. Brainiac is overwhelmed by Earth bacteria and micro-organisms.  As a result, he can not control anything on Earth and is promptly defeated by Superman. Brainiac reveals that the cities can not be sustained outside of the ship, and Superman flies off and returns Metropolis before flying to the Arctic and releasing Kandor to its normal size.\n\nSupergirl intercepts the solar-aggressor, preventing the sun from being destroyed. However Brainiac has one final trick left.  After reading Superman's mind while he was kidnapped, he knows where Superman's parents live, and he promptly fires a missile which explodes on the Kent farm. Although no one is hurt by the explosion itself, Jonathan Kent suffers a heart attack and dies in Martha's arms, just as Clark arrives.\n\nThe epilogue begins with Jonathan Kent's funeral. Clark looks over and sees [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth]] standing under a tree nearby, and after a moment with Lois, he then retreat to his family barns, where he is devastated by the loss of his adoptive father.\n\n==Recall==\n[[File:Action 869 Pre-Recall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The recalled cover of ''Action Comics'' #869, showing Superman and [[Jonathan \"Pa\" Kent]] enjoying a bottled beverage. The bottom of the drink's label appears to say \"root beer\", though the word \"root\" is less clear. Art by [[Gary Frank]].]]\nThe penultimate issue of the series, ''Action Comics'' #869, was recalled at the retailer level by DC Comics for cover content. The original cover depicted Clark and his adoptive father outside the Kent farmhouse apparently holding what may be [[beer]].\n\nDC issued a statement to retailers that the issue was recalled, and that any copies featuring the original cover be destroyed. The next week, DC reprinted the issue featuring a cover in which the label on the bottle was changed to read, \"soda pop.\"\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\nIn March 2013, the animated movie ''[[Superman: Unbound]]'' was released as part of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]].

However Brainiac has one final trick left.  After reading Superman's mind while he was kidnapped, he knows where Superman's parents live, and he promptly fires a missile which explodes on the Kent farm. Although no one is hurt by the explosion itself, Jonathan Kent suffers a heart attack and dies in Martha's arms, just as Clark arrives.\n\nThe epilogue begins with Jonathan Kent's funeral. Clark looks over and sees [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth]] standing under a tree nearby, and after a moment with Lois, he then retreat to his family barns, where he is devastated by the loss of his adoptive father.\n\n==Recall==\n[[File:Action 869 Pre-Recall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The recalled cover of ''Action Comics'' #869, showing Superman and [[Jonathan \"Pa\" Kent]] enjoying a bottled beverage.

Art by [[Gary Frank]].]]\nThe penultimate issue of the series, ''Action Comics'' #869, was recalled at the retailer level by DC Comics for cover content. The original cover depicted Clark and his adoptive father outside the Kent farmhouse apparently holding what may be [[beer]].\n\nDC issued a statement to retailers that the issue was recalled, and that any copies featuring the original cover be destroyed.

Henshaw and the crew, including Henshaw's wife, found that their bodies had begun to mutate and, after returning to Earth, Henshaw's entire crew either perished or eventually committed suicide. After learning that [[Superman]] had thrown [[Eradicator (comics)|the Eradicator]] into the sun in a battle during the space shuttle experiment, Henshaw blamed Superman for the solar flare and the accident. Before his body completely disintegrated due to the radiation exposure, Henshaw was able to save his consciousness. Using NASA communications equipment, Henshaw beamed his mind into the birthing matrix which had carried Superman from [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] to Earth as an infant. He created a small exploration craft from the birthing matrix and departed into outer space alone. Becoming increasingly mentally unstable, Henshaw used Superman's birthing matrix to create a body identical to Superman's, albeit with cybernetic parts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=64-65}}</ref> He returned to Earth to kill Superman, only to discover that [[The Death of Superman|Superman had already died]] during Henshaw's absence.

His was what [[Joseph Nye]] calls '[[soft power]]' \u2014 the power of attraction and repulsion. He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated. He was a Pole, but beyond the regime's reach. By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime. And so they came to him by the millions. They listened. He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. 'Be not afraid,' he said. Millions shouted in response, 'We want God! We want God! We want God!' The regime cowered. Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood. Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, they were finished.

I thought of its celebration as a providential opportunity during which the Church, thirty-five years after the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, would examine how far she had renewed herself, in order to be able to take up her evangelising mission with fresh enthusiasm.<ref>Novo Millenio Inuente \u00a72</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Teachings ==\n{{Catholic philosophy |expanded=all}}\nAs pope, John Paul II wrote [[List of encyclicals of Pope John Paul II|14 papal encyclicals]] and taught about sexuality in what is referred as the \"[[Theology of the Body]]\". Some key elements of his strategy to \"reposition the Catholic Church\" were encyclicals such as ''[[Ecclesia de Eucharistia]]'', ''[[Reconciliatio et paenitentia]]'' and ''[[Redemptoris Mater]]''. In his ''At the beginning of the new millennium'' (''[[Novo Millennio Ineunte]]''), he emphasised the importance of \"starting afresh from Christ\": \"No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person.\" In ''The Splendour of the Truth'' (''[[Veritatis Splendor]]''), he emphasised the dependence of man on God and His Law (\"Without the Creator, the creature disappears\") and the \"dependence of freedom on the truth\". He warned that man \"giving himself over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself\". In ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' (''On the Relationship between Faith and Reason'') John Paul promoted a renewed interest in philosophy and an autonomous pursuit of truth in theological matters. Drawing on many different sources (such as Thomism), he described the mutually supporting relationship between [[faith and rationality|faith and reason]], and emphasised that theologians should focus on that relationship. John Paul II wrote extensively about workers and the [[Catholic social teaching|social doctrine]] of the Church, which he discussed in three encyclicals: ''[[Laborem exercens]]'', ''[[Sollicitudo rei socialis]]'', and ''[[Centesimus annus]]''. Through his encyclicals and many [[General epistles|Apostolic Letters]] and Exhortations, John Paul II talked about the [[dignity]] of women and the importance of the family for the future of humanity.<ref name=\"Memory\" /> Other encyclicals include ''The Gospel of Life'' (''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'') and ''Ut Unum Sint'' (''That They May Be One''). Though critics accused him of inflexibility in explicitly re-asserting Catholic moral teachings against [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]] that have been in place for well over a thousand years, he urged a more nuanced view of [[Catholic Church and capital punishment|capital punishment]].<ref name=\"Memory\" /> In his second encyclical ''[[Dives in misericordia]]'' he stressed that [[divine mercy]] is the greatest feature of [[God]], needed especially in modern times.\n\n=== Social and political stances ===\n{{Main|Social and political stances of Pope John Paul II}}\n[[File:Ioannes Paulus II in Germany (1980).jpg|thumb|During a visit to Germany, 1980]]\nJohn Paul II was considered a conservative on [[doctrine]] and issues relating to human [[sexual reproduction]] and the ordination of women.<ref name=\"Spiegel2\" />\n\nWhile he was visiting the United States in 1977, the year before becoming pope, Wojtyla said: \"All human life, from the moments of conception and through all subsequent stages, is sacred.\"<ref name=\"Pope John Paul II Visits the US, 1977 Year in Review\" />\n\nA series of 129 lectures given by John Paul II during his Wednesday audiences in Rome between September 1979 and November 1984 were later compiled and published as a single work titled ''[[Theology of the Body]]'', an extended meditation on [[human sexuality]]. He extended it to the condemnation of abortion, euthanasia and virtually all [[capital punishment]],<ref name=\"pbs\" /> calling them all a part of a struggle between a \"[[culture of life]]\" and a \"culture of death\".<ref>John Paul II. (1995). Evangelium Vitae. Vatican City: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, \u00a795</ref> He campaigned for world debt forgiveness and [[social justice]].<ref name=\"Memory\" /><ref name=\"Spiegel2\" /> He coined the term \"[[social mortgage]]\", which related that all private property had a social dimension, namely, that \"the goods of this are originally meant for all.\"<ref>article 42, Solicitudo Rei Socialis</ref> In 2000, he publicly endorsed the [[Jubilee 2000]] campaign on African [[debt relief]] fronted by Irish rock stars [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Bono]], once famously interrupting a [[U2]] recording session by telephoning the studio and asking to speak to Bono.<ref name=\"Pope phones Bono\" />\n\nPope John Paul II, who was present and very influential at the 1962\u201365 [[Second Vatican Council]], affirmed the teachings of that Council and did much to implement them. Nevertheless, his critics often wished that he would embrace the so-called \"progressive\" agenda that some hoped would evolve as a result of the Council. In fact, the Council did not advocate \"progressive\" changes in these areas; for example, they still condemned abortion as an unspeakable crime. Pope John Paul II continued to declare that contraception, abortion, and homosexual acts were gravely sinful, and, with Joseph Ratzinger (future [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), opposed [[liberation theology]].\n\nFollowing the Church's exaltation of the marital act of sexual intercourse between a baptised man and woman within sacramental marriage as proper and exclusive to the [[sacrament]] of marriage, John Paul II believed that it was, in every instance, profaned by contraception, abortion, divorce followed by a 'second' marriage, and by homosexual acts. In 1994, John Paul II asserted the Church's lack of authority to ordain women to the priesthood, stating that without such authority ordination is not legitimately compatible with fidelity to Christ. This was also deemed a repudiation of calls to break with the constant tradition of the Church by ordaining women to the priesthood.<ref name=\"VaticanOrdinatio\" /> In addition, John Paul II chose not to end the discipline of mandatory priestly celibacy, although in a small number of unusual circumstances, he did allow certain married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests.\n\n=== Apartheid in South Africa ===\nPope John Paul II was an outspoken opponent of [[apartheid in South Africa]]. In 1985, while visiting the [[Netherlands]], he gave an impassioned speech condemning apartheid at the [[International Court of Justice]], proclaiming that \"No system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130309014419/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-13/news/mn-9935_1_afrikaners \"Pope Attacks Apartheid in Speech at U.N.

At a papal mass in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in the [[United States]] he said:\n\n<blockquote>A sign of hope is the increasing recognition that the dignity of human life must never be taken away, even in the case of someone who has done great evil. Modern society has the means of protecting itself, without definitively denying criminals the chance to reform. I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and unnecessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/1403 |title=Religious Views: Pope John Paul II's Statements on the Death Penalty |publisher=Death Penalty Information Center |accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring that visit, John Paul II convinced the then [[Governor (United States)|governor]] of Missouri, [[Mel Carnahan]], to reduce the death sentence of convicted murderer Darrell J.

At that time, Guatemala was one of only two countries in [[Latin America]] (the other being [[Cuba]]) to apply capital punishment. John Paul II asked the Guatemalan president, [[Alfonso Portillo]], for a moratorium on executions.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0802/p07s02-woam.html/(page)/3 |title=With Papal Prodding, Guatemala May End Executions |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=24 May 2013 |accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== European Union ===\nPope John Paul II pushed for a reference to Europe's Christian cultural roots in the draft of the [[European Constitution]]. In his 2003 [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Ecclesia in Europa]]'', John Paul II wrote that he \"fully (respected) the secular nature of (European) institutions\". However, he wanted the EU Constitution to enshrine religious rights, including acknowledging the rights of religious groups to organise freely, recognise the specific identity of each denomination and allow for a \"structured dialogue\" between each religious community and the EU, and extend across the European Union the legal status enjoyed by religious institutions in individual member states. \"I wish once more to appeal to those drawing up the future European Constitutional Treaty so that it will include a reference to the religion and in particular to the Christian heritage of Europe,\" John Paul II said. The pope's desire for a reference to Europe's Christian identity in the Constitution was supported by non-Catholic representatives of the [[Church of England]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] from [[Russia]], [[Romania]], and [[Greece]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/topics/european-council/aggregator/113730 |title=Pope says EU constitution should cite Christian heritage |publisher=EU Business |date=28 June 2003 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref> John Paul II's demand to include a reference to Europe's Christian roots in the European Constitution was supported by some non-Christians, such as [[Joseph Weiler]], a practising [[Orthodox Jew]] and renowned constitutional lawyer, who said that the Constitution's lack of a reference to Christianity was not a \"demonstration of neutrality,\" but, rather, \"a [[Jacobin]] attitude\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/jewish-professor-defends-mention-of-christianity-in-euro-text |title=Jewish Professor Defends Mention of Christianity in Euro Text |publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]] |date=17 September 2003 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, however, John Paul II was an enthusiastic supporter of [[European integration]]; in particular, he supported his native Poland's entry into the bloc. On 19 May 2003, three weeks before a referendum was held in Poland on EU membership, the Polish pope addressed his compatriots and urged them to vote for Poland's EU membership at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City State. While some conservative, Catholic politicians in Poland opposed EU membership, John Paul II said:\n\n<blockquote>I know that there are many in opposition to integration. I appreciate their concern about maintaining the cultural and religious identity of our nation. However, I must emphasise that Poland has always been an important part of Europe. Europe needs Poland. The Church in Europe needs the Poles' testimony of faith.

John Paul II said that it was up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a [[crime against peace]] and a violation of [[international law]].

He preached in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and received [[Robert Runcie]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

He says:\n\n<blockquote>\u2026 it would be helpful to recall \u2026 the animist religions which stress ancestor worship. It seems that those who practice them are particularly close to Christianity, and among them, the Church's missionaries also find it easier to speak a common language. Is there, perhaps, in this veneration of ancestors a kind of preparation for the Christian faith in the Communion of Saints, in which all believers\u2014whether living or dead\u2014form a single community, a single body? [\u2026] There is nothing strange, then, that the African and Asian animists would become believers in Christ more easily than followers of the great religions of the Far East.<ref>John Paul II.

To honour the pope, animist religious leaders met him at a Catholic Marian shrine in the forest, much to the pontiff's delight. John Paul II proceeded to call for the need for religious tolerance, praised nature, and emphasised common elements between animism and Christianity, saying:\n\n<blockquote>Nature, exuberant and splendid in this area of forests and lakes, impregnates spirits and hearts with its mystery and orients them spontaneously toward the mystery of He who is the author of life. It is this religious sentiment that animates you and one can say that animates all of your compatriots.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/10/world/pope-visits-palace-in-togo-then-a-woman-s-mud-hut.html Pope Visits Palace in Togo, Then a Woman's Mud Hut] ''The New York Times'', 10 August 1985</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring the investiture of President [[Thomas Boni Yayi]] of [[Benin]] as a titled [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] [[Nigerian Chieftaincy|chieftain]] on 20 December 2008, the reigning Ooni of [[Ile-Ife]], [[Nigeria]], [[Olubuse II]], referred to Pope John Paul II as a previous recipient of the same royal honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theooni.org/soko.htm |title=His Imperial Majesty, Alayeluwa Oba Okunade Sijuwade, Olubuse ll- The Ooni of Ife |publisher=Theooni.org |date=20 December 2008 |accessdate=28 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303202401/http://theooni.org/soko.htm |archivedate=3 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n=== Armenian Apostolic Church ===\nJohn Paul II had good relations with the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].

Christodoulos read a list of \"13 offences\" of the Catholic Church against the Eastern Orthodox Church since the Great Schism,<ref name=\"Macedonian\" /> including the pillaging of [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|Constantinople by crusaders]] in 1204, and bemoaned the lack of apology from the Catholic Church, saying \"Until now, there has not been heard a single request for pardon\" for the \"maniacal crusaders of the 13th century\".<ref name=\"Macedonian\" />\n\nThe pope responded by saying \"For the occasions past and present, when sons and daughters of the Catholic Church have sinned by action or omission against their Orthodox brothers and sisters, may the Lord grant us forgiveness\", to which Christodoulos immediately applauded. John Paul&nbsp;II said that the sacking of Constantinople was a source of \"profound regret\" for Catholics.<ref name=\"Macedonian\" /> Later John Paul II and Christodoulos met on a spot where [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] had once preached to Athenian Christians. They issued a 'common declaration', saying \"We shall do everything in our power, so that the Christian roots of Europe and its Christian soul may be preserved.... We condemn all recourse to violence, proselytism and fanaticism, in the name of religion.\"<ref name=\"Macedonian\" /> The two leaders then said the [[Lord's Prayer]] together, breaking an Orthodox taboo against praying with Catholics.<ref name=\"Macedonian\" />\n\nThe pope had said throughout his pontificate that one of his greatest dreams was to visit Russia, but this never occurred.

He praised [[Mohandas Gandhi]] for his \"unshakeable faith in God\", assured the Jains that the Catholic Church will continue to engage in dialogue with their religion and spoke of the common need to aid the poor.

One such theory, advanced by [[Michael Ledeen]] and heavily pushed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|United States Central Intelligence Agency]] at the time of the assassination but never substantiated by evidence, was that the Soviet Union was behind the attempt on John Paul II's life in retaliation for the pope's support of Solidarity, the Catholic, pro-democratic Polish workers' movement.<ref name=\"SanFrancisco\" /><ref name=\"ItalianPanel\" /> This theory was supported by the 2006 [[Mitrokhin Commission]], set up by [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and headed by ''[[Forza Italia]]'' senator [[Paolo Guzzanti]], which alleged that Communist Bulgarian security departments were utilised to prevent the Soviet Union's role from being uncovered, and concluded that [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|Soviet military intelligence ''(Glavnoje Razvedyvatel'noje Upravlenije)'']], not the KGB, were responsible.<ref name=\"ItalianPanel\" /> Russian Foreign Intelligence Service spokesman Boris Labusov called the accusation \"absurd\".<ref name=\"ItalianPanel\" /> The pope declared during a May 2002 visit to Bulgaria that the country's Soviet-bloc-era leadership had nothing to do with the [[List of people who survived assassination attempts|assassination attempt]].<ref name=\"SanFrancisco\" /><ref name=\"ItalianPanel\" /> However, his secretary, Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, alleged in his book ''A Life with Karol'', that the pope was convinced privately that the former Soviet Union was behind the attack.<ref name=\"Retire2\" /> It was later discovered that many of John Paul II's aides had foreign-government attachments;<ref name=\"Thomas2000\" /> Bulgaria and Russia disputed the Italian commission's conclusions, pointing out that the pope had publicly denied the Bulgarian connection.<ref name=\"ItalianPanel\" />\n\nA second assassination attempt was made on 12 May 1982, just a day before the anniversary of the first attempt on his life, in [[F\u00e1tima, Portugal|F\u00e1tima]], Portugal when a man tried to stab John Paul II with a [[bayonet]].<ref name=\"Krohn\" /><ref name=\"CBC2\" /><ref name=\"Reuters3\" /> He was stopped by security guards.

The assassination was supposed to divert attention from the next phase of the operation. However, a chemical fire inadvertently started by the cell alerted police to their whereabouts, and all were arrested a week before the pope's visit, and confessed to the plot.<ref name=\"ThePlot\" />\n\nIn 2009 John Koehler, a journalist and former army intelligence officer, published ''Spies in the Vatican: The Soviet Union's Cold War Against the Catholic Church''.<ref name=\"Koehler2011\" /> Mining mostly East German and Polish secret police archives, Koehler says the assassination attempts were \"KGB-backed\" and gives details.<ref>''Publishers Weekly'', review of 'Spies in the Vatican', 11 May 2009</ref> During John Paul II's papacy there were many [[cleric]]s within the Vatican who on nomination, declined to be ordained, and then mysteriously left the church.

His was what [[Joseph Nye]] calls '[[soft power]]' \u2014 the power of attraction and repulsion. He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated. He was a Pole, but beyond the regime's reach. By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime. And so they came to him by the millions. They listened. He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. 'Be not afraid,' he said. Millions shouted in response, 'We want God! We want God! We want God!' The regime cowered. Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood. Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, they were finished.

I thought of its celebration as a providential opportunity during which the Church, thirty-five years after the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, would examine how far she had renewed herself, in order to be able to take up her evangelising mission with fresh enthusiasm.<ref>Novo Millenio Inuente \u00a72</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Teachings ==\n{{Catholic philosophy |expanded=all}}\nAs pope, John Paul II wrote [[List of encyclicals of Pope John Paul II|14 papal encyclicals]] and taught about sexuality in what is referred as the \"[[Theology of the Body]]\". Some key elements of his strategy to \"reposition the Catholic Church\" were encyclicals such as ''[[Ecclesia de Eucharistia]]'', ''[[Reconciliatio et paenitentia]]'' and ''[[Redemptoris Mater]]''. In his ''At the beginning of the new millennium'' (''[[Novo Millennio Ineunte]]''), he emphasised the importance of \"starting afresh from Christ\": \"No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person.\" In ''The Splendour of the Truth'' (''[[Veritatis Splendor]]''), he emphasised the dependence of man on God and His Law (\"Without the Creator, the creature disappears\") and the \"dependence of freedom on the truth\". He warned that man \"giving himself over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself\". In ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' (''On the Relationship between Faith and Reason'') John Paul promoted a renewed interest in philosophy and an autonomous pursuit of truth in theological matters. Drawing on many different sources (such as Thomism), he described the mutually supporting relationship between [[faith and rationality|faith and reason]], and emphasised that theologians should focus on that relationship. John Paul II wrote extensively about workers and the [[Catholic social teaching|social doctrine]] of the Church, which he discussed in three encyclicals: ''[[Laborem exercens]]'', ''[[Sollicitudo rei socialis]]'', and ''[[Centesimus annus]]''. Through his encyclicals and many [[General epistles|Apostolic Letters]] and Exhortations, John Paul II talked about the [[dignity]] of women and the importance of the family for the future of humanity.<ref name=\"Memory\" /> Other encyclicals include ''The Gospel of Life'' (''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'') and ''Ut Unum Sint'' (''That They May Be One''). Though critics accused him of inflexibility in explicitly re-asserting Catholic moral teachings against [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]] that have been in place for well over a thousand years, he urged a more nuanced view of [[Catholic Church and capital punishment|capital punishment]].<ref name=\"Memory\" /> In his second encyclical ''[[Dives in misericordia]]'' he stressed that [[divine mercy]] is the greatest feature of [[God]], needed especially in modern times.\n\n=== Social and political stances ===\n{{Main|Social and political stances of Pope John Paul II}}\n[[File:Ioannes Paulus II in Germany (1980).jpg|thumb|During a visit to Germany, 1980]]\nJohn Paul II was considered a conservative on [[doctrine]] and issues relating to human [[sexual reproduction]] and the ordination of women.<ref name=\"Spiegel2\" />\n\nWhile he was visiting the United States in 1977, the year before becoming pope, Wojtyla said: \"All human life, from the moments of conception and through all subsequent stages, is sacred.\"<ref name=\"Pope John Paul II Visits the US, 1977 Year in Review\" />\n\nA series of 129 lectures given by John Paul II during his Wednesday audiences in Rome between September 1979 and November 1984 were later compiled and published as a single work titled ''[[Theology of the Body]]'', an extended meditation on [[human sexuality]]. He extended it to the condemnation of abortion, euthanasia and virtually all [[capital punishment]],<ref name=\"pbs\" /> calling them all a part of a struggle between a \"[[culture of life]]\" and a \"culture of death\".<ref>John Paul II. (1995). Evangelium Vitae. Vatican City: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, \u00a795</ref> He campaigned for world debt forgiveness and [[social justice]].<ref name=\"Memory\" /><ref name=\"Spiegel2\" /> He coined the term \"[[social mortgage]]\", which related that all private property had a social dimension, namely, that \"the goods of this are originally meant for all.\"<ref>article 42, Solicitudo Rei Socialis</ref> In 2000, he publicly endorsed the [[Jubilee 2000]] campaign on African [[debt relief]] fronted by Irish rock stars [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Bono]], once famously interrupting a [[U2]] recording session by telephoning the studio and asking to speak to Bono.<ref name=\"Pope phones Bono\" />\n\nPope John Paul II, who was present and very influential at the 1962\u201365 [[Second Vatican Council]], affirmed the teachings of that Council and did much to implement them. Nevertheless, his critics often wished that he would embrace the so-called \"progressive\" agenda that some hoped would evolve as a result of the Council. In fact, the Council did not advocate \"progressive\" changes in these areas; for example, they still condemned abortion as an unspeakable crime. Pope John Paul II continued to declare that contraception, abortion, and homosexual acts were gravely sinful, and, with Joseph Ratzinger (future [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), opposed [[liberation theology]].\n\nFollowing the Church's exaltation of the marital act of sexual intercourse between a baptised man and woman within sacramental marriage as proper and exclusive to the [[sacrament]] of marriage, John Paul II believed that it was, in every instance, profaned by contraception, abortion, divorce followed by a 'second' marriage, and by homosexual acts. In 1994, John Paul II asserted the Church's lack of authority to ordain women to the priesthood, stating that without such authority ordination is not legitimately compatible with fidelity to Christ. This was also deemed a repudiation of calls to break with the constant tradition of the Church by ordaining women to the priesthood.<ref name=\"VaticanOrdinatio\" /> In addition, John Paul II chose not to end the discipline of mandatory priestly celibacy, although in a small number of unusual circumstances, he did allow certain married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests.\n\n=== Apartheid in South Africa ===\nPope John Paul II was an outspoken opponent of [[apartheid in South Africa]]. In 1985, while visiting the [[Netherlands]], he gave an impassioned speech condemning apartheid at the [[International Court of Justice]], proclaiming that \"No system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130309014419/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-13/news/mn-9935_1_afrikaners \"Pope Attacks Apartheid in Speech at U.N.

At a papal mass in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in the [[United States]] he said:\n\n<blockquote>A sign of hope is the increasing recognition that the dignity of human life must never be taken away, even in the case of someone who has done great evil. Modern society has the means of protecting itself, without definitively denying criminals the chance to reform. I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and unnecessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/1403 |title=Religious Views: Pope John Paul II's Statements on the Death Penalty |publisher=Death Penalty Information Center |accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring that visit, John Paul II convinced the then [[Governor (United States)|governor]] of Missouri, [[Mel Carnahan]], to reduce the death sentence of convicted murderer Darrell J.

At that time, Guatemala was one of only two countries in [[Latin America]] (the other being [[Cuba]]) to apply capital punishment. John Paul II asked the Guatemalan president, [[Alfonso Portillo]], for a moratorium on executions.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0802/p07s02-woam.html/(page)/3 |title=With Papal Prodding, Guatemala May End Executions |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=24 May 2013 |accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== European Union ===\nPope John Paul II pushed for a reference to Europe's Christian cultural roots in the draft of the [[European Constitution]]. In his 2003 [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Ecclesia in Europa]]'', John Paul II wrote that he \"fully (respected) the secular nature of (European) institutions\". However, he wanted the EU Constitution to enshrine religious rights, including acknowledging the rights of religious groups to organise freely, recognise the specific identity of each denomination and allow for a \"structured dialogue\" between each religious community and the EU, and extend across the European Union the legal status enjoyed by religious institutions in individual member states. \"I wish once more to appeal to those drawing up the future European Constitutional Treaty so that it will include a reference to the religion and in particular to the Christian heritage of Europe,\" John Paul II said. The pope's desire for a reference to Europe's Christian identity in the Constitution was supported by non-Catholic representatives of the [[Church of England]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] from [[Russia]], [[Romania]], and [[Greece]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/topics/european-council/aggregator/113730 |title=Pope says EU constitution should cite Christian heritage |publisher=EU Business |date=28 June 2003 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref> John Paul II's demand to include a reference to Europe's Christian roots in the European Constitution was supported by some non-Christians, such as [[Joseph Weiler]], a practising [[Orthodox Jew]] and renowned constitutional lawyer, who said that the Constitution's lack of a reference to Christianity was not a \"demonstration of neutrality,\" but, rather, \"a [[Jacobin]] attitude\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/jewish-professor-defends-mention-of-christianity-in-euro-text |title=Jewish Professor Defends Mention of Christianity in Euro Text |publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]] |date=17 September 2003 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, however, John Paul II was an enthusiastic supporter of [[European integration]]; in particular, he supported his native Poland's entry into the bloc. On 19 May 2003, three weeks before a referendum was held in Poland on EU membership, the Polish pope addressed his compatriots and urged them to vote for Poland's EU membership at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City State. While some conservative, Catholic politicians in Poland opposed EU membership, John Paul II said:\n\n<blockquote>I know that there are many in opposition to integration. I appreciate their concern about maintaining the cultural and religious identity of our nation. However, I must emphasise that Poland has always been an important part of Europe. Europe needs Poland. The Church in Europe needs the Poles' testimony of faith.

John Paul II said that it was up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a [[crime against peace]] and a violation of [[international law]].

He preached in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and received [[Robert Runcie]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

He says:\n\n<blockquote>\u2026 it would be helpful to recall \u2026 the animist religions which stress ancestor worship. It seems that those who practice them are particularly close to Christianity, and among them, the Church's missionaries also find it easier to speak a common language. Is there, perhaps, in this veneration of ancestors a kind of preparation for the Christian faith in the Communion of Saints, in which all believers\u2014whether living or dead\u2014form a single community, a single body? [\u2026] There is nothing strange, then, that the African and Asian animists would become believers in Christ more easily than followers of the great religions of the Far East.<ref>John Paul II.

To honour the pope, animist religious leaders met him at a Catholic Marian shrine in the forest, much to the pontiff's delight. John Paul II proceeded to call for the need for religious tolerance, praised nature, and emphasised common elements between animism and Christianity, saying:\n\n<blockquote>Nature, exuberant and splendid in this area of forests and lakes, impregnates spirits and hearts with its mystery and orients them spontaneously toward the mystery of He who is the author of life. It is this religious sentiment that animates you and one can say that animates all of your compatriots.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/10/world/pope-visits-palace-in-togo-then-a-woman-s-mud-hut.html Pope Visits Palace in Togo, Then a Woman's Mud Hut] ''The New York Times'', 10 August 1985</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring the investiture of President [[Thomas Boni Yayi]] of [[Benin]] as a titled [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] [[Nigerian Chieftaincy|chieftain]] on 20 December 2008, the reigning Ooni of [[Ile-Ife]], [[Nigeria]], [[Olubuse II]], referred to Pope John Paul II as a previous recipient of the same royal honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theooni.org/soko.htm |title=His Imperial Majesty, Alayeluwa Oba Okunade Sijuwade, Olubuse ll- The Ooni of Ife |publisher=Theooni.org |date=20 December 2008 |accessdate=28 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303202401/http://theooni.org/soko.htm |archivedate=3 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n=== Armenian Apostolic Church ===\nJohn Paul II had good relations with the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].

Christodoulos read a list of \"13 offences\" of the Catholic Church against the Eastern Orthodox Church since the Great Schism,<ref name=\"Macedonian\" /> including the pillaging of [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|Constantinople by crusaders]] in 1204, and bemoaned the lack of apology from the Catholic Church, saying \"Until now, there has not been heard a single request for pardon\" for the \"maniacal crusaders of the 13th century\".<ref name=\"Macedonian\" />\n\nThe pope responded by saying \"For the occasions past and present, when sons and daughters of the Catholic Church have sinned by action or omission against their Orthodox brothers and sisters, may the Lord grant us forgiveness\", to which Christodoulos immediately applauded. John Paul&nbsp;II said that the sacking of Constantinople was a source of \"profound regret\" for Catholics.<ref name=\"Macedonian\" /> Later John Paul II and Christodoulos met on a spot where [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] had once preached to Athenian Christians. They issued a 'common declaration', saying \"We shall do everything in our power, so that the Christian roots of Europe and its Christian soul may be preserved.... We condemn all recourse to violence, proselytism and fanaticism, in the name of religion.\"<ref name=\"Macedonian\" /> The two leaders then said the [[Lord's Prayer]] together, breaking an Orthodox taboo against praying with Catholics.<ref name=\"Macedonian\" />\n\nThe pope had said throughout his pontificate that one of his greatest dreams was to visit Russia, but this never occurred.

He praised [[Mohandas Gandhi]] for his \"unshakeable faith in God\", assured the Jains that the Catholic Church will continue to engage in dialogue with their religion and spoke of the common need to aid the poor.

One such theory, advanced by [[Michael Ledeen]] and heavily pushed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|United States Central Intelligence Agency]] at the time of the assassination but never substantiated by evidence, was that the Soviet Union was behind the attempt on John Paul II's life in retaliation for the pope's support of Solidarity, the Catholic, pro-democratic Polish workers' movement.<ref name=\"SanFrancisco\" /><ref name=\"ItalianPanel\" /> This theory was supported by the 2006 [[Mitrokhin Commission]], set up by [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and headed by ''[[Forza Italia]]'' senator [[Paolo Guzzanti]], which alleged that Communist Bulgarian security departments were utilised to prevent the Soviet Union's role from being uncovered, and concluded that [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|Soviet military intelligence ''(Glavnoje Razvedyvatel'noje Upravlenije)'']], not the KGB, were responsible.<ref name=\"ItalianPanel\" /> Russian Foreign Intelligence Service spokesman Boris Labusov called the accusation \"absurd\".<ref name=\"ItalianPanel\" /> The pope declared during a May 2002 visit to Bulgaria that the country's Soviet-bloc-era leadership had nothing to do with the [[List of people who survived assassination attempts|assassination attempt]].<ref name=\"SanFrancisco\" /><ref name=\"ItalianPanel\" /> However, his secretary, Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, alleged in his book ''A Life with Karol'', that the pope was convinced privately that the former Soviet Union was behind the attack.<ref name=\"Retire2\" /> It was later discovered that many of John Paul II's aides had foreign-government attachments;<ref name=\"Thomas2000\" /> Bulgaria and Russia disputed the Italian commission's conclusions, pointing out that the pope had publicly denied the Bulgarian connection.<ref name=\"ItalianPanel\" />\n\nA second assassination attempt was made on 12 May 1982, just a day before the anniversary of the first attempt on his life, in [[F\u00e1tima, Portugal|F\u00e1tima]], Portugal when a man tried to stab John Paul II with a [[bayonet]].<ref name=\"Krohn\" /><ref name=\"CBC2\" /><ref name=\"Reuters3\" /> He was stopped by security guards.

The assassination was supposed to divert attention from the next phase of the operation. However, a chemical fire inadvertently started by the cell alerted police to their whereabouts, and all were arrested a week before the pope's visit, and confessed to the plot.<ref name=\"ThePlot\" />\n\nIn 2009 John Koehler, a journalist and former army intelligence officer, published ''Spies in the Vatican: The Soviet Union's Cold War Against the Catholic Church''.<ref name=\"Koehler2011\" /> Mining mostly East German and Polish secret police archives, Koehler says the assassination attempts were \"KGB-backed\" and gives details.<ref>''Publishers Weekly'', review of 'Spies in the Vatican', 11 May 2009</ref> During John Paul II's papacy there were many [[cleric]]s within the Vatican who on nomination, declined to be ordained, and then mysteriously left the church.

Many early issues also featured timelines of significant events in the characters' histories, but this stopped after the release of ''Guide to the DC Universe 2000 Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (with the exception of the two [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] ''Secret Files and Origins'' issues). Some of these one-shots are released to coincide with a new series (such as the first ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' issue), or with a special event (such as the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' issue). Originally the books featured sequential numbering, but from 2003-2006 this was dropped in favor of putting the year of publication in the title (so for example, ''[[Aquaman]] Secret Files and Origins 2003'' is the equivalent of ''Aquaman Secret Files and Origins'' #2); sequential numbering returned with the release of ''[[Green Lantern]]/[[Sinestro Corps]]: Secret Files and Origins'' #1 in 2007.\n{{-}}\n\n==Bibliography of ''Secret Files and Origins'' issues==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccf;\"\n! style=\"width:30%;\"| Issue!! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50%;\"| Profile Pages!! style=\"width:8%;\"|Issue Date!! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:12%;\"|Notes\n|-  style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"\n|''Aquaman Secret Files and Origins'' #1||[[Aquaman]], Aquaman supporting cast ([[Atlan (DC Comics)|Atlan]], [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]], [[Koryak (comics)|Koryak]], [[Vulko]]), [[Black Manta]], The Landlovers ([[Blubber (comics)|Blubber]], [[Lagoon Boy]], [[Sheeva (comics)|Sheeva]]), [[Lava Lord]], [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], [[Noble (comics)|Noble]], [[Ocean Master]], [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{dts|1998|12}}||\n|-  style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"\n|''Aquaman Secret Files and Origins 2003''||Aquaman, [[Hagen (comics)|Hagen]], The [[Lady of the Lake (comics)|Lady of the Lake]], [[McCaffrey (comics)|McCaffrey]] and [[Sweeney (comics)|Sweeney]], Mera and Vulko, [[Rodunn]], Tempest, The [[Thirst (comics)|Thirst]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{dts|2003|05}}||\n|-  style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"\n|''[[Batgirl]] Secret Files and Origins'' #1||Batgirl ([[Barbara Gordon]]), Batgirl ([[Cassandra Cain]]), [[David Cain (comics)|Cain]], [[Lady Shiva]], Oracle, Sensor and [[Force 14 (comics)|Force 14]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{dts|2002|08}}||\n|-  style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"\n|''Batman Secret Files and Origins'' #1||[[Alfred Pennyworth]], [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]], Azrael supporting cast ([[Brian Bryan]], [[Nomoz]], [[Sister Lilhy]]), [[Batman]], The [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] ([[Black Canary]], Oracle), [[Catwoman]], [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], The [[Gotham City Police Department]] (Det.

Many early issues also featured timelines of significant events in the characters' histories, but this stopped after the release of ''Guide to the DC Universe 2000 Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (with the exception of the two [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] ''Secret Files and Origins'' issues). Some of these one-shots are released to coincide with a new series (such as the first ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' issue), or with a special event (such as the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' issue). Originally the books featured sequential numbering, but from 2003-2006 this was dropped in favor of putting the year of publication in the title (so for example, ''[[Aquaman]] Secret Files and Origins 2003'' is the equivalent of ''Aquaman Secret Files and Origins'' #2); sequential numbering returned with the release of ''[[Green Lantern]]/[[Sinestro Corps]]: Secret Files and Origins'' #1 in 2007.\n{{-}}\n\n==Bibliography of ''Secret Files and Origins'' issues==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccf;\"\n! style=\"width:30%;\"| Issue!! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50%;\"| Profile Pages!! style=\"width:8%;\"|Issue Date!! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:12%;\"|Notes\n|-  style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"\n|''Aquaman Secret Files and Origins'' #1||[[Aquaman]], Aquaman supporting cast ([[Atlan (DC Comics)|Atlan]], [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]], [[Koryak (comics)|Koryak]], [[Vulko]]), [[Black Manta]], The Landlovers ([[Blubber (comics)|Blubber]], [[Lagoon Boy]], [[Sheeva (comics)|Sheeva]]), [[Lava Lord]], [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], [[Noble (comics)|Noble]], [[Ocean Master]], [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{dts|1998|12}}||\n|-  style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"\n|''Aquaman Secret Files and Origins 2003''||Aquaman, [[Hagen (comics)|Hagen]], The [[Lady of the Lake (comics)|Lady of the Lake]], [[McCaffrey (comics)|McCaffrey]] and [[Sweeney (comics)|Sweeney]], Mera and Vulko, [[Rodunn]], Tempest, The [[Thirst (comics)|Thirst]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{dts|2003|05}}||\n|-  style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"\n|''[[Batgirl]] Secret Files and Origins'' #1||Batgirl ([[Barbara Gordon]]), Batgirl ([[Cassandra Cain]]), [[David Cain (comics)|Cain]], [[Lady Shiva]], Oracle, Sensor and [[Force 14 (comics)|Force 14]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{dts|2002|08}}||\n|-  style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"\n|''Batman Secret Files and Origins'' #1||[[Alfred Pennyworth]], [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]], Azrael supporting cast ([[Brian Bryan]], [[Nomoz]], [[Sister Lilhy]]), [[Batman]], The [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] ([[Black Canary]], Oracle), [[Catwoman]], [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], The [[Gotham City Police Department]] (Det.

{"title_page": "History of Poland (1945\u20131989)", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=December 2018}}\n{{Short description|Communist rule in Poland}}\n{{History of Poland}}\nThe '''history of Poland from 1945 to 1989''' spans the period of [[Polish People's Republic|communist rule]] imposed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] over [[Poland]] after the end of [[World War II]]. These years, while featuring general [[Industrialisation|industrialization]], [[urbanization]] and many improvements in the [[standard of living]],{{Ref label|a1|a1|none}} were marred by [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] repressions, social unrest, political strife and severe economic difficulties.\n\nNear the end of World War II, the advancing Soviet [[Red Army]], along with the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East#Berling's Army: 1943\u20131945|Polish Armed Forces in the East]], pushed out the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] forces from [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]]. In February 1945, the [[Yalta Conference]] sanctioned the formation of a provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. [[Joseph Stalin]], the leader of the [[Soviet Union]], manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] was formed in [[Warsaw]] by ignoring the [[Polish government-in-exile]] based in [[London]] since 1940.\n\nDuring the subsequent [[Potsdam Conference]] in July\u2013August 1945, the three major [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] ratified the colossal westerly shift of the Polish frontier and approved its new territory between the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] and [[Curzon Line]], which resulted in Poland returning to its original borders that existed upon the [[Baptism of Poland|foundation]] of the first Polish state in 966 AD. Following the destruction of the [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] population in [[The Holocaust in Poland|the Holocaust]], the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|flight and expulsion of Germans]] in the west, [[Operation Vistula|resettlement of Ukrainians]] in the east, and the [[Polish population transfers (1944\u20131946)|repatriation of Poles]] from the [[Kresy|Eastern Borderlands]] (''Kresy''), Poland became for the first time in its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government [[1947 Polish legislative election|solidified its political power]], while the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) under [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] gained firm control over the country, which would remain an independent state within the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet sphere of influence]]. The [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|July Constitution]] was promulgated on 22 July 1952 and the country officially became the [[Polish People's Republic]] (PRL).\n\nFollowing Stalin's death in 1953, a political \"[[Khrushchev Thaw|thaw]]\" allowed a more liberal faction of the [[Communism in Poland|Polish communists]], led by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], to [[Polish October|gain power]]. By the mid-1960s, Poland began experiencing increasing economic as well as political difficulties. They culminated in the [[1968 Polish political crisis]] and the [[1970 Polish protests]], when a consumer price hike led to a wave of strikes. The government introduced a new economic program based on large-scale loans from western creditors, which resulted in a rise in living standards and expectations, but the program meant growing integration of Poland's economy with the [[world economy]] and it faltered after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In 1976, the government of [[Edward Gierek]] was forced to raise prices again and this led to the [[June 1976 protests]].\n\nThis cycle of repression and reform{{Ref label|b|b|none}} and the economic-political struggle acquired new characteristics with the 1978 election of Karol Wojty\u0142a as [[Pope John Paul II]]. Wojty\u0142a's unexpected elevation strengthened the opposition to the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and ineffective system of ''[[nomenklatura]]''-run [[state socialism]], especially with the pope's first visit to Poland in 1979. In early August 1980, a new wave of strikes resulted in the founding of the independent [[trade union]] \"[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]\" (''Solidarno\u015b\u0107'') led by [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]. The growing strength and activity of the opposition caused the government of [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] to declare [[martial law in Poland|martial law]] in December 1981. However, with the reforms of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in the Soviet Union, increasing pressure from the West, and dysfunctional economy, the regime was forced to negotiate with its opponents. The 1989 [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Talks]] led to Solidarity's participation in the [[1989 Polish legislative election|1989 election]]. Its candidates' striking victory gave rise to the first of the [[Revolutions of 1989|succession of transitions]] from communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1990, Jaruzelski resigned from the presidency following the [[1990 Polish presidential election|presidential election]] and he was succeeded by Wa\u0142\u0119sa.\n\n==Establishment of communist-ruled Poland (1944\u201348)==\n\n===Wartime devastation, border and population shifts, rebuilding of infrastructure and economy===\n\n[[File:Map of Poland (1945).png|left|thumb|Poland's [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|old and new borders in 1945]]]]\n\nBefore [[World War II]], a third of Poland's population was composed of [[Ethnic minorities in Poland|ethnic minorities]].

Already in 1948 the prewar level of industrial production was exceeded in global and per capita terms during the [[Three-Year Plan]] (''Plan Trzyletni''), implemented first and fueled by the collective desire to rebuild shattered lives.<ref name=\"Ma\u017cewski Liberalna ci\u0105g\u0142o\u015b\u0107\"/> The Three-Year Plan was the work of the Central Planning Office led by [[Czes\u0142aw Bobrowski]] and PPR economist [[Hilary Minc]], who declared the need to preserve elements of [[market (economics)|market]] [[capitalism]].

In reality it was not finished until mid-August, after the Polish communist [[Union of Polish Patriots|Moscow group]] was joined by the late-arriving [[Polish Workers' Party|Warsaw group]], led by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka|Gomu\u0142ka]] and [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut|Bierut]].<ref name=\"GP 414\"/>]]\n\nAfter the prewar [[Communist Party of Poland]] was eliminated in [[Great Purge|Stalin's purges]] in 1938 (some five thousand Polish communists were brought to [[Russia]] and killed), a group of survivors led by [[Marceli Nowotko]], [[Boles\u0142aw Mo\u0142ojec]] and [[Pawe\u0142 Finder]] convinced in 1941 the Soviets in Moscow of the need to reestablish a Polish party. The conspiratorial core of the new Polish Workers' Party was assembled in Warsaw in January 1942, and after the deaths or arrests of the above leaders there, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] emerged as the PPR's first secretary by the end of 1943. Gomu\u0142ka was a dedicated communist in the national tradition of the Polish [[left-wing politics|leftist]] movement. He loathed the Soviet practices he experienced while being trained in Russia and [[Ukraine]] in the 1930s, but was convinced of the historic necessity of alliance with the Soviet Union. He may have survived the purges because of being imprisoned in Poland for illegal labor-organizing activities in 1938\u201339. Throughout the [[German-occupied Europe|German occupation]], Gomu\u0142ka remained in Poland and was not a part of the circle organized in the Soviet Union around the [[Union of Polish Patriots]] by Stalin and [[Wanda Wasilewska]]. In Polish society of 1945, Gomu\u0142ka's party was marginally small in comparison to other political groups.<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/>\n\nWith the liberation of Polish territories and the failure of the [[Home Army]]'s [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944, control over what was to become post-war Poland passed from the occupying forces of Nazi Germany to the Red Army, and from the Red Army to [[Communism in Poland|Polish communists]], who formed the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (''Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego'', PKWN), an early government, in existence from late July 1944 in [[Lublin]]. The Polish communists became the most influential Polish factor in the politics of emerging Poland,<ref name=\"GP 413\"/> despite having initially minuscule popular support.<ref name=\"Gibianskii\"/> The PKWN recognized the legal continuity of the [[March Constitution (Poland)|March Constitution of Poland]], as opposed to the [[April Constitution of Poland|April Constitution]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Szel\u0105g 11\u201312\"/> On 6 September 1944, the PKWN issued its momentous [[land reform]] decree, the consequences of which would fundamentally alter the antiquated social and economic structure of the country. Over one million peasant families benefited from parcellation of the [[folwark|larger estates]].<ref name=\"GP 417, 424\"/>\n\nThe communists, favored by the Yalta decisions, enjoyed the advantages of Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe firmly under the influence of the Soviet Union; they exercised control over crucial government departments, such as the security services (security was in the hands of the Soviet [[NKVD]] until its Polish counterparts were developed).<ref name=\"GP 414\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the [[populism|populist]] program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's [[Government Delegation for Poland|delegation]] was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its [[Polish Underground State|political-military organizations]] became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the [[PKWN Manifesto]] and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support.<ref name=\"Od rz\u0105du do nierz\u0105du\"/> Beyond the land reform, the PKWN Manifesto foresaw no further radical ownership changes and [[nationalization]] of industry was not mentioned. On the contrary, business property was supposed to return to its owners as the economic relations become properly regulated.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 97\"/> From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established [[workers' council]]s, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its own rules.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/>\n\nThe PKWN was reshaped into the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland]] (''Rz\u0105d Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'', RTRP), which functioned from January 1945.<ref name=\"GP 413\"/> This government was headed by [[Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski]], a [[Polish Socialist Party|socialist]], but the communists, mostly non-PPR Soviet employees such as [[Micha\u0142 Rola-\u017bymierski]], held a majority of key posts.<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/> In April 1945, a Polish-Soviet treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed; it severely limited the possibilities of future Western or [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]] impact or internal cooperation with non-communist political forces in Poland.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"GP 416\"/> The consecutive early Soviet-influenced governments were subordinate to the unelected, communist-controlled parliament, the [[State National Council]] (''Krajowa Rada Narodowa'', KRN), formed by Gomu\u0142ka and his PPR in occupied Warsaw in January 1944. The communist governmental structures were not recognized by the increasingly isolated Polish government-in-exile, which had formed its own quasi-parliament, the [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'', RJN).\n\n[[File:zapluty karzel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Postwar Polish communist propaganda poster depicting \"The giant and the putrid reactionary midget\", meaning the communist [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]] soldier and the pro-Western [[Home Army]] soldier, respectively]]\n\nThe Yalta agreement stipulated a governmental union in Poland of \"all democratic and anti-Nazi elements\". Prime Minister [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] of the Polish government-in-exile resigned his post in November 1944 and having accepted the Yalta terms went to Moscow, where he negotiated with [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] the shape of a \"national unity\" government\". Miko\u0142ajczyk, along with several other exiled Polish leaders, returned to Poland in July 1945.<ref name=\"GP 417\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 569\u2013577\"/>\n\nThe new Polish [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] (''Tymczasowy Rz\u0105d Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'', TRJN) \u2014 as the Polish government was called until the [[1947 Polish legislative election|elections of 1947]] \u2014 was established on 28 June 1945.<ref name=\"GP 413\"/> Os\u00f3bka-Morawski was kept as prime minister, Gomu\u0142ka became first deputy prime minister and Miko\u0142ajczyk second deputy and minister of agriculture. The government was \"provisional\" and the [[Potsdam Conference]] soon declared that before a regular government is created, free elections must be held and a permanent constitutional system established.<ref name=\"GP 417\"/>\n\nThe communists' principal rivals were [[Freedom and Independence|veteran activists]] of the [[Polish Underground State]], Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|Polish People's Party]] (''Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe'', PSL), and veterans of the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]]. Of particular practical importance was Miko\u0142ajczyk's People's Party (originally a peasant formation), because it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with a market economy by winning the promised elections.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> Miko\u0142ajczyk hoped that an independent Polish state, friendly with the Soviet Union, would be allowed to act as a bridge between the East and the West.<ref name=\"Kochanski 569\u2013577\"/>\n\nSoviet-oriented parties, backed by the Soviet Red Army and in control of the security forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Gomu\u0142ka and Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated at the time of the PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918\u20131945 619\"/>\n\nAs a show of Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the [[Polish Underground State|Polish anti-Nazi underground]] were brought to [[Trial of the Sixteen|trial in Moscow]] in June 1945.<ref name=\"Kemp-Welch 8\"/> Their removal from the political scene precluded the possibility of a democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements.<ref name=\"GP 415\"/> The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief.<ref name=\"GP 417\"/> The exiled government in London, after Miko\u0142ajczyk's resignation led by [[Tomasz Arciszewski]], ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.<ref name=\"GP 431\"/>\n\nIn the years 1945\u201347, about 500,000 Soviet soldiers were stationed in Poland.

However, the Polish communists, led by Gomu\u0142ka and Bierut, while having no intention of giving up power, were also aware of the limited support they enjoyed among the general population. To circumvent this difficulty, in 1946 a national plebiscite, known as the [[1946 Polish people's referendum|\"Three Times Yes\" referendum]] (''Trzy razy tak''), was held first, before the parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Poland-7306\">[http://countrystudies.us/poland/16.htm  Consolidation of Communist Power.] ''Countrystudies.us/Poland.'' Retrieved 27 November 2011.</ref> The referendum comprised three fairly general, but politically charged questions about the Senate, national industries and western borders. It was meant to check and promote the popularity of communist initiatives in Poland. Since most of the important parties at the time were leftist or centrist \u2013 and could have easily approved all three options \u2013 Miko\u0142ajczyk's Polish People's Party (PSL) decided, not to be seen as merging into the government bloc, to ask its supporters to oppose the first one: the abolition of the Senate.<ref name=\"GP 424\"/> The communists voted \"Three Times Yes\". The partial results, reconstructed by the PSL, showed that the communist side was met with little support on the first question. However, after a campaign marked by electoral fraud and intimidation the communists claimed large majorities on all three questions,<ref name=\"Encyklopedia_WIEM\"/><ref name=\"GP 424\"/> which led to the [[nationalization]] of industry and state control of economic activity in general, and a unicameral national parliament (''[[Sejm]]'').<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Buchanan\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe communists consolidated power by gradually whittling away the rights of their non-communist foes, particularly by suppressing the leading opposition party \u2013 Miko\u0142ajczyk's PSL.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> In some widely publicized cases, the perceived enemies were sentenced to death on trumped up charges \u2014 among them [[Witold Pilecki]], the organizer of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] resistance. Leaders of the Home Army and of the Council of National Unity were persecuted. Many resistance fighters were murdered extrajudicially or forced to exile.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 272\u2013274\"/> The opposition members were also harassed by administrative means. Although the ongoing persecution of the former anti-Nazi and [[National Armed Forces|right-wing organizations]] by state security kept [[cursed soldiers|some partisans]] in the forests, the actions of the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Ministry of Public Security]] (known as the UB, Department of Security), NKVD and the Red Army steadily diminished their numbers. The [[National Military Union|right-wing insurgency]] radically decreased after the amnesty of July 1945<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 70\"/> and faded after the [[Amnesty of 1947|amnesty of February 1947]].<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski Zdobycie w\u0142adzy\"/><ref name=\"Daszczy\u0144ski Po wojnie\"/>\n\nBy 1946, all rightist parties had been outlawed,<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> and a new pro-government [[Front of National Unity|Democratic Bloc]] was formed in 1947 which included only the Polish Workers' Party and its leftist allies. On 19 January 1947, the [[1947 Polish legislative election|first parliamentary elections]] took place featuring primarily the PPR and allied candidates and a potentially politically potent opposition from the Polish People's Party. However, the PSL's strength and role had already been seriously compromised due to government control and persecution.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Election results were adjusted by Stalin to suit the communists, whose bloc claimed 80% of the votes. The British and American governments protested the poll for its blatant violations of the Yalta and Potsdam accords.<ref name=\"GP 426\"/> The rigged elections effectively ended the multiparty system in Poland's politics.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Buchanan\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> After the referendum dress rehearsal, this time the vote fraud was much better concealed and spread into various forms and stages and its actual scale is not known. With all the pressure and manipulations, an NKVD colonel charged with election supervision reported to Stalin that about 50% of the vote was cast for the regime's Democratic Bloc nationwide. In the new ''Sejm'', out of 444 seats, 27 were given to the [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|Polish People's Party]] of [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]].<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 91\u201395, 102\"/> He, having declared the results to be falsified, was threatened with arrest or worse and fled the country in October 1947, helped by the [[United States|US]] Embassy; other opposition leaders also left.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 91\u201395, 102\"/> In February, the new ''Sejm'' created the [[Small Constitution of 1947]].

The [[socialism|socialists]]' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss the idea of a party merger. The [[Government of the Soviet Union|Kremlin]], increasingly uncomfortable with Gomu\u0142ka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972).<ref name=\"GP 426-427\"/> In December 1948, after the removal of Gomu\u0142ka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief,<ref name=\"GP 428-430\"/> the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (''Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza'', PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]] and a [[satellite state]] of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/> Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] (ZSL) that had split from Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|PSL]] and was meant to represent rural communities, and the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Alliance of Democrats]] (SD), a token [[intelligentsia]] party (see also: [[List of political parties in Poland]]).<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/>\n\nAs the period of [[Sovietization]] and [[Stalinism]] began, the PZPR was anything but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with the PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomu\u0142ka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction.<ref name=\"GP 428-430\"/> The PZPR became divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], the official ideology, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, including those of the [[Sanation]], the [[National Democracy]], and 19th century traditions of cooperation with the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning powers]].<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/>\n\nWith Poland being a member of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]], the party's pursuits of power and reform were permanently hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the lack of public support and Soviet reaction).<ref name=\"GP 411-413\"/> Poland's political history was governed by the mutual dependence of the Soviets and the Polish communists.<ref name=\"GP 431\"/>\n\nThe ''[[nomenklatura]]'' political elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within the ruling party structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds. ''Nomenklatura'' members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management, or education. For the party, the privileged ''nomenklatura'' layer was maintained to assure the proper placement of people who were ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] dissidents [[Jacek Kuro\u0144]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political [[bureaucracy]] for its own sake.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/> The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted ''nomenklatura'' and the security services were resented.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 66\u201367\"/>\n\n==Stalinist era (1948\u201356)==\n\n{{Redirect|Stalinism in Poland|Stalinism in general|Stalinism|the state-sanctioned art of the period|Socialist realism in Poland}}\n\n[[File:Proces Pileckiego 1948-2.jpg|thumb|The [[show trial]] of Captain [[Witold Pilecki]], sentenced to death and executed May 1948]]\n\n===Removal of Gomu\u0142ka, Stalinist repressions===\n\nAs in other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, there was a Soviet-style political purge of communist officials in Poland after 1948, accused of \"nationalist\" or other \"[[Deviationism|deviationist]]\" tendencies.<ref name=\"KJL\"/> The half-hearted in Poland campaign included the arrests and imprisonments of [[Marian Spychalski]] from May 1950, and [[Micha\u0142 Rola-\u017bymierski]] five months after Stalin's death.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 170\u2013171\"/> In September 1948 W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, who opposed Stalin's direct control of the Polish PPR party, was charged, together with a group of communist leaders who like Gomu\u0142ka spent the war in Poland, with ideological departure from [[Leninism]], and dismissed from the post of the party's first secretary.<ref name=\"KJL\"/><ref name=\"Stola Anti-Zionist Campaign\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, accused of \"right-wing nationalist deviations\", had indeed emphasized the [[Polish Socialist Party|Polish socialist]] traditions and severely criticized [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] (SDKPiL) party for belittling Polish national aspirations.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 38\u201349\"/> More insidiously, the Soviets claimed Gomu\u0142ka's participation in an anti-Soviet international conspiracy.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 115\u2013116\"/> Following Boles\u0142aw Bierut's order, he was arrested by the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Ministry of Public Security]] (MBP) in early August 1951 and interrogated by [[Roman Romkowski]] and [[Anatol Fejgin]], as demanded by the Soviets.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 79\u201381\"/> Gomu\u0142ka was not subjected to physical torture unlike other communists persecuted under the regime of Bierut, [[Jakub Berman]], and other Stalin's associates.<ref name=\"LIFE\"/><ref name=\"Hodos-151\">George H.

The ORMO originated from popular self-defense efforts, which were a spontaneous reaction to the explosion of crime in the power vacuum of 1944\u201345.

The program of free and compulsory school education for all and the establishment of free institutions of higher learning received much support. The communists screened out what facts and interpretations were to be taught; history and other sciences had to follow Marxist views approved by [[Censorship in the Polish People's Republic|ideological censorship]].<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> During 1951\u201353, a large number of prewar professors who were perceived by the regime as reactionary was dismissed from universities. Government control over art and artists deepened. The Soviet-style [[socialist realism]] became the only formula accepted by the authorities after 1949. Most works of art and literature represented [[Propaganda in the Polish People's Republic|propaganda of the party]] or had to be in line with its views. (See also: [[Socialist realism in Poland]])\n\nThe reforms often brought relief for a significant part of the population. After World War II many people were willing to accept communist rule in exchange for the restoration of relatively normal life; hundreds of thousands joined the communist party and actively supported the regime. Nonetheless, latent popular discontent remained present and many Poles adopted the attitude of \"resigned cooperation\". Others, like the [[Freedom and Independence]] organization that originated from elements of the Home Army and especially the [[National Armed Forces]] actively opposed the communists, hoping for a [[World War III]] that would liberate Poland. Most [[cursed soldiers|people who took up arms against the communist regime]] had surrendered during the amnesties of 1945 and [[amnesty of 1947|1947]], but brutal repressions by the secret police continued and some fought well into the 1950s.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/><ref name=\"Piotrowski-88-90\"/>{{Ref label|d|d|none}}\n\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]], Primate of Poland]]\n\nThe communists further alienated many Poles by persecuting the [[Catholic Church in Poland|Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The [[PAX Association]] created in 1947 and led by the former prewar [[National Radical Camp|far-right]] activist [[Boles\u0142aw Piasecki]], attempted to divide the Catholic movement and promote a communist rule-friendly, [[collaborationism|collaborationist]] church.<ref name=\"GP 435\"/> The PAX did not get very far in molding the Catholic public opinion, but published numerous books and officially approved daily Catholic press.

In the party and among the intellectuals, demands for wider reforms of the Stalinist system were becoming more widespread and intense.<ref name=\"Taras-161\" />\n\nRealizing the need for new leadership, in what became known as the [[Polish October]], the [[Politburo]] chose Gomu\u0142ka, who had been released from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"history.net\" /> Subsequently, Gomu\u0142ka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Gomu\u0142ka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was reinforced by pressure from communist [[China]], which demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 246\u2013250\"/> On 21 October in Warsaw Gomu\u0142ka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland.<ref name=\"GP 439-440\"/> Gomu\u0142ka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous [[social democracy|social democratic]]-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing [[revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]] and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 38\u201349\"/> The revisionists aspired to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Pozna\u0144. Their main goals were political freedom and self-management in state enterprises.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 125\u2013131\"/> However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was nowhere in sight. On 14 May 1955, the [[Warsaw Pact]] was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of [[NATO]].<ref name=\"GP 434\"/>\n\nMany Soviet officers serving in the [[Polish People's Army|Polish Armed Forces]] were dismissed,<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=\"BZH\"/> but very few Stalinist officials were put on trial for the repressions of the Bierut period. The ''Pu\u0142awy'' faction argued that mass trials of Stalinist officials, many of them Jewish, would incite animosity toward the Jews. [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] and other Soviet advisers were sent home, and the Polish communist establishment and system took on a more independent orientation.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, conscious of geopolitical realities, agreed that [[Northern Group of Forces|Soviet troops would remain in Poland]] and no overt anti-Soviet outbursts would be allowed. However, he formalized the Polish-Soviet relations and the unprecedented for a Soviet-allied state military cooperation treaty, signed in December 1956, stated that the stationing of the Soviet forces in Poland \"can in no way violate the sovereignty of the Polish state and cannot lead to their interference in internal matters of the Polish People's Republic\".<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 214\u2013215\"/> Poland thus avoided the risk of Soviet armed intervention of the kind that crushed the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. On his part, Gomu\u0142ka rewarded the Soviets for his internal leeway with loyal support for the duration of his career. In one act of defiance, the Polish delegation at the [[United Nations]] abstained in November 1956 from the vote condemning the Soviet intervention in Hungary.<ref name=\"GP 441\"/>\n\nThere were repeated attempts by some [[History of philosophy in Poland|Polish academics and philosophers]], many related to the prewar [[Lw\u00f3w\u2013Warsaw school]] \u2013 such as [[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Ossowski]] and [[Adam Schaff]] \u2013 to create a bridge between Poland's history and [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology and develop a specific form of [[Communism in Poland|Polish Marxism]]. Such efforts were stifled due to the regime's unwillingness to risk the wrath of the Soviet Union for deviating too far from the Soviet [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. Ko\u0142akowski, a leading revisionist, was verbally attacked by Gomu\u0142ka in 1957, expelled from the party in 1966 and had to emigrate in 1968.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 218\u2013219\"/><ref name=\"PlMarx\"/><ref name=\"GP 410-411\"/> Among other noted revisionists were [[W\u0142odzimierz Brus]], [[Bronis\u0142aw Baczko]], [[Zygmunt Bauman]], and [[Krzysztof Pomian]].

The council included the prominent economists [[Oskar R. Lange]], [[Czes\u0142aw Bobrowski]], [[Micha\u0142 Kalecki]], and [[Edward Lipi\u0144ski]]. They proposed a [[Market economy|market]] reform, beginning with the granting of greater self-rule and more independent decision-making capability to enterprises, to facilitate their \"realization of plan goals\". But the recommended economic improvements, despite the self-restraint of the authors, were not compatible with the obligatory at that time heavy-handed centralized economic command system, and the reform effort fizzled out.<ref name=\"Reforma nie zacz\u0119\u0142a\"/>\n\nIn October 1957, Poland's Foreign Minister [[Adam Rapacki]] proposed a European [[Rapacki Plan|nuclear-free zone]] that would include the territories of Poland, [[West Germany]], [[East Germany]] and [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"GP 441\"/> In August 1961, the new [[Berlin Wall]] cemented the division of Europe.\n\nDuring 1948\u201371, the Polish government signed [[Indemnity|indemnification]] agreements with a number of [[Western Europe|West European]] countries (excluding those considered allies of [[Nazi Germany]]), [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The agreements dealt with compensation for the losses incurred by citizens and firms of the countries involved as a result of war events and the subsequent [[nationalization]]. The agreement with the U.S. followed the visit to Poland of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in August 1959 and his talks with Gomu\u0142ka. It was signed in 1960 and the agreed amount had been paid by the Polish government in twenty installments. The U.S. government thereby assumed responsibility for indemnities resulting from claims filed by U.S. citizens.<ref name=\"Polsko nie daj sie\"/>\n\nAfter the first wave of reform, Gomu\u0142ka's regime started to move back on their promises. Control over mass media and universities was gradually tightened, and many of the younger and more reformist members of the party were forced out (over 200,000 purged already in 1958, when the PZPR undertook a \"verification\" of its membership).<ref name=\"Werblan Szkice 149\u2013150\"/> The reform-promising Gomu\u0142ka of 1956 turned into the authoritarian Gomu\u0142ka of the 1960s. Although Poland enjoyed a period of relative stability in that decade, the idealism of the \"Polish October\" faded away.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The decisions made at the XIII Plenum of the Central Committee, held in 1963, meant a definite end of the post-October liberalization period. The demise of Gomu\u0142ka's tactical allies, the ''Pu\u0142awy'' faction, gradually replaced by Gomu\u0142ka's own people, was apparent when [[Roman Zambrowski]], the leading Jewish politician, was removed from the Politburo.<ref name=\"Stola 13\u201327\"/>\n\nPoland under Gomu\u0142ka's rule was generally considered one of the more liberal [[communist state]]s. However, Poles could still go to prison for writing [[political satire]] about the party leader, as [[Janusz Szpota\u0144ski]] did,<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 337\"/> or for publishing a book abroad. A March 1964 \"Letter of the 34\", signed by leading intellectuals and delivered to the office of Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, criticized the worsening censorship and demanded a more open cultural policy, as guaranteed by the constitution.<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski Najs\u0142ynniejszy list Peerelu\"/> [[Jacek Kuro\u0144]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] were expelled from the party and from 1965 imprisoned for written criticism (an \"Open Letter to the Party\") of the party rule and pointing out the contradictory nature of the supposedly workers' state.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 305\u2013306\"/> Kuro\u0144 and Modzelewski accused the regime of betraying the revolutionary cause; like many younger Polish reformers, they spoke from [[New Left|leftist positions]] and were ideologically closely aligned with Western radicals of the 1960s.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 1\u20136\"/>\n\nAs the regime was getting less liberal and more repressive, Gomu\u0142ka's popularity declined as his initial vision lost its impetus.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Many Poles found Gomu\u0142ka's self-righteous attitude irritating and his demeanor provincial. He reacted to increasing criticism by refusing to budge and insulating himself with the help of cronies, of whom [[Zenon Kliszko]] was the most influential. Within the party, Minister of the Interior [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]] and his nationalist-communist faction known as \"the Partisans\" (together with ''Moczarowcy'', the much broader system of Moczar's political clientele) were looking for an opportunity to assert their dominance.<ref name=\"Stola Anti-Zionist Campaign\"/><ref name=\"Stola 13\u201327\"/><ref name=\"GP 441-442\"/>\n\n[[File:Polski Fiat 125p.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[Polski Fiat 125p]], produced in Poland from the late 1960s, was based on technology purchased from [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]]]]\n\nBy the mid-1960s, Poland was starting to experience economic difficulties and the appreciable thus far standard of living improvements were showing signs of stagnation (during 1960\u201370 real wages for workers grew only by an average of 1.8% per year). The postwar [[Business cycle|economic boom]] was ending and the increasingly [[globalization|globalized]] and integrated [[world economy]] was becoming inhospitable to national developments operating behind trade barriers.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/><ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 12\u201313\"/> Like the other communist states, Poland was spending too much on heavy industry, armaments and prestige projects and too little on consumer production. The failure of Soviet-style collectivization returned the collectivized land to the peasants,<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> but most of their farms were too small to be prosperous and  productivity in agriculture remained low. Economic relations with West Germany were frozen due to East German interference and resistance to economic integration. Gomu\u0142ka attributed the signs of economic decline to faulty implementation of the fundamentally correct directions issued by central organs of the party. He failed to appreciate the corrective role of the [[Market (economics)|market]], whose [[feedback]] could not be replaced by theoretical computations, planning and administrative decisions.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 236\u2013238\"/> On the other hand, pursuing conservative investment rather than consumption oriented economic policies, his government generated no foreign debt.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 224\"/>\n\nFrom 1960, the regime increasingly implemented anti-Catholic policies, including harassment, atheistic propaganda, and measures that made carrying out religious practices more difficult.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 227\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, according to Andrzej Leder, was the last Polish politician who seriously tried to realize an [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] program, a staple leftist undertaking.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 185\u2013187\"/> In 1965, the [[Episcopal Conference of Poland|Conference of Polish Bishops]] issued the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]].<ref name=\"Stelmachowski 33\"/> In 1966, the celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of the [[Christianization of Poland]] led by the [[Primate (bishop)|primate]], Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] and other bishops who toured the country, turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the [[Catholic Church in Poland]].<ref name=\"GP I 15-17\"/> In fierce competition, the state authorities conducted their own national celebrations, stressing the origin of Polish statehood,<ref name=\"GP I 15-17\"/> but the display of the Church hierarchy's command of enormous crowds in a land ruled by the communists must have impressed the Catholic [[prelate]]s in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and elsewhere.

Poland's security chief Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar, a wartime communist partisan commander, based his appeal on nationalistic rhetoric combined with anti-intelligentsia and anti-Jewish sentiments and became the chief challenger.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> The party leader in [[Upper Silesia]], [[Edward Gierek]], who had become involved with the communist movement as a teenage mining industry laborer in France,<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/> also emerged as a possible alternative leader. Gierek was favored by the more pragmatic and technocratic members of the ''[[nomenklatura]]''.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 268\u2013272\"/> From January 1968, Polish revisionist opposition and other circles were strongly influenced by the developing movement of the [[Prague Spring]].<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 232\"/>\n\nIn March 1968, student demonstrations at the [[University of Warsaw]] broke out in the wake of the government's ban on further performance of the play ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' by [[Adam Mickiewicz]] (written in 1824) at the [[National Theatre, Warsaw|National Theatre in Warsaw]],<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski March 68\"/> because of its alleged \"anti-Soviet references\".

Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 49\u201353\"/> The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomu\u0142ka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which gave Gomu\u0142ka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power early in his term.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 282\"/>\n\nThe revisionist dissident prominence in the 1968 events overshadowed the equally significant awakening taking place among the working class of Poland. [[Gda\u0144sk]], where thousands of students and workers fought the police on March 15, had the highest in the country rate of administrative detentions and court cases.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 342\"/> The greatest proportion of people arrested and imprisoned in March and April 1968 in Poland were classified by the authorities as \"workers\".<ref name=Friszke/>\n\nAn internal attempt was made to discredit Gomu\u0142ka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and tolerated. In the meantime, irreversible damage to society had been wrecked by the Moczar movement. Gomu\u0142ka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], was preoccupied with the [[Prague Spring|crisis in Czechoslovakia]] and not inclined to support personnel changes in the Polish leadership.<ref name=\"GP 442-443\"/>\n\nIn August 1968, the [[Polish People's Army]] took part in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Some Polish intellectuals protested, and [[Ryszard Siwiec]] burned himself alive during celebrations of an official holiday.

The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church leaders issued the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]], criticized then by the Polish government.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka felt proud and secure after the treaty with West Germany, his milestone political achievement. It signified a lasting trend in Poland's international policy: extricating the country from the disproportional dependence on Russia and compensating the security vulnerability by building good relations with Germany.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 238\u2013240\"/><ref name=\"GP 444-445\"/>\n\nBut the event could not mask the economic crisis into which Poland was drifting. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 the regime unexpectedly announced substantial increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The new measures were incomprehensible to many workers, and their unfortunate timing (before Christmas, the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomu\u0142ka's fall from power.\n\nOn 14\u201319 December 1970, [[1970 Polish protests|mass demonstrations]] against the price rises broke out in the northern ([[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast) cities of [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Gdynia]], [[Elbl\u0105g]] and [[Szczecin]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> In violent confrontations at those and other locations 19 public buildings were destroyed or damaged, including headquarters of the party in Gda\u0144sk and Szczecin.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 238\u2013240\"/> The PZPR Central Committee was deliberating in Warsaw, but a smaller conference, led by Gomu\u0142ka, issued an authorization for a limited use of lethal force to defend lives and property.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, however, was determined to impose a forceful resolution of the conflict.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/> Among the party leaders who arrived on the coast and directed the local enforcement actions, initially in Gda\u0144sk, were [[Zenon Kliszko]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Kocio\u0142ek]]. In Gdynia, soldiers were instructed to prevent protesters from returning to factory buildings; they fired into a crowd of workers emerging from commuter trains. Fatal confrontations took place also in Szczecin. Possibly about fifty people were killed in the coastal region in December.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/><ref name=\"Kemp-Welch 180\u2013188\"/>\n\nThe protest movement spread to other cities, leading to more strikes and causing angry workers to occupy many factories. The general strike across Poland was scheduled for 21 December 1970.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/>\n\nThe party leadership meeting in Warsaw on 20 December recognized the danger that the working class revolt presented to their system. In consultations with the disturbed Soviet leaders, they proceeded with arranging the resignation of Gomu\u0142ka, who was by then stressed out and ill.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/> Several of his collaborators were also removed. [[Edward Gierek]] was drafted as the new first secretary. [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]], another strong contender, was not trusted and even blamed for the current debacle by the Soviets.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/>\n\nAnother strike in Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. Gierek gambled that his personal appearances would resolve the crisis. He went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gda\u0144sk the next day, met the workers, apologized for the past mistakes and assured them that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Participants of the Szczecin strike demanded freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek consented, but in reality the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing labor structures and their places of employment. The February [[1971 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a strikes]] followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases announced, and sweeping economic and political changes promised.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 209\u2013211\"/><ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 258\u2013259\"/>\n\nThe Polish opposition movement, traditionally led by the intelligentsia, after the two heavy blows of 1968 and 1970 was in disarray and silent. The revisionists' tenuous connection with the communist party was permanently broken, but a new strategy had not yet emerged.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 49\u201353\"/> However, already in 1971 [[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] published in the \u00e9migr\u00e9 ''[[Kultura]]'' journal a seminal article entitled ''Theses on Hope and Hopelessness''. It put forward a concept of civil democratizing resistance movement that would be valid even in the repressed and seemingly deadlocked [[state socialism|state socialist]] society.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 58\u201364\"/>\n\n==Gierek decade (1970\u201380)==\n\n===Catching up with the West===\n\n[[File:Edward Gierek 1980b.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Gierek]]]]\n\nGierek, like Gomu\u0142ka in 1956, came to power on a raft of promises that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and those responsible for the violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He proceeded to create a new economic program, based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West, to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek years, was intended to be used for equipment and modernization of Polish industry, and for import of [[consumer goods]] to give the workers more incentive to work.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 258\u2013259\"/>\n\nFor the next few years, the regime optimistically engaged in reform and experimentation and for the first time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other luxury items. Attention was paid to the wages workers received. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. Censorship was eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were improved. The relative cultural and political relaxation resulted in a better [[freedom of speech]] environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly ''[[Polityka]]''. The massive investments and purchases of Western technology were expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture.<ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/> The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/>\n\nThis \"New Development Strategy\", based on import-led growth,<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> depended on the global economic conditions and the program faltered suddenly because of worldwide recession and increased oil prices.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=\"Int Soc\"/> The effects of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973\u201374 oil crisis]] produced an inflationary surge followed by a recession in the West, which resulted in a sharp increase in the price of imported consumer goods in Poland, coupled with a decline in demand for Polish exports, particularly [[coal]]. Poland's [[external debt|foreign debt]], absent at the time of Gomu\u0142ka's departure,<ref name=\"Prazmowska Gomulka grozil\"/> rose rapidly under Gierek to reach a multibillion-dollar figure. Continuing borrowing from the West had become increasingly difficult. Consumer goods began to disappear from Polish shops. The new factories built by Gierek's regime proved to be largely ineffective and mismanaged, as the basics of market [[demand]] and [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost effectiveness]] were often ignored.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> The significant internal economic reform, promised by the Gierek team, had not materialized.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 55\u201358\"/>\n\nThe Western credits thus helped spur industrial growth and helped Gierek's policy of [[consumerism]], but just for a few years. The industrial production grew by an average of 10% per year between 1971 and 1975 (the years remembered later by many older Poles as most prosperous, considering not only the communist period in Poland), only to dwindle to less than 2% in 1979. [[Government debt|Debt servicing]] that took 12% of export earnings in 1971, rose to 75% in 1979.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 286\"/>\n\nIn 1975, like other European countries, Poland became a signatory of the [[Helsinki Accords]] and member of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE); such developments were possible because of the period of \"[[d\u00e9tente]]\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. Despite the regime's promises that the freedoms listed in the agreement would be implemented in Poland, there was little change. However, the Poles were becoming more aware of the rights they were being denied and emboldened by the knowledge of their government's treaty obligations.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/>\n\nGierek government's growing difficulties led also to increased dependence on the Soviet Union, including tight economic cooperation and displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomu\u0142ka's rule. The [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|constitution]], amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with the Soviet Union and the leading role of the communist party. The language of the proposed changes was softened after [[Letter of 59|protests by intellectuals]] and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The divisive issues raised helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/><ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 405\u2013407\"/>\n\nNevertheless, the regime of Gierek deemphasized the Marxist ideology and from his time the \"communist\" governments of Poland concentrated on pragmatic issues and current concerns.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 67\u201370\"/> In Polish economic politics new lasting trends were initiated, such as the emphasis on individual initiative, personal aspirations and competition, which some interpreted as an attack on [[egalitarianism]] (social inequalities were indeed increasing). Sections of the [[intelligentsia]], ''[[nomenklatura]]'' and [[small business]] gave rise to the emerging [[middle class]]. The new \"socialist\" ways were less totalitarian, stressed innovation, modern management methods and engaged workers, all seen as necessary to push the outdated economy past the constant crisis stage. Poland of the 1970s became more open to the world and entered the [[World economy|global economy]], which permanently changed society, creating at the same time a new type of crisis vulnerability. The opposition thinking, its promotion of society formed by active individuals, developed along complementary concepts.<ref name=\"Jak narod nie obalil komuny\"/><ref name=\"Gawin Michnik\"/>\n\n===Renewal of social unrest and the rise of organized opposition===\n\n[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Queue area|Queue line]], a frequent scene at times of [[shortage economy|shortages]] of [[Final good|consumer goods]] in the 1970s and 1980s]]\n\nAs a result of the 1970 worker rebellion food prices remained frozen and were artificially low. The demand for food products exceeded the supply also because of the higher real wages, which already in the first two years of Gierek's government increased more than during the entire decade of the 1960s.<ref name=\"Dudek Wzlot i upadek\"/> In June 1976, in an attempt to reduce consumption,<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> the government introduced a long-announced and several times delayed, but radical price increase: basic foodstuffs had their prices raised by an average of 60%, three times the rate of Gomu\u0142ka'a increases from six years before. The compensatory wage rises were skewed toward the better-off part of the population.<ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/>{{Ref label|w|w|none}} The result was an immediate [[June 1976 protests|nationwide wave of strikes]], with violent demonstrations, looting and other labor unrest at the [[Ursus Factory]] near Warsaw, in [[Radom]], [[P\u0142ock]] and other places.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 119\u2013120\"/> The government quickly backed down and repealed the price rises, but the strike leaders were arrested and put on trial.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> A series of \"spontaneous\" large scale public gatherings, intended to convey the \"anger of the people\" at the \"trouble-makers\" was staged by the party leadership in a number of cities, but the Soviet pressure prevented further attempts at raising prices. Gierek's cordial in the past relations with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were now seriously damaged. Food [[Ration stamp|ration cards]], introduced because of the destabilized market in August 1976, were to remain a feature of life in Poland for the duration of the People's Republic.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 290\u2013296\"/> The regime's retreat, having occurred for the second time in several years, amounted to an unprecedented defeat. Within the rigid political system, the government was neither able to reform (it would lose control and power) nor to satisfy society's staple needs, because it had to sell abroad all it could to make foreign debt and interests payments. The government was in a quandary, the population suffered from the lack of necessities, and organized opposition found room to expand and consolidate.<ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/>\n\nBecause of the 1976 disturbances and the subsequent arrests, mistreatment and dismissals of worker militants, a group of intellectuals led by [[Jacek Kuro\u0144]], [[Antoni Macierewicz]], [[Jan J\u00f3zef Lipski]] and [[Adam Michnik]] founded and operated the [[Workers' Defence Committee]] (''Komitet Obrony Robotnik\u00f3w''; KOR).<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 224\u2013226\"/> The aim of the KOR was to assist the worker victims of the 1976 repression.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Int Soc\"/> Working to support the spontaneous workers' movements, the dissidents recognized the necessarily predominant role of the working class in resisting the abuses of the regime. Accordingly, the newly formed opposition was increasingly characterized by an alliance of intelligentsia with workers.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 125\u2013131\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 227\"/> The KOR, according to Modzelewski, constituted the core of organized opposition and a seed of political alternative; clearing the way for other opposition formations, it engendered [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]].<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 234\u2013236\"/> More opposition groups indeed soon followed, including the [[Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights]] (ROPCiO), [[Free Trade Unions of the Coast]] (WZZW) and the [[Confederation of Independent Poland]] (KPN).<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> The periodical ''Robotnik'' ('The Worker') was distributed in factories from September 1977.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 234\u2013236\"/> The idea of independent trade unions was first raised by the Gda\u0144sk and Szczecin workers striking in 1970\u201371. Now it was developed and promoted by the KOR and its leftist collaborators, which led to the establishment in 1978 of Free Trade Unions, the precursor of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]].

Cardinal Karol Wojty\u0142a, the [[archbishop of Krak\u00f3w]], was elected [[pope]] at the Vatican, taking the name [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. The election of a Polish pope had an electrifying effect on what was at that time one of the last idiosyncratically Catholic countries in Europe.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> When John Paul toured Poland in June 1979, half a million people came to welcome him in Warsaw; in the next eight days, about ten million Poles attended the many outdoor [[mass (liturgy)|masses]] he celebrated.<ref name=\"TVN-1\"/> John Paul clearly became the most important person in Poland, leaving the regime not so much opposed as ignored. Rather than calling for rebellion, John Paul encouraged the creation of an \"alternative Poland\" of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next crisis came, the nation would present a united front.<ref name=\"Weigel-Pope\"/><ref name=\"Weigel-Witness\"/>\n\n===Polish emigration===\n\nThe [[Polish government-in-exile]] in [[London]], unrecognized since the end of World War II, ridiculed by the communists, to many Poles was of great symbolic importance.

The staunchly anti-communist American ''[[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]'' and other Poles felt grateful for the leadership of President [[Ronald Reagan]]. Of the Polish institutions in the West the most important were the [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]], whose Polish section was run by [[Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski]], and the monthly literary ''[[Kultura]]'' magazine in [[Paris]], led by [[Jerzy Giedroyc]] and [[Juliusz Mieroszewski]].<ref name=\"GP 481\"/>\n\n==Final decade of the Polish People's Republic (1980\u201389)==\n\n===Failing economy and labor unrest===\n\nBy 1980, the authorities had no choice but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic level, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western [[Financial institution|financial companies and institutions]] providing loans to the regime at a meeting at the [[Bank Handlowy]] in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that the state could no longer subsidize artificially low prices of consumer goods.<ref name=\"gnauck7\"/> The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat.

President [[Jimmy Carter]] and President-elect [[Ronald Reagan]] made urgent phone calls to Brezhnev and the intervention was postponed.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/> In the meantime Solidarity, not quite aware of the looming danger, did its [[revolution]]ary work, practicing democracy in the union movement and pushing for sovereign society in a number of ways.<ref name=\"Solidarnosc tak bylo\"/> The autonomous labor unions, united under the Solidarity banner, strove to \"recapture public life from the monopoly control of the party\". On 16 December 1980, the [[Monument to the Fallen Shipyard Workers of 1970]] was officially unveiled in Gda\u0144sk in a ceremony that marked the high point in the ascent of Solidarity.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 100\u2013111\"/>\n\nAmong the mass protests that occurred at that time were the winter [[1981 general strike in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]], the [[1981 warning strike in Poland|nationwide warning strike]] in the spring of that year and [[Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland|hunger demonstrations]] in summer. The warning strike took place in the aftermath of the [[Bydgoszcz events]] (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention.<ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/> Wa\u0142\u0119sa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, but at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.<ref name=\"Dudek: 13 grudnia\"/>\n\nMinister Jaruzelski became also prime minister in February 1981. In June, the Soviet Central Committee pressured the Polish party for a leadership change, but Jaruzelski received strong support from the military members of the Polish Central Committee. The extraordinary IX Congress of the PZPR took place in July. Kania was reelected the party's first secretary, while the organization's internal reformers suffered a defeat.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nAs the economic situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuro\u0144 and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the ruling party of some of its burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 126\u2013133\"/>\n\nThe existence of Solidarity and the political liberties that the movement brought paralyzed the authoritarian state and the state-controlled economy. Everyday life was becoming increasingly unbearable and the public displayed sentiments of extreme volatility. The hostility of the ''nomenklatura'' toward Solidarity was rapidly increasing.<ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nAt the State Defense Committee meeting on 13 September (the time of the Soviet [[Exercise Zapad-81]] maneuvers and of renewed pressure on the Polish leadership), Kania was warned by the uniformed cadres that the progressing counterrevolution must be terminated by an imposition of [[martial law]]. The PZPR regional secretaries soon issued the same demands. Under the circumstances, in October First Secretary Kania stepped down and Prime Minister Jaruzelski became also the party chief.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nIn September and October, the [[History of Solidarity|First Congress of Solidarity]] deliberated in Gda\u0144sk. Wa\u0142\u0119sa faced activist opposition and was barely elected chairman of the organization. The delegates passed a radical reform program in which the world \"social\" or \"socialized\" was repeated 150 times. The congress issued a provocative call for workers in other East European countries, urging them to follow in Solidarity's footsteps.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Stelmachowski 53\"/><ref name=\"Kapitalizm przegra\"/> Locally authorized, increasingly \"political\" strikes continued. They were characterized as \"[[Wildcat strike action|wildcats]]\" by Wa\u0142\u0119sa, who desperately tried to impose discipline from the center. He attempted to reach an accord with the state, meeting General Jaruzelski and Catholic Primate [[J\u00f3zef Glemp]] on 4 November. At the time of the regime's re-energized efforts to reduce Solidarity's role, the union had nearly ten million members \u2014 almost four times as many as the ruling party.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 137\u2013141\"/> Militant mood was displayed and unrealistic demands made at the meeting of the partially represented National Commission on 3 December, but the proceedings were wiretapped by the authorities, who then broadcast the (previously manipulated to their advantage) recordings.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 141\u2013146\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 320\u2013327\"/>\n\nThe government, not consulting Solidarity, adopted a plan of economic measures that could be implemented only by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 320\u2013327\"/> In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/><ref name=\"Dudek: Nie wierz\u0119\"/>\n\n===Imposition of martial law===\n\n[[File:Wojciech Jaruzelski 1980s.jpg|thumb|right|150px|General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] led the [[Polish People's Republic|People's Republic]] during its final decade and became one of the key players in the systemic transition of 1989\u201390]]\n\nOn 13 December 1981, claiming that the country was on the verge of economic and civil breakdown and [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980\u20131981|alleging a danger of Soviet intervention]],<ref name=\"Mastny\"/> General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] began a crack-down on Solidarity.

The reform's effects were positive but limited (the process vastly increased general economic literacy and some of its accomplishments were later claimed by Solidarity governments as their own), because enterprises' self-rule had to compete with the traditional party interference, the authorities shied from subjecting the population to hardships, and Western governments and institutions showed no interest in supporting what was perceived as reform of a communist regime.<ref name=\"Reforma nie zacz\u0119\u0142a\"/> The government allowed more small-scale private enterprises to function, departing further from the 'socialist' model of economy.

The remaining 65% were to be reserved for candidates from the PZPR and its allies (the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]], the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Alliance of Democrats]] and the [[PAX Association]]). Since the Round Table Agreement mandated only reform (not replacement) of \"[[real socialism]]\" in Poland, the party thought of the election as a way of neutralizing political conflict and staying in power, while gaining some legitimacy to carry out economic reforms.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 205\u2013215\"/><ref name=\"DSM\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 375\u2013380\"/> However, the negotiated social policies, arrived at by economists and trade unionists during the Round Table talks, were quickly tossed out by both the party and the opposition.<ref name=\"Sutowski Okragly Stol\"/>\n\nA systemic transformation happening sooner rather than later was made possible by the [[1989 Polish legislative election|Polish legislative elections]] of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square protests]] in [[China]]. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed.

The PZPR-led coalition suffered a catastrophic blow to its legitimacy.<ref name=\"DSM\"/>\n\n====Political transformation====\n\nThe next few months were spent on political maneuvering. The increasingly insecure communists, who still had military and administrative control over the country, were appeased by a compromise in which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. On 19 July 1989 Jaruzelski barely won the vote in the [[Parliament of Poland#National Assembly|National Assembly]] [[1989 Polish presidential election|presidential election]], even though his name was the only one on the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by a sufficient number of Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong.

On 1 August, prices were freed because of the ongoing market reforms and [[hyperinflation]] resulted. The instantly increased economic hardship caused a new wave of strikes. The strikes were spontaneous, but the Solidarity leaders, no longer in agreement with the strikers' economic demands, were able to emphasize the secondary political aspect of the strikes (anger at the party's obstinacy) and use them to pressure the regime for an expedited transfer of power.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 43\u201349\"/> The new prime minister, General Kiszczak, who was appointed on 2 August 1989, failed to gain enough support in the ''Sejm'' to form a government and resigned on 19 August.

These years, while featuring general [[Industrialisation|industrialization]], [[urbanization]] and many improvements in the [[standard of living]],{{Ref label|a1|a1|none}} were marred by [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] repressions, social unrest, political strife and severe economic difficulties.\n\nNear the end of World War II, the advancing Soviet [[Red Army]], along with the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East#Berling's Army: 1943\u20131945|Polish Armed Forces in the East]], pushed out the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] forces from [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]]. In February 1945, the [[Yalta Conference]] sanctioned the formation of a provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. [[Joseph Stalin]], the leader of the [[Soviet Union]], manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] was formed in [[Warsaw]] by ignoring the [[Polish government-in-exile]] based in [[London]] since 1940.\n\nDuring the subsequent [[Potsdam Conference]] in July\u2013August 1945, the three major [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] ratified the colossal westerly shift of the Polish frontier and approved its new territory between the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] and [[Curzon Line]], which resulted in Poland returning to its original borders that existed upon the [[Baptism of Poland|foundation]] of the first Polish state in 966 AD. Following the destruction of the [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] population in [[The Holocaust in Poland|the Holocaust]], the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|flight and expulsion of Germans]] in the west, [[Operation Vistula|resettlement of Ukrainians]] in the east, and the [[Polish population transfers (1944\u20131946)|repatriation of Poles]] from the [[Kresy|Eastern Borderlands]] (''Kresy''), Poland became for the first time in its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government [[1947 Polish legislative election|solidified its political power]] over the next two years, while the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) under [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] gained firm control over the country, which would be within the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet sphere of influence]], but remain independent. The [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]] was promulgated in July 1952 and the state officially became the [[Polish People's Republic]] (PRL).\n\nFollowing Stalin's death in 1953, a political \"[[Khrushchev Thaw|thaw]]\" allowed a more liberal faction of the [[Communism in Poland|Polish communists]], led by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], to [[Polish October|gain power]]. By the mid-1960s, Poland began experiencing increasing economic as well as political difficulties. They culminated in the [[1968 Polish political crisis]] and the [[1970 Polish protests]], when a consumer price hike led to a wave of strikes. The government introduced a new economic program based on large-scale loans from western creditors, which resulted in a rise in living standards and expectations, but the program meant growing integration of Poland's economy with the [[world economy]] and it faltered after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In 1976, the government of [[Edward Gierek]] was forced to raise prices again and this led to the [[June 1976 protests]].\n\nThis cycle of repression and reform{{Ref label|b|b|none}} and the economic-political struggle acquired new characteristics with the 1978 election of Karol Wojty\u0142a as [[Pope John Paul II]]. Wojty\u0142a's unexpected elevation strengthened the opposition to the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and ineffective system of ''[[nomenklatura]]''-run [[state socialism]], especially with the pope's first visit to Poland in 1979. In early August 1980, a new wave of strikes resulted in the founding of the independent [[trade union]] \"[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]\" (''Solidarno\u015b\u0107'') led by [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]. The growing strength and activity of the opposition caused the government of [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] to declare [[martial law in Poland|martial law]] in December 1981. However, with the reforms of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in the Soviet Union, increasing pressure from the West, and dysfunctional economy, the regime was forced to negotiate with its opponents. The 1989 [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Talks]] led to Solidarity's participation in the [[1989 Polish legislative election|1989 election]]. Its candidates' striking victory gave rise to the first of the [[Revolutions of 1989|succession of transitions]] from communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1990, Jaruzelski resigned from the presidency following the [[1990 Polish presidential election|presidential election]] and he was succeeded by Wa\u0142\u0119sa.\n\n==Establishment of communist-ruled Poland (1944\u201348)==\n\n===Wartime devastation, border and population shifts, rebuilding of infrastructure and economy===\n\n[[File:Map of Poland (1945).png|left|thumb|Poland's [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|old and new borders in 1945]]]]\n\nBefore [[World War II]], a third of Poland's population was composed of [[Ethnic minorities in Poland|ethnic minorities]].

In reality it was not finished until mid-August, after the Polish communist [[Union of Polish Patriots|Moscow group]] was joined by the late-arriving [[Polish Workers' Party|Warsaw group]], led by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka|Gomu\u0142ka]] and [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut|Bierut]].<ref name=\"GP 414\"/>]]\n\nAfter the prewar [[Communist Party of Poland]] was eliminated in [[Great Purge|Stalin's purges]] in 1938 (some five thousand Polish communists were brought to [[Russia]] and killed), a group of survivors led by [[Marceli Nowotko]], [[Boles\u0142aw Mo\u0142ojec]] and [[Pawe\u0142 Finder]] convinced in 1941 the Soviets in Moscow of the need to reestablish a Polish party. The conspiratorial core of the new Polish Workers' Party was assembled in Warsaw in January 1942, and after the deaths or arrests of the above leaders there, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] emerged as the PPR's first secretary by the end of 1943. Gomu\u0142ka was a dedicated communist in the national tradition of the Polish [[left-wing politics|leftist]] movement. He loathed the Soviet practices he experienced while being trained in Russia and [[Ukraine]] in the 1930s, but was convinced of the historic necessity of alliance with the Soviet Union. He may have survived the purges because of being imprisoned in Poland for illegal labor-organizing activities in 1938\u201339. Throughout the [[German-occupied Europe|German occupation]], Gomu\u0142ka remained in Poland and was not a part of the circle organized in the Soviet Union around the [[Union of Polish Patriots]] by Stalin and [[Wanda Wasilewska]]. In Polish society of 1945, Gomu\u0142ka's party was marginally small in comparison to other political groups.<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/>\n\nWith the liberation of Polish territories and the failure of the [[Home Army]]'s [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944, control over what was to become post-war Poland passed from the occupying forces of Nazi Germany to the Red Army, and from the Red Army to [[Communism in Poland|Polish communists]], who formed the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (''Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego'', PKWN), an early government, in existence from late July 1944 in [[Lublin]]. The Polish communists became the most influential Polish factor in the politics of emerging Poland,<ref name=\"GP 413\"/> despite having initially minuscule popular support.<ref name=\"Gibianskii\"/> The PKWN recognized the legal continuity of the [[March Constitution (Poland)|March Constitution of Poland]], as opposed to the [[April Constitution of Poland|April Constitution]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Szel\u0105g 11\u201312\"/> On 6 September 1944, the PKWN issued its momentous [[land reform]] decree, the consequences of which would fundamentally alter the antiquated social and economic structure of the country. Over one million peasant families benefited from parcellation of the [[folwark|larger estates]].<ref name=\"GP 417, 424\"/>\n\nThe communists, favored by the Yalta decisions, enjoyed the advantages of Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe firmly under the influence of the Soviet Union; they exercised control over crucial government departments, such as the security services (security was in the hands of the Soviet [[NKVD]] until its Polish counterparts were developed).<ref name=\"GP 414\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the [[populism|populist]] program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's [[Government Delegation for Poland|delegation]] was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its [[Polish Underground State|political-military organizations]] became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the [[PKWN Manifesto]] and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support.<ref name=\"Od rz\u0105du do nierz\u0105du\"/> Beyond the land reform, the PKWN Manifesto foresaw no further radical ownership changes and [[nationalization]] of industry was not mentioned. On the contrary, business property was supposed to return to its owners as the economic relations become properly regulated.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 97\"/> From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established [[workers' council]]s, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its own rules.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/>\n\nThe PKWN was reshaped into the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland]] (''Rz\u0105d Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'', RTRP), which functioned from January 1945.<ref name=\"GP 413\"/> This government was headed by [[Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski]], a [[Polish Socialist Party|socialist]], but the communists, mostly non-PPR Soviet employees such as [[Micha\u0142 Rola-\u017bymierski]], held a majority of key posts.<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/> In April 1945, a Polish-Soviet treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed; it severely limited the possibilities of future Western or [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]] impact or internal cooperation with non-communist political forces in Poland.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"GP 416\"/> The consecutive early Soviet-influenced governments were subordinate to the unelected, communist-controlled parliament, the [[State National Council]] (''Krajowa Rada Narodowa'', KRN), formed by Gomu\u0142ka and his PPR in occupied Warsaw in January 1944. The communist governmental structures were not recognized by the increasingly isolated Polish government-in-exile, which had formed its own quasi-parliament, the [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'', RJN).\n\n[[File:zapluty karzel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Postwar Polish communist propaganda poster depicting \"The giant and the putrid reactionary midget\", meaning the communist [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]] soldier and the pro-Western [[Home Army]] soldier, respectively]]\n\nThe Yalta agreement stipulated a governmental union in Poland of \"all democratic and anti-Nazi elements\". Prime Minister [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] of the Polish government-in-exile resigned his post in November 1944 and having accepted the Yalta terms went to Moscow, where he negotiated with [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] the shape of a \"national unity\" government\". Miko\u0142ajczyk, along with several other exiled Polish leaders, returned to Poland in July 1945.<ref name=\"GP 417\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 569\u2013577\"/>\n\nThe new Polish [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] (''Tymczasowy Rz\u0105d Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'', TRJN) \u2014 as the Polish government was called until the [[1947 Polish legislative election|elections of 1947]] \u2014 was established on 28 June 1945.<ref name=\"GP 413\"/> Os\u00f3bka-Morawski was kept as prime minister, Gomu\u0142ka became first deputy prime minister and Miko\u0142ajczyk second deputy and minister of agriculture. The government was \"provisional\" and the [[Potsdam Conference]] soon declared that before a regular government is created, free elections must be held and a permanent constitutional system established.<ref name=\"GP 417\"/>\n\nThe communists' principal rivals were [[Freedom and Independence|veteran activists]] of the [[Polish Underground State]], Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|Polish People's Party]] (''Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe'', PSL), and veterans of the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]]. Of particular practical importance was Miko\u0142ajczyk's People's Party (originally a peasant formation), because it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with a market economy by winning the promised elections.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> Miko\u0142ajczyk hoped that an independent Polish state, friendly with the Soviet Union, would be allowed to act as a bridge between the East and the West.<ref name=\"Kochanski 569\u2013577\"/>\n\nSoviet-oriented parties, backed by the Soviet Red Army and in control of the security forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Gomu\u0142ka and Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated at the time of the PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918\u20131945 619\"/>\n\nAs a show of Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the [[Polish Underground State|Polish anti-Nazi underground]] were brought to [[Trial of the Sixteen|trial in Moscow]] in June 1945.<ref name=\"Kemp-Welch 8\"/> Their removal from the political scene precluded the possibility of a democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements.<ref name=\"GP 415\"/> The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief.<ref name=\"GP 417\"/> The exiled government in London, after Miko\u0142ajczyk's resignation led by [[Tomasz Arciszewski]], ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.<ref name=\"GP 431\"/>\n\nIn the years 1945\u201347, about 500,000 Soviet soldiers were stationed in Poland.

However, the Polish communists, led by Gomu\u0142ka and Bierut, while having no intention of giving up power, were also aware of the limited support they enjoyed among the general population. To circumvent this difficulty, in 1946 a national plebiscite, known as the [[1946 Polish people's referendum|\"Three Times Yes\" referendum]] (''Trzy razy tak''), was held first, before the parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Poland-7306\">[http://countrystudies.us/poland/16.htm  Consolidation of Communist Power.] ''Countrystudies.us/Poland.'' Retrieved 27 November 2011.</ref> The referendum comprised three fairly general, but politically charged questions about the Senate, national industries and western borders. It was meant to check and promote the popularity of communist initiatives in Poland. Since most of the important parties at the time were leftist or centrist \u2013 and could have easily approved all three options \u2013 Miko\u0142ajczyk's Polish People's Party (PSL) decided, not to be seen as merging into the government bloc, to ask its supporters to oppose the first one: the abolition of the Senate.<ref name=\"GP 424\"/> The communists voted \"Three Times Yes\". The partial results, reconstructed by the PSL, showed that the communist side was met with little support on the first question. However, after a campaign marked by electoral fraud and intimidation the communists claimed large majorities on all three questions,<ref name=\"Encyklopedia_WIEM\"/><ref name=\"GP 424\"/> which led to the [[nationalization]] of industry and state control of economic activity in general, and a unicameral national parliament (''[[Sejm]]'').<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Buchanan\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe communists consolidated power by gradually whittling away the rights of their non-communist foes, particularly by suppressing the leading opposition party \u2013 Miko\u0142ajczyk's PSL.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> In some widely publicized cases, the perceived enemies were sentenced to death on trumped up charges \u2014 among them [[Witold Pilecki]], the organizer of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] resistance. Leaders of the Home Army and of the Council of National Unity were persecuted. Many resistance fighters were murdered extrajudicially or forced to exile.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 272\u2013274\"/> The opposition members were also harassed by administrative means. Although the ongoing persecution of the former anti-Nazi and [[National Armed Forces|right-wing organizations]] by state security kept [[cursed soldiers|some partisans]] in the forests, the actions of the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Ministry of Public Security]] (known as the UB, Department of Security), NKVD and the Red Army steadily diminished their numbers. The [[National Military Union|right-wing insurgency]] radically decreased after the amnesty of July 1945<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 70\"/> and faded after the [[Amnesty of 1947|amnesty of February 1947]].<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski Zdobycie w\u0142adzy\"/><ref name=\"Daszczy\u0144ski Po wojnie\"/>\n\nBy 1946, all rightist parties had been outlawed,<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> and a new pro-government [[Front of National Unity|Democratic Bloc]] was formed in 1947 which included only the Polish Workers' Party and its leftist allies. On 19 January 1947, the [[1947 Polish legislative election|first parliamentary elections]] took place featuring primarily the PPR and allied candidates and a potentially politically potent opposition from the Polish People's Party. However, the PSL's strength and role had already been seriously compromised due to government control and persecution.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Election results were adjusted by Stalin to suit the communists, whose bloc claimed 80% of the votes. The British and American governments protested the poll for its blatant violations of the Yalta and Potsdam accords.<ref name=\"GP 426\"/> The rigged elections effectively ended the multiparty system in Poland's politics.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Buchanan\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> After the referendum dress rehearsal, this time the vote fraud was much better concealed and spread into various forms and stages and its actual scale is not known. With all the pressure and manipulations, an NKVD colonel charged with election supervision reported to Stalin that about 50% of the vote was cast for the regime's Democratic Bloc nationwide. In the new ''Sejm'', out of 444 seats, 27 were given to the [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|Polish People's Party]] of [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]].<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 91\u201395, 102\"/> He, having declared the results to be falsified, was threatened with arrest or worse and fled the country in October 1947, helped by the [[United States|US]] Embassy; other opposition leaders also left.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 91\u201395, 102\"/> In February, the new ''Sejm'' created the [[Small Constitution of 1947]].

The [[socialism|socialists]]' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 34\u201338\"/> Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss the idea of a party merger. The [[Government of the Soviet Union|Kremlin]], increasingly uncomfortable with Gomu\u0142ka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972).<ref name=\"GP 426-427\"/> In December 1948, after the removal of Gomu\u0142ka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief,<ref name=\"GP 428-430\"/> the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (''Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza'', PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]] and a [[satellite state]] of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/> Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] (ZSL) that had split from Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u20131949)|PSL]] and was meant to represent rural communities, and the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Alliance of Democrats]] (SD), a token [[intelligentsia]] party (see also: [[List of political parties in Poland]]).<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/>\n\nAs the period of [[Sovietization]] and [[Stalinism]] began, the PZPR was anything but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with the PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomu\u0142ka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction.<ref name=\"GP 428-430\"/> The PZPR became divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], the official ideology, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, including those of the [[Sanation]], the [[National Democracy]], and 19th century traditions of cooperation with the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning powers]].<ref name=\"GP 401-410\"/>\n\nWith Poland being a member of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]], the party's pursuits of power and reform were permanently hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the lack of public support and Soviet reaction).<ref name=\"GP 411-413\"/> Poland's political history was governed by the mutual dependence of the Soviets and the Polish communists.<ref name=\"GP 431\"/>\n\nThe ''[[nomenklatura]]'' political elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within the ruling party structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds. ''Nomenklatura'' members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management, or education. For the party, the privileged ''nomenklatura'' layer was maintained to assure the proper placement of people who were ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] dissidents [[Jacek Kuro\u0144]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political [[bureaucracy]] for its own sake.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/> The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted ''nomenklatura'' and the security services were resented.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 66\u201367\"/>\n\n==Stalinist era (1948\u201356)==\n\n{{Redirect|Stalinism in Poland|Stalinism in general|Stalinism|the state-sanctioned art of the period|Socialist realism in Poland}}\n\n[[File:Proces Pileckiego 1948-2.jpg|thumb|The [[show trial]] of Captain [[Witold Pilecki]], sentenced to death and executed May 1948]]\n\n===Removal of Gomu\u0142ka, Stalinist repressions===\n\nAs in other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, there was a Soviet-style political purge of communist officials in Poland after 1948, accused of \"nationalist\" or other \"[[Deviationism|deviationist]]\" tendencies.<ref name=\"KJL\"/> The half-hearted in Poland campaign included the arrests and imprisonments of [[Marian Spychalski]] from May 1950, and [[Micha\u0142 Rola-\u017bymierski]] five months after Stalin's death.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 170\u2013171\"/> In September 1948 W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, who opposed Stalin's direct control of the Polish PPR party, was charged, together with a group of communist leaders who like Gomu\u0142ka spent the war in Poland, with ideological departure from [[Leninism]], and dismissed from the post of the party's first secretary.<ref name=\"KJL\"/><ref name=\"Stola Anti-Zionist Campaign\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, accused of \"right-wing nationalist deviations\", had indeed emphasized the [[Polish Socialist Party|Polish socialist]] traditions and severely criticized [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] (SDKPiL) party for belittling Polish national aspirations.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 38\u201349\"/> More insidiously, the Soviets claimed Gomu\u0142ka's participation in an anti-Soviet international conspiracy.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 115\u2013116\"/> Following Boles\u0142aw Bierut's order, he was arrested by the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Ministry of Public Security]] (MBP) in early August 1951 and interrogated by [[Roman Romkowski]] and [[Anatol Fejgin]], as demanded by the Soviets.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 79\u201381\"/> Gomu\u0142ka was not subjected to physical torture unlike other communists persecuted under the regime of Bierut, [[Jakub Berman]], and other Stalin's associates.<ref name=\"LIFE\"/><ref name=\"Hodos-151\">George H.

The ORMO originated from popular self-defense efforts, which were a spontaneous reaction to the explosion of crime in the power vacuum of 1944\u201345.

The program of free and compulsory school education for all and the establishment of free institutions of higher learning received much support. The communists screened out what facts and interpretations were to be taught; history and other sciences had to follow Marxist views approved by [[Censorship in the Polish People's Republic|ideological censorship]].<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> During 1951\u201353, a large number of prewar professors who were perceived by the regime as reactionary was dismissed from universities. Government control over art and artists deepened. The Soviet-style [[socialist realism]] became the only formula accepted by the authorities after 1949. Most works of art and literature represented [[Propaganda in the Polish People's Republic|propaganda of the party]] or had to be in line with its views. (See also: [[Socialist realism in Poland]])\n\nThe reforms often brought relief for a significant part of the population. After World War II many people were willing to accept communist rule in exchange for the restoration of relatively normal life; hundreds of thousands joined the communist party and actively supported the regime. Nonetheless, latent popular discontent remained present and many Poles adopted the attitude of \"resigned cooperation\". Others, like the [[Freedom and Independence]] organization that originated from elements of the Home Army and especially the [[National Armed Forces]] actively opposed the communists, hoping for a [[World War III]] that would liberate Poland. Most [[cursed soldiers|people who took up arms against the communist regime]] had surrendered during the amnesties of 1945 and [[amnesty of 1947|1947]], but brutal repressions by the secret police continued and some fought well into the 1950s.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/><ref name=\"Piotrowski-88-90\"/>{{Ref label|d|d|none}}\n\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]], Primate of Poland]]\n\nThe communists further alienated many Poles by persecuting the [[Catholic Church in Poland|Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The [[PAX Association]] created in 1947 and led by the former prewar [[National Radical Camp|far-right]] activist [[Boles\u0142aw Piasecki]], attempted to divide the Catholic movement and promote a communist rule-friendly, [[collaborationism|collaborationist]] church.<ref name=\"GP 435\"/> The PAX did not get very far in molding the Catholic public opinion, but published numerous books and officially approved daily Catholic press.

In the party and among the intellectuals, demands for wider reforms of the Stalinist system were becoming more widespread and intense.<ref name=\"Taras-161\" />\n\nRealizing the need for new leadership, in what became known as the [[Polish October]], the [[Politburo]] chose Gomu\u0142ka, who had been released from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"history.net\" /> Subsequently, Gomu\u0142ka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Gomu\u0142ka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was reinforced by pressure from communist [[China]], which demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 246\u2013250\"/> On 21 October in Warsaw Gomu\u0142ka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland.<ref name=\"GP 439-440\"/> Gomu\u0142ka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous [[social democracy|social democratic]]-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing [[revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]] and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 38\u201349\"/> The revisionists aspired to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Pozna\u0144. Their main goals were political freedom and self-management in state enterprises.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 125\u2013131\"/> However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was nowhere in sight. On 14 May 1955, the [[Warsaw Pact]] was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of [[NATO]].<ref name=\"GP 434\"/>\n\nMany Soviet officers serving in the [[Polish People's Army|Polish Armed Forces]] were dismissed,<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=\"BZH\"/> but very few Stalinist officials were put on trial for the repressions of the Bierut period. The ''Pu\u0142awy'' faction argued that mass trials of Stalinist officials, many of them Jewish, would incite animosity toward the Jews. [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] and other Soviet advisers were sent home, and the Polish communist establishment and system took on a more independent orientation.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, conscious of geopolitical realities, agreed that [[Northern Group of Forces|Soviet troops would remain in Poland]] and no overt anti-Soviet outbursts would be allowed. However, he formalized the Polish-Soviet relations and the unprecedented for a Soviet-allied state military cooperation treaty, signed in December 1956, stated that the stationing of the Soviet forces in Poland \"can in no way violate the sovereignty of the Polish state and cannot lead to their interference in internal matters of the Polish People's Republic\".<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 214\u2013215\"/> Poland thus avoided the risk of Soviet armed intervention of the kind that crushed the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. On his part, Gomu\u0142ka rewarded the Soviets for his internal leeway with loyal support for the duration of his career. In one act of defiance, the Polish delegation at the [[United Nations]] abstained in November 1956 from the vote condemning the Soviet intervention in Hungary.<ref name=\"GP 441\"/>\n\nThere were repeated attempts by some [[History of philosophy in Poland|Polish academics and philosophers]], many related to the prewar [[Lw\u00f3w\u2013Warsaw school]] \u2013 such as [[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Ossowski]] and [[Adam Schaff]] \u2013 to create a bridge between Poland's history and [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology and develop a specific form of [[Communism in Poland|Polish Marxism]]. Such efforts were stifled due to the regime's unwillingness to risk the wrath of the Soviet Union for deviating too far from the Soviet [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. Ko\u0142akowski, a leading revisionist, was verbally attacked by Gomu\u0142ka in 1957, expelled from the party in 1966 and had to emigrate in 1968.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 218\u2013219\"/><ref name=\"PlMarx\"/><ref name=\"GP 410-411\"/> Among other noted revisionists were [[W\u0142odzimierz Brus]], [[Bronis\u0142aw Baczko]], [[Zygmunt Bauman]], and [[Krzysztof Pomian]].

The council included the prominent economists [[Oskar R. Lange]], [[Czes\u0142aw Bobrowski]], [[Micha\u0142 Kalecki]], and [[Edward Lipi\u0144ski]]. They proposed a [[Market economy|market]] reform, beginning with the granting of greater self-rule and more independent decision-making capability to enterprises, to facilitate their \"realization of plan goals\". But the recommended economic improvements, despite the self-restraint of the authors, were not compatible with the obligatory at that time heavy-handed centralized economic command system, and the reform effort fizzled out.<ref name=\"Reforma nie zacz\u0119\u0142a\"/>\n\nIn October 1957, Poland's Foreign Minister [[Adam Rapacki]] proposed a European [[Rapacki Plan|nuclear-free zone]] that would include the territories of Poland, [[West Germany]], [[East Germany]] and [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"GP 441\"/> In August 1961, the new [[Berlin Wall]] cemented the division of Europe.\n\nDuring 1948\u201371, the Polish government signed [[Indemnity|indemnification]] agreements with a number of [[Western Europe|West European]] countries (excluding those considered allies of [[Nazi Germany]]), [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The agreements dealt with compensation for the losses incurred by citizens and firms of the countries involved as a result of war events and the subsequent [[nationalization]]. The agreement with the U.S. followed the visit to Poland of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in August 1959 and his talks with Gomu\u0142ka. It was signed in 1960 and the agreed amount had been paid by the Polish government in twenty installments. The U.S. government thereby assumed responsibility for indemnities resulting from claims filed by U.S. citizens.<ref name=\"Polsko nie daj sie\"/>\n\nAfter the first wave of reform, Gomu\u0142ka's regime started to move back on their promises. Control over mass media and universities was gradually tightened, and many of the younger and more reformist members of the party were forced out (over 200,000 purged already in 1958, when the PZPR undertook a \"verification\" of its membership).<ref name=\"Werblan Szkice 149\u2013150\"/> The reform-promising Gomu\u0142ka of 1956 turned into the authoritarian Gomu\u0142ka of the 1960s. Although Poland enjoyed a period of relative stability in that decade, the idealism of the \"Polish October\" faded away.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The decisions made at the XIII Plenum of the Central Committee, held in 1963, meant a definite end of the post-October liberalization period. The demise of Gomu\u0142ka's tactical allies, the ''Pu\u0142awy'' faction, gradually replaced by Gomu\u0142ka's own people, was apparent when [[Roman Zambrowski]], the leading Jewish politician, was removed from the Politburo.<ref name=\"Stola 13\u201327\"/>\n\nPoland under Gomu\u0142ka's rule was generally considered one of the more liberal [[communist state]]s. However, Poles could still go to prison for writing [[political satire]] about the party leader, as [[Janusz Szpota\u0144ski]] did,<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 337\"/> or for publishing a book abroad. A March 1964 \"Letter of the 34\", signed by leading intellectuals and delivered to the office of Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, criticized the worsening censorship and demanded a more open cultural policy, as guaranteed by the constitution.<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski Najs\u0142ynniejszy list Peerelu\"/> [[Jacek Kuro\u0144]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] were expelled from the party and from 1965 imprisoned for written criticism (an \"Open Letter to the Party\") of the party rule and pointing out the contradictory nature of the supposedly workers' state.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 305\u2013306\"/> Kuro\u0144 and Modzelewski accused the regime of betraying the revolutionary cause; like many younger Polish reformers, they spoke from [[New Left|leftist positions]] and were ideologically closely aligned with Western radicals of the 1960s.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 1\u20136\"/>\n\nAs the regime was getting less liberal and more repressive, Gomu\u0142ka's popularity declined as his initial vision lost its impetus.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> Many Poles found Gomu\u0142ka's self-righteous attitude irritating and his demeanor provincial. He reacted to increasing criticism by refusing to budge and insulating himself with the help of cronies, of whom [[Zenon Kliszko]] was the most influential. Within the party, Minister of the Interior [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]] and his nationalist-communist faction known as \"the Partisans\" (together with ''Moczarowcy'', the much broader system of Moczar's political clientele) were looking for an opportunity to assert their dominance.<ref name=\"Stola Anti-Zionist Campaign\"/><ref name=\"Stola 13\u201327\"/><ref name=\"GP 441-442\"/>\n\n[[File:Polski Fiat 125p.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[Polski Fiat 125p]], produced in Poland from the late 1960s, was based on technology purchased from [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]]]]\n\nBy the mid-1960s, Poland was starting to experience economic difficulties and the appreciable thus far standard of living improvements were showing signs of stagnation (during 1960\u201370 real wages for workers grew only by an average of 1.8% per year). The postwar [[Business cycle|economic boom]] was ending and the increasingly [[globalization|globalized]] and integrated [[world economy]] was becoming inhospitable to national developments operating behind trade barriers.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 13\u201318\"/><ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 12\u201313\"/> Like the other communist states, Poland was spending too much on heavy industry, armaments and prestige projects and too little on consumer production. The failure of Soviet-style collectivization returned the collectivized land to the peasants,<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> but most of their farms were too small to be prosperous and  productivity in agriculture remained low. Economic relations with West Germany were frozen due to East German interference and resistance to economic integration. Gomu\u0142ka attributed the signs of economic decline to faulty implementation of the fundamentally correct directions issued by central organs of the party. He failed to appreciate the corrective role of the [[Market (economics)|market]], whose [[feedback]] could not be replaced by theoretical computations, planning and administrative decisions.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 236\u2013238\"/> On the other hand, pursuing conservative investment rather than consumption oriented economic policies, his government generated no foreign debt.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 224\"/>\n\nFrom 1960, the regime increasingly implemented anti-Catholic policies, including harassment, atheistic propaganda, and measures that made carrying out religious practices more difficult.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 227\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, according to Andrzej Leder, was the last Polish politician who seriously tried to realize an [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] program, a staple leftist undertaking.<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 185\u2013187\"/> In 1965, the [[Episcopal Conference of Poland|Conference of Polish Bishops]] issued the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]].<ref name=\"Stelmachowski 33\"/> In 1966, the celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of the [[Christianization of Poland]] led by the [[Primate (bishop)|primate]], Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] and other bishops who toured the country, turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the [[Catholic Church in Poland]].<ref name=\"GP I 15-17\"/> In fierce competition, the state authorities conducted their own national celebrations, stressing the origin of Polish statehood,<ref name=\"GP I 15-17\"/> but the display of the Church hierarchy's command of enormous crowds in a land ruled by the communists must have impressed the Catholic [[prelate]]s in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and elsewhere.

Poland's security chief Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar, a wartime communist partisan commander, based his appeal on nationalistic rhetoric combined with anti-intelligentsia and anti-Jewish sentiments and became the chief challenger.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> The party leader in [[Upper Silesia]], [[Edward Gierek]], who had become involved with the communist movement as a teenage mining industry laborer in France,<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 260\u2013262\"/> also emerged as a possible alternative leader. Gierek was favored by the more pragmatic and technocratic members of the ''[[nomenklatura]]''.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 268\u2013272\"/> From January 1968, Polish revisionist opposition and other circles were strongly influenced by the developing movement of the [[Prague Spring]].<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 232\"/>\n\nIn March 1968, student demonstrations at the [[University of Warsaw]] broke out in the wake of the government's ban on further performance of the play ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' by [[Adam Mickiewicz]] (written in 1824) at the [[National Theatre, Warsaw|National Theatre in Warsaw]],<ref name=\"Leszczy\u0144ski March 68\"/> because of its alleged \"anti-Soviet references\".

Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 49\u201353\"/> The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomu\u0142ka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which gave Gomu\u0142ka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power early in his term.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 282\"/>\n\nThe revisionist dissident prominence in the 1968 events overshadowed the equally significant awakening taking place among the working class of Poland. [[Gda\u0144sk]], where thousands of students and workers fought the police on March 15, had the highest in the country rate of administrative detentions and court cases.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 342\"/> The greatest proportion of people arrested and imprisoned in March and April 1968 in Poland were classified by the authorities as \"workers\".<ref name=Friszke/>\n\nAn internal attempt was made to discredit Gomu\u0142ka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and tolerated. In the meantime, irreversible damage to society had been wrecked by the Moczar movement. Gomu\u0142ka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], was preoccupied with the [[Prague Spring|crisis in Czechoslovakia]] and not inclined to support personnel changes in the Polish leadership.<ref name=\"GP 442-443\"/>\n\nIn August 1968, the [[Polish People's Army]] took part in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Some Polish intellectuals protested, and [[Ryszard Siwiec]] burned himself alive during celebrations of an official holiday.

Brezhnev, who attended the gathering, used the occasion to expound his [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], a self-granted Soviet right to forcefully intervene if an allied state strays too far from the \"fraternal course\".<ref name=\"GP 442-443\"/>\n\n===Treaty with West Germany, food riots and the ousting of Gomu\u0142ka===\n\n[[File:Polish 1970 protests - Zbyszek Godlewski body.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstrators in [[Gdynia]] carry the body of [[Janek Wi\u015bniewski|Zbigniew Godlewski]], who was shot and killed during the [[1970 Polish protests|protests of 1970]]]]\n\nIn December 1970, Gomu\u0142ka's government scored a major political success when Poland obtained recognition by [[West Germany]] of [[Oder\u2013Neisse line|post-World War II borders]].<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> In the negotiations leading to the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]], the German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for residents of Poland of German identity and the ability to help financially those who stayed in Poland by granting pensions. Hundreds of thousands eventually became affected.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 238\u2013240\"/> [[Chancellor of Germany (1949\u2013present)|German Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]], who signed the agreement, used the occasion to ask on his knees for forgiveness for the crimes of the Nazis (''[[Kniefall von Warschau]]''). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was made at the site of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church leaders issued the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]], criticized then by the Polish government.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/>\n\nGomu\u0142ka felt proud and secure after the treaty with West Germany, his milestone political achievement. It signified a lasting trend in Poland's international policy: extricating the country from the disproportional dependence on Russia and compensating the security vulnerability by building good relations with Germany.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 238\u2013240\"/><ref name=\"GP 444-445\"/>\n\nBut the event could not mask the economic crisis into which Poland was drifting. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 the regime unexpectedly announced substantial increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/> The new measures were incomprehensible to many workers, and their unfortunate timing (before Christmas, the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomu\u0142ka's fall from power.\n\nOn 14\u201319 December 1970, [[1970 Polish protests|mass demonstrations]] against the price rises broke out in the northern ([[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast) cities of [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Gdynia]], [[Elbl\u0105g]] and [[Szczecin]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> In violent confrontations at those and other locations 19 public buildings were destroyed or damaged, including headquarters of the party in Gda\u0144sk and Szczecin.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 238\u2013240\"/> The PZPR Central Committee was deliberating in Warsaw, but a smaller conference, led by Gomu\u0142ka, issued an authorization for a limited use of lethal force to defend lives and property.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/> Gomu\u0142ka, however, was determined to impose a forceful resolution of the conflict.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/> Among the party leaders who arrived on the coast and directed the local enforcement actions, initially in Gda\u0144sk, were [[Zenon Kliszko]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Kocio\u0142ek]]. In Gdynia, soldiers were instructed to prevent protesters from returning to factory buildings; they fired into a crowd of workers emerging from commuter trains. Fatal confrontations took place also in Szczecin. Possibly about fifty people were killed in the coastal region in December.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/><ref name=\"Kemp-Welch 180\u2013188\"/>\n\nThe protest movement spread to other cities, leading to more strikes and causing angry workers to occupy many factories. The general strike across Poland was scheduled for 21 December 1970.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/>\n\nThe party leadership meeting in Warsaw on 20 December recognized the danger that the working class revolt presented to their system. In consultations with the disturbed Soviet leaders, they proceeded with arranging the resignation of Gomu\u0142ka, who was by then stressed out and ill.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 206\u2013207\"/> Several of his collaborators were also removed. [[Edward Gierek]] was drafted as the new first secretary. [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]], another strong contender, was not trusted and even blamed for the current debacle by the Soviets.<ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 365\u2013375\"/>\n\nAnother strike in Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. Gierek gambled that his personal appearances would resolve the crisis. He went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gda\u0144sk the next day, met the workers, apologized for the past mistakes and assured them that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Participants of the Szczecin strike demanded freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek consented, but in reality the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing labor structures and their places of employment. The February [[1971 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a strikes]] followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases announced, and sweeping economic and political changes promised.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 209\u2013211\"/><ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 258\u2013259\"/>\n\nThe Polish opposition movement, traditionally led by the intelligentsia, after the two heavy blows of 1968 and 1970 was in disarray and silent. The revisionists' tenuous connection with the communist party was permanently broken, but a new strategy had not yet emerged.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 49\u201353\"/> However, already in 1971 [[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] published in the \u00e9migr\u00e9 ''[[Kultura]]'' journal a seminal article entitled ''Theses on Hope and Hopelessness''. It put forward a concept of civil democratizing resistance movement that would be valid even in the repressed and seemingly deadlocked [[state socialism|state socialist]] society.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 58\u201364\"/>\n\n==Gierek decade (1970\u201380)==\n\n===Catching up with the West===\n\n[[File:Edward Gierek 1980b.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Gierek]]]]\n\nGierek, like Gomu\u0142ka in 1956, came to power on a raft of promises that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and those responsible for the violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He proceeded to create a new economic program, based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West, to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek years, was intended to be used for equipment and modernization of Polish industry, and for import of [[consumer goods]] to give the workers more incentive to work.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 258\u2013259\"/>\n\nFor the next few years, the regime optimistically engaged in reform and experimentation and for the first time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other luxury items. Attention was paid to the wages workers received. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. Censorship was eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were improved. The relative cultural and political relaxation resulted in a better [[freedom of speech]] environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly ''[[Polityka]]''. The massive investments and purchases of Western technology were expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture.<ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/> The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/>\n\nThis \"New Development Strategy\", based on import-led growth,<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> depended on the global economic conditions and the program faltered suddenly because of worldwide recession and increased oil prices.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=\"Int Soc\"/> The effects of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973\u201374 oil crisis]] produced an inflationary surge followed by a recession in the West, which resulted in a sharp increase in the price of imported consumer goods in Poland, coupled with a decline in demand for Polish exports, particularly [[coal]]. Poland's [[external debt|foreign debt]], absent at the time of Gomu\u0142ka's departure,<ref name=\"Prazmowska Gomulka grozil\"/> rose rapidly under Gierek to reach a multibillion-dollar figure. Continuing borrowing from the West had become increasingly difficult. Consumer goods began to disappear from Polish shops. The new factories built by Gierek's regime proved to be largely ineffective and mismanaged, as the basics of market [[demand]] and [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost effectiveness]] were often ignored.<ref name=\"poloniatodayhistory\"/><ref name=\"Britannica\"/> The significant internal economic reform, promised by the Gierek team, had not materialized.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 55\u201358\"/>\n\nThe Western credits thus helped spur industrial growth and helped Gierek's policy of [[consumerism]], but just for a few years. The industrial production grew by an average of 10% per year between 1971 and 1975 (the years remembered later by many older Poles as most prosperous, considering not only the communist period in Poland), only to dwindle to less than 2% in 1979. [[Government debt|Debt servicing]] that took 12% of export earnings in 1971, rose to 75% in 1979.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/><ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 286\"/>\n\nIn 1975, like other European countries, Poland became a signatory of the [[Helsinki Accords]] and member of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE); such developments were possible because of the period of \"[[d\u00e9tente]]\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. Despite the regime's promises that the freedoms listed in the agreement would be implemented in Poland, there was little change. However, the Poles were becoming more aware of the rights they were being denied and emboldened by the knowledge of their government's treaty obligations.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/>\n\nGierek government's growing difficulties led also to increased dependence on the Soviet Union, including tight economic cooperation and displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomu\u0142ka's rule. The [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|constitution]], amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with the Soviet Union and the leading role of the communist party. The language of the proposed changes was softened after [[Letter of 59|protests by intellectuals]] and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The divisive issues raised helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.<ref name=\"historybuffalo\"/><ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/><ref name=\"Sowa Historia polityczna 405\u2013407\"/>\n\nNevertheless, the regime of Gierek deemphasized the Marxist ideology and from his time the \"communist\" governments of Poland concentrated on pragmatic issues and current concerns.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 67\u201370\"/> In Polish economic politics new lasting trends were initiated, such as the emphasis on individual initiative, personal aspirations and competition, which some interpreted as an attack on [[egalitarianism]] (social inequalities were indeed increasing). Sections of the [[intelligentsia]], ''[[nomenklatura]]'' and [[small business]] gave rise to the emerging [[middle class]]. The new \"socialist\" ways were less totalitarian, stressed innovation, modern management methods and engaged workers, all seen as necessary to push the outdated economy past the constant crisis stage. Poland of the 1970s became more open to the world and entered the [[World economy|global economy]], which permanently changed society, creating at the same time a new type of crisis vulnerability. The opposition thinking, its promotion of society formed by active individuals, developed along complementary concepts.<ref name=\"Jak narod nie obalil komuny\"/><ref name=\"Gawin Michnik\"/>\n\n===Renewal of social unrest and the rise of organized opposition===\n\n[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Queue area|Queue line]], a frequent scene at times of [[shortage economy|shortages]] of [[Final good|consumer goods]] in the 1970s and 1980s]]\n\nAs a result of the 1970 worker rebellion food prices remained frozen and were artificially low. The demand for food products exceeded the supply also because of the higher real wages, which already in the first two years of Gierek's government increased more than during the entire decade of the 1960s.<ref name=\"Dudek Wzlot i upadek\"/> In June 1976, in an attempt to reduce consumption,<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> the government introduced a long-announced and several times delayed, but radical price increase: basic foodstuffs had their prices raised by an average of 60%, three times the rate of Gomu\u0142ka'a increases from six years before. The compensatory wage rises were skewed toward the better-off part of the population.<ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/>{{Ref label|w|w|none}} The result was an immediate [[June 1976 protests|nationwide wave of strikes]], with violent demonstrations, looting and other labor unrest at the [[Ursus Factory]] near Warsaw, in [[Radom]], [[P\u0142ock]] and other places.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 119\u2013120\"/> The government quickly backed down and repealed the price rises, but the strike leaders were arrested and put on trial.<ref name=\"Hardy New Capitalism 19\u201320\"/> A series of \"spontaneous\" large scale public gatherings, intended to convey the \"anger of the people\" at the \"trouble-makers\" was staged by the party leadership in a number of cities, but the Soviet pressure prevented further attempts at raising prices. Gierek's cordial in the past relations with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were now seriously damaged. Food [[Ration stamp|ration cards]], introduced because of the destabilized market in August 1976, were to remain a feature of life in Poland for the duration of the People's Republic.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 290\u2013296\"/> The regime's retreat, having occurred for the second time in several years, amounted to an unprecedented defeat. Within the rigid political system, the government was neither able to reform (it would lose control and power) nor to satisfy society's staple needs, because it had to sell abroad all it could to make foreign debt and interests payments. The government was in a quandary, the population suffered from the lack of necessities, and organized opposition found room to expand and consolidate.<ref name=\"GP 470-474\"/>\n\nBecause of the 1976 disturbances and the subsequent arrests, mistreatment and dismissals of worker militants, a group of intellectuals led by [[Jacek Kuro\u0144]], [[Antoni Macierewicz]], [[Jan J\u00f3zef Lipski]] and [[Adam Michnik]] founded and operated the [[Workers' Defence Committee]] (''Komitet Obrony Robotnik\u00f3w''; KOR).<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 224\u2013226\"/> The aim of the KOR was to assist the worker victims of the 1976 repression.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"Int Soc\"/> Working to support the spontaneous workers' movements, the dissidents recognized the necessarily predominant role of the working class in resisting the abuses of the regime. Accordingly, the newly formed opposition was increasingly characterized by an alliance of intelligentsia with workers.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 125\u2013131\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 227\"/> The KOR, according to Modzelewski, constituted the core of organized opposition and a seed of political alternative; clearing the way for other opposition formations, it engendered [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]].<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 234\u2013236\"/> More opposition groups indeed soon followed, including the [[Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights]] (ROPCiO), [[Free Trade Unions of the Coast]] (WZZW) and the [[Confederation of Independent Poland]] (KPN).<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> The periodical ''Robotnik'' ('The Worker') was distributed in factories from September 1977.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 234\u2013236\"/> The idea of independent trade unions was first raised by the Gda\u0144sk and Szczecin workers striking in 1970\u201371. Now it was developed and promoted by the KOR and its leftist collaborators, which led to the establishment in 1978 of Free Trade Unions, the precursor of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]. The KPN represented the minority [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] of the Polish opposition scene at that time.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 49\u201353\"/><ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 6\u201314\"/> The opposition members tried to resist the regime by denouncing it for violating the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]], Polish laws and Poland's international obligations.

Cardinal Karol Wojty\u0142a, the [[archbishop of Krak\u00f3w]], was elected [[pope]] at the Vatican, taking the name [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. The election of a Polish pope had an electrifying effect on what was at that time one of the last idiosyncratically Catholic countries in Europe.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> When John Paul toured Poland in June 1979, half a million people came to welcome him in Warsaw; in the next eight days, about ten million Poles attended the many outdoor [[mass (liturgy)|masses]] he celebrated.<ref name=\"TVN-1\"/> John Paul clearly became the most important person in Poland, leaving the regime not so much opposed as ignored. Rather than calling for rebellion, John Paul encouraged the creation of an \"alternative Poland\" of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next crisis came, the nation would present a united front.<ref name=\"Weigel-Pope\"/><ref name=\"Weigel-Witness\"/>\n\n===Polish emigration===\n\nThe [[Polish government-in-exile]] in [[London]], unrecognized since the end of World War II, ridiculed by the communists, to many Poles was of great symbolic importance.

The staunchly anti-communist American ''[[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]'' and other Poles felt grateful for the leadership of President [[Ronald Reagan]]. Of the Polish institutions in the West the most important were the [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]], whose Polish section was run by [[Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski]], and the monthly literary ''[[Kultura]]'' magazine in [[Paris]], led by [[Jerzy Giedroyc]] and [[Juliusz Mieroszewski]].<ref name=\"GP 481\"/>\n\n==Final decade of the Polish People's Republic (1980\u201389)==\n\n===Failing economy and labor unrest===\n\nBy 1980, the authorities had no choice but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic level, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western [[Financial institution|financial companies and institutions]] providing loans to the regime at a meeting at the [[Bank Handlowy]] in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that the state could no longer subsidize artificially low prices of consumer goods.<ref name=\"gnauck7\"/> The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat.

They were formally recognized by the authorities only after strike actions conducted by activists of both movements in January 1981.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 362\"/>\n\nIn September 1980, in the aftermath of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/> Like his predecessors, Kania made promises that the regime could not fulfill because the authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. The [[gross national income]] fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8%, and in 1981 by 15\u201320%.<ref name = \"Int Soc\"/>\n\nAt the communist summit in December 1980 in [[Moscow]], Kania argued with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and other [[Warsaw Pact]] leaders, who pressed for an immediate military intervention in Poland. Kania and Minister of Defense [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] declared their determination to fight the \"counterrevolution\" in Poland on their own. In regard to Solidarity, as they saw it, there was still a chance for its healthy, working class current to prevail, not the KOR-instigated anti-socialist, troublemaking elements. President [[Jimmy Carter]] and President-elect [[Ronald Reagan]] made urgent phone calls to Brezhnev and the intervention was postponed.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/> In the meantime Solidarity, not quite aware of the looming danger, did its [[revolution]]ary work, practicing democracy in the union movement and pushing for sovereign society in a number of ways.<ref name=\"Solidarnosc tak bylo\"/> The autonomous labor unions, united under the Solidarity banner, strove to \"recapture public life from the monopoly control of the party\". On 16 December 1980, the [[Monument to the Fallen Shipyard Workers of 1970]] was officially unveiled in Gda\u0144sk in a ceremony that marked the high point in the ascent of Solidarity.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 100\u2013111\"/>\n\nAmong the mass protests that occurred at that time were the winter [[1981 general strike in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]], the [[1981 warning strike in Poland|nationwide warning strike]] in the spring of that year and [[Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland|hunger demonstrations]] in summer. The warning strike took place in the aftermath of the [[Bydgoszcz events]] (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention.<ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/> Wa\u0142\u0119sa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, but at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.<ref name=\"Dudek: 13 grudnia\"/>\n\nMinister Jaruzelski became also prime minister in February 1981. In June, the Soviet Central Committee pressured the Polish party for a leadership change, but Jaruzelski received strong support from the military members of the Polish Central Committee. The extraordinary IX Congress of the PZPR took place in July. Kania was reelected the party's first secretary, while the organization's internal reformers suffered a defeat.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nAs the economic situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuro\u0144 and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the ruling party of some of its burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 126\u2013133\"/>\n\nThe existence of Solidarity and the political liberties that the movement brought paralyzed the authoritarian state and the state-controlled economy. Everyday life was becoming increasingly unbearable and the public displayed sentiments of extreme volatility. The hostility of the ''nomenklatura'' toward Solidarity was rapidly increasing.<ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nAt the State Defense Committee meeting on 13 September (the time of the Soviet [[Exercise Zapad-81]] maneuvers and of renewed pressure on the Polish leadership), Kania was warned by the uniformed cadres that the progressing counterrevolution must be terminated by an imposition of [[martial law]]. The PZPR regional secretaries soon issued the same demands. Under the circumstances, in October First Secretary Kania stepped down and Prime Minister Jaruzelski became also the party chief.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/>\n\nIn September and October, the [[History of Solidarity|First Congress of Solidarity]] deliberated in Gda\u0144sk. Wa\u0142\u0119sa faced activist opposition and was barely elected chairman of the organization. The delegates passed a radical reform program in which the world \"social\" or \"socialized\" was repeated 150 times. The congress issued a provocative call for workers in other East European countries, urging them to follow in Solidarity's footsteps.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Stelmachowski 53\"/><ref name=\"Kapitalizm przegra\"/> Locally authorized, increasingly \"political\" strikes continued. They were characterized as \"[[Wildcat strike action|wildcats]]\" by Wa\u0142\u0119sa, who desperately tried to impose discipline from the center. He attempted to reach an accord with the state, meeting General Jaruzelski and Catholic Primate [[J\u00f3zef Glemp]] on 4 November. At the time of the regime's re-energized efforts to reduce Solidarity's role, the union had nearly ten million members \u2014 almost four times as many as the ruling party.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 137\u2013141\"/> Militant mood was displayed and unrealistic demands made at the meeting of the partially represented National Commission on 3 December, but the proceedings were wiretapped by the authorities, who then broadcast the (previously manipulated to their advantage) recordings.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 141\u2013146\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 320\u2013327\"/>\n\nThe government, not consulting Solidarity, adopted a plan of economic measures that could be implemented only by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority.<ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 320\u2013327\"/> In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.<ref name=\"Jaruzelski tchorzem nie bylem\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski grozba\"/><ref name=\"Dudek: Nie wierz\u0119\"/>\n\n===Imposition of martial law===\n\n[[File:Wojciech Jaruzelski 1980s.jpg|thumb|right|150px|General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] led the [[Polish People's Republic|People's Republic]] during its final decade and became one of the key players in the systemic transition of 1989\u201390]]\n\nOn 13 December 1981, claiming that the country was on the verge of economic and civil breakdown and [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980\u20131981|alleging a danger of Soviet intervention]],<ref name=\"Mastny\"/> General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] began a crack-down on Solidarity.

The reform's effects were positive but limited (the process vastly increased general economic literacy and some of its accomplishments were later claimed by Solidarity governments as their own), because enterprises' self-rule had to compete with the traditional party interference, the authorities shied from subjecting the population to hardships, and Western governments and institutions showed no interest in supporting what was perceived as reform of a communist regime.<ref name=\"Reforma nie zacz\u0119\u0142a\"/> The government allowed more small-scale private enterprises to function, departing further from the 'socialist' model of economy.

The government side was represented by Czes\u0142aw Kiszczak, [[Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski]], Janusz Reykowski, Stanis\u0142aw Ciosek, Romuald Sosnowski, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Baka, Andrzej Gdula and [[Ireneusz Seku\u0142a]]; the Solidarity opposition by [[Adam Michnik]], Tadeusz Mazowiecki, [[Bronis\u0142aw Geremek]], [[Jacek Kuro\u0144]], [[Zbigniew Bujak]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Frasyniuk]], [[Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski]] and Witold Trzeciakowski, among others. The talks resulted in the [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Agreement]], by which political power was to be vested in a newly created [[bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] and in a [[President of Poland|president]], who would be the chief executive.<ref name=\"GP 501-508\"/><ref name=\"Kwasniewski Okragly Stol\"/>\n\nBy 4 April 1989, numerous reforms and freedoms for the opposition were agreed. Solidarity, now in existence as the [[Solidarity Citizens' Committee]], was to be legalized again as a trade union and allowed to participate in [[1989 Polish legislative election|semi-free elections]].<ref name=\"PWN_historia\"/><ref name=\"GP 501-508\"/> This election had restrictions imposed, designed to keep the PZPR in power, since only 35% of the seats in the ''[[Sejm]]'', the key lower chamber of parliament, would be open to Solidarity candidates. The remaining 65% were to be reserved for candidates from the PZPR and its allies (the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]], the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Alliance of Democrats]] and the [[PAX Association]]). Since the Round Table Agreement mandated only reform (not replacement) of \"[[real socialism]]\" in Poland, the party thought of the election as a way of neutralizing political conflict and staying in power, while gaining some legitimacy to carry out economic reforms.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity 205\u2013215\"/><ref name=\"DSM\"/><ref name=\"Modzelewski kobyla historii 375\u2013380\"/> However, the negotiated social policies, arrived at by economists and trade unionists during the Round Table talks, were quickly tossed out by both the party and the opposition.<ref name=\"Sutowski Okragly Stol\"/>\n\nA systemic transformation happening sooner rather than later was made possible by the [[1989 Polish legislative election|Polish legislative elections]] of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square protests]] in [[China]]. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity (caused in part by the [[electoral system]] that favored the opposition as far as the contested seats were concerned, but was permitted by the government nevertheless)<ref name=\"Krasowski Po po\u0142udniu 32\u201333\"/> surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the ''Sejm'', while in the newly established [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats. At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The PZPR-led coalition suffered a catastrophic blow to its legitimacy.<ref name=\"DSM\"/>\n\n====Political transformation====\n\nThe next few months were spent on political maneuvering. The increasingly insecure communists, who still had military and administrative control over the country, were appeased by a compromise in which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. On 19 July 1989 Jaruzelski barely won the vote in the [[Parliament of Poland#National Assembly|National Assembly]] [[1989 Polish presidential election|presidential election]], even though his name was the only one on the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by a sufficient number of Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong.

On 1 August, prices were freed because of the ongoing market reforms and [[hyperinflation]] resulted. The instantly increased economic hardship caused a new wave of strikes. The strikes were spontaneous, but the Solidarity leaders, no longer in agreement with the strikers' economic demands, were able to emphasize the secondary political aspect of the strikes (anger at the party's obstinacy) and use them to pressure the regime for an expedited transfer of power.<ref name=\"Ost Solidarity Defeat 43\u201349\"/> The new prime minister, General Kiszczak, who was appointed on 2 August 1989, failed to gain enough support in the ''Sejm'' to form a government and resigned on 19 August. He was the last communist head of government in Poland. Although Jaruzelski tried to persuade Solidarity to join the PZPR in a \"grand coalition\", Wa\u0142\u0119sa refused.

[[1968 Polish political crisis|Defeated in 1968]] by the regime which took advantage of the opposition's social isolation, the opposition activists opted for an alliance with the Polish Catholic Church. The alliance ended the opposition's isolation and legitimated the movement in popular perception. However, the cost for the Left was a surrender of its fundamental value system (the mainstream opposition could thus no longer be considered leftist), and in the long run granting the Right the upper hand in the ability to mobilize mass political support. The opposition's alliance with the Church (before 1989 and after, when it became the ruling establishment) is also responsible, according to the cultural philosopher Andrzej Leder, for the marginalization of the Left and its social concept in the political spectrum of democratic Poland.<ref name=\"Leder Pustka\"/> In 1977 [[Adam Michnik]] published his pivotal book ''Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142, lewica, dialog'' ('The Church, the Left, the dialogue').

From February 1946 to the end of 1948, 2.2 million Germans had to leave Poland (Paczkowski). 2.8 million Poles returned to Poland after the war from Germany and other parts of Western Europe (out of the total of 3.0\u20133.5 million war displaced who were present there) and many of them settled in the Recovered Territories.(S\u0142abek).<ref name=\"Leder Rewolucja 141\u2013143\"/>\n\n''c1.''{{Note label|c1|c1|none}}Andrzej Leder wrote (2014) of the mass migration from rural areas to urban centers: \"The consequence ... of the extermination during the German occupation of Jewish urban people and the destruction by Stalinist communism of the dominant position of state functionary, military and intellectual elites originating from  ''[[szlachta]]'', was the creation of an enormous and multi-dimensional sphere for advancement.

The character first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #844 (Dec. 2006) and was created by [[Richard Donner]], [[Geoff Johns]], and [[Adam Kubert]].\n\nAs the biological son of [[General Zod]] and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]], he is a [[Kryptonian]] who becomes the foster son of [[Clark Kent]] ([[Superman]]) and his wife [[Lois Lane]].\n\n==Publication history==\nHe first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #844 (December 2006), in the story arc ''[[Superman: Last Son]]'', and was created by [[Richard Donner]], [[Geoff Johns]], and [[Adam Kubert]]. The character has assumed the role of [[Nightwing]]. Following ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', DC revisited the concept of Zod's heroic son. On Earth-16, he succeeds Clark Kent as Superman and is best friends with the new Batman, [[Damian Wayne]]. On Earth-2, in the comic ''Earth 2'', Zod's son '''[[Val-Zod]]''' succeeds Kal-El as the pacifist Superman of his universe. <ref>''Earth 2'' #19</ref>\n\nA new version of Lor-Zod was introduced in 2017 during [[DC Rebirth]] in the ''Action Comics'' series during the Revenge storyline, this time as a villain.<ref name=\"AC984\"/>\n\n==Fictional character biography==<!-- W:MOS -->\n\n===\"Last Son\"===\nWhen a spacecraft fell towards [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], it was diverted to a relatively safe landing by [[Superman]]. After its landing, Superman was very surprised to discover a young boy inside. Echoing his own arrival in his youth years before, Superman saw that the boy was completely unharmed. The Kryptonian writings on his ship stated that his Kryptonian name was \"Lor-Zod,\" which was later confirmed in ''Action Comics'' #851 (August 2007). He was taken to the east coast lab of the [[Department of Metahuman Affairs]] (under supervision of [[Sarge Steel]]) for observation.\n\nThe boy exhibited superhuman strength and could only speak [[Kryptonian]]. He did not know his name or where he came from.  As with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], Superman instinctively knew the boy was Kryptonian before the tests were completed. After he was confirmed as a Kryptonian, he was immediately taken to the Department of [[Metahuman]] Affairs headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]] without Superman's knowledge. He removed the boy from their [[Child custody|custody]], and decided, with [[Lois Lane]], to raise the boy.<ref name=\"ac844\">''Action Comics'' #844 (December 2006)</ref> Clark then contacted [[Batman]], who used his resources to create the identity '''Christopher Kent'''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=152-153}}</ref>\n\nChris remained in the custody of Lois and Clark as their foster son. He attended the Ellsworth School, an elite private school, where he had some trouble concealing his powers, particularly during P.E. To aid him, Superman worked with Batman to develop an implant, concealed within a wristwatch, that used red sun radiation to block Chris' powers while in school until he learned how to control them.  While the watch was being created, Chris made friends with [[Tim Drake]], the current Robin, who treated him like a younger brother and offered to show him some gymnastics.<ref name=\"sm668\">''Superman'' (vol. 1) #668 (December 2007)</ref>  Eventually, the wristwatch failed, due to it being calibrated on the metabolism of an adult Kryptonian, and the built-up energies exploded, wrecking Clark and Lois' apartment. Clark reassured the young boy that he wouldn't be sent away, and that they would find a way to cope with his growing powers.<ref name=\"sm673\">''Superman'' (vol. 1) #673 (April 2008)</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Superman held a press conference to inform the world that the Kryptonian child was under his care. At that time, [[Bizarro]], sent by [[Lex Luthor]], attempted unsuccessfully to [[kidnap]] Chris. Later, it was revealed that Chris is the biological son of [[General Zod]] and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]]. His arrival released Zod, [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]], and Ursa from the [[Phantom Zone]].<ref name=\"ac845\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #845 (January 2007)</ref> He was apparently conceived and raised there within a prison structure that is immune to the \"timeless\" effects of the zone, and Christopher himself was specially immune as well. It was insinuated by Phantom Zone resident [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]] that Zod and Ursa were abusive towards their son before sending him out of the Zone. In a battle with Superman, Zod and Ursa reclaimed their son and captured Lois. After sending Superman to the [[Phantom Zone]], General Zod's army invaded Earth.<ref name=\"ac846\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #846 (February 2007)</ref>  Superman escaped with Mon-El's aid, and then sought an alliance with [[Lex Luthor]] to defeat Zod, who had captured a large portion of Earth's superhero population. In Zod's custody, Chris used his powers to prevent Lois from being harmed.<ref name=\"ac851\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #851 (August 2007)</ref>\n\nFollowing the events of ''Action Comics Annual'' #11, Zod and his army were defeated and Chris pursued them into the Phantom Zone in order to ensure that the passage between the Phantom Zone and the rest of the universe is closed properly, since it would remain weak for as long as he remained on Earth. He was aware of the cost of this action, and as he left he thanked Superman and Lois for giving him a proper family.  Afterward, Mon-El, asked by Superman to look for the child in the Zone, reported that he was unsuccessful so far although he knows that Zod does not have him, but vowed to continue searching.\n\n===Nightwing===\nAfter returning to the [[Phantom Zone]], Chris entered the Kryptonian prison where his parents had made shelter. There he found a piece of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s technology; Chris' mind interfaced with the device, expanding his consciousness, and forging a connection with the mind of [[Thara Ak-Var]], security chief of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], which had recently been freed from Brainiac's ship by Superman. Thara used the connection between their minds to stage a successful rescue attempt with the added help of [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]].<ref>''Action Comics Annual'' #12 (August 2009)</ref> When the citizens of Kandor created [[New Krypton]], which was placed in orbit around the Sun opposite Earth, Chris and Thara tasked themselves with the mission of bringing in the Phantom Zone Kryptonian criminals hiding on Earth as [[sleeper agent]]s. Since the belligerent government of [[Alura (DC Comics)|Alura Zor-El]] and Zod had tarnished all Kryptonians' reputations on Earth, Chris and Thara decided to act as a new [[Nightwing]] and [[Flamebird]] duo (since [[Dick Grayson]], the previous Nightwing, became the new Batman), at first with simple cloth masks, then with fake power suits, to obscure the origins of their powers.\n\nHowever Chris, due to his birth in the Phantom Zone, exhibits strange and uncontrollable growth spurts: when Thara saved him he was still the young boy raised by [[Lois Lane|Lois]] and [[Superman|Clark]], as Nightwing he is shown as roughly 15 or 16, and after another growth spurt of about seven years, he ages to 23 years old.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20543 Greg Rucka: Man of \"Action\"]</ref>\n\nHis mother, Ursa, begins stalking him to exact revenge. Chris had been shown denying his heritage and insisting Thara address him with his \"human\" name, despising her attempts to transliterate it as a Kryptonian name, and never going by his true Kryptonian name of Lor-Zod.<ref name=\"ac875\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #875 (May 2009)</ref> After a brutal attack by Ursa, Thara is left gravely wounded by a frangible [[Kryptonite]] knife and Chris is forced to bring her to Lois for medical assistance.<ref name=\"ac876\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #876 (June 2009)</ref>\n\nUpon bringing Thara to Lois, Chris and Lois have a tearful reunion. Lois is happy to see him again but is concerned about his advanced aging. Lois calls [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]] for medical assistance while Chris goes back to the fortress and is again confronted by Ursa. Their conflict is cut short as UAVs sent by [[Sam Lane (comics)|General Lane]] arrived at the scene, forcing both to flee.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #877 (July 2009)</ref>\n\nWhile Chris returns home to Lois, he finds that Thara has recovered and is being quizzed by Lois about their relationship. Before Lois is able to learn anything, the two fly away to confront a Kryptonian couple on a crime spree. The four battle, with Chris and Thara quickly gaining the upper hand; however their fight is interrupted by [[Codename: Assassin]] and what seems to be a gang of \"ogres\".<ref name=\"ac876\"/> The sleeper couple use the distraction to escape. Chris as Nightwing pursues them, but is forced to let them go in order to save some innocents from a falling bridge.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #879 (September 2009)</ref>\n\nAfter the two receive a hero's thank you from a crowd in Hollywood, Thara notices that one of the girls gave her phone number to Chris. Chris asks if she is jealous. Thara lies saying that she does not care if he goes around with hundreds of girls. Reacting on an impulse the two share a kiss. Before either of the two actually manages to respond they are attacked by [[Metallo]] and [[Reactron]] and captured.<ref name=\"ac880\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #880 (October 2009)</ref>\n\n===Framed for murder===\nFortunately Chris and Thara are teleported away, along with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. Kara as Supergirl attacks Thara, for killing her father and trying to kill her. However, Chris stops her and tells her he is her cousin. The three are attacked by Guardian and the Science Police, for apparently killing Mon-El. Chris tries to tell Guardian that they did not murder Mon-El, but Guardian ignores him. The three manage to escape to Paris. Chris, Thara, and Kara talk about what has happened. They then discover that the two sleepers they were fighting were [[Metallo]] and [[Reactron]]. However, they are attacked by Squad K.<ref name=\"ac881\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #881 (November 2009)</ref>\n\nFramed for the murder of [[Mon-El]], the two along with Kara, manage to escape from Squad K, and go to [[Lana Lang]]'s apartment. They enlist Lois' help in clearing their names. Chris and Lana go to find Lois while Kara and Thara stay in Lana's apartment.<ref name=\"supergirl45\">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #45 (November 2009)</ref>\n\nChris and Thara are discovered, and once more forced to flee. During the attempt to flee they once more encounter Squad K however the three opt to surrender in order to clear their names. While they manage to persuade the Squad K commander, Reactron quickly murders his teammates and attempts to kill the three.\n\nDuring their conflict Thara is injured while attempting to protect Supergirl. As Reactron is about to kill Chris and Kara, Thara manifests her Flamebird powers and personality, and easily overpowers Reactron. The Flamebird decides to kill Reactron but is swayed to show mercy after Reactron reveals that Mon-El is alive and is talked down by Supergirl. The Flamebird is once more submerged after sharing a kiss with Chris.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #882 (December 2009)</ref>\n\nDonning new costumes, Chris and Thara continue to save lives, despite their actions being twisted by the anti-Kryptonian media. Not long after, Chris experiences another aging spurt, becoming an old man. Doctor Light brings Chris to her colleague, Doctor Pillings, who, unbeknownst to any of them, is the Kryptonian sleeper agent [[Jax-Ur]].<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #883 (January 2010)</ref>\nJax-Ur cures Chris, reverting him to his young adult form and takes a sample of his DNA.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #884 (February 2010)</ref>\n\nJax-Ur's theft of Chris' DNA and its purpose is soon revealed as he unleashes a replica of the Kryptonian deity Rao to trample and rampage across Earth. Thara attempts to subdue Jax-Ur and the false deity but even in her Flamebird form is overpowered.  Meanwhile, Chris is helpless once more stuck in the Phantom Zone, banished there by Jax-Ur. While he is there he can only observe as Thara, Lois, and other heroes battle against Rao but fail to inflict any actual damage, only [[Wonder Woman]] managing to hold her own. Saddened and frustrated, he is contacted by the Nightwing, another Kryptonian entity, opposite and lover of Flamebird. Nightwing reveals that while Thara is truly the host of Flamebird, so is he Nightwing's. For some reason, however, the two are unable to connect. Seeing that Thara and the others won't hold out much longer, Chris and Nightwing merge properly and are able to free themselves.\n\nNow a fully fledged avatar of the Nightwing entity Chris is able to fight [[Jax-Ur]] (revealed to be the Kryptonian deity the Builder as well) along with Flamebird on even terms.

Later during [[DC Rebirth]], a new version of Lor-Zod was introduced, this one more loyal to his father General Zod. <ref name=\"AC984\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #984</ref>. Freed by the [[Superman Revenge Squad]], the House of Zod ruled over Jekuul, a planet with two yellow [[sun]]s.

His abilities are less powerful than those of the average [[Kryptonian]], but the limits have not been measured. He has exhibited eight Kryptonian abilities so far:\n\n* ''Flight'': He flies in the [[Fortress of Solitude]] and at the Kent farm.<ref name=\"ac845\"/>\n* ''Heat Vision'': He burns [[General Zod]]'s hand when he attempts to harm [[Lois Lane]].<ref name=\"ac851\" />\n* ''Telescopic Vision'': He is able to combine this power with his x-ray vision to watch the main screens in the [[Batcave]] from afar.<ref name=\"sm668\" />\n* ''X-Ray Vision'': He is able to combine this power with his super vision to watch the main screens in the Batcave from afar.<ref name=\"sm668\" />\n* ''Invulnerability'': He arrives on Earth unharmed, and a bus falls on him during the [[Bizarro]] attack.<ref name=\"ac845\"/> However, he has stated that he isn't as invulnerable as other Kryptonians.<ref name=\"ac876\"/>\n* ''Superhuman Strength'': He is able to lift objects hundreds of times his own weight, including a heavy, old style, console television in the Metahuman Affairs lab as a child.<ref name=\"ac844\" /> He then, later, exhibited a greater degree of strength when he caught the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' globe as it fell during the Bizarro attack.<ref name=\"ac845\" /> He has stated that he is not as strong as other Kryptonians.<ref name=\"ac876\"/>\n* ''Superhuman Intelligence'': He is able to memorize a dictionary within an hour and learn the English language.<ref name=\"ac845\" />\n* ''Vortex Breath'': He is able to use this power to slow the falls of several cars, allowing [[Superman]] to catch them.<ref name=\"sm668\"/>\n\nAs [[Nightwing]], he has also demonstrated additional abilities due to his birth in the [[Phantom Zone]]:\n* ''Tactile Telekinesis'': He is able to dismantle objects similarly to [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]].<ref name=\"ac876\"/> He also displays the skill in a more traditional sense, such as moving objects without actually touching them. While this is considered base telekinesis, he seems to manifest this power through hand gestures instead of this ability emanating from pure thought. Also, while he is moderately powerful in this area, he lacks any fine skill; generally using it as a \"blunt instrument\" of destructive power. The use of his power is usually accompanied by a dark purple display of lighted bands emanating from his hands.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #46 (December 2009)</ref>\n* ''Kryptonite Resistance'': He does not feel the effects of kryptonite exposure as severely as other Kryptonians and can withstand its effects for much longer periods of time, an ability he has used offensively and defensively in combat. It is not known if prolonged exposure to kryptonite would eventually kill him or not.<ref name=\"ac876\"/>\n\nHe is also immune to the effects of the [[Phantom Zone]] because he was born there. He has a solid body within the zone and apparently ages normally while all other inhabitants are timeless and phantoms.

The exact distance he can teleport remains unknown, but he was able to teleport or absorb a faulty artificial sun into the Phantom Zone.\n* ''Shadow Construct Creation'': Chris displays this ability in the most rudimentary form, creating dark creatures, shadow shields, etc. His exact limitations are also unknown.\n* ''Virtual Omniscience'': The Nightwing has stated that he sees and knows everything that occurs in shadows or darkness.

Sacrificing himself in an attempt to kill [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] ([[Captain Atom|Nathaniel Adam]]), he is ultimately the first to fall in his battle against the Supermen of [[Superman: Red Son|Earth-30]] and [[The Dark Knight Returns|Earth-31]].<ref>''Countdown: Arena'' #3-4</ref>\n\nA previous/similar version of Chris Kent/Nightwing was devised in the [[Elseworlds]] series ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'' in issue #4, \"1999: Beginnings and Endings\", where a descendant of [[Superman]] named Clark Wayne- the biological son of Joel Kent, Superman's son, who was manipulated into turning against his father by Lex Luthor and subsequently killed, with Bruce Wayne Junior adopting Chris after Joel's death- adopts the heroic identity of \"Knightwing\".<ref>''Superman & Batman: Generations'' #3</ref>\n\nThe New 52 version of Earth-16 is visited in ''[[The Multiversity]]: The Just'' #1, where Chris Kent is Superman and his best friend is Damian Wayne, Batman, with Conner Kent as Superboy. Chris and his friends, including [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]], [[Kyle Rayner]], and [[Connor Hawke]], though they've inherited the superhero mantles of their parents and predecessors, are deeply bored as the world is effectively policed by [[Superman robot]]s, and many of the Justice League's villains were defeated by the previous generation of heroes. They resort to a celebrity lifestyle of partying and affairs, as well as occasional battle re-enactments, to pass the time.\n\n==In other media==\nAnother child of [[General Zod]] appeared in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[Benjamin Bratt]]. He is the genetically-engineered son of Zod and [[Lara Lor-Van]], who was rocketed to Earth as a child from the doomed planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] following [[Jor-El]]'s murder by Zod. Upon his arrival on Earth, he is named as '''Hernan Guerra''' and was raised by a family of honorable and hardworking [[Mexicans|Mexican]] migrant farmers. Having gone through the troubles that undocumented immigrants face in the United States, he has become short-tempered and withdrawn from humanity with a deep contempt and resentment for authority, but he grows to become that reality's version of [[Superman]] and leader of the [[Justice League]]. He is best friend of [[Kirk Langstrom]], that reality's [[Batman]], and appears to be in a relationship with [[Bekka]], that reality's [[Wonder Woman]], He is also willing to use lethal force against enemies and even plans to topple world governments and reorganize world leadership under the Justice League's rule. Due to his brutality he is generally feared by the public, is frequently criticized by [[Lois Lane]], and is resented by Lex Luthor, [[Amanda Waller]], and [[Steve Trevor]]. After a series of murders orchestrated by the secretly villainous [[Will Magnus]] to frame the Justice League, which the world easily believes due to Superman's past brutality, Superman gradually realizes the consequences of his brutality, especially after learning his father was responsible for Krypton's destruction. After the Justice League foils Magnus's plan to turn humanity into a hive minded species, Superman earns back public favor and considers using less brutality.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Superman characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kent, Chris}}\n[[Category:DC Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Kryptonians]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2006]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Geoff Johns]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional superhero in DC Comics}}\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| character_name= Chris Kent\n| image=ChristopherKent.jpg\n| imagesize=\n| caption=Chris Kent as [[Nightwing]] on the cover of ''Action Comics'' #883 (Jan. 2010); art by Pere P\u00e9rez\n| publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n| debut=''[[Action Comics]]'' #844 (December [[2006 in comics|2006]])\n| creators=[[Richard Donner]]<br/>[[Geoff Johns]]<br/>[[Adam Kubert]]\n| full_name=-Christopher Kent/Lor-Zod<br>-Hernan Guerra/Superman\n| species= [[Kryptonian]]\n| homeworld=[[Phantom Zone]]\n| alliances=<!-- optional -->\n| partners=[[Thara Ak-Var|Flamebird (Thara Ak-Var)]]\n| aliases=[[Nightwing]], K'Riss\n| supports=[[Superman]]\n| powers=\n*Flight\n*Heat vision\n*Freezing breath\n*Extrasensory powers, including X-ray vision\n| cat=super\n| subcat=DC Comics\n| hero=y\n}}\n'''Christopher Kent''' ('''Lor-Zod''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #844 (Dec. 2006) and was created by [[Richard Donner]], [[Geoff Johns]], and [[Adam Kubert]].\n\nAs the biological son of [[General Zod]] and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]], he is a [[Kryptonian]] who becomes the foster son of [[Clark Kent]] ([[Superman]]) and his wife [[Lois Lane]].\n\n==Publication history==\nHe first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #844 (December 2006), in the story arc ''[[Superman: Last Son]]'', and was created by [[Richard Donner]], [[Geoff Johns]], and [[Adam Kubert]]. The character has assumed the role of [[Nightwing]]. Following ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', DC revisited the concept of Zod's heroic son. On Earth-16, he succeeds Clark Kent as Superman and is best friends with the new Batman, [[Damian Wayne]]. On Earth-2, in the comic ''Earth 2'', Zod's son '''[[Val-Zod]]''' succeeds Kal-El as the pacifist Superman of his universe. <ref>''Earth 2'' #19</ref>\n\nA new version of Lor-Zod was introduced in 2017 during [[DC Rebirth]] in the ''Action Comics'' series during the Revenge storyline, this time as a villain.<ref name=\"AC984\"/>\n\n==Fictional character biography==<!-- W:MOS -->\n\n===\"Last Son\"===\nWhen a spacecraft fell towards [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], it was diverted to a relatively safe landing by [[Superman]]. After its landing, Superman was very surprised to discover a young boy inside. Echoing his own arrival in his youth years before, Superman saw that the boy was completely unharmed. The Kryptonian writings on his ship stated that his Kryptonian name was \"Lor-Zod,\" which was later confirmed in ''Action Comics'' #851 (August 2007). He was taken to the east coast lab of the [[Department of Metahuman Affairs]] (under supervision of [[Sarge Steel]]) for observation.\n\nThe boy exhibited superhuman strength and could only speak [[Kryptonian]]. He did not know his name or where he came from.  As with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], Superman instinctively knew the boy was Kryptonian before the tests were completed. After he was confirmed as a Kryptonian, he was immediately taken to the Department of [[Metahuman]] Affairs headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]] without Superman's knowledge. He removed the boy from their [[Child custody|custody]], and decided, with [[Lois Lane]], to raise the boy.<ref name=\"ac844\">''Action Comics'' #844 (December 2006)</ref> Clark then contacted [[Batman]], who used his resources to create the identity '''Christopher Kent'''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=152-153}}</ref>\n\nChris remained in the custody of Lois and Clark as their foster son. He attended the Ellsworth School, an elite private school, where he had some trouble concealing his powers, particularly during P.E. To aid him, Superman worked with Batman to develop an implant, concealed within a wristwatch, that used red sun radiation to block Chris' powers while in school until he learned how to control them.  While the watch was being created, Chris made friends with [[Tim Drake]], the current Robin, who treated him like a younger brother and offered to show him some gymnastics.<ref name=\"sm668\">''Superman'' (vol. 1) #668 (December 2007)</ref>  Eventually, the wristwatch failed, due to it being calibrated on the metabolism of an adult Kryptonian, and the built-up energies exploded, wrecking Clark and Lois' apartment. Clark reassured the young boy that he wouldn't be sent away, and that they would find a way to cope with his growing powers.<ref name=\"sm673\">''Superman'' (vol. 1) #673 (April 2008)</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Superman held a press conference to inform the world that the Kryptonian child was under his care. At that time, [[Bizarro]], sent by [[Lex Luthor]], attempted unsuccessfully to [[kidnap]] Chris. Later, it was revealed that Chris is the biological son of [[General Zod]] and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]]. His arrival released Zod, [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]], and Ursa from the [[Phantom Zone]].<ref name=\"ac845\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #845 (January 2007)</ref> He was apparently conceived and raised there within a prison structure that is immune to the \"timeless\" effects of the zone, and Christopher himself was specially immune as well. It was insinuated by Phantom Zone resident [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]] that Zod and Ursa were abusive towards their son before sending him out of the Zone. In a battle with Superman, Zod and Ursa reclaimed their son and captured Lois. After sending Superman to the [[Phantom Zone]], General Zod's army invaded Earth.<ref name=\"ac846\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #846 (February 2007)</ref>  Superman escaped with Mon-El's aid, and then sought an alliance with [[Lex Luthor]] to defeat Zod, who had captured a large portion of Earth's superhero population. In Zod's custody, Chris used his powers to prevent Lois from being harmed.<ref name=\"ac851\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #851 (August 2007)</ref>\n\nFollowing the events of ''Action Comics Annual'' #11, Zod and his army were defeated and Chris pursued them into the Phantom Zone in order to ensure that the passage between the Phantom Zone and the rest of the universe is closed properly, since it would remain weak for as long as he remained on Earth. He was aware of the cost of this action, and as he left he thanked Superman and Lois for giving him a proper family.  Afterward, Mon-El, asked by Superman to look for the child in the Zone, reported that he was unsuccessful so far although he knows that Zod does not have him, but vowed to continue searching.\n\n===Nightwing===\nAfter returning to the [[Phantom Zone]], Chris entered the Kryptonian prison where his parents had made shelter. There he found a piece of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s technology; Chris' mind interfaced with the device, expanding his consciousness, and forging a connection with the mind of [[Thara Ak-Var]], security chief of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], which had recently been freed from Brainiac's ship by Superman. Thara used the connection between their minds to stage a successful rescue attempt with the added help of [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]].<ref>''Action Comics Annual'' #12 (August 2009)</ref> When the citizens of Kandor created [[New Krypton]], which was placed in orbit around the Sun opposite Earth, Chris and Thara tasked themselves with the mission of bringing in the Phantom Zone Kryptonian criminals hiding on Earth as [[sleeper agent]]s. Since the belligerent government of [[Alura|Alura Zor-El]] and Zod had tarnished all Kryptonians' reputations on Earth, Chris and Thara decided to act as a new [[Nightwing]] and [[Flamebird]] duo (since [[Dick Grayson]], the previous Nightwing, became the new Batman), at first with simple cloth masks, then with fake power suits, to obscure the origins of their powers.\n\nHowever Chris, due to his birth in the Phantom Zone, exhibits strange and uncontrollable growth spurts: when Thara saved him he was still the young boy raised by [[Lois Lane|Lois]] and [[Superman|Clark]], as Nightwing he is shown as roughly 15 or 16, and after another growth spurt of about seven years, he ages to 23 years old.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20543 Greg Rucka: Man of \"Action\"]</ref>\n\nHis mother, Ursa, begins stalking him to exact revenge. Chris had been shown denying his heritage and insisting Thara address him with his \"human\" name, despising her attempts to transliterate it as a Kryptonian name, and never going by his true Kryptonian name of Lor-Zod.<ref name=\"ac875\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #875 (May 2009)</ref> After a brutal attack by Ursa, Thara is left gravely wounded by a frangible [[Kryptonite]] knife and Chris is forced to bring her to Lois for medical assistance.<ref name=\"ac876\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #876 (June 2009)</ref>\n\nUpon bringing Thara to Lois, Chris and Lois have a tearful reunion. Lois is happy to see him again but is concerned about his advanced aging. Lois calls [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]] for medical assistance while Chris goes back to the fortress and is again confronted by Ursa. Their conflict is cut short as UAVs sent by [[Sam Lane (comics)|General Lane]] arrived at the scene, forcing both to flee.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #877 (July 2009)</ref>\n\nWhile Chris returns home to Lois, he finds that Thara has recovered and is being quizzed by Lois about their relationship. Before Lois is able to learn anything, the two fly away to confront a Kryptonian couple on a crime spree. The four battle, with Chris and Thara quickly gaining the upper hand; however their fight is interrupted by [[Codename: Assassin]] and what seems to be a gang of \"ogres\".<ref name=\"ac876\"/> The sleeper couple use the distraction to escape. Chris as Nightwing pursues them, but is forced to let them go in order to save some innocents from a falling bridge.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #879 (September 2009)</ref>\n\nAfter the two receive a hero's thank you from a crowd in Hollywood, Thara notices that one of the girls gave her phone number to Chris. Chris asks if she is jealous. Thara lies saying that she does not care if he goes around with hundreds of girls. Reacting on an impulse the two share a kiss. Before either of the two actually manages to respond they are attacked by [[Metallo]] and [[Reactron]] and captured.<ref name=\"ac880\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #880 (October 2009)</ref>\n\n===Framed for murder===\nFortunately Chris and Thara are teleported away, along with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. Kara as Supergirl attacks Thara, for killing her father and trying to kill her. However, Chris stops her and tells her he is her cousin. The three are attacked by Guardian and the Science Police, for apparently killing Mon-El. Chris tries to tell Guardian that they did not murder Mon-El, but Guardian ignores him. The three manage to escape to Paris. Chris, Thara, and Kara talk about what has happened. They then discover that the two sleepers they were fighting were [[Metallo]] and [[Reactron]]. However, they are attacked by Squad K.<ref name=\"ac881\">''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #881 (November 2009)</ref>\n\nFramed for the murder of [[Mon-El]], the two along with Kara, manage to escape from Squad K, and go to [[Lana Lang]]'s apartment. They enlist Lois' help in clearing their names. Chris and Lana go to find Lois while Kara and Thara stay in Lana's apartment.<ref name=\"supergirl45\">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #45 (November 2009)</ref>\n\nChris and Thara are discovered, and once more forced to flee. During the attempt to flee they once more encounter Squad K however the three opt to surrender in order to clear their names. While they manage to persuade the Squad K commander, Reactron quickly murders his teammates and attempts to kill the three.\n\nDuring their conflict Thara is injured while attempting to protect Supergirl. As Reactron is about to kill Chris and Kara, Thara manifests her Flamebird powers and personality, and easily overpowers Reactron. The Flamebird decides to kill Reactron but is swayed to show mercy after Reactron reveals that Mon-El is alive and is talked down by Supergirl. The Flamebird is once more submerged after sharing a kiss with Chris.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #882 (December 2009)</ref>\n\nDonning new costumes, Chris and Thara continue to save lives, despite their actions being twisted by the anti-Kryptonian media. Not long after, Chris experiences another aging spurt, becoming an old man. Doctor Light brings Chris to her colleague, Doctor Pillings, who, unbeknownst to any of them, is the Kryptonian sleeper agent [[Jax-Ur]].<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #883 (January 2010)</ref>\nJax-Ur cures Chris, reverting him to his young adult form and takes a sample of his DNA.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #884 (February 2010)</ref>\n\nJax-Ur's theft of Chris' DNA and its purpose is soon revealed as he unleashes a replica of the Kryptonian deity Rao to trample and rampage across Earth. Thara attempts to subdue Jax-Ur and the false deity but even in her Flamebird form is overpowered.  Meanwhile, Chris is helpless once more stuck in the Phantom Zone, banished there by Jax-Ur. While he is there he can only observe as Thara, Lois, and other heroes battle against Rao but fail to inflict any actual damage, only [[Wonder Woman]] managing to hold her own. Saddened and frustrated, he is contacted by the Nightwing, another Kryptonian entity, opposite and lover of Flamebird. Nightwing reveals that while Thara is truly the host of Flamebird, so is he Nightwing's. For some reason, however, the two are unable to connect. Seeing that Thara and the others won't hold out much longer, Chris and Nightwing merge properly and are able to free themselves.\n\nNow a fully fledged avatar of the Nightwing entity Chris is able to fight [[Jax-Ur]] (revealed to be the Kryptonian deity the Builder as well) along with Flamebird on even terms. Furious that Nightwing escaped, Jax-Ur flees into the heart of his construct, Rao and triggers a self-destruct located in Rao's heart which would engulf the Earth into a black hole and rip the universe apart. Nightwing and Flamebird together are able to overpower him and Nightwing absorbs Rao's heart into the Phantom Zone where it is rendered harmless and destroys the Rao construct.\n\nOnce the Rao crises is dealt with both Thara and Chris regroup with the other heroes; they kiss and flee in order to avoid any more hostilities with the locals.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #885-889 (March\u2013June 2010)</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Superman: War of the Supermen|War of the Supermen]] event, the solar system's sun was turned red by the combined efforts of [[Sam Lane (comics)|General Lane]] and [[Lex Luthor]]. Thara sacrifices herself to restore it to its yellow coloration, becoming a charred skeleton. Chris attempted to join her, but the Nightwing entity spirited him away.<ref>''Superman: War of the Supermen'' #3 (July 2010)</ref>\n\nIn the final confrontation between Superman and Zod, Chris pushes Zod back into the Phantom Zone. Once back in the Zone, Chris returns to being a young boy, and encounters Mon-El once again.<ref>''Superman: War of the Supermen'' #4 (July 2010)</ref>\n\n===Rebirth===\nFollowing the [[New 52]] reboot, Chris Kent was officially retconned from the continuity.

Sacrificing himself in an attempt to kill [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] ([[Captain Atom|Nathaniel Adam]]), he is ultimately the first to fall in his battle against the Supermen of [[Superman: Red Son|Earth-30]] and [[The Dark Knight Returns|Earth-31]].<ref>''Countdown: Arena'' #3-4</ref>\n\nA previous/similar version of Chris Kent/Nightwing was devised in the [[Elseworlds]] series ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'' in issue #4, \"1999: Beginnings and Endings\", where a descendant of [[Superman]] named Clark Wayne- the biological son of Joel Kent, Superman's son, who was manipulated into turning against his father by Lex Luthor and subsequently killed, with Bruce Wayne Junior adopting Chris after Joel's death- adopts the heroic identity of \"Knightwing\".<ref>''Superman & Batman: Generations'' #3</ref>\n\nThe New 52 version of Earth-16 is visited in ''[[The Multiversity]]: The Just'' #1, where Chris Kent is Superman and his best friend is Damian Wayne, Batman, with Conner Kent as Superboy. Chris and his friends, including [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]], [[Kyle Rayner]], and [[Connor Hawke]], though they've inherited the superhero mantles of their parents and predecessors, are deeply bored as the world is effectively policed by [[Superman robot]]s, and many of the Justice League's villains were defeated by the previous generation of heroes. They resort to a celebrity lifestyle of partying and affairs, as well as occasional battle re-enactments, to pass the time.\n\n==In other media==\nAnother child of [[General Zod]] appeared in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[Benjamin Bratt]]. He is the genetically-engineered son of Zod and [[Lara Lor-Van]], who was rocketed to Earth as a child from the doomed planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] following [[Jor-El]]'s murder by Zod. Upon his arrival on Earth, he is named as '''Hernan Guerra''' and was raised by a family of honorable and hardworking [[Mexicans|Mexican]] migrant farmers. Having gone through the troubles that undocumented immigrants face in the United States, he has become short-tempered and withdrawn from humanity with a deep contempt and resentment for authority, but he grows to become that reality's version of [[Superman]] and leader of the [[Justice League]]. He is best friend of [[Kirk Langstrom]], that reality's [[Batman]], and appears to be in a relationship with [[Bekka]], that reality's [[Wonder Woman]], He is also willing to use lethal force against enemies and even plans to topple world governments and reorganize world leadership under the Justice League's rule. Due to his brutality he is generally feared by the public, is frequently criticized by [[Lois Lane]], and is resented by Lex Luthor, [[Amanda Waller]], and [[Steve Trevor]]. After a series of murders orchestrated by the secretly villainous [[Will Magnus]] to frame the Justice League, which the world easily believes due to Superman's past brutality, Superman gradually realizes the consequences of his brutality, especially after learning his father was responsible for Krypton's destruction. After the Justice League foils Magnus's plan to turn humanity into a hive minded species, Superman earns back public favor and considers using less brutality.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Superman characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kent, Chris}}\n[[Category:DC Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Kryptonians]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2006]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Geoff Johns]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toAlura(link changed toAlura (DC Comics)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Kent_(character)"}

As a representation of one of the first superheroes, it served as a template for character design decades after Superman's first appearance. The tradition of wearing a representative symbol on the chest was followed by many subsequent superheroes, including [[Batman]], [[Green Lantern]], [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Hawkman]], and many others.\n\nIn earlier Superman stories, the logo was simply an initial for \"Superman\", but in the 1978 movie, it became the family crest of the House of El, the family of Superman.\n\n==Evolution of the symbol==\nIn its original inception in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]], Superman's symbol was a letter ''[[S]]'' with red and blue on a yellow [[badge|police badge]] symbol that resembled a [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]].  The symbol was first changed a few issues later in ''Action Comics'' #7.  The shield varied over the first few years of the comics, and many times was nothing more than an inverted triangle with an ''S'' inside of it.<ref name=\"supermans-shop1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.supermans-shop.com/superman-logo-history.html |title=Emblem History |publisher=Supermans-shop.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503172250/http://www.supermans-shop.com/superman-logo-history.html |archivedate=2010-05-03 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"supermanhomepage1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/images/logos-emblems/va-tb.html |title=S Photo History |publisher=Supermanhomepage.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref>\n\nThe shield first became a [[diamond]] in the [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Fleischer cartoon serial ''Superman'']].  It was black with a red ''S'' outlined with white (or occasionally with yellow).  The ''S'' has varied in size and shape and the diamond shape containing it has also changed size and shape.  Extreme examples of this would be the very large logo on the [[Dean Cain]] costume from the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' and the comparatively small version of the shield as depicted in the [[2006 in film|2006]] film ''[[Superman Returns]]''.  It has, in most incarnations, retained its original color, while changing shape here and there.  The classic logo is the basis for virtually all other interpretations of the logo.<ref name=\"supermans-shop1\"/><ref name=\"supermanhomepage1\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1990s, when Superman's costume and powers changed briefly, during the \"[[Superman Red/Superman Blue]]\" comic book storylines, the shield changed colors and slightly changed shape, in accordance with the changes in the costume. In 1997's Superman Vol 2 #123 Superman's new powers forced him to find a suit that was capable of containing his new abilities. The effective material found to create Superman's suit, along with being blue and silver, was also courtesy of Lex Luthor. Not only did the colors and powers change, [http://images.halloweencostumes.com/infographics/superman-infographic-FULL.jpg the logo also evolved] into a re-imagined \"electric\" emblem. In the miniseries [[Kingdom Come (comic book)|''Kingdom Come'']], an aged Superman sported an ''S''-like symbol against a black background in a red pentagon.<ref name=\"supermans-shop1\"/><ref name=\"supermanhomepage1\"/>\n\nIn the 2000s TV series ''[[Smallville]]'', the ''S'' symbol originally appeared as a diamond with a vertical [[infinity symbol]] (to be similar to the ''S''), in an attempt to make it seem more alien.  However, beginning with the Season Six opening episode \"[[Zod (Smallville episode)|Zod]],\" Clark is given a crystal bearing the ''S'' logo in the style of the ''Superman Returns'' logo and is seen several times throughout the series and specifically in the season finale when a beam shaped like the logo hits a [[Phantom Zone]] [[Bizarro|escapee]].  The logo also appeared in the first episode of the series, when the students captured Clark by giving him a kryptonite necklace (which they didn't know was a weakness) and tied him to a cross-like beam in a cornfield and painted a red 'S' on Clark's chest (standing for Scarecrow, which was what he was meant to be as part of a high school hazing tradition) as a reference.<ref name=\"supermans-shop1\"/>\n\n==Representations==\nInitially, the S-shield had one meaning: ''S'' for Superman.  One of the first alternative meanings was presented in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'', in which it was not an ''S'', but rather the ''S''-shaped [[Coat of arms]] of the [[Superman dynasty|House of El]] as it was [[Marlon Brando|Brando]]'s idea to have Jor-El wear the \"S\" as a family crest, folklore spun off from there.  After the Superman reboot story ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'', the symbol's story was that it was designed by [[Jonathan \"Pa\" Kent|Jonathan Kent]] and was derived from an ancient Native American symbol. The symbol was featured on a medicine blanket given to an ancestor of the Kent family by a Native American tribe after he helped to cure them of a plague and was supposed to represent a snake, an animal held to possess healing powers by the tribe (implying that, by wearing this symbol, Superman was a metaphorical healer). This was also included in the 1997 Superman encyclopedia. In 2004, [[Mark Waid]]'s ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' series says the S-Shield is the [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] symbol for \"[[hope]]\" and Superman believes it may have begun as a coat of arms for the House of El. Later, writer Geoff Johns confirmed it was indeed a coat of arms, as well as a symbol for hope. In the 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', when asked by [[Lois Lane]] what the \"S\" stands for, Superman states that it is not an \"S\", but rather the Kryptonian symbol for \"hope\", and explaining that the design is based on a river in the 2017 film ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' (TV series, 2015) Season 1, episode 2 [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara]] states that the Kryptonian symbol stands for her family's motto, \"Stronger together.\"\n\n===House of El===\nMarv Wolfman's [[Superman Returns (novel)|novelization]] of the film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' depicts the symbol as belonging to one of the three primary houses of Krypton that brought peace to the planet after a civil uprising, a serpent coiled inside a shield, a warning not to return to the ways of violence and deception. The shield has since been taken as a coat of arms, resulting in Jor-El's continued presence in the council despite his \"mad\" findings.  The other two are merely described, including Pol-Us' eye of vigilance and Kol-Ar's open hand of truth and justice.\n\n===Cape===\nIn almost all versions, Superman's red cape has an all-yellow version of the logo, with a thin black (in the comics) or red (in movies, matching the red color of the cape) line separating the areas. A notable exception is in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', where the logo was absent from Superman's cape. This was due to the difficulty in animating the S on the flowing cape. In the 2006 film ''[[Superman Returns]]'', the logo appeared on the belt buckle in reverse colors (yellow diamond and S with red background pieces) instead of on Superman's cape. The logo is also absent from Superman's cape in the 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''. In the 2011 reboot of the comic book series, on his cape is a black pentagon and S with red background pieces.\n\n===Variants===\nIn the 1960s the tiny bottle city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], the miniaturized capital city of the planet Krypton, resided in Superman's [[Fortress of Solitude]]. Originally, certain inhabitants resembling [[Kal-El]] formed the [[Superman Emergency Squad]] and would, on occasion, leave the bottle, enter the Earth's atmosphere and gain super powers in order to aid Superman. As designed by artist [[Curt Swan]], their uniforms were similar to that of Superman save for the 'S' on their chests which resembled the early version, the 'S' and border in red on a yellow field, but in an elongated triangle.\n\nDuring the ''Reign of the Supermen'' story arc, Each of the four different Supermen was represented by a variant of the symbol, which each wore on their person. \n* [[Eradicator (comics)|The Last Son of Krypton (The Eradicator)]] wore a normal shield when he attempted to continue Superman's career. Later on, he wore a slightly altered, more curved version with an opening in the border and which was red and black instead of yellow and red.\n* [[Hank Henshaw|The Man of Tomorrow (The Cyborg)'s]] shield was half-normal on the left side, but the red darkened to an almost black color on the right half. \n* [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] wore an all-yellow symbol stitched into the back of his leather jacket, in addition to a normal one on his chest. \n* [[John Henry Irons|The Man of Steel]] wore an all-metallic symbol.\n\nOther variations include:\n*Black and red\n**[[Superboy (Kon-El)|The modern Superboy]] wears a black and red variant of the symbol on his third costume. [[Lex Luthor]] hypothesized it is because that version of the symbol was everywhere following the death of Superman and his consequent first appearance.<ref>''Teen Titans Annual'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>\n**In ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Superman wears a black and red, simplified version following his return.\n**After the [[Our Worlds at War|Imperiex War]], Superman wore the black and red variant to signify his mourning of the losses during the war.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]]|Title = [[Superman (vol. 2)|Superman]]|Volume = 2|Issue = 174|Date = August 2001|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n**The Eradicator, for a time, wore a red and blacked, curvier version of the S-Shield.\n*[[Bizarro]]'s symbol is a reversed purple and yellow version.\n*The inverted symbol, first seen in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', means \"resurrection\" in Kryptonian.\n*[[Jor-El]] sports a white symbol on his black clothing, as well as a black symbol on his white clothing in the 1978 [[Superman (1978 film)|''Superman'']] movie.\n*In his modern appearances, [[Kal-L|Superman of Earth-2]] wears a slightly different version of the symbol.  Its most notable difference is an exaggerated [[serif]] on the 'S'.\n*A variation of the symbol, designed as a stubbed red lightning bolt against a black shield has been used in several media, including an Elseworlds where Darkseid raised Kal-El, and was the basis of one of the final season of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', and an episode named ''Brave New Metropolis'' from an alternate reality where Superman and Luthor took over Metropolis.\n*A further variation, this time a white symbol against a red background, was used in episodes of ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', including an over the shoulder style cape and black costume.  This version was a fascistic Superman and his Justice Lords who assassinated President Lex Luthor and then ruled the world with an iron fist after Luthor arranged the murder of [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]].\n*Black and white\n**Superman briefly wore an all-black costume with a white shield following his resurrection at the conclusion of ''[[The Death of Superman]]''.\n**In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', an aged Superman wears a heavily stylised symbol, consisting of a white slash within an inverted black triangle, and a rhombus in the upper left corner. A similar symbol is worn by an adult [[Jonathan Samuel Kent]] in the alternate future depicted in ''[[The New 52: Futures End|Futures End]]''.\n**After being transported to the New 52 universe, the pre-Flashpoint Superman wore a black costume with an emblem resembling a white version of the ''Kingdom Come'' shield.\n*The symbol has been adapted to various flags in alternate realities, including the [[Nazi]] [[swastika]] (in [[JL-Axis]]) and [[Soviet Union]] [[hammer and sickle]] (''[[Superman: Red Son]]'').\n*In the movie ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'', and the Elseworlds story ''[[JSA: The Liberty Files]]'', the shield has black background pieces and a yellow outline, resembling the Fleischer Studios version.\n*In ''[[Superman: Earth One]]'', the shield has an additional yellow outline.\n*In ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', the emblem worn by the eponymous Supergirl has a blue background, with yellow outlines around the red S and border.\n\n===Wearers of the shield===\nKryptonian family members of Superman wear the symbol, but sometimes it is worn to honor Superman. After [[The Death of Superman|the death of Superman]], many [[DC Comics]] superheroes wore a black armband with the Superman logo.\n{{div col}}\n*Superman\n**[[Kal-El]]\n**[[Kal-L]] (variant)\n**[[Kal Kent]] (variant)\n*[[Supergirl]]\n**[[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]]\n**[[Linda Danvers]]\n**[[Matrix (comics)|Matrix]]\n*[[Superboy]]\n**[[Superboy (Kal-El)|Kal-El]] (Superman as a teenager; pre-1986)\n**[[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] (red and black variant)\n**[[Superboy-Prime]] (carves an S-symbol in blood on his chest).\n**[[Jonathan Samuel Kent]] (the new Superboy in [[DC Rebirth]], son of Superman and [[Lois Lane]])\n*[[Superwoman]]\n**[[Lucy Lane]] (white and red variant)\n*[[House of El]]\n**[[Jor-El]] (''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', ''[[Action Comics]]'' #850, [[Man of Steel (2013)|Man of Steel]])\n**Lar Gand ([[Mon-El]])\n**[[Zor-El]]\n*Others\n**[[Krypto]]  (shown as tag on his collar) \n**[[Bizarro]] (reversed 'S', sometimes purple and yellow)\n** The [[Superman Emergency Squad]] from [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], a red 'S' in an elongated triangle\n**[[Hank Henshaw]] (red and black variant, like Kon-El.

Along the edges are imprinted [[Kryptonian language|Kryptonian characters]], one of which is the diamond border of the Superman shield with a [[wikt:figure-of-eight|figure 8]] inside of the diamond instead of the S. The 8-shield is later described as being from an ancient form of the Kryptonian language, while the modern symbol is the familiar S-shield. The familiar S-shield is seen in [[Smallville (season 9)|season 9]]. It is used as [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent's]] calling card in his vigilante actions in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. Clark, known as the Blur, burns the sign using his heat vision in various places throughout the city. In the season 9 episode \"Rabid\", Clark mentions while talking to [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]] that the mark \"''gives people hope.''\"<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1468806/quotes Memorable quotes for \"Smallville\" Rabid (2009)].

Later on, he wore a slightly altered, more curved version with an opening in the border and which was red and black instead of yellow and red.\n* [[Hank Henshaw|The Man of Tomorrow (The Cyborg)'s]] shield was half-normal on the left side, but the red darkened to an almost black color on the right half. \n* [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] wore an all-yellow symbol stitched into the back of his leather jacket, in addition to a normal one on his chest. \n* [[John Henry Irons|The Man of Steel]] wore an all-metallic symbol.\n\nOther variations include:\n*Black and red\n**[[Superboy (Kon-El)|The modern Superboy]] wears a black and red variant of the symbol on his third costume. [[Lex Luthor]] hypothesized it is because that version of the symbol was everywhere following the death of Superman and his consequent first appearance.<ref>''Teen Titans Annual'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>\n**In ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Superman wears a black and red, simplified version following his return.\n**After the [[Our Worlds at War|Imperiex War]], Superman wore the black and red variant to signify his mourning of the losses during the war.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]]|Title = [[Superman (vol. 2)|Superman]]|Volume = 2|Issue = 174|Date = August 2001|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n**The Eradicator, for a time, wore a red and blacked, curvier version of the S-Shield.\n*[[Bizarro]]'s symbol is a reversed purple and yellow version.\n*The inverted symbol, first seen in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', means \"resurrection\" in Kryptonian.\n*[[Jor-El]] sports a white symbol on his black clothing, as well as a black symbol on his white clothing in the 1978 [[Superman (1978 film)|''Superman'']] movie.\n*In his modern appearances, [[Kal-L|Superman of Earth-2]] wears a slightly different version of the symbol.  Its most notable difference is an exaggerated [[serif]] on the 'S'.\n*A variation of the symbol, designed as a stubbed red lightning bolt against a black shield has been used in several media, including an Elseworlds where Darkseid raised Kal-El, and was the basis of one of the final season of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', and an episode named ''Brave New Metropolis'' from an alternate reality where Superman and Luthor took over Metropolis.\n*A further variation, this time a white symbol against a red background, was used in episodes of ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', including an over the shoulder style cape and black costume.  This version was a fascistic Superman and his Justice Lords who assassinated President Lex Luthor and then ruled the world with an iron fist after Luthor arranged the murder of [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]].\n*Black and white\n**Superman briefly wore an all-black costume with a white shield following his resurrection at the conclusion of ''[[The Death of Superman]]''.\n**In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', an aged Superman wears a heavily stylised symbol, consisting of a white slash within an inverted black triangle, and a rhombus in the upper left corner. A similar symbol is worn by an adult [[Jonathan Samuel Kent]] in the alternate future depicted in ''[[The New 52: Futures End|Futures End]]''.\n**After being transported to the New 52 universe, the pre-Flashpoint Superman wore a black costume with an emblem resembling a white version of the ''Kingdom Come'' shield.\n*The symbol has been adapted to various flags in alternate realities, including the [[Nazi]] [[swastika]] (in [[JL-Axis]]) and [[Soviet Union]] [[hammer and sickle]] (''[[Superman: Red Son]]'').\n*In the movie ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'', and the Elseworlds story ''[[JSA: The Liberty Files]]'', the shield has black background pieces and a yellow outline, resembling the Fleischer Studios version.\n*In ''[[Superman: Earth One]]'', the shield has an additional yellow outline.\n*In ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', the emblem worn by the eponymous Supergirl has a blue background, with yellow outlines around the red S and border.\n\n===Wearers of the shield===\nKryptonian family members of Superman wear the symbol, but sometimes it is worn to honor Superman.
