Both Koch and Pasteur played a role in improving antisepsis in medical treatment. This had an enormous positive effect on public health  and gave a better understanding of the body and diseases. In 1870-1885 the modern methods of bacteriology technique were introduced by the use of stains and by the method of separating mixtures of organisms on plates of nutrient media. Between 1880 and 1881 Pasteur produced two successful vaccinations for animals against diseases caused by bacteria and it was successful.

Originally called the '''Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade''' it was formed from [[Imperial Service Troops]] provided by the [[Indian Princely States]] of [https://www.jodhpurescortservices.com/jaipur-escorts-services-call-girls.html Hyderabad], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], [https://www.jodhpurescortservices.com/jaipur-escorts-services-call-girls.html Patiala], [https://www.jodhpurescortservices.com/jaipur-escorts-services-call-girls.html Alwar] and [https://www.jodhpurescortservices.com/jaipur-escorts-services-call-girls.html Jodhpur], which each provided a [[regiment]] of [[lancer]]s. A maximum of three regiments served in the brigade at any one time. The states of [[Bhavnagar State|Bhavnagar]], [[Kashmir]], [[Kathiawar]] and [[Idar State|Idar]] provided smaller detachments for the brigade, which was at times reinforced by other British Empire regiments and artillery batteries when on operations.\n\nIn October 1914, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was moved by sea to Egypt to become part of the [[Force in Egypt]] defending the [[Suez Canal]]. In the first three years of the war, the soldiers were involved in several small-scale battles connected to the [[First Suez Offensive]], but spent most of their time patrolling in the [[Sinai Desert]] and along the west bank of the canal. It was not until November 1917 as part of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] that the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was involved in the [[Third Battle of Gaza]]. The following year the brigade joined the [[5th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|5th Cavalry Division]] when it became the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade and played an active role in the British victory over Turkish<!--TURKISH IS USED BY SOURCES - ''not'' OTTOMAN --> forces in Palestine.\n\nIn total, eighty-four men from the brigade were killed in action or died of their wounds and another 123 were wounded. Several memorials were erected to commemorate the brigade in the Middle East and in India. The anniversary of the brigade's most famous victory, the [[Battle of Haifa (1918)|Battle of Haifa]], is still celebrated today by its successors in the [[Indian Army]].\n{{toclimit|3}}{{clear}}\n\n==Background==\n{{further information|List of Indian princely states}}\n\n[[File:Group of Imperial Service Troops.jpg|thumb|Imperial Service Troops circa 1908|alt=A painted illustration showing a group of men wearing various 19th Century military uniforms{{spaced ndash}}some wearing sand-coloured tunics, some red and some black.

The states' forces were recognised by the Indian Government and the [[British Indian Army]] as allies, and their troops were subject to the ''[[Indian Army Act]]'' when serving alongside the Indian Army.

In January 1915 the brigade was informed that a large Turkish force had moved into the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. The out-stations were reinforced and the squadron at Kantarah was involved in a small action at [[Bir El Dueidar]], between Kantarah and [[Battle of Katia|Katia]] which was the brigade's first involvement in combat. Towards the end of the month, several small battles occurred until the night of 2/3 February, when their Turkish opponents tried to cross the canal in force. The attempt failed and on 4 February the brigade moved into the Sinai with infantry in support.

In response the brigade crossed the canal that night supported by infantry and Egyptian artillery and advanced on [[El Hawawish]], where the Turkish were believed to be located.<ref name=hmso7/> By daybreak however their guide reported he was lost, so the brigade continued alone. Bypassing El Hawaish, they made for [[Bir Mahadat]], arriving at midday they discovered the Turkish were withdrawing to the north.

For the loss of two killed and eight wounded the brigade killed twenty Turkish soldiers and captured thirteen. At 20:00 on 29 April, the pursuit was called off and the brigade returned to Ferry Post on the canal.<ref name=hmso8>HMSO 1920, p.8</ref> Several times in the following months the brigade responded to reports of Turkish incursions, but nothing came of them until 23 November when a Mysore Lancers squadron located a Turkish camel force of about sixty men {{convert|15|mi|km|spell=in}} east of Kantarah. Pursued by the Lancers, the Turkish withdrew, during which the Lancers killed seven men, captured twelve and wounded several more.

The Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade concentrated on patrolling the Sweet Water Canal, the railway line between Suez and [[Port Said]], and the Suez Canal Zone to the west of the canal, which was a restricted area for non-military personnel. On 31 March, [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] W.A. Watson assumed command of the [[Nile Delta]] region and was replaced as brigade commander by Brigadier-General M.H. Henderson. In May 1916, the brigade was reduced to two cavalry regiments when the Patiala Lancers left for Mesopotamia.

The Mysore Lancers moved to Gebel-Geneffe, the Hyderabad Lancers to [[Ayun Musa]], with the brigade headquarters at [[El Shatt]].

The brigade marched the {{convert|150|mi}} in nine days, arrived on the 25 April and came under command of the [[Australian Mounted Division|Imperial Mounted Division]]. The division was the army reserve under orders to counter-attack the Turkish left flank. The expected attack never came, but instead of moving back to the canal, the brigade became [[lines of communication]] troops, based at Khan Yunis and [[Rafah]].<ref name=hmso10>HMSO 1920, pp.10\u201311</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=11 January 2013|publisher=Australian War Memorial|title=Imperial Mounted Division War Diary|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/1/56/awm4-1-56-2part7.pdf}}</ref> For the next three months, the brigade was deployed on rear area security and patrolling duties. In May 1917, the cavalry regiments received the [[Vickers machine-gun]] to replace their older [[Maxim Gun]]s and all ranks were put through training courses on the Vickers and a newer version of the Lee\u2013Enfield Rifle, which had also just been issued. In September, the cavalry regiments' pack horses started to be replaced by horse-drawn wagons and each of the regiments was issued with twelve [[Hotchkiss M1909 Ben\u00e9t\u2013Merci\u00e9 machine gun|Hotchkiss machine-guns]]; one per troop.<ref name=hmso13>HMSO 1920, p.13</ref>\n\n====Third battle of Gaza====\n{{further information|Third Battle of Gaza}}\n\nOn 27 September, the brigade was once again moved to the front line and given responsibility for patrolling the area between the [[Desert Mounted Corps]] and the [[XXI Corps (United Kingdom)|XXI Corps]],<ref name=hmso13/> taking under command the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment on 20 October.<ref name=hmso14/> At the time the brigade was the only mounted formation not under the direct command of the Desert Mounted Corps, remaining Army Troops.<ref name=\"Preston\" /> The next British attack was the capture of Gaza in November 1917; the plan was for the infantry to capture their initial objectives, then the brigade would be released to advance along the Mediterranean coastline, turn right and attack the Turkish rear and their headquarters at [[Nazla|Nuzzle]]. When the battle started, the British infantry captured all but one of their objectives, but as the brigade started to move out, a Turkish counter-attack regained their previous positions, so the brigade's advance was called off.<ref name=hmso14>HMSO 1920, p.14</ref> However, by the night of 6/7 November, continued British attacks forced the Turkish to withdraw from Gaza and the brigade was ordered forward to pursue them. By 13:00 the brigade was north of Gaza when the Mysore Lancers' leading squadron located the Turkish rearguard, which included a heavy machine-gun position. At 15:00 the Hyderabad Lancers and the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment attacked [[Beit Hanun]], while the rest of the brigade attacked [[Beit Lahi]]. As the Hyderabad Lancers approached their objective, they came under a heavy artillery bombardment. Leaving one squadron and their machine-guns behind to provide fire support, the rest of the Lancers attacked, capturing the Wadi Safieh line. The Lancers, still under artillery fire, held out until 16:30, when they were ordered to withdraw and rejoin the rest of the brigade now concentrated at Beit Lahi.<ref>HMSO 1920, pp.14\u201315</ref>\n\nThe brigade now came under command of XXI Corps and at 01:45 on 8 November was ordered to move west of Beit Hanun and link up with the Australian Mounted Division, which was advancing from the east. As they moved to the east of Beit Hanun, the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment, which was still attached to the brigade, came under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire, preventing the brigade from advancing further. The Turkish bombardment continued until 12:20, when they were observed withdrawing. The XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment and Mysore Lancers were ordered to encircle and cut off their retreat, however dug in Turkish positions at the Wadi Hesi once again halted the brigade advance. At 15:00 that day the brigade eventually made contact with the [[4th Light Horse Brigade]], completing the link up with the Australian Mounted Division.<ref>HMSO 1920, p.16</ref><ref>Preston 1921, p.52</ref>\n\nThe morning of 9 November was spent trying to water the horses, some of which had had no water for over twenty-four hours, so the brigade did not move after the now retreating Turkish until after 11:20. Moving at their best speed, the brigade reached the high ground east of [[El Medjel]] by 14:30, capturing two artillery guns, rifles and ammunition en route. Two troops were sent forward to locate the Turkish rearguard, which they found at 16:30 crossing the plain at [[El Tine]]. Early the next morning, patrols were again sent to locate the Turkish forces but at 07:00, the brigade was unexpectedly ordered back to Gaza. Despite the heavy fire the brigade had been subjected to, their casualties during the battle were light; only four officers and ten other ranks had been wounded, sixteen horses killed and another fifty wounded. The Turkish casualties were estimated at 100 dead; forty-nine were taken prisoner and five artillery guns were captured.<ref>HMSO 1920, p.17</ref>\n\n===1918===\n{{further information|Raid on Es Salt|Occupation of the Jordan Valley}}\n\n[[File:Photo of a Mysore Lancer during Charge at Haritan 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Mysore Lancers [[sowar]] and horse; note the method of carrying small arms ammunition in a [[bandolier]] on the man and around the horse's neck.|alt=In a black and white photograph, a man wearing a turban and light-coloured tunic sits astride a dark-coloured horse facing left and holds a bayonet in his right hand.

On 2 April, the Hyderabad Lancers were detached from the brigade, coming under the command of the [[ANZAC Mounted Division]], then the Desert Mounted Corps and finally the [[60th (2/2nd London) Division|60th Division]]. The rest of the brigade moved to the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], arriving at [[Jericho]] on 29 April.<ref name=hmso18>HMSO 1920, p.18</ref> The next day the brigade was designated the Desert Mounted Corps reserve and concentrated {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} to the west of the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead over the [[River Jordan]].<ref>HMSO 1920, p.19</ref> On the final day of the raid on Es Salt, on 4 May, the brigade, with the New Zealand [[Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment]] attached, was ordered to cross the Jordan and form a defensive screen on the east bank to cover the withdrawal of the ANZAC Division. They remained in place until 5 May, when the ANZAC Division reached and crossed the Jordan safely at 16:00. The brigade, less some patrols, was back within the bridgehead by 18:00. In the following twelve days, the brigade patrolled to the east of the River Jordan, resulting in numerous contacts with the Turkish defenders, during which several prisoners and deserters were captured. On 11 May, the Jodhpur Lancers were assigned to the brigade and the Wellington Mounted Rifles returned to the command of their parent [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade]]. On 23 May, the brigade came under command of the Australian Mounted Division and moved to a position {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} north of Jericho, remaining with the Australians until 4 June, when they left for [[Ras Dieran]], becoming part of the newly raised [[5th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|2nd Mounted Division]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=10 January 2013|publisher=Australian War Museum|title=Australian Mounted Division War Diary|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/1/58/awm4-1-58-11.pdf}}</ref><ref name=hmso20/> For almost a month the brigade was involved in training and staff exercises, during which time the brigade machine-gun squadron was formed.

Accumulatively, the day's fighting resulted in over 100 Turkish dead and seventy prisoners taken, twenty of them wounded, from the 9th and 11th Cavalry Regiments. The brigade's casualties were twenty-five dead, seven wounded and six missing.<ref>HMSO 1920, pp.22\u201323</ref> For their part in the battles the Jodhpur Lancers were mentioned in army despatches.<ref>{{London Gazette|date=5 November 1918|issue=30994|supp=y|page=13109}}</ref> On 24 July, the 2nd Mounted Division was renamed 5th Cavalry Division and the brigade became the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade.<ref>Preston 1920, p.154</ref><ref name=hmso24/> In early August, the brigade carried out several patrols, crossing the bridgehead and into the Jordan Valley until 4 August, the Turkish were found to have withdrawn overnight. A small Turkish force returned on 15 August but withdrew before the brigade could move up and engage them. The brigade remained in the area until the night of the 17/18 August, when they were  relieved by the [[10th Cavalry Brigade (British Indian Army)|10th Cavalry Brigade]] from the [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th Cavalry Division]].<ref name=hmso24>HMSO 1920, p.24</ref>\n\n====Haifa====\n{{further information|Battle of Haifa (1918)}}\n[[File:Indian lancers in Haifa 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Men from the brigade at [[Haifa]] after its capture|alt=In a black and white photograph, a large group of turbaned men on horseback ride through a dusty, sunlit street and into the distance, obscured by dust.

The Hyderabad Lancers were detached from the brigade on 22 September to escort 12,000 prisoners to [[Kerkur]], and on 23 September, [[B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company]] was attached to the brigade for the forthcoming operations.<ref name=hmso25>HMSO 1920, p.25</ref> At 03:00 on 23 September, the brigade leading the 5th Cavalry Division left [[Afule]] for [[Haifa]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].<ref>Preston 1921, p. 232</ref> The advance was unopposed until 10:00 that day when the Mysore Lancers reached the village of [[Beled Esh Sheikh]] where the leading squadron was shelled from [[Mount Carmel]] and came under small-arms fire from the region of the village. The Turkish had four artillery guns on the heights overlooking the brigade's line of approach and another six to the east of Haifa, supported by machine-gun posts and infantry to the west of the main Haifa road.<ref name=hmso25/>\n\nThe brigade deployed its forces, with one squadron from the Mysore Lancers supported by two machine-guns to capture Mount Carmel.<ref>Preston 1921, p. 234</ref> A second Mysore squadron would cover the main road while the remainder of the regiment with two machine-guns would advance along the Acre railway line. The Jodhpur Lancers would deploy in the open and wait further orders, while brigade headquarters and the remainder of the machine-gun squadron and the artillery battery would be to the north of Beled Esh Sheikh. When in position, the Jodhpur Lancers\u2014supported by covering fire from the artillery\u2014and the Mysore Lancers would charge the guns. At 11:45 the [[Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry]] caught up with the brigade and one squadron was detached to support the Mysore Lancers on Mount Carmel. The attack was scheduled to start at 14:00 but before that, the artillery battery and reconnaissance patrols sent out to look for the Turkish positions kept up suppressing fire on them, to which the Turkish responded with counter-battery fire. The attack commenced on time; the Jodhpur Lancers advanced in squadron columns in the face of heavy Turkish rifle and machine-gun fire.<ref name=hmso26>HMSO 1920, p. 26</ref>\n\nThe Lancers charged towards the railway line, but the terrain forced them to move to their left into a [[wadi]], which was impassable and forced the Lancers even further left. The leading squadron crossed the railway line, captured the machine-gun positions and cleared the way for the remainder of the regiment to charge into the town. At the same time the regiment's second squadron had moved right, capturing three artillery guns and two machine-guns, while the two remaining squadrons charged through the town virtually unopposed, facing only sporadic rifle fire. As they reached the other side of the town they were soon joined by the two other squadrons which had made their way around the outskirts, capturing another two artillery guns en route. Elsewhere, one of the Mysore Lancers squadrons that had been giving covering fire came under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire from the mouth of the [[River Nahr el Mukutta]]. The squadron mounted and charged the Turkish positions, capturing two artillery guns, two machine-guns and 110 prisoners. With the town secure the Mysore squadron on Mount Carmel charged a Turkish position at [[Karmelheim]], capturing a 6-inch naval gun, two mountain artillery guns, two machine-guns and seventy-eight prisoners. During the charge they were joined by a squadron from the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, who captured another fifty prisoners. Prisoners taken inside the town were two German officers, twenty-three Turkish officers and 664 other ranks. Two 6-inch naval guns, four 4.2-inch guns, six 77&nbsp;mm guns, four 10-pound camel guns, ten machine-guns and a large quantity of ammunition were captured in Haifa. The brigade's own casualties were relatively light; one Indian officer and two other ranks were killed, and six Indian officers and twenty-eight other ranks were wounded. Sixty horses were killed and eighty-three were wounded.<ref>HMSO 1920, pp. 26\u201327</ref><ref>Preston 1921, pp. 234\u2013236</ref>\n\n====Advance to Homs====\n\nThe brigade rested for the next two days and was rejoined by the Hyderabad Lancers on 25 September. At 05:00 the next day they resumed the advance, arriving at [[Lake Tiberias]] (Sea of Galilee) at 11:00 on 27 September. After watering the horses the brigade advanced again, reaching [[Kasr Atra]] at 22:30, where they halted for the night. They were to start again early the next day, but had to wait as the Australian Mounted Division to their right had been stopped by the Turkish forces and at 11:00 the brigade resumed their advance. Because of the delay, they did not reach [[El Kuneitra]] until midnight on 28/29 September. The next day the brigade was designated as the Desert Mounted Corps reserve, responsible for guarding their own and the Australian Mounted Division's transport columns. During the day, the two divisions were held up for fourteen hours by a small, well-placed Turkish detachment. On 30 September the brigade was ordered to head for [[Kiswe]] to round up Turkish stragglers from the [[Ottoman Fourth Army]]. By 09:30 on 1 October, the brigade was {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} to the north of Kiswe but were then ordered to move to a new position {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} east of [[Damascus]], where they were to be the division reserve, while the [[14th Cavalry Brigade (British Indian Army)|14th Cavalry Brigade]] was made responsible for the [[Charge at Kiswe|capture of Kiswe]].<ref>HMSO 1920, p.28</ref><ref>Preston 1921, p.273</ref>\n\nThe next day, 2 October, was the day that British Empire forces officially entered Damascus. This was marked by a short period of rest for the British forces and the brigade advance did not resume until 05:30 on 5 October. Their first objective was [[Khan Meizelun]] then [[Moallaka]] which they reached unopposed on 6 October. The next day [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Hyla Holden, a SSO with the Jodhpur Lancers, became the first [[Allies of World War One|Allied]] officer to enter [[Beirut]], the [[Arab Revolt]] forces commanded by [[Sherif Hussein bin Ali]] arrived that same afternoon and assumed control of the local government. The brigade continued their advance capturing several villages in the following days. [[Tell Esh Sherif]] on 11 October, [[Baalbek]] on 13 October, [[Lebwe]] on 14 October, [[El Kaa]] on 15 October, [[Kusseir]] on 16 October and [[Homs]] was reached at midday 17 October.<ref name=hmso29>HMSO 1920, pp.28\u201329</ref>\n\n====Haritan====\n{{further information|Pursuit to Haritan|Charge at Haritan}}\n\nAt Homs, the brigade rested for two days and on 19 October headed for [[Er Rastan]], with orders to repair a bridge over the [[River Orontes]], which had been destroyed by retreating Turkish forces.<ref>Preston 1921, p.288</ref> The next day, assisted by No. 5 Field Squadron [[Royal Engineers]], was spent repairing the bridge, after which the brigade advanced, reaching [[Hama]] on 21 October. The brigade had expected to rest there for several days but were ordered to continue the advance to [[Aleppo]]. The brigade was preceded by seven light [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], but the remainder of the division was following a day behind. On 24 October the armoured cars' advance was stopped by Turkish defences near [[Khan Tuman]]. The Turkish held a strong defensive line on a ridge line to the south and west of Aleppo. The brigade was ordered to occupy a position on the Aleppo-[[Alexandretta]] road and to clear Turkish trenches on the ridge to the west of Aleppo, but when they reached the ridge line on 26 October, the position had been evacuated.<ref name=hmso29/> Intelligence from locals suggested that a force of 1,000 men with two small artillery guns were heading north out of Aleppo, so the brigade set off in pursuit.<ref>Preston 1921, p.291</ref> At 11:00, the leading two Jodhpur Lancers squadrons and a machine-gun section reached a position overlooking [[Haritan]] to the north of Aleppo when they came under Turkish small arms fire. Harbord ordered an immediate brigade attack; the Mysore Lancers would move around to the east of the ridge and charge the village, followed by the other two Jodhpur Lancer squadrons while the remainder of the brigade machine-gun squadron would move onto the ridge to provide covering fire, with the two other Jodhpur squadrons.

Originally called the '''Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade''' it was formed from [[Imperial Service Troops]] provided by the [[Indian Princely States]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], [[Patiala State|Patiala]], [[Alwar State|Alwar]] and [[Jodhpur]], which each provided a [[regiment]] of [[lancer]]s. A maximum of three regiments served in the brigade at any one time. The states of [[Bhavnagar State|Bhavnagar]], [[Kashmir]], [[Kathiawar]] and [[Idar State|Idar]] provided smaller detachments for the brigade, which was at times reinforced by other British Empire regiments and artillery batteries when on operations.\n\nIn October 1914, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was moved by sea to Egypt to become part of the [[Force in Egypt]] defending the [[Suez Canal]]. In the first three years of the war, the soldiers were involved in several small-scale battles connected to the [[First Suez Offensive]], but spent most of their time patrolling in the [[Sinai Desert]] and along the west bank of the canal. It was not until November 1917 as part of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] that the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was involved in the [[Third Battle of Gaza]]. The following year the brigade joined the [[5th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|5th Cavalry Division]] when it became the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade and played an active role in the British victory over Turkish<!--TURKISH IS USED BY SOURCES - ''not'' OTTOMAN --> forces in Palestine.\n\nIn total, eighty-four men from the brigade were killed in action or died of their wounds and another 123 were wounded. Several memorials were erected to commemorate the brigade in the Middle East and in India. The anniversary of the brigade's most famous victory, the [[Battle of Haifa (1918)|Battle of Haifa]], is still celebrated today by its successors in the [[Indian Army]].\n{{toclimit|3}}{{clear}}\n\n==Background==\n{{further information|List of Indian princely states}}\n\n[[File:Group of Imperial Service Troops.jpg|thumb|Imperial Service Troops circa 1908|alt=A painted illustration showing a group of men wearing various 19th Century military uniforms{{spaced ndash}}some wearing sand-coloured tunics, some red and some black.

The states' forces were recognised by the Indian Government and the [[British Indian Army]] as allies, and their troops were subject to the ''[[Indian Army Act]]'' when serving alongside the Indian Army.

In January 1915 the brigade was informed that a large Turkish force had moved into the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. The out-stations were reinforced and the squadron at Kantarah was involved in a small action at [[Bir El Dueidar]], between Kantarah and [[Battle of Katia|Katia]] which was the brigade's first involvement in combat. Towards the end of the month, several small battles occurred until the night of 2/3 February, when their Turkish opponents tried to cross the canal in force. The attempt failed and on 4 February the brigade moved into the Sinai with infantry in support.

In response the brigade crossed the canal that night supported by infantry and Egyptian artillery and advanced on [[El Hawawish]], where the Turkish were believed to be located.<ref name=hmso7/> By daybreak however their guide reported he was lost, so the brigade continued alone. Bypassing El Hawaish, they made for [[Bir Mahadat]], arriving at midday they discovered the Turkish were withdrawing to the north.

On 31 March, [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] W.A. Watson assumed command of the [[Nile Delta]] region and was replaced as brigade commander by Brigadier-General M.H. Henderson.

The expected attack never came, but instead of moving back to the canal, the brigade became [[lines of communication]] troops, based at Khan Yunis and [[Rafah]].<ref name=hmso10>HMSO 1920, pp.10\u201311</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=11 January 2013|publisher=Australian War Memorial|title=Imperial Mounted Division War Diary|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/1/56/awm4-1-56-2part7.pdf}}</ref> For the next three months, the brigade was deployed on rear area security and patrolling duties. In May 1917, the cavalry regiments received the [[Vickers machine-gun]] to replace their older [[Maxim Gun]]s and all ranks were put through training courses on the Vickers and a newer version of the [[Lee\u2013Enfield Rifle]], which had also just been issued. In September, the cavalry regiments' pack horses started to be replaced by horse-drawn wagons and each of the regiments was issued with twelve [[Hotchkiss M1909 Ben\u00e9t\u2013Merci\u00e9 machine gun|Hotchkiss machine-guns]]; one per troop.<ref name=hmso13>HMSO 1920, p.13</ref>\n\n====Third battle of Gaza====\n{{further information|Third Battle of Gaza}}\n\nOn 27 September, the brigade was once again moved to the front line and given responsibility for patrolling the area between the [[Desert Mounted Corps]] and the [[XXI Corps (United Kingdom)|XXI Corps]],<ref name=hmso13/> taking under command the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment on 20 October.<ref name=hmso14/> At the time the brigade was the only mounted formation not under the direct command of the Desert Mounted Corps, remaining Army Troops.<ref name=\"Preston\" /> The next British attack was the capture of Gaza in November 1917; the plan was for the infantry to capture their initial objectives, then the brigade would be released to advance along the Mediterranean coastline, turn right and attack the Turkish rear and their headquarters at [[Nazla|Nuzzle]]. When the battle started, the British infantry captured all but one of their objectives, but as the brigade started to move out, a Turkish counter-attack regained their previous positions, so the brigade's advance was called off.<ref name=hmso14>HMSO 1920, p.14</ref> However, by the night of 6/7 November, continued British attacks forced the Turkish to withdraw from Gaza and the brigade was ordered forward to pursue them. By 13:00 the brigade was north of Gaza when the Mysore Lancers' leading squadron located the Turkish rearguard, which included a heavy machine-gun position. At 15:00 the Hyderabad Lancers and the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment attacked [[Beit Hanun]], while the rest of the brigade attacked [[Beit Lahi]]. As the Hyderabad Lancers approached their objective, they came under a heavy artillery bombardment. Leaving one squadron and their machine-guns behind to provide fire support, the rest of the Lancers attacked, capturing the Wadi Safieh line. The Lancers, still under artillery fire, held out until 16:30, when they were ordered to withdraw and rejoin the rest of the brigade now concentrated at Beit Lahi.<ref>HMSO 1920, pp.14\u201315</ref>\n\nThe brigade now came under command of XXI Corps and at 01:45 on 8 November was ordered to move west of Beit Hanun and link up with the Australian Mounted Division, which was advancing from the east. As they moved to the east of Beit Hanun, the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment, which was still attached to the brigade, came under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire, preventing the brigade from advancing further. The Turkish bombardment continued until 12:20, when they were observed withdrawing. The XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment and Mysore Lancers were ordered to encircle and cut off their retreat, however dug in Turkish positions at the Wadi Hesi once again halted the brigade advance. At 15:00 that day the brigade eventually made contact with the [[4th Light Horse Brigade]], completing the link up with the Australian Mounted Division.<ref>HMSO 1920, p.16</ref><ref>Preston 1921, p.52</ref>\n\nThe morning of 9 November was spent trying to water the horses, some of which had had no water for over twenty-four hours, so the brigade did not move after the now retreating Turkish until after 11:20. Moving at their best speed, the brigade reached the high ground east of [[El Medjel]] by 14:30, capturing two artillery guns, rifles and ammunition en route. Two troops were sent forward to locate the Turkish rearguard, which they found at 16:30 crossing the plain at [[El Tine]]. Early the next morning, patrols were again sent to locate the Turkish forces but at 07:00, the brigade was unexpectedly ordered back to Gaza. Despite the heavy fire the brigade had been subjected to, their casualties during the battle were light; only four officers and ten other ranks had been wounded, sixteen horses killed and another fifty wounded. The Turkish casualties were estimated at 100 dead; forty-nine were taken prisoner and five artillery guns were captured.<ref>HMSO 1920, p.17</ref>\n\n===1918===\n{{further information|Raid on Es Salt|Occupation of the Jordan Valley}}\n\n[[File:Photo of a Mysore Lancer during Charge at Haritan 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Mysore Lancers [[sowar]] and horse; note the method of carrying small arms ammunition in a [[bandolier]] on the man and around the horse's neck.|alt=In a black and white photograph, a man wearing a turban and light-coloured tunic sits astride a dark-coloured horse facing left and holds a bayonet in his right hand.

On 2 April, the Hyderabad Lancers were detached from the brigade, coming under the command of the [[ANZAC Mounted Division]], then the Desert Mounted Corps and finally the [[60th (2/2nd London) Division|60th Division]]. The rest of the brigade moved to the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], arriving at [[Jericho]] on 29 April.<ref name=hmso18>HMSO 1920, p.18</ref> The next day the brigade was designated the Desert Mounted Corps reserve and concentrated {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} to the west of the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead over the [[River Jordan]].<ref>HMSO 1920, p.19</ref> On the final day of the raid on Es Salt, on 4 May, the brigade, with the New Zealand [[Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment]] attached, was ordered to cross the Jordan and form a defensive screen on the east bank to cover the withdrawal of the ANZAC Division. They remained in place until 5 May, when the ANZAC Division reached and crossed the Jordan safely at 16:00. The brigade, less some patrols, was back within the bridgehead by 18:00. In the following twelve days, the brigade patrolled to the east of the River Jordan, resulting in numerous contacts with the Turkish defenders, during which several prisoners and deserters were captured. On 11 May, the Jodhpur Lancers were assigned to the brigade and the Wellington Mounted Rifles returned to the command of their parent [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade]]. On 23 May, the brigade came under command of the Australian Mounted Division and moved to a position {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} north of Jericho, remaining with the Australians until 4 June, when they left for [[Ras Dieran]], becoming part of the newly raised [[5th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|2nd Mounted Division]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=10 January 2013|publisher=Australian War Museum|title=Australian Mounted Division War Diary|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/1/58/awm4-1-58-11.pdf}}</ref><ref name=hmso20/> For almost a month the brigade was involved in training and staff exercises, during which time the brigade machine-gun squadron was formed. On 5 July, the brigade left for the Jordan Valley to resume their place in the front line.<ref name=hmso20>HMSO 1920, pp.20\u201321</ref>\n\nOn 14 July, the brigade's squadrons were involved in several small battles in the [[Battle of Abu Tellul|Hajlah, Henu and Abu Tellul bridgehead area]], which included a charge by the Jodhpur Lancers on the Turkish positions followed by a separate charge by a squadron of Mysore Lancers on those retreating from the Jodhpur's action. Accumulatively, the day's fighting resulted in over 100 Turkish dead and seventy prisoners taken, twenty of them wounded, from the 9th and 11th Cavalry Regiments. The brigade's casualties were twenty-five dead, seven wounded and six missing.<ref>HMSO 1920, pp.22\u201323</ref> For their part in the battles the Jodhpur Lancers were mentioned in army despatches.<ref>{{London Gazette|date=5 November 1918|issue=30994|supp=y|page=13109}}</ref> On 24 July, the 2nd Mounted Division was renamed 5th Cavalry Division and the brigade became the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade.<ref>Preston 1920, p.154</ref><ref name=hmso24/> In early August, the brigade carried out several patrols, crossing the bridgehead and into the Jordan Valley until 4 August, the Turkish were found to have withdrawn overnight. A small Turkish force returned on 15 August but withdrew before the brigade could move up and engage them. The brigade remained in the area until the night of the 17/18 August, when they were  relieved by the [[10th Cavalry Brigade (British Indian Army)|10th Cavalry Brigade]] from the [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th Cavalry Division]].<ref name=hmso24>HMSO 1920, p.24</ref>\n\n====Haifa====\n{{further information|Battle of Haifa (1918)}}\n[[File:Indian lancers in Haifa 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Men from the brigade at [[Haifa]] after its capture|alt=In a black and white photograph, a large group of turbaned men on horseback ride through a dusty, sunlit street and into the distance, obscured by dust.

The Hyderabad Lancers were detached from the brigade on 22 September to escort 12,000 prisoners to [[Kerkur]], and on 23 September, [[B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company]] was attached to the brigade for the forthcoming operations.<ref name=hmso25>HMSO 1920, p.25</ref> At 03:00 on 23 September, the brigade leading the 5th Cavalry Division left [[Afule]] for [[Haifa]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].<ref>Preston 1921, p. 232</ref> The advance was unopposed until 10:00 that day when the Mysore Lancers reached the village of [[Beled Esh Sheikh]] where the leading squadron was shelled from [[Mount Carmel]] and came under small-arms fire from the region of the village. The Turkish had four artillery guns on the heights overlooking the brigade's line of approach and another six to the east of Haifa, supported by machine-gun posts and infantry to the west of the main Haifa road.<ref name=hmso25/>\n\nThe brigade deployed its forces, with one squadron from the Mysore Lancers supported by two machine-guns to capture Mount Carmel.<ref>Preston 1921, p. 234</ref> A second Mysore squadron would cover the main road while the remainder of the regiment with two machine-guns would advance along the Acre railway line. The Jodhpur Lancers would deploy in the open and wait further orders, while brigade headquarters and the remainder of the machine-gun squadron and the artillery battery would be to the north of Beled Esh Sheikh. When in position, the Jodhpur Lancers\u2014supported by covering fire from the artillery\u2014and the Mysore Lancers would charge the guns. At 11:45 the [[Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry]] caught up with the brigade and one squadron was detached to support the Mysore Lancers on Mount Carmel. The attack was scheduled to start at 14:00 but before that, the artillery battery and reconnaissance patrols sent out to look for the Turkish positions kept up suppressing fire on them, to which the Turkish responded with counter-battery fire. The attack commenced on time; the Jodhpur Lancers advanced in squadron columns in the face of heavy Turkish rifle and machine-gun fire.<ref name=hmso26>HMSO 1920, p. 26</ref>\n\nThe Lancers charged towards the railway line, but the terrain forced them to move to their left into a [[wadi]], which was impassable and forced the Lancers even further left. The leading squadron crossed the railway line, captured the machine-gun positions and cleared the way for the remainder of the regiment to charge into the town. At the same time the regiment's second squadron had moved right, capturing three artillery guns and two machine-guns, while the two remaining squadrons charged through the town virtually unopposed, facing only sporadic rifle fire. As they reached the other side of the town they were soon joined by the two other squadrons which had made their way around the outskirts, capturing another two artillery guns en route. Elsewhere, one of the Mysore Lancers squadrons that had been giving covering fire came under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire from the mouth of the [[River Nahr el Mukutta]]. The squadron mounted and charged the Turkish positions, capturing two artillery guns, two machine-guns and 110 prisoners. With the town secure the Mysore squadron on Mount Carmel charged a Turkish position at [[Karmelheim]], capturing a 6-inch naval gun, two mountain artillery guns, two machine-guns and seventy-eight prisoners. During the charge they were joined by a squadron from the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, who captured another fifty prisoners. Prisoners taken inside the town were two German officers, twenty-three Turkish officers and 664 other ranks. Two 6-inch naval guns, four 4.2-inch guns, six 77&nbsp;mm guns, four 10-pound camel guns, ten machine-guns and a large quantity of ammunition were captured in Haifa. The brigade's own casualties were relatively light; one Indian officer and two other ranks were killed, and six Indian officers and twenty-eight other ranks were wounded. Sixty horses were killed and eighty-three were wounded.<ref>HMSO 1920, pp. 26\u201327</ref><ref>Preston 1921, pp. 234\u2013236</ref>\n\n====Advance to Homs====\n\nThe brigade rested for the next two days and was rejoined by the Hyderabad Lancers on 25 September. At 05:00 the next day they resumed the advance, arriving at [[Lake Tiberias]] (Sea of Galilee) at 11:00 on 27 September. After watering the horses the brigade advanced again, reaching [[Kasr Atra]] at 22:30, where they halted for the night. They were to start again early the next day, but had to wait as the Australian Mounted Division to their right had been stopped by the Turkish forces and at 11:00 the brigade resumed their advance. Because of the delay, they did not reach [[El Kuneitra]] until midnight on 28/29 September. The next day the brigade was designated as the Desert Mounted Corps reserve, responsible for guarding their own and the Australian Mounted Division's transport columns. During the day, the two divisions were held up for fourteen hours by a small, well-placed Turkish detachment. On 30 September the brigade was ordered to head for [[Kiswe]] to round up Turkish stragglers from the [[Ottoman Fourth Army]]. By 09:30 on 1 October, the brigade was {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} to the north of Kiswe but were then ordered to move to a new position {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} east of [[Damascus]], where they were to be the division reserve, while the [[14th Cavalry Brigade (British Indian Army)|14th Cavalry Brigade]] was made responsible for the [[Charge at Kiswe|capture of Kiswe]].<ref>HMSO 1920, p.28</ref><ref>Preston 1921, p.273</ref>\n\nThe next day, 2 October, was the day that British Empire forces officially entered Damascus. This was marked by a short period of rest for the British forces and the brigade advance did not resume until 05:30 on 5 October. Their first objective was [[Khan Meizelun]] then [[Moallaka]] which they reached unopposed on 6 October. The next day [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Hyla Holden, a SSO with the Jodhpur Lancers, became the first [[Allies of World War One|Allied]] officer to enter [[Beirut]], the [[Arab Revolt]] forces commanded by [[Sherif Hussein bin Ali]] arrived that same afternoon and assumed control of the local government. The brigade continued their advance capturing several villages in the following days. [[Tell Esh Sherif]] on 11 October, [[Baalbek]] on 13 October, [[Lebwe]] on 14 October, [[El Kaa]] on 15 October, [[Kusseir]] on 16 October and [[Homs]] was reached at midday 17 October.<ref name=hmso29>HMSO 1920, pp.28\u201329</ref>\n\n====Haritan====\n{{further information|Pursuit to Haritan|Charge at Haritan}}\n\nAt Homs, the brigade rested for two days and on 19 October headed for [[Er Rastan]], with orders to repair a bridge over the [[River Orontes]], which had been destroyed by retreating Turkish forces.<ref>Preston 1921, p.288</ref> The next day, assisted by No. 5 Field Squadron [[Royal Engineers]], was spent repairing the bridge, after which the brigade advanced, reaching [[Hama]] on 21 October. The brigade had expected to rest there for several days but were ordered to continue the advance to [[Aleppo]]. The brigade was preceded by seven light [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], but the remainder of the division was following a day behind. On 24 October the armoured cars' advance was stopped by Turkish defences near [[Khan Tuman]]. The Turkish held a strong defensive line on a ridge line to the south and west of Aleppo. The brigade was ordered to occupy a position on the Aleppo-[[Alexandretta]] road and to clear Turkish trenches on the ridge to the west of Aleppo, but when they reached the ridge line on 26 October, the position had been evacuated.<ref name=hmso29/> Intelligence from locals suggested that a force of 1,000 men with two small artillery guns were heading north out of Aleppo, so the brigade set off in pursuit.<ref>Preston 1921, p.291</ref> At 11:00, the leading two Jodhpur Lancers squadrons and a machine-gun section reached a position overlooking [[Haritan]] to the north of Aleppo when they came under Turkish small arms fire. Harbord ordered an immediate brigade attack; the Mysore Lancers would move around to the east of the ridge and charge the village, followed by the other two Jodhpur Lancer squadrons while the remainder of the brigade machine-gun squadron would move onto the ridge to provide covering fire, with the two other Jodhpur squadrons. The armoured cars of [[Machine Gun Corps|No. 12 Light Armoured Motor Battery]] arrived at 11:30 and were ordered along the main road to support the attack.<ref name=hmso30/>\n\n[[File:Indian lancer 1918 near Aleppo.jpg|thumb|Indian lancer near [[Aleppo]] in 1918|alt=In a black and white photograph, a man wearing a turban and military uniform sits astride a stationary, dark-coloured horse, facing left.

At 12:00 the Lancers charged the Turkish position, killing fifty men and capturing twenty, but without any fire support from their machine-gun squadron they were unable to penetrate the Turkish defences and were forced to withdraw to the rear, dismount and keep the Turkish position under observation.<ref name=hmso30>HMSO 1920, p.30</ref> The extent of the Turkish position had not been fully appreciated, and was now estimated to be held by a force of 3,000 infantry, 400 cavalry, up to twelve artillery guns and between thirty and forty machine-guns.<ref name=\"Preston_a\" /> One group of Turkish soldiers started towards the Mysore Lancers position, but halted about {{convert|800|yd}} short and started to dig new defensive trenches. Unable to progress against the larger force, the brigade kept the position under observation and at 21:00, the Turkish were seen to be withdrawing and had completely evacuated their positions by midnight. At 23:15 the 14th Cavalry Brigade arrived, setting up their own observation lines, until daylight when they took over the 15th Brigade's positions.<ref>Preston 1921, p.293</ref><ref name=hmso31/> In the day's battle, Turkish casualties were estimated to be around 100 men, while the brigade lost four British officers, including Holden attached to the Jodhpur Lancers, one Indian officer and sixteen other ranks.

Students benefit from the advantages of a degree from a British university offered by its location in the 'Capital of Europe'. There are approximately 220 postgraduate students pursuing degrees at the school, drawn from over 65 countries. The School has just celebrated its 20th anniversary in Brussels and has more than 1400 alumni.\n\nThe school currently offers the following degrees:\n\n*MA in EU External Relations\n*MA in International Relations\n*MA in International Conflict and Security\n*MA in International Political Economy\n*MA in International Development\n*MA in International Migration\n*MA in Political Strategy and Communication\n*LLM in International Law\n*LLM in Human Rights\n*PhD in International Relations\n*PhD in Law\n*PhD in International Conflict Analysis\n*PhD in Comparative Thought\n*PhD in Political and Social Thought\n\nAs the name suggests, it is located in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].\n\n== Genesis ==\n\nThe Brussels School of International Studies began as an initiative of the Department of Politics and International Relations of the University of Kent based in Canterbury. The original concept was devised by [[Professor AJR Groom]] of Kent and [[Professor Gustaaf Geeraerts]] of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), whilst discussing the future of European education at a pan-European conference of International Relations. The then recently opened high-speed rail link from Ashford, near Canterbury, to Brussels, made such trans-border educational cooperation technically feasible. The partnership was extended to include [[Professor Eric Remacle]], then director of the Institute for European Studies (IES) of the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), and the idea for a trilateral inter-institutional program in International Relations was born.\n\nThe original concept was for a master's program to be offered in Brussels, in English, taught by members of staff from all three institutions, with the degree conferred under the seals of all three universities. To reflect the cooperative venture, the program was initially to be the \"Tri-University Program in International Relations in Brussels\".  \n\nNotably, the initiative predated the Bologna Declaration by several years, and the concept anticipated many of the later policy developments at the European level to create a cooperative and integrated educational space within the European Union. The school continues to operate in partnership with the two Brussels universities.\n\n[[Dr Jarrod Wiener]] was seconded from Kent in 1998 to found the program, now called the \"Brussels School of International Studies\", and there was participation in teaching from all three universities. \n\n== Faculty ==\n\nFrom 1998 to 2000, Dr Wiener directed the school and its only program, the MA in International Relations.  In 2000, market demand dictated that Kent's flagship MA in International Conflict Analysis be launched in Brussels, and [[Dr Christopher Daase]] was appointed as its first program director.  Dr Daase held that post from 2000 to 2003, leaving when he became full professor at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].  He was succeeded by AJR Groom.\n\nThe school expanded rapidly to include other departments of the University of Kent.\n\nIn 2002, the Kent Law School began offering programs in Brussels. [[Professor Wade Mansell]] led the creation of a joint LLM in International Law with International Relations at BSIS, and [[Dr Harm Schepel]] became the first member of the Kent Law School to be seconded to BSIS in 2002, whereupon he launched the LLM in International Economic Law.\n\nThe Kent School for Social Policy Sociology and Social Research (SSPSSR) then launched an MA in International Migration at the Brussels School, appointing [[Dr Amanda Klekowski Von Koppenfels]] as the program coordinator, drawing on her extensive academic expertise and experience with the International Organisation for Migration in Brussels.\n\nMore programs under the Department of Politics and International Relations were launched as well.  The MA in International Political Economy, originally designed by Dr Wiener for the London Centre, was transposed, and Dr Wiener created two new programs: the MA in European Public Policy, and the MA in Political Strategy and Communication.  Internationally recognised political theorist, Dr Albena Azmanova, was appointed to assume the directorship of the MA in International Political Economy and the MA in European Public Policy, while Dr Wiener directed the MA in Political Strategy and Communication.\n\nThe School now hosts eight permanent members of academic staff across a range of subjects - conflict, development, migration, political strategy, diplomacy, foreign affairs and international law. \n\nIn 2015, the School moved to new premises at Boulevard Louis Schmidt 2a in Etterbeek. BSIS hosts a strong lecture series throughout the terms, hosts summers schools and has a strong research community. \n\n== The University of Kent at Brussels ==\n\nWhat had started as an initiative of a single department had grown to include three academic departments of Kent by 2005. Space issues, as well as the needs for administrative coordination, required the development of a more formal structure.  Dr Wiener was appointed the founding dean of the University of Kent at Brussels, and was later succeeded by [[John Malcolm Macgregor|John Macgregor]], former British ambassador to Austria.
