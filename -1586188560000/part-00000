Baldwin received little formal education but was known as a strong-willed, independent individual. At age 18, he eloped with a neighbor girl named Sarah Ann Unruh and returned home to farm and train horses. He and his wife looked for more prosperous way to make a living and they moved to [[Valparaiso, Indiana]], where they opened a saloon and grocery store.

One contemporary commented,  \"Baldwin didn't run after women; they ran after him.\"<ref name=social/>\n\nBaldwin's matrimonial ventures periodically created sensations. He was married four times, the first two marriages ending in divorce. His third wife, Jennie Dexter, was 16 at the time of marriage. She died of tuberculosis at the age of 23, leaving him with a five-year-old daughter. Baldwin remarried another 16-year old dark-haired, dark-eyed beauty called Lillie Bennett who had a striking resemblance to Jennie. The Queen Anne Cottage was built as a honeymoon present by Lillie's father. They separated after less than two years but never divorced. He reportedly had many affairs with young women in his older years. He was sued by four women for breach of promise of marriage. His stature as a celebrity was such that at age 56, when he married 16-year-old Bennett in San Francisco, the wedding drew coast-to-coast press coverage.<ref>\"A Millionaire's Third Marriage\" ''New York Times'' June 1, 1884, Page 4</ref> In the same year, he was sued by a jilted 16-year-old girl who was awarded $75,000 in damages.<ref name=SoCalHist>''Historical Society of Southern California'', 1999, Wilkman, Jon, [http://www.socalhistory.org/biographies/e-j-lucky-baldwin.html \"E.

[[Shaving mug#Shaving mugs and scuttles|Shaving mug]]s are used to assist in [[shaving|wet shaving]].\n\nAncient mugs were usually carved in [[wood]] or bone, [[ceramic]] or shaped of [[clay]], while most modern ones are made of [[ceramic]] materials such as [[bone china]], [[earthenware]], [[porcelain]], or [[stoneware]]. Some are made from strengthened [[glass]], such as [[Pyrex]]. Other materials, including [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]ed metal, [[plastic]], or [[steel]] are preferred, when reduced weight or resistance to breakage is at a premium, such as for [[camping]]. A travel mug is insulated and has a cover with a small sipping opening to prevent spills. Techniques such as [[silk screen]] printing or [[decal]]s are used to apply decorations such as [[Logo|logos]] or images and [[fan art]], which are fired onto the mug to ensure permanence.\n\n==History==\n===Early mugs===\n[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - large grey mug.jpg|upright|thumb|left|A mug made on a potter wheel in the Late Neolithic Period (ca. 2500\u20132000 BCE) in [[Zhengzhou]], China]]\n\nWooden mugs were produced probably from the earliest days of [[woodworking]], but most of them have not survived intact.<ref name=\"columbia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-porcelai.html|title=Porcelain|publisher=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] Sixth Edition. 2008|accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.nicks.com.au/index.aspx?link_id=76.623|title=Drinking Vessels of Bygone Days|author=G.

It was relatively easy to add a handle to a cup in the process thus producing a mug. For example, a rather advanced, decorated clay mug from 4000\u20135000 BCE was found in Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceramicstudies.me.uk/histx105.html |title=Ceramic Web Page Tutorials|website= Ceramicstudies.me.uk|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}</ref> \n\n[[File:AnasaziMugs.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Ancestral Pueblo]] (Anasazi) mugs from SW [[Colorado]], made between 1000 and 1280 CE.

P. Brooks and J. McGrady \"Improvement in shaving-cups\" {{US patent|66788}} Issue date: July 1867</ref> As hot water was not common in many households, one way to provide hot lather was to use a scuttle or mug. A traditional scuttle resembles a [[teapot]] with a wide spout where hot water is poured in; this is where it differs from a shaving mug, which has no spout.

Carving had been traditionally applied to mugs in the ancient times. Deforming a mug into an unusual shape is sometimes used. However, the most popular decoration technique nowadays is printing on mugs, which is usually performed as follows: Ceramic powder is mixed with dyes of chosen color and a plasticizer. Then it is printed on a gelatin-coated paper using a traditional [[screen-printing]] technique, which applies the mixture through a fine woven mesh, which is stretched on a frame and has a mask of desired shape. This technique produces a thin homogeneous coating; however, if smoothness is not required, the ceramic mixture is painted directly with a brush. Another, more complex alternative is to coat the paper with a photographic emulsion, photoprint the image and then cure the emulsion with ultraviolet light.<ref name=print>{{cite web|title=Printing Ceramics|url=http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|publisher=Ceramics Today|access-date=2009-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601072522/http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|archive-date=2009-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter drying, the printed paper, called a [[transfer-print|litho]], can be stored indefinitely. When a litho is applied to the mug, it is first softened in warm water. This detaches the gelatin cover, with the printed image, from the paper; this cover is then transferred to the mug. The mug is then fired around 700\u2013750&nbsp;\u00b0C, which softens the top surface of the glaze, thereby embedding the image into it.<ref name=print/>\n\n==Storage==\n[[File:Mugs hanging in a ship's mess 01A.jpg|thumb|Mug rack on a ship]]\n[[File:Mugtree1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mug tree]]\nA popular way to store mugs is on a 'mug tree', a wooden or metal pole mounted on a round base and fitted with pegs to hang mugs by their handles.<ref>Jane Ancona, Bruce Ancona \"Mug tree\" {{US patent|D312556}} Issue date: December 4, 1990</ref> There are also racks designed for hanging mugs so that they are ready to hand.

For the same reason of thermal insulation, mugs are usually made of materials with low [[thermal conductivity]], such as [[earthenware]], [[bone china]], [[porcelain]], or glass.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJw0K1ZGY1kC&pg=PA98|page=98|title=The really useful science book: a framework of knowledge for primary teachers|author=Steve Farrow|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=0-7507-0983-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esDW3xTKoLIC&pg=PA27|page=27|title=The handbook of evolutionary psychology|author=David M.

Carving had been traditionally applied to mugs in the ancient times. Deforming a mug into an unusual shape is sometimes used. However, the most popular decoration technique nowadays is printing on mugs, which is usually performed as follows: Ceramic powder is mixed with dyes of chosen color and a plasticizer. Then it is printed on a gelatin-coated paper using a traditional [[screen-printing]] technique, which applies the mixture through a fine woven mesh, which is stretched on a frame and has a mask of desired shape. This technique produces a thin homogeneous coating; however, if smoothness is not required, the ceramic mixture is painted directly with a brush. Another, more complex alternative is to coat the paper with a photographic emulsion, photoprint the image and then cure the emulsion with ultraviolet light.<ref name=print>{{cite web|title=Printing Ceramics|url=http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|publisher=Ceramics Today|access-date=2009-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601072522/http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|archive-date=2009-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter drying, the printed paper, called a [[transfer-print|litho]], can be stored indefinitely. When a litho is applied to the mug, it is first softened in warm water. This detaches the gelatin cover, with the printed image, from the paper; this cover is then transferred to the mug. The mug is then fired around 700\u2013750&nbsp;\u00b0C, which softens the top surface of the glaze, thereby embedding the image into it.<ref name=print/>\n\n==Storage==\n[[File:Mugs hanging in a ship's mess 01A.jpg|thumb|Mug rack on a ship]]\n[[File:Mugtree1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mug tree]]\nA popular way to store mugs is on a 'mug tree', a wooden or metal pole mounted on a round base and fitted with pegs to hang mugs by their handles.<ref>Jane Ancona, Bruce Ancona \"Mug tree\" {{US patent|D312556}} Issue date: December 4, 1990</ref> There are also racks designed for hanging mugs so that they are ready to hand.

There is no singularly accepted scope for the region, and it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of [[Mauritania]] in the west, to [[Egypt]]'s [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]] in the east. Others{{Like whom?|date=January 2019}} have limited it to the countries of [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]], a region that was known by the French during colonial times as \"Afrique du Nord\" and is known by Arabs as the [[Maghreb]] (\"West\", ''The western part of Arab World''). The most commonly accepted definition includes [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Sudan]], the 6 countries that shape the top North of the African continent. Meanwhile, \"North Africa\", particularly when used in the term ''North Africa and the Middle East'', often refers only to the countries of the [[Maghreb]] and Libya. Egypt, being also part of the [[Middle East]], is often considered separately, due to being both North African and Middle Eastern at the same time.\n\nNorth Africa includes a number of Spanish and Portuguese possessions, [[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]], [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/United-Nations-definition-of-African-Regions-West-Northern-Central-East-and-Southern_fig3_267971678|title=Figure 5: United Nations definition of African Regions: West, Northern,...|website=ResearchGate.net|accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref> The countries of North Africa share a common ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity that is unique to this region. Northwest Africa has been inhabited by [[Berbers]] since the beginning of recorded history, while the eastern part of North Africa has been home to the [[Egyptians]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://cairoscene.com/Buzz/National-Geographic-s-DNA-Analysis-Proves-Egyptians-Are-Only-17-Arab|title=National Geographic Geno Project: Egyptians are North Africans}}</ref> Between the A.D. 600s and 1000s, Arabs from the [[Middle East]] swept across the region in a wave of [[Conquest (military)|Muslim conquest]]. These peoples, physically quite similar, formed a single population in many areas, as Berbers and Egyptians merged into [[Arabic culture|Arabic]] and [[Muslim culture]]. This process of Arabization and Islamization has defined the cultural landscape of North Africa ever since.\n\nThe distinction between North Africa, the [[Sahel]] and the rest of the [[Africa|continent]] is as follows: \n{{Quote|text=\nNineteenth century European [[Exploration|explorers]], attracted by the accounts of Ancient geographers or [[Arab geographers]] of the classical period, followed the routes by the nomadic people of the vast \"empty\" space. They documented the names of the stopping places they discovered or rediscovered, described landscapes, took a few climate measurements and gathered rock samples. Gradually, a map began to fill in the white blotch.\n\nThe [[Sahara]] and the [[Sahel]] entered the geographic corpus by way of naturalist explorers because aridity is the feature that circumscribes the boundaries of the ''[[ecumene]]''. &nbsp;The map details included topographical relief and location of watering holes crucial to long crossings. The Arabic word \"Sahel\" (shore) and \"Sahara\" (desert) made its entry into the vocabulary of geography.\n\nLatitudinally, the \"slopes\" of the arid desert, devoid of continuous human habitation, descend in step-like fashion toward the northern and southern edges of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] that opens to Europe and the Sahel that opens to \"Trab al Sudan.\" Longitudinally, a uniform grid divides the central desert then shrinks back toward the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. Gradually, the Sahara-Sahel is further divided into a total of twenty sub-areas: central, northern, southern, western, eastern, etc.\n\nIn this way, \"standard\" geography has determined aridity to be the boundary of the ''ecumene''. It identifies settlements based on visible activity without regard for social or political organizations of space in vast, purportedly \"empty\" areas. It gives only cursory acknowledgement to what makes Saharan geography, and for that matter, world geography unique: mobility and the routes by which it flows.\n|title=''An atlas of the Sahara-Sahel : geography, economics and security''<ref>{{Cite book|title=An atlas of the Sahara-Sahel : geography, economics and security.|others=Bossard, Laurent., Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development., Sahel and West Africa Club., OECD iLibrary.|isbn=978-9264222342|location=Paris|oclc=900622439}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe [[Sahel]] or \"African Transition Zone\" has been affected by many formative epochs in North African history ranging from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation to the Arab-Berber control of the [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tarikhalsudan00sadauoft/page/n6|title=Tarikh es soudan|last=es-Sadi|first=Abderrahman|publisher=Paris E.

The [[Atlas Mountains]] extend across much of northern [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]. These mountains are part of the [[fold mountains|fold mountain]] system that also runs through much of [[Southern Europe]]. They recede to the south and east, becoming a [[steppe]] landscape before meeting the [[Sahara]] desert, which covers more than 75 percent of the region. The tallest peaks are in the High Atlas range in south-central Morocco, which has many snow-capped peaks.\n\nSouth of the Atlas Mountains is the dry and barren expanse of the [[Sahara]] desert, which is the largest sand desert in the world.<ref name=\"geology.com\">{{cite web|url=http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml|title=Largest Desert in the World|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>  In places the desert is cut by irregular watercourses called wadis\u2014streams that flow only after rainfalls but are usually dry. The Sahara's major landforms include ergs, large seas of sand that sometimes form into huge dunes; the hammada, a level rocky plateau without soil or sand; and the reg, a level plain of gravel or small stones. The Sahara covers the southern part of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and most of Libya. Only two regions of Libya are outside the desert: [[Tripolitania]] in the northwest and [[Cyrenaica]] in the northeast. Most of Egypt is also desert, with the exception of the Nile River and the irrigated land along its banks. The Nile Valley forms a narrow fertile thread that runs along the length of the country.\n\nSheltered valleys in the [[Atlas Mountains]], the Nile Valley and [[Nile Delta|Delta]], and the Mediterranean coast are the main sources of fertile farming land. A wide variety of valuable crops including cereals, rice and cotton, and woods such as cedar and cork, are grown. Typical Mediterranean crops, such as olives, figs, dates and citrus fruits, also thrive in these areas. The Nile Valley is particularly fertile and most of the population in [[Egypt]] live close to the river. Elsewhere, irrigation is essential to improve crop yields on the desert margins.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Definitions==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border:1px solid #aaa; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ececec;\"\n!

Ancient Egyptians record extensive contact in their Western desert with people that appear to have been Berber or proto-Berber. As the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] and other rock art findings in the Sahara have shown, the [[Sahara]] also hosted various populations before its rapid [[desertification]] in 3500 B.C and even today continues to host small populations of [[Tuareg people|nomadic trans-Saharan peoples]].\n\nIn the eleventh century, the [[Banu Hilal]] invaded the North African plains and plateaus, but not the mountainous areas such as the [[Tell Atlas]] range, the [[Rif]] or the [[Aur\u00e8s Mountains]] and brought with them [[Hilalian dialects]] of [[Arabic]], which over the centuries have been in significant contact with other languages, including the [[languages of Europe]].

The Arabic and Berber languages are distantly related, both being members of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]]. The [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] Berber languages are notably more conservative than those of the coastal cities.\n\nOver the years, Berbers have been influenced by contact with other cultures: [[Greeks]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Egyptians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Arabs]], [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] and [[Africa]]ns. The cultures of the Maghreb and the Sahara therefore combine indigenous Berber, Arab and elements from neighboring parts of Africa and beyond. In the Sahara, the distinction between sedentary [[oasis]] inhabitants and nomadic [[Bedouin]]s and [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]] is particularly marked. \n[[File:Flickr - stringer bel - Ait Benhaddou.jpg|thumb|The [[kasbah]] of [[A\u00eft Benhaddou]] in Morocco]]\nThe diverse peoples of North Africa are usually categorized along ethno-linguistic lines. In the Maghreb, where Arab and Berber identities are often integrated, these lines can be blurred. Some Berber-speaking North Africans may identify as \"Arab\" depending on the social and political circumstances, although substantial numbers of Berbers (or ''Amazighen'') have retained a distinct cultural identity which in the 20th century has been expressed as a clear ethnic identification with Berber history and language. Arabic-speaking Northwest Africans, regardless of ethnic background, often identify with Arab history and culture and may share a common vision with other Arabs. This, however, may or may not exclude pride in and identification with Berber and/or other parts of their heritage. Berber political and cultural activists for their part, often referred to as [[Berberism|Berberists]], may view all Northwest Africans as principally Berber, whether they are primarily Berber- or Arabic-speaking.\n\n[[Egyptians]] over the centuries have shifted their language from [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] (in its late form, [[Coptic language|varieties of Coptic]]) to modern [[Egyptian Arabic]] while retaining a sense of national identity that has historically set them apart from other people in the region. Most Egyptians are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]], although there is a significant minority of Coptic Christians.\n\nThe Maghreb formerly had a significant Jewish population, almost all of whom emigrated to France or [[Israel]] when the North African nations gained independence. Prior to the modern establishment of Israel, there were about 600,000\u2013700,000 Jews in Northern Africa, including both [[Sephardi Jews]] (refugees from France, Spain and Portugal from the Renaissance era) as well as indigenous [[Mizrahi Jews]]. Today, less than fifteen thousand remain in the region, almost all in Morocco and Tunisia, and are mostly part of a French-speaking urban elite.

The Carthaginians were of [[Phoenicia]]n origin, with the Roman myth of their origin being that [[Dido]], a Phoenician princess, was granted land by a local ruler based on how much land she could cover with a piece of cowhide. She ingeniously devised a method to extend the cowhide to a high proportion, thus gaining a large territory. She was also rejected by the [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]] according to [[Virgil]], thus creating a historical enmity between Carthage and [[Rome]], as Aeneas would eventually lay the foundations for Rome. [[Ancient Carthage]] was a commercial power and had a strong navy, but relied on mercenaries for land soldiers. The Carthaginians developed an empire in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Sicily]], the latter being the cause of [[First Punic War]] with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]].\n\nOver a hundred years and more, all Carthaginian territory was eventually conquered by the Romans, resulting in the Carthaginian North African territories becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]] in 146 B.C.<ref>''The Punic Wars 264\u2013146 BC'', by Nigel Bagnall</ref> This led to tension and eventually [[war|conflict]] between [[Numidia]] and Rome. The Numidian wars are notable for launching the careers of both [[Gaius Marius]], and [[Sulla]], and stretching the constitutional burden of the Roman republic as Marius required a professional army, something previously contrary to Roman values, to overcome the talented [[military]] leader [[Jugurtha]].<ref>[[Sallust]], ''De Bello Iugurthino''</ref>\n\nNorth Africa remained a part of the Roman Empire, which produced many notable citizens such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], until incompetent leadership from Roman commanders in the early fifth century allowed the [[Germanic peoples]], the [[Vandals]], to cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], whereupon they overcame the fickle Roman defense. The loss of North Africa is considered a pinnacle point in the fall of the Western Roman Empire as Africa had previously been an important grain province that maintained Roman prosperity despite the barbarian incursions, and the wealth required to create new armies. The issue of regaining North Africa became paramount to the Western Empire, but was frustrated by Vandal victories. The focus of Roman energy had to be on the emerging threat of the [[Huns]]. In 468 AD, the Romans made one last serious attempt to invade North Africa but were repelled. This perhaps marks the point of terminal decline for the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The last Roman emperor was deposed in 476 by the [[Herules|Heruli]] general [[Odoacer]]. [[Trade route]]s between [[Europe]] and North Africa remained intact until the coming of Islam.

By 700, most of North Africa had come under Muslim rule. Indigenous Berbers subsequently started to form their own polities in response in places such as [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and [[Sijilmasa]]. In the eleventh century, a reformist movement made up of members that called themselves the [[Almoravid dynasty]] expanded south into [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].\n\nNorth Africa's populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]]. Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.<ref>[http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm Populations Crises and Population Cycles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527170154/http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm |date=2013-05-27 }}, Claire Russell and W.M.S.

The [[Spanish Empire]] conquered several coastal cities between the 16th and 18th centuries. After the 19th century, the imperial and colonial presence of [[French colonial empire|France]], [[British Empire|the United Kingdom]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Italy]] left the entirety of the region under one form of European occupation.\n\nIn [[World War II]] from 1940 to 1943 the area was the setting for the [[North African Campaign]]. During the 1950s and 1960s all of the North African states gained independence. There remains a dispute over [[Western Sahara]] between [[Morocco]] and the [[Algeria]]n-backed [[Polisario Front]].\n\nIn 2010\u20132011 massive protests swept the region leading to the overthrow of the governments in Tunisia and Egypt, as well as civil war in Libya. Large protests also occurred in Algeria and Morocco to a lesser extent. Many hundreds died in the uprisings.

There is no singularly accepted scope for the region, and it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of [[Mauritania]] in the west, to [[Egypt]]'s [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]] in the east. Others{{Like whom?|date=January 2019}} have limited it to the countries of [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]], a region that was known by the French during colonial times as \"Afrique du Nord\" and is known by Arabs as the [[Maghreb]] (\"West\", ''The western part of Arab World''). The most commonly accepted definition includes [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Sudan]], the 6 countries that shape the top North of the African continent. Meanwhile, \"North Africa\", particularly when used in the term ''North Africa and the Middle East'', often refers only to the countries of the [[Maghreb]] and Libya. Egypt, being also part of the [[Middle East]], is often considered separately, due to being both North African and Middle Eastern at the same time.\n\nNorth Africa includes a number of Spanish and Portuguese possessions, [[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]], [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/United-Nations-definition-of-African-Regions-West-Northern-Central-East-and-Southern_fig3_267971678|title=Figure 5: United Nations definition of African Regions: West, Northern,...|website=ResearchGate.net|accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref> The countries of North Africa share a common ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity that is unique to this region. Northwest Africa has been inhabited by [[Berbers]] since the beginning of recorded history, while the eastern part of North Africa has been home to the [[Egyptians]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://cairoscene.com/Buzz/National-Geographic-s-DNA-Analysis-Proves-Egyptians-Are-Only-17-Arab|title=National Geographic Geno Project: Egyptians are North Africans}}</ref> Between the A.D. 600s and 1000s, Arabs from the [[Middle East]] swept across the region in a wave of [[Conquest (military)|Muslim conquest]]. These peoples, physically quite similar, formed a single population in many areas, as Berbers and Egyptians merged into [[Arabic culture|Arabic]] and [[Muslim culture]]. This process of Arabization and Islamization has defined the cultural landscape of North Africa ever since.\n\nThe distinction between North Africa, the [[Sahel]] and the rest of the [[Africa|continent]] is as follows: \n{{Quote|text=\nNineteenth century European [[Exploration|explorers]], attracted by the accounts of Ancient geographers or [[Arab geographers]] of the classical period, followed the routes by the nomadic people of the vast \"empty\" space. They documented the names of the stopping places they discovered or rediscovered, described landscapes, took a few climate measurements and gathered rock samples. Gradually, a map began to fill in the white blotch.\n\nThe [[Sahara]] and the [[Sahel]] entered the geographic corpus by way of naturalist explorers because aridity is the feature that circumscribes the boundaries of the ''[[ecumene]]''. &nbsp;The map details included topographical relief and location of watering holes crucial to long crossings. The Arabic word \"Sahel\" (shore) and \"Sahara\" (desert) made its entry into the vocabulary of geography.\n\nLatitudinally, the \"slopes\" of the arid desert, devoid of continuous human habitation, descend in step-like fashion toward the northern and southern edges of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] that opens to Europe and the Sahel that opens to \"Trab al Sudan.\" Longitudinally, a uniform grid divides the central desert then shrinks back toward the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. Gradually, the Sahara-Sahel is further divided into a total of twenty sub-areas: central, northern, southern, western, eastern, etc.\n\nIn this way, \"standard\" geography has determined aridity to be the boundary of the ''ecumene''. It identifies settlements based on visible activity without regard for social or political organizations of space in vast, purportedly \"empty\" areas. It gives only cursory acknowledgement to what makes Saharan geography, and for that matter, world geography unique: mobility and the routes by which it flows.\n|title=''An atlas of the Sahara-Sahel : geography, economics and security''<ref>{{Cite book|title=An atlas of the Sahara-Sahel : geography, economics and security.|others=Bossard, Laurent., Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development., Sahel and West Africa Club., OECD iLibrary.|isbn=978-9264222342|location=Paris|oclc=900622439}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe [[Sahel]] or \"African Transition Zone\" has been affected by many formative epochs in North African history ranging from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation to the Arab-Berber control of the [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tarikhalsudan00sadauoft/page/n6|title=Tarikh es soudan|last=es-Sadi|first=Abderrahman|publisher=Paris E.

The [[Atlas Mountains]] extend across much of northern [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]. These mountains are part of the [[fold mountains|fold mountain]] system that also runs through much of [[Southern Europe]]. They recede to the south and east, becoming a [[steppe]] landscape before meeting the [[Sahara]] desert, which covers more than 75 percent of the region. The tallest peaks are in the High Atlas range in south-central Morocco, which has many snow-capped peaks.\n\nSouth of the Atlas Mountains is the dry and barren expanse of the [[Sahara]] desert, which is the largest sand desert in the world.<ref name=\"geology.com\">{{cite web|url=http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml|title=Largest Desert in the World|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>  In places the desert is cut by irregular watercourses called wadis\u2014streams that flow only after rainfalls but are usually dry. The Sahara's major landforms include ergs, large seas of sand that sometimes form into huge dunes; the hammada, a level rocky plateau without soil or sand; and the reg, a level plain of gravel or small stones. The Sahara covers the southern part of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and most of Libya. Only two regions of Libya are outside the desert: [[Tripolitania]] in the northwest and [[Cyrenaica]] in the northeast. Most of Egypt is also desert, with the exception of the Nile River and the irrigated land along its banks. The Nile Valley forms a narrow fertile thread that runs along the length of the country.\n\nSheltered valleys in the [[Atlas Mountains]], the Nile Valley and [[Nile Delta|Delta]], and the Mediterranean coast are the main sources of fertile farming land. A wide variety of valuable crops including cereals, rice and cotton, and woods such as cedar and cork, are grown. Typical Mediterranean crops, such as olives, figs, dates and citrus fruits, also thrive in these areas. The Nile Valley is particularly fertile and most of the population in [[Egypt]] live close to the river. Elsewhere, irrigation is essential to improve crop yields on the desert margins.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Definitions==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border:1px solid #aaa; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ececec;\"\n!

Ancient Egyptians record extensive contact in their Western desert with people that appear to have been Berber or proto-Berber.

The Arabic and Berber languages are distantly related, both being members of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]]. The [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] Berber languages are notably more conservative than those of the coastal cities.\n\nOver the years, Berbers have been influenced by contact with other cultures: [[Greeks]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Egyptians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Arabs]], [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] and [[Africa]]ns. The cultures of the Maghreb and the Sahara therefore combine indigenous Berber, Arab and elements from neighboring parts of Africa and beyond. In the Sahara, the distinction between sedentary [[oasis]] inhabitants and nomadic [[Bedouin]]s and [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]] is particularly marked. \n[[File:Flickr - stringer bel - Ait Benhaddou.jpg|thumb|The [[kasbah]] of [[A\u00eft Benhaddou]] in Morocco]]\nThe diverse peoples of North Africa are usually categorized along ethno-linguistic lines. In the Maghreb, where Arab and Berber identities are often integrated, these lines can be blurred. Some Berber-speaking North Africans may identify as \"Arab\" depending on the social and political circumstances, although substantial numbers of Berbers (or ''Amazighen'') have retained a distinct cultural identity which in the 20th century has been expressed as a clear ethnic identification with Berber history and language. Arabic-speaking Northwest Africans, regardless of ethnic background, often identify with Arab history and culture and may share a common vision with other Arabs. This, however, may or may not exclude pride in and identification with Berber and/or other parts of their heritage. Berber political and cultural activists for their part, often referred to as [[Berberism|Berberists]], may view all Northwest Africans as principally Berber, whether they are primarily Berber- or Arabic-speaking.\n\n[[Egyptians]] over the centuries have shifted their language from [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] (in its late form, [[Coptic language|varieties of Coptic]]) to modern [[Egyptian Arabic]] while retaining a sense of national identity that has historically set them apart from other people in the region. Most Egyptians are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]], although there is a significant minority of Coptic Christians.\n\nThe Maghreb formerly had a significant Jewish population, almost all of whom emigrated to France or [[Israel]] when the North African nations gained independence. Prior to the modern establishment of Israel, there were about 600,000\u2013700,000 Jews in Northern Africa, including both [[Sephardi Jews]] (refugees from France, Spain and Portugal from the Renaissance era) as well as indigenous [[Mizrahi Jews]]. Today, less than fifteen thousand remain in the region, almost all in Morocco and Tunisia, and are mostly part of a French-speaking urban elite.

The Carthaginians were of [[Phoenicia]]n origin, with the Roman myth of their origin being that [[Dido]], a Phoenician princess, was granted land by a local ruler based on how much land she could cover with a piece of cowhide. She ingeniously devised a method to extend the cowhide to a high proportion, thus gaining a large territory. She was also rejected by the [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]] according to [[Virgil]], thus creating a historical enmity between Carthage and [[Rome]], as Aeneas would eventually lay the foundations for Rome. [[Ancient Carthage]] was a commercial power and had a strong navy, but relied on mercenaries for land soldiers. The Carthaginians developed an empire in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Sicily]], the latter being the cause of [[First Punic War]] with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]].\n\nOver a hundred years and more, all Carthaginian territory was eventually conquered by the Romans, resulting in the Carthaginian North African territories becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]] in 146 B.C.<ref>''The Punic Wars 264\u2013146 BC'', by Nigel Bagnall</ref> This led to tension and eventually [[war|conflict]] between [[Numidia]] and Rome. The Numidian wars are notable for launching the careers of both [[Gaius Marius]], and [[Sulla]], and stretching the constitutional burden of the Roman republic as Marius required a professional army, something previously contrary to Roman values, to overcome the talented [[military]] leader [[Jugurtha]].<ref>[[Sallust]], ''De Bello Iugurthino''</ref>\n\nNorth Africa remained a part of the Roman Empire, which produced many notable citizens such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], until incompetent leadership from Roman commanders in the early fifth century allowed the [[Germanic peoples]], the [[Vandals]], to cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], whereupon they overcame the fickle Roman defense. The loss of North Africa is considered a pinnacle point in the fall of the Western Roman Empire as Africa had previously been an important grain province that maintained Roman prosperity despite the barbarian incursions, and the wealth required to create new armies. The issue of regaining North Africa became paramount to the Western Empire, but was frustrated by Vandal victories. The focus of Roman energy had to be on the emerging threat of the [[Huns]]. In 468 AD, the Romans made one last serious attempt to invade North Africa but were repelled. This perhaps marks the point of terminal decline for the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The last Roman emperor was deposed in 476 by the [[Herules|Heruli]] general [[Odoacer]]. [[Trade route]]s between [[Europe]] and North Africa remained intact until the coming of Islam.

By 700, most of North Africa had come under Muslim rule. Indigenous Berbers subsequently started to form their own polities in response in places such as [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and [[Sijilmasa]]. In the eleventh century, a reformist movement made up of members that called themselves the [[Almoravid dynasty]] expanded south into [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].\n\nNorth Africa's populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]]. Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.<ref>[http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm Populations Crises and Population Cycles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527170154/http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm |date=2013-05-27 }}, Claire Russell and W.M.S.

The [[Spanish Empire]] conquered several coastal cities between the 16th and 18th centuries. After the 19th century, the imperial and colonial presence of [[French colonial empire|France]], [[British Empire|the United Kingdom]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Italy]] left the entirety of the region under one form of European occupation.\n\nIn [[World War II]] from 1940 to 1943 the area was the setting for the [[North African Campaign]]. During the 1950s and 1960s all of the North African states gained independence. There remains a dispute over [[Western Sahara]] between [[Morocco]] and the [[Algeria]]n-backed [[Polisario Front]].\n\nIn 2010\u20132011 massive protests swept the region leading to the overthrow of the governments in Tunisia and Egypt, as well as civil war in Libya. Large protests also occurred in Algeria and Morocco to a lesser extent. Many hundreds died in the uprisings. This uprising is commonly referred to as the \"Arab spring\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/02/201122164254698620.html |title=In search of an African revolution |first=Azad |last=Essa |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=February 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Science and technology==\n{{See|History of science and technology in Africa#Northern Africa and the Nile Valley}}\n\n==Transport and industry==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2011}}\n[[File:Tunis1960-040 hg.jpg|thumb|Thousands of people in North Africa depend on [[date palm]] trees for a living.

[[Egypt]] has the most varied industrial base, importing technology to develop electronics and engineering industries, and maintaining the reputation of its high-quality cotton textiles.\n\nOil rigs are scattered throughout the deserts of [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]].

However, it was not until the [[Township (Canada)|townships]] were created in 1792 that Vaughan began to see European settlements, as it was considered to be extremely remote and the lack of roads through the region made travel difficult. The township was named after [[Benjamin Vaughan]], a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] commissioner who signed a peace treaty with the [[United States]] in 1783.\n\nDespite the hardships of [[settler|pioneer]] life, settlers came to Vaughan in considerable numbers. The population grew from 19 men, 5 women, and 30 children in 1800 to 4,300 in 1840. The first people to arrive were mainly [[Pennsylvania]] Germans, with a smaller number of families of [[England|English]] descent and a group of [[France|French]] [[House of Bourbon|Royalists]]. This migration from the [[United States]] was by 1814 superseded by immigrants from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. While many of their predecessors had been agriculturalists, the newer immigrants proved to be highly skilled tradespeople, which would prove useful for a growing [[community]].\n\nAround the facilities established by this group were a number of hamlets, the oldest of which was [[Thornhill, Ontario|Thornhill]], where a saw-mill was erected in 1801, a grist mill in 1815, and had a population of 300 by 1836. Other such enclaves included ''[[Kleinburg]], Coleraine, [[Maple, Ontario|Rupertville]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/RHPL/RHPL003215301pf_0002.pdf|title=Historical Notes on Maple|last=Rumble|first=Mrs. Arnold|date=1948-10-28|work=The Liberal|accessdate=2018-12-14|location=Richmond Hill, Ontario|page=1|format=PDF}}</ref>''[[Maple, Ontario|(Maple)]], [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]], Teston, [[Clairville, Toronto|Claireville]], [[Pine Grove, Regional Municipality of York, Ontario|Pine Grove]], Carrville, Patterson, Burlington, [[Concord, Ontario|Concord]], Edgeley, Fisherville, Elder's Mills, Elgin Mills, Jefferson, Nashville, Purpleville, Richvale, Sherwood, Langstaff, Vellore'', and ''Burwick ([[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]])''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Vaughan Township Churches|last=Somerville|first=Patricia|last2=Macfarlane|first2=Catherine|publisher=Vaughan Township Historical Society|year=1984|isbn=0-9692207-0-7|location=Maple, Ontario|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the Township was primarily agricultural but had a population of 4,300.

The ethnocultural composition of the area began to change with the arrival of different groups such as [[Italy|Italians]], [[Jew]]s and [[Eastern Europe]]ans.\n\nIncorporated in 1850 as ''Vaughan Township,'' a municipal government was established. [[Vaughan Road]] was a historic road constructed in 1850 that linked Vaughan Township with [[Toronto]]. It incorporated parts of present-day [[Dufferin Street]] north of [[Eglinton Avenue]] in Toronto, though all that remains of it today is the separate alignment farther south, running through the eastern half of the former [[York, Toronto|City of York]].<ref name=\"lostrivers\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.lostrivers.ca/points/vaughanrd.htm\n|title=History of Vaughan Road\n|work=The Tollkeepers Cottage and Early Roads such as Vaughan Road\n|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> In 1971, the new regional government of [[York Regional Municipality, Ontario|York Region]] was established, acquiring policing and welfare services from the communities it served; simultaneously, the township merged with the Village of [[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]] to form the Town of Vaughan.

Gino Rosati, a Vaughan local councillor, was subsequently appointed by Vaughan Council to fill Di Biase's position as regional councillor and a by-election was held to fill Rosati's local councillor's position which was won by [[Linda Jackson (politician)|Linda Jackson]], the daughter of Mayor Jackson. Di Biase first became involved in the city's politics in 1985, when he was elected as a local councillor in 1985. Di Biase retained the mayorship in the [[2003 Vaughan municipal election|2003 municipal election]], defeating challenger Robert Craig.\n\nIn the [[2006 Vaughan municipal election|municipal election]] on November 13, 2006, Di Biase was narrowly defeated by Linda Jackson, who was sworn in as mayor on December 4, 2006. On June 18, 2008, an audit of Jackson's 2006 campaign finances found that the politician exceeded her legal spending limit of $120,419 by at least $12,356, or 10 per cent.

It has been used as a summer school field trip site since 1976 by the Boyd archaeological field summer school for high school students. The school is sponsored by the York Region district school board in co-operation with the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). In 1895, a local farmer began finding Iroquoian artifacts in the area. In 1895, Roland Orr recognized the classic ecological features favoured by the Iroquoian people for their villages: floodplains along a river, an easily defensible plateau and nearby forests. The Iroquois used the floodplains to plant maize, beans and squash,{{rp|1}} known as the three sisters. In the 1950s, University of Toronto professor Norman Emerson and the students excavated artifacts from the Seed-Baker site. Since 1975, more than a million artifacts were discovered and nineteen [[longhouse]]s were excavated revealing that the village was occupied by the Iroquois from c. 1500 - 1550 AD.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Bob |last1=Burgar |first2=Cathy |last2=Crinnion |title=The \"dirt\" on the TRCA's archaeology program |journal=Arch Notes |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=14\u201315 |url=https://www.ontarioarchaeology.org/Resources/ArchNotes/anns10-3.pdf |accessdate=July 28, 2019 |publisher=Ontario Archaeological Society}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Vaughan}}\n\n=== Order of Vaughan ===\nIn 2016, to celebrate the city's 25th anniversary, Mayor Bevilacqua introduced the Order of Vaughan.

The Skandatut ancestral Wendat village overlooked the east branch of the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]] (Pinevalley Drive) and was once home to approximately 2000 Huron in the sixteenth century.<ref>Salvage excavations of nationally significant Huron sites in Vaughan continue into 2010.

However, it was not until the [[Township (Canada)|townships]] were created in 1792 that Vaughan began to see European settlements, as it was considered to be extremely remote and the lack of roads through the region made travel difficult. The township was named after [[Benjamin Vaughan]], a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] commissioner who signed a peace treaty with the [[United States]] in 1783.\n\nDespite the hardships of [[settler|pioneer]] life, settlers came to Vaughan in considerable numbers. The population grew from 19 men, 5 women, and 30 children in 1800 to 4,300 in 1840. The first people to arrive were mainly [[Pennsylvania]] Germans, with a smaller number of families of [[England|English]] descent and a group of [[France|French]] [[House of Bourbon|Royalists]]. This migration from the [[United States]] was by 1814 superseded by immigrants from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. While many of their predecessors had been agriculturalists, the newer immigrants proved to be highly skilled tradespeople, which would prove useful for a growing [[community]].\n\nAround the facilities established by this group were a number of hamlets, the oldest of which was [[Thornhill, Ontario|Thornhill]], where a saw-mill was erected in 1801, a grist mill in 1815, and had a population of 300 by 1836. Other such enclaves included ''[[Kleinburg]], Coleraine, [[Maple, Ontario|Rupertville]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/RHPL/RHPL003215301pf_0002.pdf|title=Historical Notes on Maple|last=Rumble|first=Mrs. Arnold|date=1948-10-28|work=The Liberal|accessdate=2018-12-14|location=Richmond Hill, Ontario|page=1|format=PDF}}</ref>''[[Maple, Ontario|(Maple)]], [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]], Teston, [[Clairville, Toronto|Claireville]], [[Pine Grove, Regional Municipality of York, Ontario|Pine Grove]], Carrville, Patterson, Burlington, [[Concord, Ontario|Concord]], Edgeley, Fisherville, Elder's Mills, Elgin Mills, Jefferson, Nashville, Purpleville, Richvale, Sherwood, Langstaff, Vellore'', and ''Burwick ([[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]])''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Vaughan Township Churches|last=Somerville|first=Patricia|last2=Macfarlane|first2=Catherine|publisher=Vaughan Township Historical Society|year=1984|isbn=0-9692207-0-7|location=Maple, Ontario|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the Township was primarily agricultural but had a population of 4,300.

The ethnocultural composition of the area began to change with the arrival of different groups such as [[Italy|Italians]], [[Jew]]s and [[Eastern Europe]]ans.\n\nIncorporated in 1850 as ''Vaughan Township,'' a municipal government was established. [[Vaughan Road]] was a historic road constructed in 1850 that linked Vaughan Township with [[Toronto]]. It incorporated parts of present-day [[Dufferin Street]] north of [[Eglinton Avenue]] in Toronto, though all that remains of it today is the separate alignment farther south, running through the eastern half of the former [[York, Toronto|City of York]].<ref name=\"lostrivers\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.lostrivers.ca/points/vaughanrd.htm\n|title=History of Vaughan Road\n|work=The Tollkeepers Cottage and Early Roads such as Vaughan Road\n|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> In 1971, the new regional government of [[York Regional Municipality, Ontario|York Region]] was established, acquiring policing and welfare services from the communities it served; simultaneously, the township merged with the Village of [[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]] to form the Town of Vaughan.

Di Biase first became involved in the city's politics in 1985, when he was elected as a local councillor in 1985. Di Biase retained the mayorship in the [[2003 Vaughan municipal election|2003 municipal election]], defeating challenger Robert Craig.\n\nIn the [[2006 Vaughan municipal election|municipal election]] on November 13, 2006, Di Biase was narrowly defeated by Linda Jackson, who was sworn in as mayor on December 4, 2006. On June 18, 2008, an audit of Jackson's 2006 campaign finances found that the politician exceeded her legal spending limit of $120,419 by at least $12,356, or 10 per cent.

It has been used as a summer school field trip site since 1976 by the Boyd archaeological field summer school for high school students. The school is sponsored by the York Region district school board in co-operation with the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). In 1895, a local farmer began finding Iroquoian artifacts in the area. In 1895, Roland Orr recognized the classic ecological features favoured by the Iroquoian people for their villages: floodplains along a river, an easily defensible plateau and nearby forests. The Iroquois used the floodplains to plant maize, beans and squash,{{rp|1}} known as the three sisters. In the 1950s, University of Toronto professor Norman Emerson and the students excavated artifacts from the Seed-Baker site. Since 1975, more than a million artifacts were discovered and nineteen [[longhouse]]s were excavated revealing that the village was occupied by the Iroquois from c. 1500 - 1550 AD.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Bob |last1=Burgar |first2=Cathy |last2=Crinnion |title=The \"dirt\" on the TRCA's archaeology program |journal=Arch Notes |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=14\u201315 |url=https://www.ontarioarchaeology.org/Resources/ArchNotes/anns10-3.pdf |accessdate=July 28, 2019 |publisher=Ontario Archaeological Society}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Vaughan}}\n\n=== Order of Vaughan ===\nIn 2016, to celebrate the city's 25th anniversary, Mayor Bevilacqua introduced the Order of Vaughan.
