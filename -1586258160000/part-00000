The region includes the provinces of [[Mersin Province|Mersin]], [[Adana Province|Adana]], [[Osmaniye Province|Osmaniye]] and [[Hatay Province|Hatay]]. Adding the large population centers surrounding Cilicia, more than 10 million people reside within 2-hours drive from the Adana city center.\n\nThroughout the history, Adana were a market town at the Cilicia plain and one of the gateways from Europe to the Middle East, as it provided the only access on the wide Seyhan river. The city turned into a power house of Cilicia with the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkic]] takeover in 1359. The city remained as the capital of the [[Ramadanid Emirate]] until 1608, and then the regional administrative center for the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Turkey]], and shortly for the [[Cilicia#French Cilicia|French Cilicia]]. Economically a modest town until 1861 with a population of roughly 15000, the city boomed with the breakdown of the [[American Civil War]], as becoming a new center for supplying cotton and cotton related products to Europe. Traditionally a town populated by Armenians and Turks; influx of [[Armenians]], Turks, [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Alawites]] at this period, made the city one of the most diverse cities of [[Anatolia]]. Economic, social and cultural growth were halted by the [[Adana massacre]], the [[Armenian Genocide]] and the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]]<ref name=\"HrantAdana\">{{cite web|url=https://hrantdink.org/attachments/article/1398/Adana_Raporu_new.pdf|title=Ermeni K\u00fclt\u00fcr Varl\u0131klar\u0131yla Adana|publisher=HDV Yay\u0131nlar\u0131|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>, all devastated the city in the early 20th century. After the eviction of Armenians and Greeks, most of the city's private properties were confiscated in 1923 and were granted to the Muslim/Turks who recently had migrated into the city.  After a standstill period, city's economy again boomed in 1950s with the construction of the [[Seyhan Dam]], and the growth continued until 1980s.\n\nAdana in the 21st century, are a center for regional trade, healthcare, public and private services. Agriculture and logistics are significant sectors of the city. Economic decline caused by national policies and de-industrialization since 1990s is reversing, as the city is gaining momentum with the fairs, festivals and entertainment life. Though not competing at the top level, the rivalry between the city's football clubs, [[Adanaspor]] and [[Adana Demirspor]], is getting national attraction as being the [[Adana football derby|only citywide derby]] of [[Turkey]] that is rooted in socio-economic divisions.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Adana1.jpg|thumb|Eskibaraj Dam Lake on [[Seyhan River]].]]\n\nAdana is located at the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, where it serves as the gateway to the Cilicia plain. This large stretch of flat, fertile land lies southeast of the [[Taurus Mountains]].\n\nFrom Adana, crossing the Cilicia westwards, the road from Tarsus enters the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, eventually reaching an altitude of nearly {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. It goes through the famous [[Cilician Gates]], the rocky pass through which armies have coursed since the dawn of history, and continues to the Anatolian plain.\n\nThe north of the city is surrounded by the Seyhan reservoir. The Seyhan Dam, completed in 1956, was constructed for hydroelectric power and to irrigate the lower \u00c7ukurova plain. Two irrigation channels in the city flow to the plain, passing through the city center from east to west. There is another canal for irrigating the Y\u00fcre\u011fir plain to the southeast of the city.\n\nThe [[37th parallel north]] passes through the city.\n\n===Climate===\nAdana has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) under both the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] classification, and a dry-hot summer subtropical climate (Csa) under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification. Winters are mild and wet. Summers are long, hot, humid and dry. The highest recorded temperature was on 8 July 1978 at {{convert|45.6|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}.

It is considered to be the oldest city of Cilicia. A place called ''Adana'' is mentioned by name in a [[Sumer]]ian epic, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], but the geography of this work is too imprecise to identify its location.\n\n===Ancient times===\nFirst known people living in Adana and area were the [[Luwians]]. They controlled the Mediterranean coasts of Anatolia roughly from 3000BC to around 1600BC. [[Hittites]] took over the region which came to be known as [[Kizzuwatna]]. Inhabited by Luwians and [[Hurrians]],  Kizzuwatna had an autonomous governance under the Hittites protection, but they had a brief independent period from 1500s to 1420s.  According to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] inscription of [[Kava]], found in [[Hattusa]] ([[Bo\u011fazkale]]), [[Kizzuwatna]] was the kingdom that ruled Adana, under the protection of the Hittites by 1335 BC. At that time, the name of the city was ''Uru Adaniyya'', and the inhabitants were called [[Denyen|Danuna]]. Beginning with the collapse of the [[Hittite Empire]] c. 1191\u20131189 BC, relatively unknown [[Sea Peoples]] took control of the plain until around 900BC. Then after, [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite States]] founded in the region and Adana was the center of [[Quw\u00ea]] state. Quw\u00ea and other states were protected by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], though they had independent periods. After the Greek migration to Cilicia in the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the dynasty of [[Mopsus|Mopsos]]<ref name=\"Fox-211ff\">Fox, Robin Lane (2009) ''Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer'' Alfred A. Knopf, , New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9k8Frkhiq_MC&pg=PA211 pages 211-224], {{ISBN|978-0-679-44431-2}}</ref> and Adana was established as the capital. Bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries founded in  [[Mopsuestia]] were written both in Indo-European [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and West Semitic [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. Assyrians took the control of the regions several times until their collapse in 612BC. The region appeared in Assyrian inscriptions as ''Hilikku'', in which the Cilicia name derived from. Cilicians founded the [[Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)|Kingdom of Cilicia]] by the efforts of [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]]. The kingdom were independent until the invasion of [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 549, then after became an autonomous [[satrapy]] of Achaemenids and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]]. After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s death, for a time, Adana fell under [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic dominion]], but finally came to the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Seleucids ruled Adana until the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] made Cilicia their vassal state in  83BC.\n\n===Roman-Byzantine, Islamic and Armenian era===\n[[Pompey]] took over entire Cilicia and organized it as a [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64BC. Adana was of relatively minor importance during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]'s influential period, while nearby Tarsus was the [[metropolis]] of the area. During the era of [[Pompey]], the city was used as a prison for the pirates of Cilicia. The [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] was built in the early 2nd century, and for several centuries thereafter, the city was a [[wikt:way station|waystation]] on a Roman military road leading to the East. After the permanent split of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, the area became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and was probably developed during the time of [[Julian the Apostate]]. With the construction of large bridges, roads, government buildings, irrigation and plantation, Adana and Cilicia became the most developed and important trade centers of the region. \n\nAdana was a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of Tarsus, but was raised to the rank of autocephalous archdiocese after 680, the year in which its bishop appeared as a simple bishop at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]], but before its listing in a 10th-century ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' as an archdiocese.The Bishop Paulinus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Piso was among the [[Arianism]]-inclined bishops at the [[Council of Sardica]] (344) who withdrew and set up their own council at Philippopolis; he later returned to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodoxy]] and signed the profession of [[Nicene Creed|Nicene faith]] at a synod in Antioch in 363. Cyriacus was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Anatolius is mentioned in a letter of Saint [[John Chrysostom]]. Cyrillus was at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 and at a synod in Tarsus in 434.

In 746, profiting by the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate, Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] took control of Adana in 746. [[Abbasid Caliphate]] took over the rule of the region from Byzantine  after [[Al-Mansur]]'s inauguration to caliph in 756. With the Abbasid rule, Muslims for the first time started settling in Cilicia. Abandoned for more than 50 years, Adana was garrisoned and re-built from 758 to 760. To form a [[Al-Awasim|Thugh\u016br]] on the Byzantine frontier, Cilicia was colonized with the Turkic Say\u0101bija tribe from [[Khorasan]].

The city became part of the [[Seleucia (theme)|Seleucia theme]]. After the defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] was removed from reign by a coup. He then gathered a troop to regain his power, though got defeated and had to retreat his troop to Adana. He was forced to surrender by the Garrison in Adana upon receiving assurances of his personal safety. [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], the founder of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] annexed Adana, in his campaign in 1084. The city remained under Turkish rule until it was captured by the forces of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Principality of Cilicia]] in 1132, under its king, [[Leo I of Armenia|Leo I]]. It was taken by [[Byzantine]] forces in 1137, but the Armenians regained it around 1170. In 1268, a [[1268 Cilicia earthquake|devastating earthquake]] destroyed much of the city. Adana was rebuilt and remained a part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia until 1359, when the city was ceded to the T\u00fcrkmen supported [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] who marched into Cilicia and captured the plain. Surviving Armenians of the severe depopulation caused by the [[Black Death]] which reached the city in 1348, fled to [[Cyprus]] after the ceding.\n\n===Turkish era=== \n[[File:Adana Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] forces entering the city. Adana Castle and the city walls seen behind were demolished by them in 1836.]]\nThe Mamluks built garrisons in Tarsus, [[Yumurtal\u0131k|Ayas]] port and [[Sarvandikar]], and left the administration of Adana plain to [[Oghuz Turks|Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks]] who already formed a Mamluk authorized ''T\u00fcrkmen Emirate'' in [[Camili, Y\u00fcre\u011fir|Camili]] area in 1352, just southeast of Adana. The [[Amir]], Ramazan Beg, designated Adana as the capital, and led the Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks to settle in the city. The emirate which later on known as the [[Ramadanid Emirate]], played a key role in the 15th-century Ottoman-Mamluk relations by being a [[Al-Awasim#Mamluk\u2013Turkmen frontier|Mamluk al-'Awasim]]. In 1517, Selim I incorporated the beylik into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state. The beys of Ramadanids held the administration of the new Ottoman sanjak of Adana in a hereditary manner until 1608.\n\n[[File:Adana Armenian Quarter.jpg|thumb|Armenian Quarter in the late 19th century]]\n[[File:The City of Adana.svg|thumb|left|Adana in 1909]]\n[[File:Adana from the river in 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|River mansions]]\n[[File:Adana Armenian Protestant Church.jpg|thumb|right|Protestant Church founded by American missioanaries (demolished in 1970s)]]\n[[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] ended the Ramadanid administration of Adana sanjak in 1608, and ruled it directly from Constantinople then after. The autonomous sanjak was then split from the [[Aleppo Eyalet]] and established as a new province under the name of [[Adana Eyalet]]. A governor was appointed to administer the province. In late 1832, [[Egypt Eyalet|Eyalet of Egypt]] [[wali|Vali]] [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] invaded [[Syria]], and reached Cilicia. The [[Convention of K\u00fctahya]] that was signed on 14 May 1833, ceded Cilicia to the ''de facto'' independent [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]. At the time of ceding, the Adana population of 13,000 hardly received any urban services.

Factories were shut down and the economy almost came to a standstill in 1915, after the genocide of Armenians who ran most of the businesses in the city. Foundation of the republic, again accelerated the growth of industrialization by re-activation of closed plants and opening of state-owned ones. With the construction of [[Seyhan Dam]] and improvements in agricultural techniques, there was an explosive growth in agricultural production during the 1950s. Large-scale industries were built along D-400 state road and Karata\u015f road.

Among the people with faith, the majority of the residents adhere to [[Sunni Islam]]. The majority of Turks, most of the Kurds and some of the Arabs are Sunni Muslim. Adana is also a stronghold of [[Alevism]], many Alevis having moved to the city from [[Kahramanmara\u015f]] after the [[Mara\u015f Massacre|incidents in 1978]]. Arabs of Adana are mostly [[Alawites in Turkey|Alawi]], which is often confused with Alevis. Alawi Arabs are locally known as [[Nusayri]] or ''Fellah''.

The city grew rapidly during that period with many new neighborhoods being built. Most of the historical landmarks of Adana were built during this period, thus [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]] and [[Seljuqid]] architecture are dominant in Adana's architectural history. [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] is the only remaining landmark from the Roman-Byzantine era, and few public buildings were built during Ottoman rule. Adana is home to modern Turkey's historic Armenian architecture, which can be found behind the city's central modern buildings.\n\nThe first traces of settlement in the quarter of [[Tepeba\u011f]], can be traced to the [[neolithic age]]. The quarter is next to the Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc stone bridge, situated on a hill which gave its name Tepeba\u011f (Garden on the hill). The city administration has launched a campaign to preserve the heritage of this area, particularly the Ottoman houses.

In the 1960s, rapid industrialization brought more men to pavyons not only from the city, but from a wide region including Istanbul and Ankara, thus Adana was named ''Pavyon Capital of Turkey''. Many popular singers took the stage at and owe their fame to the pavyons of Adana.\n\nPavyons led the way to Western-style pubs and night clubs by the late 1980s with the socio-economic changes in Adana. The traditional entertainment district is Sular, near Central Station, but the pubs and clubs nowadays are spread throughout the city. The bigger clubs such as Life Legend, Uptown, Casara and Lava host world star singers at their elegant locations, mostly along the river and the lake. There are still two active pavyons, Afrodit and Maksim, but adult entertainment is directed mostly to what is known locally as tele-bars. Tele-bars are licensed as regular pubs, but function as places where bargirls entertain customers and usually hook with them afterwards. There are around 20 tele-bars mainly in the city center and around the old dam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=12 | title = Tele-bar Furyas\u0131 (Turkish)|author=\u0130brahim Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi}}</ref>\n\nA hundred-year-long tradition of [[Adana Kebab|kebab]], liver and [[rak\u0131]] in the Kazanc\u0131lar Bazaar, with street music and dances, turned into a festival since 2010, with all-night entertainment.

The square shape of the city, city center's location right at the center of the square and the river running straight north\u2013south in the middle of the city create further advantage for cycling as a means of transportation. Compact urban form due to dominance of high-rise buildings that are closely built, especially in Seyhan and \u00c7ukurova districts, make cycling from any end of the city to the city center to take less than 40 minutes. Despite all the advantages, car-oriented urban planning since the 1950s caused cycling to take a minor part in commuting to work or school. There are no bike lanes, but there are two bike paths, one along Fuzuli Street, the other along M. Kemalpa\u015fa Boulevard\u2014the latter not used by cyclists at all. Bicycles for commuting are currently only used by residents of low-income neighborhoods.

The rise in car ownership not only caused high traffic, but also led to drivers parking their cars on the sidewalks. The city currently has no car-free squares or streets other than a few narrow ones. There are plans to convert both ends of Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc to squares and widen the sidewalks in the old town where it is difficult to walk at the peddler-invaded narrow sidewalks. By far the most [[Walkability|pedestrian friendly]] street of the city is Turgut \u00d6zal Boulevard; Kenan Evren and other major streets in \u00c7ukurova district are also very convenient for

The region includes the provinces of [[Mersin Province|Mersin]], [[Adana Province|Adana]], [[Osmaniye Province|Osmaniye]] and [[Hatay Province|Hatay]]. Adding the large population centers surrounding Cilicia, more than 10 million people reside within 2-hours drive from the Adana city center.\n\nThroughout the history, Adana were a market town at the Cilicia plain and one of the gateways from Europe to the Middle East, as it provided the only access on the wide Seyhan river. The city turned into a power house of Cilicia with the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkic]] takeover in 1359. The city remained as the capital of the [[Ramadanid Emirate]] until 1608, and then the regional administrative center for the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Turkey]], and shortly for the [[Cilicia#French Cilicia|French Cilicia]]. Economically a modest town until 1861 with a population of roughly 15000, the city boomed with the breakdown of the [[American Civil War]], as becoming a new center for supplying cotton and cotton related products to Europe. Traditionally a town populated by Armenians and Turks; influx of [[Armenians]], Turks, [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Alawites]] at this period, made the city one of the most diverse cities of [[Anatolia]]. Economic, social and cultural growth were halted by the [[Adana massacre]], the [[Armenian Genocide]] and the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]]<ref name=\"HrantAdana\">{{cite web|url=https://hrantdink.org/attachments/article/1398/Adana_Raporu_new.pdf|title=Ermeni K\u00fclt\u00fcr Varl\u0131klar\u0131yla Adana|publisher=HDV Yay\u0131nlar\u0131|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>, all devastated the city in the early 20th century. After the eviction of Armenians and Greeks, most of the city's private properties were confiscated in 1923 and were granted to the Muslim/Turks who recently had migrated into the city.  After a standstill period, city's economy again boomed in 1950s with the construction of the [[Seyhan Dam]], and the growth continued until 1980s.\n\nAdana in the 21st century, are a center for regional trade, healthcare, public and private services. Agriculture and logistics are significant sectors of the city. Economic decline caused by national policies and de-industrialization since 1990s is reversing, as the city is gaining momentum with the fairs, festivals and entertainment life. Though not competing at the top level, the rivalry between the city's football clubs, [[Adanaspor]] and [[Adana Demirspor]], is getting national attraction as being the [[Adana football derby|only citywide derby]] of [[Turkey]] that is rooted in socio-economic divisions.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Adana1.jpg|thumb|Eskibaraj Dam Lake on [[Seyhan River]].]]\n\nAdana is located at the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, where it serves as the gateway to the Cilicia plain. This large stretch of flat, fertile land lies southeast of the [[Taurus Mountains]].\n\nFrom Adana, crossing the Cilicia westwards, the road from Tarsus enters the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, eventually reaching an altitude of nearly {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. It goes through the famous [[Cilician Gates]], the rocky pass through which armies have coursed since the dawn of history, and continues to the Anatolian plain.\n\nThe north of the city is surrounded by the Seyhan reservoir. The Seyhan Dam, completed in 1956, was constructed for hydroelectric power and to irrigate the lower \u00c7ukurova plain. Two irrigation channels in the city flow to the plain, passing through the city center from east to west. There is another canal for irrigating the Y\u00fcre\u011fir plain to the southeast of the city.\n\nThe [[37th parallel north]] passes through the city.\n\n===Climate===\nAdana has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) under both the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] classification, and a dry-hot summer subtropical climate (Csa) under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification. Winters are mild and wet. Summers are long, hot, humid and dry. The highest recorded temperature was on 8 July 1978 at {{convert|45.6|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}.

It is considered to be the oldest city of Cilicia. A place called ''Adana'' is mentioned by name in a [[Sumer]]ian epic, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], but the geography of this work is too imprecise to identify its location.\n\n===Ancient times===\nFirst known people living in Adana and area were the [[Luwians]]. They controlled the Mediterranean coasts of Anatolia roughly from 3000BC to around 1600BC. [[Hittites]] took over the region which came to be known as [[Kizzuwatna]]. Inhabited by Luwians and [[Hurrians]],  Kizzuwatna had an autonomous governance under the Hittites protection, but they had a brief independent period from 1500s to 1420s.  According to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] inscription of [[Kava]], found in [[Hattusa]] ([[Bo\u011fazkale]]), [[Kizzuwatna]] was the kingdom that ruled Adana, under the protection of the Hittites by 1335 BC. At that time, the name of the city was ''Uru Adaniyya'', and the inhabitants were called [[Denyen|Danuna]]. Beginning with the collapse of the [[Hittite Empire]] c. 1191\u20131189 BC, relatively unknown [[Sea Peoples]] took control of the plain until around 900BC. Then after, [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite States]] founded in the region and Adana was the center of [[Quw\u00ea]] state. Quw\u00ea and other states were protected by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], though they had independent periods. After the Greek migration to Cilicia in the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the dynasty of [[Mopsus|Mopsos]]<ref name=\"Fox-211ff\">Fox, Robin Lane (2009) ''Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer'' Alfred A. Knopf, , New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9k8Frkhiq_MC&pg=PA211 pages 211-224], {{ISBN|978-0-679-44431-2}}</ref> and Adana was established as the capital. Bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries founded in  [[Mopsuestia]] were written both in Indo-European [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and West Semitic [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. Assyrians took the control of the regions several times until their collapse in 612BC. The region appeared in Assyrian inscriptions as ''Hilikku'', in which the Cilicia name derived from. Cilicians founded the [[Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)|Kingdom of Cilicia]] by the efforts of [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]]. The kingdom were independent until the invasion of [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 549, then after became an autonomous [[satrapy]] of Achaemenids and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]]. After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s death, for a time, Adana fell under [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic dominion]], but finally came to the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Seleucids ruled Adana until the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] made Cilicia their vassal state in  83BC.\n\n===Roman-Byzantine, Islamic and Armenian era===\n[[Pompey]] took over entire Cilicia and organized it as a [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64BC. Adana was of relatively minor importance during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]'s influential period, while nearby Tarsus was the [[metropolis]] of the area. During the era of [[Pompey]], the city was used as a prison for the pirates of Cilicia. The [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] was built in the early 2nd century, and for several centuries thereafter, the city was a [[wikt:way station|waystation]] on a Roman military road leading to the East. After the permanent split of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, the area became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and was probably developed during the time of [[Julian the Apostate]]. With the construction of large bridges, roads, government buildings, irrigation and plantation, Adana and Cilicia became the most developed and important trade centers of the region. \n\nAdana was a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of Tarsus, but was raised to the rank of autocephalous archdiocese after 680, the year in which its bishop appeared as a simple bishop at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]], but before its listing in a 10th-century ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' as an archdiocese.The Bishop Paulinus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Piso was among the [[Arianism]]-inclined bishops at the [[Council of Sardica]] (344) who withdrew and set up their own council at Philippopolis; he later returned to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodoxy]] and signed the profession of [[Nicene Creed|Nicene faith]] at a synod in Antioch in 363. Cyriacus was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Anatolius is mentioned in a letter of Saint [[John Chrysostom]]. Cyrillus was at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 and at a synod in Tarsus in 434.

In 746, profiting by the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate, Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] took control of Adana in 746. [[Abbasid Caliphate]] took over the rule of the region from Byzantine  after [[Al-Mansur]]'s inauguration to caliph in 756. With the Abbasid rule, Muslims for the first time started settling in Cilicia. Abandoned for more than 50 years, Adana was garrisoned and re-built from 758 to 760. To form a [[Al-Awasim|Thugh\u016br]] on the Byzantine frontier, Cilicia was colonized with the Turkic Say\u0101bija tribe from [[Khorasan]].

The city became part of the [[Seleucia (theme)|Seleucia theme]]. After the defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] was removed from reign by a coup. He then gathered a troop to regain his power, though got defeated and had to retreat his troop to Adana. He was forced to surrender by the Garrison in Adana upon receiving assurances of his personal safety. [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], the founder of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] annexed Adana, in his campaign in 1084. The city remained under Turkish rule until it was captured by the forces of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Principality of Cilicia]] in 1132, under its king, [[Leo I of Armenia|Leo I]]. It was taken by [[Byzantine]] forces in 1137, but the Armenians regained it around 1170. In 1268, a [[1268 Cilicia earthquake|devastating earthquake]] destroyed much of the city. Adana was rebuilt and remained a part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia until 1359, when the city was ceded to the T\u00fcrkmen supported [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] who marched into Cilicia and captured the plain. Remaining Armenians from the severe depopulation caused by the [[Black Death]] which reached the city in 1348, fled to [[Cyprus]] after the ceding.\n\n===Turkish era=== \n[[File:Adana Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] forces entering the city. Adana Castle and the city walls seen behind were demolished by them in 1836.]]\nThe Mamluks built garrisons in Tarsus, [[Yumurtal\u0131k|Ayas]] port and [[Sarvandikar]], and left the administration of Adana plain to [[Oghuz Turks|Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks]] who already formed a Mamluk authorized ''T\u00fcrkmen Emirate'' in [[Camili, Y\u00fcre\u011fir|Camili]] area in 1352, just southeast of Adana. The [[Amir]], Ramazan Beg, designated Adana as the capital, and led the Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks to settle in the city. The emirate which later on known as the [[Ramadanid Emirate]], played a key role in the 15th-century Ottoman-Mamluk relations by being a [[Al-Awasim#Mamluk\u2013Turkmen frontier|Mamluk al-'Awasim]]. In 1517, Selim I incorporated the beylik into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state. The beys of Ramadanids held the administration of the new Ottoman sanjak of Adana in a hereditary manner until 1608.\n\n[[File:Adana Armenian Quarter.jpg|thumb|Armenian Quarter in the late 19th century]]\n[[File:The City of Adana.svg|thumb|left|Adana in 1909]]\n[[File:Adana from the river in 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|River mansions]]\n[[File:Adana Armenian Protestant Church.jpg|thumb|right|Protestant Church founded by American missioanaries (demolished in 1970s)]]\n[[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] ended the Ramadanid administration of Adana sanjak in 1608, and ruled it directly from Constantinople then after. The autonomous sanjak was then split from the [[Aleppo Eyalet]] and established as a new province under the name of [[Adana Eyalet]]. A governor was appointed to administer the province. In late 1832, [[Egypt Eyalet|Eyalet of Egypt]] [[wali|Vali]] [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] invaded [[Syria]], and reached Cilicia. The [[Convention of K\u00fctahya]] that was signed on 14 May 1833, ceded Cilicia to the ''de facto'' independent [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]. At the time of ceding, the Adana population of 13,000 hardly received any urban services. First neighborhood ([[Kar\u015f\u0131yaka, Adana|Kar\u015f\u0131yaka]]) east of the river was founded and [[Alawites]] brought here from Syria to work at the flourishing agricultural lands. \u0130brahim Pa\u015fa, the son of Muhammed Ali Pa\u015fa, demolished the Adana Castle and the city walls in 1836.

Adana became the center of cotton trade and one of the most economically strong cities of the Empire within decades.

Factories were shut down and the economy almost came to a standstill in 1915, after the genocide of Armenians who ran most of the businesses in the city. Foundation of the republic, again accelerated the growth of industrialization by re-activation of closed plants and opening of state-owned ones. With the construction of [[Seyhan Dam]] and improvements in agricultural techniques, there was an explosive growth in agricultural production during the 1950s. Large-scale industries were built along D-400 state road and Karata\u015f road.

Among the people with faith, the majority of the residents adhere to [[Sunni Islam]]. The majority of Turks, most of the Kurds and some of the Arabs are Sunni Muslim. Adana is also a stronghold of [[Alevism]], many Alevis having moved to the city from [[Kahramanmara\u015f]] after the [[Mara\u015f Massacre|incidents in 1978]]. Arabs of Adana are mostly [[Alawites in Turkey|Alawi]], which is often confused with Alevis. Alawi Arabs are locally known as [[Nusayri]] or ''Fellah''.

The city grew rapidly during that period with many new neighborhoods being built. Most of the historical landmarks of Adana were built during this period, thus [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]] and [[Seljuqid]] architecture are dominant in Adana's architectural history. [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] is the only remaining landmark from the Roman-Byzantine era, and few public buildings were built during Ottoman rule. Adana is home to modern Turkey's historic Armenian architecture, which can be found behind the city's central modern buildings.\n\nThe first traces of settlement in the quarter of [[Tepeba\u011f]], can be traced to the [[neolithic age]]. The quarter is next to the Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc stone bridge, situated on a hill which gave its name Tepeba\u011f (Garden on the hill). The city administration has launched a campaign to preserve the heritage of this area, particularly the Ottoman houses.

In the 1960s, rapid industrialization brought more men to pavyons not only from the city, but from a wide region including Istanbul and Ankara, thus Adana was named ''Pavyon Capital of Turkey''. Many popular singers took the stage at and owe their fame to the pavyons of Adana.\n\nPavyons led the way to Western-style pubs and night clubs by the late 1980s with the socio-economic changes in Adana. The traditional entertainment district is Sular, near Central Station, but the pubs and clubs nowadays are spread throughout the city. The bigger clubs such as Life Legend, Uptown, Casara and Lava host world star singers at their elegant locations, mostly along the river and the lake. There are still two active pavyons, Afrodit and Maksim, but adult entertainment is directed mostly to what is known locally as tele-bars. Tele-bars are licensed as regular pubs, but function as places where bargirls entertain customers and usually hook with them afterwards. There are around 20 tele-bars mainly in the city center and around the old dam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=12 | title = Tele-bar Furyas\u0131 (Turkish)|author=\u0130brahim Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi}}</ref>\n\nA hundred-year-long tradition of [[Adana Kebab|kebab]], liver and [[rak\u0131]] in the Kazanc\u0131lar Bazaar, with street music and dances, turned into a festival since 2010, with all-night entertainment.

Compact urban form due to dominance of high-rise buildings that are closely built, especially in Seyhan and \u00c7ukurova districts, make cycling from any end of the city to the city center to take less than 40 minutes. Despite all the advantages, car-oriented urban planning since the 1950s caused cycling to take a minor part in commuting to work or school. There are no bike lanes, but there are two bike paths, one along Fuzuli Street, the other along M. Kemalpa\u015fa Boulevard\u2014the latter not used by cyclists at all.

The rise in car ownership not only caused high traffic, but also led to drivers parking their cars on the sidewalks. The city currently has no car-free squares or streets other than a few narrow ones. There are plans to convert both ends of Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc to squares and widen the sidewalks in the old town where it is difficult to walk at the peddler-invaded narrow sidewalks. By far the most [[Walkability|pedestrian friendly]] street of the city is Turgut \u00d6zal Boulevard; Kenan Evren and other major streets in \u00c7ukurova district are also very convenient for walking.\n\n==International relations==\nAdana is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\nEurope\n*{{flagicon|ESP}} [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], Spain\n*{{flagicon|NMK}} [[Skopje]], North Macedonia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Livorno]], Italy\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Debrecen]], Hungary<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/adana-ve-debrecen-kardes-sehir-oldu-40929419|title=Adana ve Debrecen karde\u015f \u015fehir oldu|website=H\u00fcrriyet}}</ref>\n|\nAsia\n*{{flagicon|ISR}} [[Beersheba]], Israel<ref name=\"muni-sister\">{{cite web|title=International Relations of the City of Beersheba |url=http://www.beer-sheva.muni.il/ArimTeomot.asp |publisher=Beersheba Municipality |accessdate=6 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209131035/http://www.beer-sheva.muni.il/ArimTeomot.asp |archivedate=9 December 2008 |url-status=dead |language=he }}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|KAZ}} [[Shymkent]], Kazakhstan\n*{{flagicon|JPN}} [[Sapporo]], Japan\n*{{flagicon|MNG}} [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia\n|}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 2213.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Side view\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 844.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Entrance to courtyard\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 8573.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Entrance to courtyard's backside\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 3570.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Exterior\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque3636.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Courtyard\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 3638.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Mihrab and minber\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 5720.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Woodwork under balcony\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque3645.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Woodwork under balcony\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7586.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami From west\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7588.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami From east\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7589.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami Interior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4990.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Exterior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4995.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Interior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4993.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Decorative stonework\nFile:Adana Yesil Mescit 4989.jpg|Adana Yesil Mescit Exterior\nFile:Adana Yesil Mescit 4988.jpg|Adana Yesil Mescit Window decoration\nFile:Adana Alidede Mosque 1625.jpg|Adana Alidede Mosque Exterior\nFile:Adana Alidede Mosque 3591.jpg|Adana Alidede Mosque Interior\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Turkey}}\n*[[List of people from Adana]]\n*[[List of twin towns and sister cities in Turkey]]\n*[[List of mayors of Adana]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book|title = The Helsinki Atlas of the Near East in the Neo-Assyrian Period |ISBN=951-45-9050-3|first1=Simo|last= Parpola|author-link1=Simo Parpola |first2= Michael|last2= Porter|author-link2=Michael Porter|publisher=[[Gazetteer]]|location=Helsinki, Finland|year=2001}}\n*{{Cite book|title = The Turks Today|ISBN=1-58567-756-6|first=Andrew |last=Mango|author-link=Andrew Mango|publisher=The Overlook Press|location=New York City|year=2004}}\n*{{Cite book|title = [[Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World]] |ISBN=0-691-03169-X |first=Richard |last=Talbert|author-link=Richard Talbert|publisher=The Overlook Press|location=New York City|year=2004}}\n*{{Cite book|title = \u0531\u057f\u0561\u0576\u0561\u0575\u056b \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0581 \u054a\u0561\u057f\u0574\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576 |trans-title=The History of the Armenians of Adana|first=Puzant |last=Yeghiayan |location= Beirut |publisher=Union of Armenian Compatriots of Adana|year=1970|language=hy}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Adana}}\n{{Commonscat}}\n* [http://adana.gov.tr/ Governorship of Adana]\n* [http://adana.bel.tr Adana Metropolitan Municipality]\n* [http://www.adana-to.org.tr Adana Trade and Industry Chamber]\n\n{{City of Adana |state=collapsed}}\n{{Districts of Turkey|provname=Adana}}\n{{Metropolitan centers in Turkey}}\n{{Syro-Hittite states}}\n{{Largest cities in Turkey}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Adana| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Districts of Adana Province]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Adana Province]]\n[[Category:Populated places along the Silk Road]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in the Mediterranean Region, Turkey]]\n[[Category:Hittite cities]]\n[[Category:Roman sites in Turkey]]\n", "name_user": "Seyhan668", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRoman-Byzantine, Islamic and Armenian era", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adana"}

It was one of the most commercially successful games from the video arcade's [[Golden age of arcade video games|golden age]]. The player fights off centipedes, spiders, scorpions and fleas, completing a round after eliminating the centipede that winds down the playing field.\n\n''Centipede'' was ported to Atari's own [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]], [[Atari 7800]], and [[Atari 8-bit family]]. Under the [[Atarisoft]] label, the game was sold for the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ColecoVision]], [[VIC-20]], [[IBM PC]] (as a [[PC booter|booter]]), [[Intellivision]], and [[TI-99/4A]]. [[Superior Software]] published the port for the [[BBC Micro]]. Versions for the [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] were also produced, as well as a version for the short-lived [[Game.com]] was also made, developed by [[Handheld Games]] and published by [[Tiger Electronics]].\n\n==Plot==\nAccording to the game's instruction manual from the Atari 2600 port, the player takes the role of a [[garden gnome]] armed with a [[magic wand]] and has to defend his mushroom forest from the invasion of giant centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Centipede arcade.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of Centipede's gameplay]]\nIn the original arcade version: The player's [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] is represented by a small insect-like head at the bottom of the screen called the ''Bug Blaster''. The player moves it around the bottom area of the screen with a [[trackball]] and fires small [[Dart (missile)|darts]] at a segmented [[centipede]] advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of [[mushroom]]s.  Each segment of the centipede become a mushroom when shot; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the screen, with the rear piece sprouting its own head. If the centipede head is destroyed, the segment behind it becomes the next head. Shooting the head is worth 100 points while the other segments are 10. The centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right.  When it touches a mushroom or reached the edge of the screen, it descends one level and reverses direction. The player can destroy mushrooms by shooting them, but each takes four shots to destroy. At higher levels, the screen can become increasingly crowded with mushrooms due to player/enemy actions, causing the centipede to descend more rapidly.\n[[File:Centipede Arcade Automat.jpg|thumb|Arcade machine]]\nOnce the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it moves back and forth within the player area and one-segment \"head\" centipedes will periodically appear from the side. This continues until the player has eliminated both the original centipede and all heads.  When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, another one enters from the top of the screen. The initial centipede is 10 or 12 segments long, including the head; each successive centipede is one segment shorter and accompanied by one detached, faster-moving head. This pattern continues until all segments are separate heads, after which it repeats with a single full-length centipede.\n\nThe player also encounters other creatures besides the centipedes. [[Flea]]s drop vertically and disappear upon touching the bottom of the screen, occasionally leaving a trail of mushrooms in their path when only a few mushrooms are in the player movement area; they are worth 200 points and takes two shots to destroy. [[Spider]]s move across the player area in a zig-zag pattern and eat some of the mushrooms; they are worth 300, 600, or 900 points depending on how close the player shoots it. [[Scorpion]]s move horizontally across the screen, turning every mushroom they touch into poison mushrooms. Scorpions are also worth the most points of all enemies with 1,000 points each. A centipede touching a poison mushroom will attack straight down toward the bottom, then return to normal behavior upon reaching it. This \"poisoned\" centipede can be both beneficial and detrimental to the player; the player can destroy them rapidly as it descends down, while at the same time, they can be very challenging to avoid, especially if already split into multiple segments.\n\nThe Bug Blaster will be destroyed when hit by any enemy, after which any poisonous or partially damaged mushrooms revert to normal. 5 points are awarded for each regenerated mushroom. The player gains extra lives every 12,000 points (10,000 in several ported versions).\n\n==Development==\n[[Dona Bailey]] and [[Ed Logg]] developed ''Centipede'' for Atari.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://vancouverdesi.com/business/dona-bailey-a-rare-female-programmer-in-ataris-early-days-recalls-birth-of-centipede/ |title=Dona Bailey, a rare female programmer in Atari's early days, recalls birth of 'Centipede' |agency=Associated Press / DesiWireFeed |first=Barbara |last=Ortutay |date=June 30, 2012 |publisher=VancouverDesi.com |accessdate=July 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009025633/http://vancouverdesi.com/business/dona-bailey-a-rare-female-programmer-in-ataris-early-days-recalls-birth-of-centipede/ |archivedate=October 9, 2012 }}</ref> Logg, a supervisor, said that he did the design, while Bailey did about half of the programming.<ref name=\"rouse2010\">{{Cite book |title=Game Design: Theory and Practice |last=Rouse |first=Richard III |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |year=2010 |isbn=9781449633455 |pages=93\u201394 |chapter=Chapter 6: Interview: Ed Logg |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGePP1Nu_P8C&lpg=PA94&ots=T_fP0ICkAn&pg=PA93#v=onepage&f=false}}</ref> Bailey was one of the few female game programmers in the industry.<ref name=\"supercade\">{{Cite book\n |last              = Burnham\n |first             = Van\n |publication-date  = 2001\n |title             = Supercade: a visual history of the videogame age 1971-1984\n |location = Cambridge, MA\n |publisher         = MIT Press\n |page              = 220\n |isbn              = 0-262-02492-6\n |url               = http://www.supercade.com/\n |year              = 2001\n |access-date       = 2008-12-14\n |archive-url       = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219081930/http://www.supercade.com/\n |archive-date      = 2008-12-19\n |url-status          = live\n}}</ref> Logg stated that the game was intended to attract women players; he believed that its design was not biased by sex, unlike a fighting or sports game.

It was one of the most commercially successful games from the video arcade's [[Golden age of arcade video games|golden age]]. The player fights off centipedes, spiders, scorpions and fleas, completing a round after eliminating the centipede that winds down the playing field.\n\n''Centipede'' was ported to Atari's own [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 5200]], [[Atari 7800]], and [[Atari 8-bit family]]. Under the [[Atarisoft]] label, the game was sold for the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ColecoVision]], [[VIC-20]], [[IBM PC]] (as a [[PC booter|booter]]), [[Intellivision]], and [[TI-99/4A]]. [[Superior Software]] published the port for the [[BBC Micro]]. Versions for the [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] were also produced, as well as a version for the short-lived [[Game.com]] was also made, developed by [[Handheld Games]] and published by [[Tiger Electronics]].\n\n==Plot==\nAccording to the game's instruction manual from the Atari 2600 port, the player takes the role of a [[garden gnome]] armed with a [[magic wand]] and has to defend his mushroom forest from the invasion of giant centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Centipede arcade.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of Centipede's gameplay]]\nIn the original arcade version: The player's [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] is represented by a small insect-like head at the bottom of the screen called the ''Bug Blaster''. The player moves it around the bottom area of the screen with a [[trackball]] and fires small [[Dart (missile)|darts]] at a segmented [[centipede]] advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of [[mushroom]]s.  Each segment of the centipede become a mushroom when shot; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the screen, with the rear piece sprouting its own head. If the centipede head is destroyed, the segment behind it becomes the next head. Shooting the head is worth 100 points while the other segments are 10. The centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right.  When it touches a mushroom or reached the edge of the screen, it descends one level and reverses direction. The player can destroy mushrooms by shooting them, but each takes four shots to destroy. At higher levels, the screen can become increasingly crowded with mushrooms due to player/enemy actions, causing the centipede to descend more rapidly.\n[[File:Centipede Arcade Automat.jpg|thumb|Arcade machine]]\nOnce the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it moves back and forth within the player area and one-segment \"head\" centipedes will periodically appear from the side. This continues until the player has eliminated both the original centipede and all heads.  When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, another one enters from the top of the screen. The initial centipede is 10 or 12 segments long, including the head; each successive centipede is one segment shorter and accompanied by one detached, faster-moving head. This pattern continues until all segments are separate heads, after which it repeats with a single full-length centipede.\n\nThe player also encounters other creatures besides the centipedes. [[Flea]]s drop vertically and disappear upon touching the bottom of the screen, occasionally leaving a trail of mushrooms in their path when only a few mushrooms are in the player movement area; they are worth 200 points and takes two shots to destroy. [[Spider]]s move across the player area in a zig-zag pattern and eat some of the mushrooms; they are worth 300, 600, or 900 points depending on how close the player shoots it. [[Scorpion]]s move horizontally across the screen, turning every mushroom they touch into poison mushrooms. Scorpions are also worth the most points of all enemies with 1,000 points each. A centipede touching a poison mushroom will attack straight down toward the bottom, then return to normal behavior upon reaching it. This \"poisoned\" centipede can be both beneficial and detrimental to the player; the player can destroy them rapidly as it descends down, while at the same time, they can be very challenging to avoid, especially if already split into multiple segments.\n\nThe Bug Blaster will be destroyed when hit by any enemy, after which any poisonous or partially damaged mushrooms revert to normal. 5 points are awarded for each regenerated mushroom. The player gains extra lives every 12,000 points (10,000 in several ported versions).\n\n==Development==\n[[Dona Bailey]] and [[Ed Logg]] developed ''Centipede'' for Atari.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://vancouverdesi.com/business/dona-bailey-a-rare-female-programmer-in-ataris-early-days-recalls-birth-of-centipede/ |title=Dona Bailey, a rare female programmer in Atari's early days, recalls birth of 'Centipede' |agency=Associated Press / DesiWireFeed |first=Barbara |last=Ortutay |date=June 30, 2012 |publisher=VancouverDesi.com |accessdate=July 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009025633/http://vancouverdesi.com/business/dona-bailey-a-rare-female-programmer-in-ataris-early-days-recalls-birth-of-centipede/ |archivedate=October 9, 2012 }}</ref> Logg, a supervisor, said that he did the design, while Bailey did about half of the programming.<ref name=\"rouse2010\">{{Cite book |title=Game Design: Theory and Practice |last=Rouse |first=Richard III |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |year=2010 |isbn=9781449633455 |pages=93\u201394 |chapter=Chapter 6: Interview: Ed Logg |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGePP1Nu_P8C&lpg=PA94&ots=T_fP0ICkAn&pg=PA93#v=onepage&f=false}}</ref> Bailey was one of the few female game programmers in the industry.<ref name=\"supercade\">{{Cite book\n |last              = Burnham\n |first             = Van\n |publication-date  = 2001\n |title             = Supercade: a visual history of the videogame age 1971-1984\n |location = Cambridge, MA\n |publisher         = MIT Press\n |page              = 220\n |isbn              = 0-262-02492-6\n |url               = http://www.supercade.com/\n |year              = 2001\n |access-date       = 2008-12-14\n |archive-url       = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219081930/http://www.supercade.com/\n |archive-date      = 2008-12-19\n |url-status          = live\n}}</ref> Logg stated that the game was intended to attract women players; he believed that its design was not biased by sex, unlike a fighting or sports game.

First dominated by Dutch and Germans, it was overtaken by the English in the early 19th century. Irish immigrants soon outnumbered most other ethnicities by the mid-19th century, and were followed by Italians and [[Poles]]. In the mid-to-late 20th century, the African-American population increased with thousands of people from the rural South, as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. As historian (and Albany Assemblyman) John McEneny puts it, \n{{quote|Dutch and Yankee, German and Irish, Polish and Italian, black and Chinese\u2014over the centuries Albany's heritage has reflected a succession of immigrant nationalities.

Settlers migrating from New England tipped the balance toward British ethnicity in the early 19th century.<ref name=mceneny103>McEneny (2006), p. 103</ref> Jobs on the turnpikes, canals, and railroads attracted floods of [[Irish American|Irish immigrants]] in the early 19th century, especially in the 1840s during the [[Irish potato famine]], solidifying the city's Irish base.

Their numbers were smaller than in many other eastern cities mainly because most had found manufacturing jobs at [[General Electric]] in Schenectady.<ref name=mceneny107>McEneny (2006), p. 107</ref> The Jewish community had been established early, with Sephardic Jewish members as part of the Beverwijck community.

Many of their descendants have since moved to suburban areas.<ref name=mceneny108>McEneny (2006), p. 108</ref> Immigration plummeted after the [[Immigration Act of 1924]].\n\nAlbany was also a destination of internal migration, as many African Americans moved north in their [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the rural South before and after [[World War I]] to fill industrial positions and find new opportunities. In the early years, they lived together with Italians, Jews and other immigrants in the South End, where housing was older and less expensive.<ref>[https://www.questia.com/library/p18/afro-americans-in-new-york-life-and-history/i2464161/vol-32-no-1-january Lemak, Jennifer A. \"Albany, New York and the Great Migration\"], ''Afro - Americans in New York Life and History'', Vol. 32, Iss. 1, (Jan 2008): 47-74</ref> The black community has grown as a proportion of the population since then: African Americans made up 3 percent of the city's population in 1950, 6 percent in 1960, 12 percent in 1970, and 30 percent in 2010.
