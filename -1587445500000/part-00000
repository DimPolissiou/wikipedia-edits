{"title_page": "Spanish verbs", "text_new": "{{Spanish language}}\n'''Spanish verbs''' form hi miss verga one of the more complex areas of [[Spanish grammar]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is a relatively [[synthetic language]] with a moderate to high degree of [[inflection]], which shows up mostly in [[Spanish conjugation]].\n\nAs is typical of [[verbs]] in virtually all languages, Spanish verbs express an action or a state of being of a given subject, and like verbs in most [[Indo-European languages]], Spanish verbs undergo [[inflection]] according to the following categories:\n\n* [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]: [[Past Tense|past]], [[Present tense|present]], or [[future Tense|future]]\n* [[Grammatical number|Number]]: singular or [[plural]]\n* [[Grammatical person|Person]]: first, second or third\n* [[T\u2013V_distinction#Spanish|T\u2013V distinction]]: familiar or formal\n* [[Grammatical Mood|Mood]]: [[Indicative mood|indicative]], [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], or [[Imperative mood|imperative]]\n* [[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]]: [[perfective aspect|perfective]] or [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (distinguished only in the past tense as [[preterite]] and [[imperfect]])\n* [[Grammatical Voice|Voice]]: [[Active Voice|active]] or [[Passive Voice|passive]]\n\nThe modern Spanish verb system has sixteen distinct complete<ref>\"Complete\" here means having forms for all three grammatical persons in both singular and plural.</ref> paradigms, i.e. sets of forms for each combination of tense and mood (tense refers to when the action takes place, and mood or mode refers to the mood of the subject \u2013 e.g., certainty vs. doubt), plus one incomplete<ref>\"Incomplete\", with reference to the imperative, means having forms only for the second person and the first-person plural, and lacking third-person forms.</ref> paradigm (the imperative), as well as three [[Non-finite verb|non-temporal forms]] (the infinitive, gerund, and past participle).\n\nThe fourteen regular tenses are also subdivided into seven ''simple tenses'' and seven ''compound tenses'' (also known as the perfect). The seven ''compound tenses'' are formed with the [[auxiliary verb]] ''haber'' followed by the [[past participle]]. Verbs can be used in other forms, such as the present progressive, but in grammar treatises they are not usually considered a special tense but rather [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] verbal constructions.\n\n==Accidents of a verb==\nA verbal accident is defined as one of the changes of form that a verb can undergo. Spanish verbs have five accidents. Every verb changes according to the following:\n\n===Person and number===\nSpanish verbs are conjugated in three persons, each having a singular and a plural form. In some varieties of Spanish, such as that of the [[Rioplatense Spanish|R\u00edo de la Plata Region]], [[voseo|a special form of the second person]] is used.\n\nBecause Spanish is a \"[[pro-drop language]]\", subject pronouns are often omitted.\n\n====First person====\nThe grammatical first person refers to the speaker (\"I\"). The first person plural refers to the speaker together with at least one other person.\n\n* ''(Yo) '''soy''''': \"I am\"\n* ''(Nosotros/Nosotras) '''somos''''': \"We are\"; the feminine form ''nosotras'' is used only when referring to a group that is composed entirely of females; otherwise, ''nosotros'' is used.\n\n====Second person====\nThe grammatical second person refers to the addressee, the receiver of the communication (\"you\"). Spanish has different pronouns (and verb forms) for \"you,\" depending on the relationship, familiar or formal, between speaker and addressee.\n\n'''Singular forms'''\n* ''(T\u00fa) '''eres''''': \"You are\"; familiar singular; used when addressing someone who is of close affinity (a member of the family, a close friend, a child, a pet). Also the form used to address the [[deity]].\n* ''([[Voseo|Vos]]) '''sos''''': \"You are\"; familiar singular; generally used in the same way as ''t\u00fa''. Its use is restricted to some areas of [[Hispanic America]]; where ''t\u00fa'' and ''vos'' are both used, ''vos'' is used to denote a closer affinity.\n* ''(Usted) '''es''''': \"You are\"; formal singular; used when addressing a person respectfully, someone older, someone not known to the speaker, or someone of some social distance. Although it is a second-person pronoun, it uses third-person verb forms (and object pronouns and possessives) because it developed as a contraction of ''vuestra merced'' (literally, \"your mercy\" or \"your grace\").\n\n'''Plural forms'''\n* ''(Vosotros/Vosotras) '''sois''''': \"You (all) are\"; familiar plural; used when addressing people who are of close affinity (members of the family, friends, children, pets). The feminine form ''vosotras'' is used only when addressing a group composed entirely of females; otherwise, ''vosotros'' is used. Used primarily in [[Spain]] and [[Equatoguinean Spanish|Equatorial Guinea]], though it may appear in old, formal texts from other countries, such as the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Philippines]],<ref>In [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli me tangere]]'', Salom\u00e9 uses ''vosotros'' to refer to El\u00edas and his passengers that day. In its sequel, ''[[El filibusterismo]]'', in the chapter entitled ''Risas, llantos'', Sandoval addresses his fellow students using ''vosotros''.</ref> or in the initial line of the Argentine national anthem (\"O\u00edd, mortales, el grito sagrado\").\n* ''(Ustedes) '''son''''': \"You (all) are\"; formal plural where ''vosotros'' is used; both familiar and formal plural elsewhere. Where it is strictly formal, used when addressing people respectfully or addressing people of some social distance. Like ''usted'', it uses third-person verb forms, for the same reasons.\n\n====Third person====\nThe grammatical third person refers to a person or thing other than the speaker or the addressee.\n\n'''Singular forms'''\n* ''(\u00c9l) '''es''''': \"He/it is\"; used for a male person or a thing of [[grammatical gender|masculine]] (grammatical) gender.\n* ''(Ella) '''es''''': \"She/it is\"; used for a female person or a thing of [[grammatical gender|feminine]] (grammatical) gender.\n* ''(Ello) '''es''''': \"It is\"; used to refer to [[grammatical gender|neuter]] nouns such as facts, ideas, situations, and sets of things; rarely used as an explicit subject.\n\n'''Plural forms'''\n* ''(Ellos) '''son''''':  \"They are\"; used for a group of people or things that includes at least one person or thing of [[grammatical gender|masculine]] (grammatical) gender.\n* ''(Ellas) '''son''''': \"They are\"; used for a group of people or things that are all of [[grammatical gender|feminine]] (grammatical) gender.\n\n===Mood===\nGrammatical mood is one of a set of distinctive forms that are used to signal modality. In Spanish, every verb has forms in three moods.\n\n* Indicative mood: The indicative mood, or evidential mood, is used for factual statements and positive beliefs. The Spanish conditional, although semantically expressing the dependency of one action or proposition on another, is generally considered a tense of the indicative mood, because, syntactically, it can appear in an independent clause.\n* Subjunctive mood: The subjunctive mood expresses an imagined or desired action in the past, present, or future.\n* Imperative mood: The imperative mood expresses direct commands, requests, and prohibitions. In Spanish, using the imperative mood may sound blunt or even rude, so it is often used with care.\n\n===Tense===\nThe tense of a verb indicates the time when the action occurs. It may be in the past, present, or future.\n\n=== Impersonal or non-finite forms of the verb ===\n[[Non-finite verb|Non-finite]] verb forms refer to an action or state without indicating the time or person. Spanish has three impersonal forms: the infinitive, the gerund, and the past participle.\n\n==== Infinitive ====\nThe infinitive is generally the form found in dictionaries. It corresponds to the English \"base-form\" or \"dictionary form\" and is usually indicated in English by \"to _____\" (\"to sing,\" \"to write,\" etc.). The ending of the infinitive is the basis of the names given in English to the three classes of Spanish verbs:\n\n* \"''-ar''\" verbs (''primera conjugaci\u00f3n'' [\"first conjugation\"])\n: Examples: ''hablar'' (\"to speak\"); ''cantar'' (\"to sing\"); ''bailar'' (\"to dance\")\n\n* \"''-er''\" verbs (''segunda conjugaci\u00f3n'' [\"second conjugation\"])\n: Examples: ''beber'' (\"to drink\"); ''leer'' (\"to read\"); ''comprender'' (\"to understand\")\n\n* \"''-ir''\" verbs (''tercera conjugaci\u00f3n'' [\"third conjugation\"])\n: Examples: ''vivir'' (\"to live\"); ''sentir'' (\"to feel\"); ''escribir'' (\"to write\")\n\n==== Gerund ====\nAlthough in English grammar the [[gerund]] refers to the ''-ing'' form of the verb used as a noun, in Spanish the term refers to a verb form that behaves more like an adverb. It is created by adding the following endings to the stem of the verb (i.e. the infinitive without the last two letters):\n\n* ''-ar'' verbs: '''''-ando'''''\n: Examples: ''hablando'' (\"speaking\"); ''cantando'' (\"singing\"); ''bailando'' (\"dancing\")\n\n* ''-er'' verbs: '''''-iendo'''''\n: Examples: ''bebiendo'' (\"drinking\"); ''leyendo'' (with spelling change; \"reading\"); ''comprendiendo'' (\"understanding\")\n\n* ''-ir'' verbs: '''''-iendo'''''\n: Examples: ''viviendo'' (\"living\"); ''sintiendo'' (with stem-vowel change; \"feeling\"); ''escribiendo'' (\"writing\")\nCertain verbs have irregular gerund forms:\n* Most ''-ir'' verbs undergo a [[Spanish_irregular_verbs#Vowel_raising|predictable stem-vowel change]]: ''sentir'' \u2192 ''sintiendo'', ''medir'' \u2192 ''midiendo'', ''repetir'' \u2192 ''repitiendo'', ''dormir'' \u2192 ''durmiendo'', ''morir'' \u2192 ''muriendo''. One ''-er'' verb also belongs to this group: ''poder'' \u2192 ''pudiendo''.\n* In verbs whose stem ends in a vowel, the spelling of the ''-iendo'' ending is changed to ''-yendo'':  ''o\u00edr'' \u2192 ''oyendo'', ''caer'' \u2192 ''cayendo'', ''leer'' \u2192 ''leyendo'', ''traer'' \u2192 ''trayendo'', ''construir'' \u2192 ''construyendo'', ''huir'' \u2192 ''huyendo''. The \"stemless\" verb ''ir'' belongs to this group, with ''yendo''.\n* For ''-er'' and ''-ir'' verbs whose stem ends in <\u00f1> or <ll>, the ''-iendo'' ending is reduced to ''-endo'': ''ta\u00f1er'' \u2192 ''ta\u00f1endo'', ''bullir'' \u2192 ''bullendo''.<ref>http://www.rae.es/obras-academicas/diccionarios/diccionario-de-la-lengua-espanola</ref>\n\nThe gerund has a variety of uses and can mean (with ''haciendo'', for example) \"doing/while doing/by doing/because of one's doing/through doing\" and so on. It is also used to form [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]] constructions, such as ''estoy haciendo'' (\"I am doing\"). The gerund cannot be used as an adjective and, unlike in most European languages, generally has no corresponding adjectival forms. The now-mostly archaic present participle, which ended in ''-ante'' or ''-iente'' and formerly filled this function, in some cases survives as such an adjective (e.g. ''durmiente'' (\"sleeping\"), ''interesante'' (\"interesting\")), but such cases are limited, and in cases where it does not, other constructions must be used to express the same ideas: where in English one would say \"the crying baby\", one would say in Spanish ''el beb\u00e9 que llora'' (\"the baby who's crying\"; ''llorante'' is archaic).\n\n==== Past participle ====\n{{See also|List of Spanish irregular participles}}\nThe past participle corresponds to the English ''-en'' or ''-ed'' form of the verb. It is created by adding the following endings to the verb stem:\n\n* ''-ar'' verbs: '''''-ado'''''\n: Examples: ''hablado'' (\"spoken\"); ''cantado'' (\"sung\"); ''bailado'' (\"danced\")\n\n* ''-er'' verbs: '''''-ido'''''\n: Examples: ''bebido'' (\"drunk\"); ''le\u00eddo'' (requires accent mark; \"read\"); ''comprendido'' (\"understood\")\n\n* ''-ir'' verbs,: '''''-ido'''''\n: Examples: ''vivido'' (\"lived\"); ''sentido'' (\"felt\"); ''hervido'' (\"boiled\")\n\nThe past participle, ending invariably in ''-o'', is used following the [[auxiliary verb]] ''haber'' to form the compound or perfect: ''(Yo) he '''hablado''''' (\"I have spoken\"); ''(Ellos) hab\u00edan '''hablado''''' (\"They had spoken\"); etc.\n\nWhen the past participle is used as an adjective, it inflects for both gender and number \u2013 for example, ''una lengua '''hablada''' en Espa\u00f1a'' (\"a language spoken in Spain\").\n\n===Voice===\nIn grammar, the voice of a verb describes the relationship between the action (or state) that the verb expresses and the participants identified by its arguments ([[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[Object (grammar)|object]], etc.). When the subject is the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] or doer of the action, the verb is in the active voice. When the subject is the [[Patient (grammar)|patient]], target, or undergoer of the action, it is said to be in the passive voice.\n\n===Verbal aspect===\nVerbal aspect marks whether an action is completed (perfect), a completed whole (perfective), or not yet completed (imperfective).\n\n* Perfect: In Spanish, verbs that are conjugated with '''''haber''''' (\"to have [done something]\") are in the [[perfect aspect]].\n* Perfective: In Spanish, verbs in the preterite are in the [[perfective aspect]].\n* Imperfective: In Spanish, the present, imperfect, and future tenses are in the [[imperfective aspect]].\n\n==Conjugation==\n\n{{for|a set of conjugation tables|Spanish conjugation}}\n\nIn this page, verb conjugation is illustrated with the verb ''hablar'' (\"to talk,\" \"to speak\").\n\n===The indicative===\n[[File:Tiempos verbales del indicativo.png|thumb|right|Graphic representation of Spanish verbal tenses of the indicative]]\nThe indicative mood has five simple tenses, each of which has a corresponding perfect form. In older classifications, the conditional tenses were considered part of an independent ''conditional mood''. Continuous forms (such as ''estoy hablando'') are usually not considered part of the verbal paradigm, though they often appear in books addressed to English speakers who are learning Spanish. Modern grammatical studies count only the simple forms as tenses, and the other forms as products of tenses and [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]].\n\n==== Simple tenses (''tiempos simples'') ====\nThe simple tenses are the forms of the verb without the use of a modal or helping verb.

''ir\n|-\n| yo || -aba || -\u00eda || era ||iba\n|-\n| t\u00fa/vos || -abas || -\u00edas ||eras ||ibas\n|-\n| \u00e9l/ella/ello/usted || -aba || -\u00eda ||era||iba\n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -\u00e1bamos || -\u00edamos ||eramos||ibamos\n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -abais || -\u00edais ||erais||ibais\n|-\n| ellos/ellas/ustedes || -aban || -\u00edan ||eran||iban\n|}\n\n'''Uses'''\n\nThe imperfect is used to express the following:\n\n* '''Habitual action in the past''': This use expresses an action done habitually in an indefinite past. It does not focus on when the action ended.\n\n:''Cuando era peque\u00f1o, '''hablaba''' espa\u00f1ol con mi abuela'' = \"When I was young, I spoke Spanish with my grandmother\"\n\n* '''An action interrupted by another action''': This expresses an action that was in progress when another action took place.\n\n:'''''Tom\u00e1bamos''' la cena cuando entr\u00f3 Eduardo''  = \"We were having dinner when Eduardo came in\"\n\n*'''General description of the past''': This expresses a past setting, as, for example, the background for a narrative.\n\n:''Todo '''estaba''' tranquilo esa noche.

Juan Eduardo was watching the football match with his friend Alejandro. They were eating some slices of pizza.\"\n\n===== Preterite (''pret\u00e9rito indefinido'') =====\nThe preterite is formed with the endings shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !! ''-ar'' verbs !! ''-er'' and ''-ir'' verbs!!Most irregular verbs !! ''ser/ir''\n|-\n| yo || -\u00e9 || -\u00ed ||-e || fui\n|-\n| t\u00fa/vos || -aste || -iste ||-iste ||fuiste\n|-\n| \u00e9l/ella/ello/usted || -\u00f3 || -i\u00f3 || -o ||fue\n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -amos || -imos ||-imos ||fuimos\n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -asteis || -isteis ||-isteis ||fuisteis\n|-\n| ellos/ellas/ustedes || -aron || -ieron || -ieron ||fueron\n|}\n\n'''Uses'''\n\nThe preterite is used to express the following:\n\n* '''An action that was done in the past''': This use expresses an action that is viewed as a completed event. It is often accompanied by adverbial expressions of time, such as ''ayer'', ''anteayer'', or ''la semana pasada''.\n\n:''Ayer, '''encontr\u00e9''' la flor que t\u00fa me '''diste''''' = \"Yesterday, I found the flower that you gave me\"\n\n* '''An action that interrupts another action''': This expresses an event that happened (and was completed) while another action was taking place.\n\n:''Tom\u00e1bamos la cena cuando '''entr\u00f3''' Eduardo'' = \"We were having dinner when Eduardo came in\"\n\n*'''A general truth''': This expresses a past relationship that is viewed as finished.\n\n:''Las Filipinas '''fueron''' parte del Imperio Espa\u00f1ol'' = \"The Philippines were part of the Spanish Empire\"\n\n===== Future (''futuro simple'' or ''futuro imperfecto'') =====\nThe future tense uses the entire infinitive as a stem. The following endings are attached to it:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !! (All regular verbs) ''Infinitive form'' + !! Stem changing ''-dr''\n|-\n| yo || -\u00e9 ||-dr\u00e9\n|-\n| t\u00fa/vos || -\u00e1s ||-dr\u00e1s\n|-\n| \u00e9l/ella/ello/usted || -\u00e1 ||-dr\u00e1\n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -emos ||-dremos\n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -\u00e9is ||-dr\u00e9is\n|-\n| ellos/ellas/ustedes || -\u00e1n ||-dr\u00e1n\n|}\n\n'''Uses'''\n\nThe future is used to express the following:\n\n* '''A future action''': This expresses an action that will be done in the future.\n\n:''El a\u00f1o pr\u00f3ximo, '''visitar\u00e9''' Buenos Aires'' = \"Next year, I shall/will visit Buenos Aires\"\n\n* '''Uncertainty or probability''': This expresses inference, rather than direct knowledge.\n\n:''\u00bfQui\u00e9n '''estar\u00e1''' tocando a la puerta? \u2014 '''Ser\u00e1''' Fabio.'' = \"Who (do you suppose) is knocking at the door? \u2014 It must be Fabio\". (An analogous use of the future tense occurs [[English_modal_verbs#will|in English]], as in \"That'll be Fabio\".) \n\n* '''Command, prohibition, or obligation''':\n\n:''No '''llevar\u00e1s''' a ese hombre a mi casa'' = \"Do not bring that man to my house\" or, more accurately, \"You will not bring that man to my house\"; this form is also used to assert a command, prohibition, or obligation in English. The biblical [[Ten Commandments]] are commonly expressed in the future tense in Spanish (e.g. ''No '''matar\u00e1s''''').\n\n* '''Courtesy''':\n\n:''\u00bfTe '''importar\u00e1''' encender la televisi\u00f3n?'' = \"Would you mind turning on the television?\"\n\nAnother common way to represent future time is with a present indicative conjugation of ''ir'', followed by ''a'', followed by an infinitive verb: '''''Voy a viajar''' a Bolivia en el verano'' (\"I'm going to travel to Bolivia in the summer\"). The difference between the use of the two forms varies according to dialect, but the \"''ir a'' + [infinitive]\" construction tends to be more colloquial. Also, this construction\u2014unlike the simple future form\u2014is not used in the \"probability\" sense to express conjecture.<ref>https://cvc.cervantes.es/ensenanza/biblioteca_ele/asele/pdf/15/15_0666.pdf</ref>\n\n==== Compound tenses (''tiempos compuestos'') ====\nAll the compound tenses are formed with ''haber'' followed by the past participle of the main verb. ''Haber'' changes its form for person, number, and the like, while the past participle remains invariable, ending with ''-o'' regardless of the number or gender of the subject.\n\n===== Present perfect (''pret\u00e9rito perfecto'') =====\nIn the present perfect, the present indicative of ''haber'' is used as an auxiliary, and it is followed by the past participle of the main verb. In most of Spanish America, this tense has virtually the same use as the English present perfect:\n*''Te '''he dicho''' mi opini\u00f3n'' = \"I have told you my opinion\"\n\nIn most of Spain the tense has an additional use\u2014to express a past action or event that is contained in a still-ongoing period of time or that has effects in the present:\n*''Este mes '''ha llovido''' mucho, pero hoy hace buen d\u00eda'' = \"It has rained a lot this month, but today is a fine day\"\n\nOccasionally ''tener'' and ''llevar'' are used with the past participle of a transitive verb for an effect that is similar to the present perfect. In these cases the participle usually agrees in gender and number with the direct object:\n*''Ya '''tengo compradas''' las entradas para nosotros. = \"I have already bought the tickets for us\" (Speaking of the effects in the present)\n*'''''Llevo grabados''' tres discos'' = \"I have recorded three records\"\n\n===== Past perfect or pluperfect (''pret\u00e9rito pluscuamperfecto'') =====\nIn this tense, the imperfect form of ''haber'' is used as a modal, and it is followed by the past participle of the main verb:\n\n* ''(yo) hab\u00eda'' + past participle\n* ''(t\u00fa) hab\u00edas'' + past participle\n* ''(\u00e9l/ella/ello/usted) hab\u00eda'' + past participle\n* ''(nosotros/nosotras) hab\u00edamos'' + past participle\n* ''(vosotros/vosotras) hab\u00edais'' + past participle\n* ''(ellos/ellas/ustedes) hab\u00edan'' + past participle\n\n'''Uses'''\n\nThe past perfect is used to express the following:\n\n* '''A past action that occurred prior to another past action''':\n\n:''Yo '''hab\u00eda esperado''' tres horas cuando \u00e9l lleg\u00f3'' = \"I had waited for three hours when he arrived\"\n\n===== Past anterior (''pret\u00e9rito anterior'') =====\nThe past anterior combines the preterite form of ''haber'' with the past participle of the main verb. It is very rare in spoken Spanish, but it is sometimes used in formal written language, where it is almost entirely limited to subordinate (temporal, adverbial) clauses. Thus, it is usually introduced by temporal conjunctions such as ''cuando'', ''apenas'', or ''en cuanto''. It is used to express an action that ended immediately before another past action:\n\n* ''(yo) hube'' + past participle\n* ''(t\u00fa) hubiste'' + past participle\n* ''(\u00e9l/ella/ello/usted) hubo'' + past participle\n* ''(nosotros/nosotras) hubimos'' + past participle\n* ''(vosotros/vosotras) hubisteis'' + past participle\n* ''(ellos/ellas/ustedes) hubieron'' + past participle\n\nFor example:\n*''Cuando '''hubieron llegado''' todos, empez\u00f3 la ceremonia'' = \"When everyone had arrived, the ceremony began\"\n*''Apenas Mar\u00eda '''hubo terminado''' la canci\u00f3n, su padre entr\u00f3'' = \"As soon as Maria had finished the song, her father came in\"\n\nIt is often replaced by either the preterite or the pluperfect, with the same meaning:\n\n*''Apenas Mar\u00eda '''termin\u00f3''' la canci\u00f3n, su padre entr\u00f3''\n*''Apenas Mar\u00eda '''hab\u00eda terminado''' la canci\u00f3n, su padre entr\u00f3''\n\n===== Future perfect (''futuro compuesto'') =====\nThe future perfect is formed with the future indicative of ''haber'' followed by the past participle of the main verb:\n\n* ''(yo) habr\u00e9'' + past participle\n* ''(t\u00fa) habr\u00e1s'' + past participle\n* ''(\u00e9l/ella/ello/usted) habr\u00e1'' + past participle\n* ''(nosotros/nosotras) habremos'' + past participle\n* ''(vosotros/vosotras) habr\u00e9is'' + past participle\n* ''(ellos/ellas/ustedes) habr\u00e1n'' + past participle\n\nFor example:\n*''Habr\u00e9 hablado'' = \"I shall/will have spoken\"\n\nIt is used to indicate a future action that will be finished right before another action:\n\n*''Cuando yo llegue a la fiesta, ya se habr\u00e1n marchado todos'' = \"When I get to the party, everyone will already have left\"\n\n=== The conditional ===\n\n==== Simple conditional (''condicional simple'' or ''pospret\u00e9rito'') ====\nAs with the future, the conditional uses the entire infinitive as the stem.  The following endings are attached to it:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject || (All regular verbs) ''Infinitive form'' +\n|-\n| yo || -\u00eda \n|-\n| t\u00fa/vos || -\u00edas \n|-\n| \u00e9l/ella/ello/usted || -\u00eda \n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -\u00edamos \n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -\u00edais \n|-\n| ellos/ellas/ustedes || -\u00edan \n|}\n\n'''Uses'''\n\nThe conditional is used to express the following:\n\n* '''Courtesy''': Using this mood softens a request, making it more polite.\n\n:''Se\u00f1or, \u00bf'''podr\u00eda''' darme una copa de vino?'' = \"Sir, could you give me a glass of wine?\"\n\n* '''Polite expression of a desire (using ''querer'')''':\n\n:'''''Querr\u00eda''' ver la pel\u00edcula esta semana'' = \"I would like to see the film this week\"\n\n* '''In a ''then'' clause whose realization depends on a hypothetical ''if'' clause:\n\n:''Si yo fuera rico, '''viajar\u00eda''' a Sudam\u00e9rica'' = \"If I were rich, I would travel to South America\"\n\n* '''Speculation about past events''' (the speaker's knowledge is indirect, unconfirmed, or approximating):\n\n:''\u00bfCu\u00e1ntas personas asistieron a la inauguraci\u00f3n del Presidente? \u2014 No lo s\u00e9; '''habr\u00eda''' unas 5.000'' = \"How many people attended the President's inauguration? \u2014 I do not know; there must have been about 5,000\")\n\n* '''A future action in relation to the past''': This expresses future action that was imagined in the past.\n\n:''Cuando era peque\u00f1o, pensaba que me '''gustar\u00eda''' ser m\u00e9dico'' = \"When I was young, I thought that I would like to be a doctor\"\n\n* '''A suggestion''':\n\n:''Yo que t\u00fa, lo '''olvidar\u00eda''' completamente'' = \"If I were you, I would forget him completely\"\n\n==== Conditional perfect or compound conditional (''condicional compuesto'' or ''antepospret\u00e9rito'') ====\nThe conditional perfect refers to a hypothetical past action.\n\nFor example:\n\n*''Yo habr\u00eda hablado si me hubieran/hubiesen dado la oportunidad'' = \"I would have spoken if they had given me the opportunity to\"\n\n===The imperative===\nThe imperative mood has three specific forms, corresponding to the pronouns ''t\u00fa'', ''vos'', and ''vosotros'' (''t\u00fa'' and ''vos'' are used in different regional dialects; ''vosotros'' only in Spain). These forms are used only in positive expressions, not negative ones. The subjunctive supplements the imperative in all other cases (negative expressions and the conjugations corresponding to the pronouns ''nosotros'', ''\u00e9l/ella'', ''usted'', ''ellos/ellas'', and ''ustedes'').\n\nThe imperative can also be expressed in three other ways:<ref>[http://spanish.about.com/cs/verbs/a/not_imperative.htm Other Ways of Making Commands and Requests]</ref>\n* Using the present or future indicative to form an emphatic command: ''Comer\u00e1s la verdura'' (\"You will eat the vegetables\")\n* The first person plural imperative (\"Let's...\") can also be expressed by ''Vamos a'' + infinitive: ''\u00a1Vamos a comer!''\n* Indirect commands with ''que'': ''Que lo llame el secretario'' (\"Have the secretary call him\")\n\n==== Affirmative imperative (''imperativo positivo'') ====\nThe positive form of the imperative mood in regular verbs is formed by adding the following to the stem:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !! ''-ar'' verbs !! ''-er'' verbs  !! ''-ir'' verbs\n|-\n| t\u00fa || -a || colspan=\"2\" | -e\n|-\n| vos || -\u00e1 || -\u00e9 || -\u00ed\n|-\n| usted || -e || colspan=\"2\" | -a\n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -emos || colspan=\"2\" | -amos\n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -ad (-ar) || -ed (-er) || -id (-ir) \n|-\n| ustedes || -en || colspan=\"2\" | -an\n|}\n\nThe singular imperative ''t\u00fa'' coincides with the third-person singular of the indicative for all but a few irregular verbs.  The plural ''vosotros'' is always the same as the infinitive, but with a final ''-d'' instead of an ''-r'' in the formal, written form; the informal spoken form is the same as the infinitive. The singular ''vos'' drops the ''-r'' of the infinitive, requiring a written accent to indicate the stress.\n\n==== Negative imperative (''imperativo negativo'') ====\nFor the negative imperative, the adverb ''no'' is placed before the verb, and the following endings are attached to the stem:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !! ''-ar'' verbs !! ''-er'' and ''-ir'' verbs\n|-\n| t\u00fa/vos || -es || -as\n|-\n| usted || -e || -a\n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -emos || -amos\n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -\u00e9is || -\u00e1is\n|-\n| ustedes || -en || -an\n|}\n\nNote that in the imperative, the affirmative second-person forms differ from their negative counterparts; this is the only case of a difference in conjugation between affirmative and negative in Spanish.\n\n<small>Beginner's rule:\n#To conjugate something that is positive in the imperative mood for the ''t\u00fa'' form (which is used most often), conjugate for the ''t\u00fa'' form and drop the ''s''.\n#To conjugate something that is negative in the imperative mood for the ''t\u00fa'' form (which also is used most often), conjugate in the ''yo'' form, drop the ''o'', add the opposite ''t\u00fa'' ending (if it is an ''-ar'' verb add ''es''; for an ''-er'' or ''-ir'' verb add ''as''), and then put the word ''no'' in front.\n</small>\n\n=====Emphasizing the subject=====\nIf one wishes to place emphasis on the subject of a command, it is placed after the verbal word:\n* ''Hazlo '''t\u00fa''''' = \"You do it\"\n* ''No lo diga '''usted''''' = \"Don't you [polite] say it\"\n\n==== Examples ====\n\n===== Positive command forms of the verb ''comer'' =====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is used, almost exclusively in subordinate clauses, to express the speaker's opinion or judgment, such as doubts, possibilities, emotions, and events that may or may not occur.\n\n==== Simple tenses (''tiempos simples'') ====\n\n===== Present subjunctive (''presente de subjuntivo'') =====\nThe present subjunctive of regular verbs is formed with the endings shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In Spanish America, the ''-ra'' forms are virtually the only forms used, to the exclusion of the ''-se'' forms.  In Spain, both sets of forms are used, but the ''-ra'' forms are predominant as well.\n\n======Imperfect subjunctive, ''-ra'' forms======\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !!

The following endings are attached to the preterite stem:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !! ''-ar'' verbs !! ''-er'' and ''-ir'' verbs\n|-\n| yo || -are || -iere\n|-\n| t\u00fa/vos || -ares || -ieres\n|-\n| \u00e9l/ella/ello/usted || -are || -iere\n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -\u00e1remos || -i\u00e9remos\n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -areis || -iereis\n|-\n| ellos/ellas/ustedes || -aren || -ieren\n|}\n\nFor example:\n*''Cuando hablaren...'' = \"Whenever they might speak...\"\n\n==== Compound tenses (''tiempos compuestos'') ====\nIn the subjunctive mood, the subjunctive forms of the verb ''haber'' are used with the past participle of the main verb.\n\n===== Present perfect subjunctive (''pret\u00e9rito perfecto de subjuntivo'') =====\n*''Cuando yo haya hablado...'' = \"When I have spoken...\"\n\n===== Pluperfect subjunctive (''pluscuamperfecto de subjuntivo'') =====\n*''Si yo hubiera hablado...'' or ''Si yo hubiese hablado...'' = \"If I had spoken...\"\n\n===== Future perfect subjunctive (''futuro compuesto de subjuntivo'') =====\nLike the simple future subjunctive, this tense is no longer used in modern Spanish.\n*''Cuando yo hubiere hablado...'' = \"When I shall have spoken...\"\n\n<small>\nNotes:\n* The present subjunctive is formed from the stem of the first person present indicative of a verb. Therefore, for an irregular verb like ''salir'' with the first person ''salgo'', the present subjunctive would be ''salga'', not ''sala''.\n* The choice between present subjunctive and imperfect subjunctive is determined by the tense of the main verb of the sentence.\n* The future subjunctive is rarely used in modern Spanish and mostly appears in old texts, legal documents, and certain fixed expressions, such as ''venga lo que viniere'' (\"come what may\").\n</small>\n\n===Continuous tenses===\nIn Spanish grammar, continuous tenses are not formally recognized as in English. Although the imperfect expresses a continuity compared to the perfect (e.g., ''te esperaba'' [\"I was waiting for you\"]), the continuity of an action is usually expressed by a verbal [[periphrasis]] (''per\u00edfrasis verbal''), as in ''estoy leyendo'' (\"I am reading\"). However, one can also say ''sigo leyendo'' (\"I am ''still'' reading\"), ''voy leyendo'' (\"I am ''slowly but surely'' reading\"), ''ando leyendo'' (\"I am ''going around'' reading\"), and others.\n\n===The passive===\n====\"True\" passive====\nThe \"true\" passive is formed with ''ser'' + the past participle, which in this case behaves like a normal adjective. Thus:\n* ''Yo soy amado'' = \"I [masc.] am loved\"\n* ''T\u00fa eras amada'' = \"You [fem.] were being loved\"\n* ''Nosotros seremos amados'' = \"We [masc.] will be loved\"\n* ''Ellas habr\u00edan sido amadas'' = \"They [fem.] would have been loved\"\n\nThe \"true\" passive is used in a variety of situations, but its use is somewhat more limited than that of its English counterpart.\n\n====''Se'' passive====\nIn the third person, reflexive constructions are often used to express ideas that could also be expressed in the passive. In such constructions, the recipient of the action is said to do the action to itself. Thus:\n* ''Se habla espa\u00f1ol'' = \"Spanish is spoken\" (lit. \"Spanish speaks itself\")\n* ''Se me dio el libro'' = \"The book was given to me\" (lit. \"The book gave itself to me\")\n* ''Se perdieron los datos'' = \"The data were lost\" (lit. \"The data lost themselves\")\n* ''Se puede hacer [ello]'' = \"It can be done\" (lit. \"It can do itself\")\n\nThe ''se'' passive is very common in the third person, but equivalent constructions cannot be used for the first and second persons: ''Yo me amo'' always translates to \"I love myself\" and never \"I am loved\".\n\n==Irregular verbs==\n{{Main|Spanish irregular verbs}}\n\nA considerable number of verbs change the vowel ''e'' in the stem to the diphthong ''ie'', and the vowel ''o'' to ''ue''. This happens when the stem vowel receives the stress. These verbs are referred to as stem-changing verbs. Examples include ''p'''e'''nsar'' (\"to think\"; e.g., ''p'''ie'''nso'' [\"I think\"]), ''s'''e'''ntarse'' (\"to sit\"; e.g., ''me s'''ie'''nto'' [\"I sit\"]), ''emp'''e'''zar'' (\"to begin\"; e.g., ''emp'''ie'''zo'' [\"I begin\"]), ''v'''o'''lver'' (\"to return\"; e.g., ''v'''ue'''lvo'' [\"I return\"]), and ''ac'''o'''starse'' (\"to go to bed\"; e.g., ''me ac'''ue'''sto'' [\"I go to bed\"]).\n\nVirtually all verbs of the third conjugation (''-ir''), if they have an ''-e-'' or ''-o-'' as the last vowel of their stem, undergo a vowel-raising change whereby ''e'' changes to ''i'' and ''o'' changes to ''u'', in some of their forms (for details, see [[Spanish irregular verbs]]). Examples include ''p'''e'''dir'' (\"to ask for\"; e.g., ''p'''i'''de'' [\"he/she asks for\"]), ''comp'''e'''tir'' (\"to compete\"; e.g., ''comp'''i'''te'' [\"he/she competes\"]), and ''derr'''e'''tirse'' (\"to melt\"; e.g., ''se derr'''i'''te'' [\"it melts\"]).\n\nThe so-called I-go verbs add a medial ''-g-'' in the first-person singular present tense (making the ''Yo'' [\"I\"] form end in ''-go''; e.g., ''tener'' [\"to have\"] becomes ''tengo'' [\"I have\"]; ''venir'' [\"to come\"] becomes ''vengo'' [\"I come\"]). The ''-g-'' is present in the present subjunctive of such verbs.  These verbs are often irregular in other forms as well.\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Contrasting simple and continuous forms===\n\nThere is no strict distinction between simple and continuous forms in Spanish as there is in English. In English, \"I do\" is one thing (a habit) and \"I am doing\" is another (current activity). In Spanish, ''hago'' can be either of the two, and ''estoy haciendo'' stresses the latter. Although not as strict as English, Spanish is stricter than French or German, which have no systematic distinction between the two concepts at all. This optionally continuous meaning that can be underlined by using the continuous form is a feature of the present and imperfect. The preterite never has this meaning, even in the continuous form, and the future has it only when it is in the continuous form.\n\n;Present\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 haces?'' could be either \"What do you do?\" or \"What are you doing?\"\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 est\u00e1s haciendo?'' is only \"What are you doing?\"\n\n;Imperfect\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 hac\u00edas?'' could be either \"What did you use to do?\" or \"What were you doing?\"\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 estabas haciendo?'' is only \"What were you doing?\"\n\n;Preterite\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 hiciste?'' is \"What did you do?\"\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 estuviste haciendo?'' is \"What were you doing (all of that time)?\"\n\nNote that since the preterite by nature refers to an event seen as having a beginning and an end, and not as a context, the use of the continuous form of the verb only adds a feeling for the length of time spent on the action. The future has two main forms in Spanish, the imperfect (compound) future and the simple one. The difference between them is one of aspect. The compound future is done with the conjugated ''ir'' (which means \"to go,\" but may also mean \"will\" in this case) plus the infinitive and, sometimes, with a present progressive verb added as well.\n\n;Future:\n* ''\u00bfQu\u00e9 vas a hacer?'' is \"What are you going to do?\" (implies that it will be done again, as in a routine)\n* ''\u00bfQu\u00e9 vas a estar haciendo?'' is \"What are you going to be doing?\" (does not necessarily imply that it will be done)\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 har\u00e1s?'' is \"What will you do?\" (will be completed immediately, or done just once)\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 estar\u00e1s haciendo?'' is \"What will you be doing?\"\n\n===Contrasting the present and the future===\n\nBoth the present and the future can express future actions, the latter more explicitly so. There are also expressions that convey the future.\n*''Mi padre llega ma\u00f1ana'' = \"My father arrives tomorrow\" (out of context, ''llega'' could mean both \"he is arriving now\" or \"he usually arrives\")\n*''Mi padre estar\u00e1 llegando ma\u00f1ana'' = \"My father will be arriving tomorrow\"\n*''Mi padre va a llegar ma\u00f1ana'' = \"My father is going to arrive tomorrow\" (future with ''ir'')\n*''Mi padre llegar\u00e1 ma\u00f1ana'' = \"My father will arrive tomorrow\" (future tense)\n*''Mi padre est\u00e1 a punto de llegar'' = \"My father is about to arrive\" (immediate future with ''estar a punto'')\n\nThe future tense can also simply express guesses about the present and immediate future:\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 hora es?'' ''Ser\u00e1n las tres'' = \"What time is it?\" \"It is about three (but I have not checked)\"\n*''\u00bfQui\u00e9n llama a la puerta?  Ser\u00e1 Jos\u00e9'' = \"Who is at the door?  It must be Jos\u00e9\"\n\nThe same is applied to imperfect and conditional:\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 hora era?'' ''Ser\u00edan las tres'' = \"What time was it?\" \"It was about three (but I had not checked)\"\n*''\u00bfQui\u00e9n llamaba a la puerta? Ser\u00eda Jos\u00e9'' = \"Who was at the door? It must have been Jos\u00e9\"\n\nStudies have shown that Spanish-speaking children learn this use of the future tense before they learn to use it to express future events {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} (the English future with \"will\" can also sometimes be used with this meaning). The other constructions detailed above are used instead. Indeed, in some areas, such as Argentina and Uruguay, speakers hardly use the future tense to refer to the future.\n\nThe future tense of the subjunctive mood is also obsolete in practice. As of today, it is only found in legal documents and the like. In other contexts, the present subjunctive form always replaces it.\n\n===Contrasting the preterite and the imperfect===\n\n====Fundamental meanings of the preterite and the imperfect====\nSpanish has two fundamental past tenses, the preterite and the imperfect. Strictly speaking, the difference between them is one of not [[Grammatical tense|tense]] but [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], in a manner that is similar to that of the Slavic languages. However, within Spanish grammar, they are customarily called tenses.\n\nThe difference between the preterite and the imperfect (and in certain cases, the perfect) is often hard to grasp for English speakers. English has just one past-tense form, which can have aspect added to it by auxiliary verbs, but not in ways that reliably correspond to what occurs in Spanish. The distinction between them does, however, correspond rather well to the distinctions in other Romance languages, such as between the French ''imparfait'' and ''pass\u00e9 simple'' / ''pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9'' or between the Italian ''imperfetto'' and ''passato remoto'' / ''passato prossimo''.\n\nThe imperfect fundamentally presents an action or state as being a ''context'' and is thus essentially descriptive. It does not present actions or states as having ends and often does not present their beginnings either. Like the Slavic imperfective past, it tends to show actions that used to be done at some point, as in a routine. In this case, one would say ''Yo jugaba'' (\"I used to play\"), ''Yo le\u00eda'' (\"I used to read\"), or ''Yo escrib\u00eda'' (\"I used to write\"). \n\nThe preterite (as well as the perfect, when applicable) fundamentally presents an action or state as being an ''event'', and is thus essentially narrative. It presents actions or states as having beginnings and ends. This also bears resemblance to the Slavic perfective past, as these actions are usually viewed as done in one stroke. The corresponding preterite forms would be ''Yo jugu\u00e9'' (\"I played\"), ''Yo le\u00ed'' (\"I read\") or ''Yo escrib\u00ed'' (\"I wrote\").\n\nAs stated above, deciding whether to use the preterite or the imperfect can present some difficulty for English speakers. But there are certain topics, words, and key phrases that can help one decide if the verb should be conjugated in the preterite or the imperfect. These expressions co-occur significantly more often with one or the other of the two tenses, corresponding to a completed action (preterite) or a repetitive action or a continuous action or state (imperfect) in the past.\n\nKey words and phrases that tend to co-occur with the preterite tense:\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''ayer'' (\"yesterday\")\n* ''anteayer'' (\"the day before yesterday\")\n* ''anoche'' (\"last night\")\n* ''durante dos siglos'' (\"for two centuries\")\n* ''por un rato'' (\"for a while\")\n* ''el otro d\u00eda'' (\"the other day\")\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''entonces'' (\"then\")\n* ''luego'' (\"then\"; \"and then\")\n* ''esta ma\u00f1ana'' (\"this morning\")\n* ''esta tarde'' (\"this afternoon\")\n* ''la semana pasada'' (\"last week\")\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''el mes pasado'' (\"last month\")\n* ''el a\u00f1o pasado'' (\"last year\")\n* ''hace dos d\u00edas/a\u00f1os'' (\"two days/years ago\")\n* ''de repente'' (\"suddenly\")\n* ''en 1954'', etc. (years)\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''el 25 de enero'', etc. (dates)\n* ''durante'' (\"during\")\n* ''muchas veces'' (\"many times\")\n* ''dos/tres veces'' (\"twice\"/\"three times\")\n* ''tantas veces'' (\"so many times\")\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''varias veces'' (\"several times\")\n* ''nunca'' (\"never\")\n* ''tan pronto como'' (\"as soon as\")\n* ''despu\u00e9s de que'' (\"after\")\n* ''desde que'' (\"since\")\n{{col-end}}\n\nE.g.: ''Esta ma\u00f1ana com\u00ed huevos y pan tostado'' (\"This morning I ate eggs and toast\")\n\nKey words and phrases that tend to co-occur with the imperfect tense:\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''a menudo'' (\"often\")\n* ''a veces'' (\"sometimes\")\n* ''cada d\u00eda'' (\"every day\")\n* ''cada semana'' (\"every week\")\n* ''cada mes'' (\"every month\")\n* ''cada a\u00f1o'' (\"every year\")\n* ''con frecuencia'' (\"frequently\")\n* ''de vez en cuando'' (\"from time to time\")\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''en aquella \u00e9poca'' (\"at that time\")\n* ''frecuentemente'' (\"frequently\")\n* ''generalmente'' (\"usually\")\n* ''todas las semanas'' (\"every week\")\n* ''todos los d\u00edas'' (\"every day\")\n* ''todo el tiempo'' (\"all the time\")\n* ''constantemente'' (\"constantly\")\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''mientras'' (\"while\")\n* ''regularmente'' (\"regularly\")\n* ''por lo general'' (\"generally\")\n* ''todav\u00eda'' (\"still\")\n* ''ya'' (\"already\")\n* ''Eran las tres'', etc. (\"It was three o'clock,\" etc.)\n* ''Estaba nublado'', etc. (\"It was cloudy,\" etc.)\n{{col-end}}\n\nE.g.: ''Cada a\u00f1o mi familia iba a Puerto Rico.'' (\"Each year my family went to Puerto Rico.\")\n\n====Comparison with English usage====\nThe English simple past can express either of these concepts.  However, there are devices that allow us to be more specific.  Consider, for example, the phrase \"the sun shone\" in the following contexts:\n#\"The sun shone through his window; John knew that it was going to be a fine day.\"\n#\"The sun was shining through his window; John knew that it was going to be a fine day.\"\n#\"The sun shone through his window back in those days.\"\n#\"The sun used to shine through his window back in those days.\"\n#\"The sun shone through his window the moment that John pulled back the curtain.\"\n\nIn the first two, it is clear that the shining refers to the background to the events that are about to unfold in the story. It is talking about what ''was happening''.  One has a choice between making this explicit with the past continuous, as in (2), or using the simple past and allowing the context to make it clear what is intended, as in (1). In Spanish, these would be in the imperfect, optionally in the imperfect continuous.\n\nIn (3) and (4), it is clear that the shining refers to a regular, general, habitual event. It is talking about what ''used to happen''. One has a choice between making this explicit with the expression \"used to,\" as in (4), or using the simple past and allowing the context to make it clear what we mean, as in (3). In Spanish, these would be in the imperfect, optionally with the auxiliary verb ''soler''.\n\nIn (5), only the simple past is possible. It is talking about a single event presented as occurring at a specific point in time (the moment John pulled back the curtain). The action starts and ends with this sentence. In Spanish, this would be in the preterite (or alternatively in the perfect, if the event has only just happened).\n\n====Further examples====\n*''Cuando '''ten\u00eda''' quince a\u00f1os, me '''atropell\u00f3''' un coche'' = \"When I '''was''' fifteen years old, a car '''ran over''' me\"\nThe imperfect is used for \"was\" in Spanish because it forms the background to the specific event expressed by \"was run over\", which is in the preterite.\n*''Mientras '''cruzaba'''/'''estaba cruzando''' la calle, me '''atropell\u00f3''' un coche'' = \"While I crossed/was crossing the road, a car '''ran over''' me\"\nIn both languages, the continuous form for action in progress is optional, but Spanish requires the verb in either case to be in the imperfect, because it is the background to the specific event expressed by \"was run over\", in the preterite.\n*''Siempre '''ten\u00eda''' cuidado cuando '''cruzaba''' la calle'' = \"I '''was''' always/always '''used to be''' careful when I '''crossed'''/'''used to cross''' the road\"\nThe imperfect is used for both verbs since they refer to habits in the past. Either verb could optionally use the expression \"used to\" in English.\n*''Me ba\u00f1\u00e9'' = \"I took a bath\"\nThe preterite is used if this refers to a single action or event\u2014that is, the person took a bath last night.\n*''Me ba\u00f1aba'' = \"I took baths\"\nThe imperfect is used if this refers to any sort of habitual action\u2014that is, the person took a bath every morning. Optionally, ''sol\u00eda ba\u00f1arme'' can specifically express \"I used to take baths\".\n*''Tuvo una hija'' = \"She had a daughter\"\nThe preterite is used if this refers to an event\u2014here, a birth.\n*''Ten\u00eda una hija'' = \"She had a/one daughter\"\nThe imperfect is used if this refers to the number of children by a certain point, as in \"She had one daughter when I met her ten years ago; she may have more now\". A description.\n\nNote that when describing the life of someone who is now dead, the distinction between the two tenses blurs.  One might describe the person's life saying ''ten\u00eda una hija'', but ''tuvo una hija'' is very common because the person's whole life is viewed as a whole, with a beginning and an end.  The same goes for ''viv\u00eda/vivi\u00f3 en...'' \"he lived in...\".\n\nPerhaps the verb that English speakers find most difficult to translate properly is \"to be\" in the past tense (\"was\"). Apart from the choice between the verbs ''ser'' and ''estar'' (see below), it is often very hard for English speakers to distinguish between contextual and narrative uses.\n*''Alguien '''cogi\u00f3''' mis CD.  \u00bfQui\u00e9n '''fue'''?'' = \"Someone '''took''' my CDs.  Who '''was''' it?\"\nHere the preterite is used because it is an event.  A good clue is the tense in which ''cogi\u00f3'' is.\n*'''''Hab\u00eda''' una persona que '''miraba''' los CD.  \u00bfQui\u00e9n '''era'''?'' = \"There '''was''' a person who '''was looking''' at the CDs.  Who '''was''' it?\"\nHere the imperfect is used because it is a description (the start and end of the action is not presented; it is something that was in progress at a certain time). Again, a good clue is the tense of the other verbs.\n\n===Contrasting the preterite and the perfect===\nThe preterite and the perfect are distinguished in a similar way as the equivalent English tenses. Generally, whenever the present perfect (\"I have done\") is used in English, the perfect is also used in Spanish.  In addition, there are cases in which English uses a simple past (\"I did\") but Spanish requires a perfect.  In the remaining cases, both languages use a simple past.\n\nAs in English, the perfect expresses past actions that have some link to the present.  The preterite expresses past actions as being past, complete and done with.  In both languages, there are dialectal variations.\n\n====Frame of reference includes the present: perfect====\nIf it is implicitly or explicitly communicated that the [[linguistic frame of reference|frame of reference]] for the event includes the present and the event or events may therefore continue occurring, then both languages strongly prefer the perfect.\n;With references including \"this\" including the present:\n*''Este a\u00f1o me he ido de vacaciones dos veces'' = \"This year I have gone on vacation twice\"\n*''Esta semana ha sido muy interesante'' = \"This week has been very interesting\"\n;With other references to recent periods including the present:\n*''No he hecho mucho hoy'' = \"I have not done much today\"\n*''No ha pasado nada hasta la fecha'' = \"Nothing has happened to date\"\n*''Hasta ahora no se me ha ocurrido'' = \"Until now it has not occurred to me\"\n;With reference to someone's life experience (his/her life not being over):\n*''\u00bfAlguna vez has estado en \u00c1frica?'' = \"Have you ever been in Africa?\"\n*''Mi vida no ha sido muy interesante'' = \"My life has not been very interesting\"\n*''Jam\u00e1s he robado nada'' = \"Never have I stolen anything\"\n\n====Frame of reference superficially includes the present: perfect====\nSometimes expressions like \"today\", \"this year\", and \"this week\" are used to express the idea these periods are over. This requires the simple past in English. For example, in December one might speak of the year in the simple past because we are assuming that all of that year's important events have occurred and one can talk as though it were over. Other expressions\u2014such as \"this weekend,\" if today is Monday\u2014refer to a period which is definitely over; the word \"this\" just distinguishes it from other weekends.  There is a tendency in Spanish to use the perfect even for this type of time reference, even though the preterite is possible and seems more logical.\n*''Este fin de semana hemos ido al zoo'' = \"This weekend we went to the zoo\"\n*''Hoy he tenido una jornada muy aburrida'' = \"Today I had a very boring day at work\"\n\n====Consequences continue into the present: perfect====\nAs in English, the perfect is used when the consequences of which an event are referred.\n*''Alguien ha roto esta ventana'' = \"Someone has broken this window\" (the window is currently in a broken state)\n*''Nadie me ha dicho qu\u00e9 pas\u00f3 aquel d\u00eda'' = \"Nobody has told me what happened that day\" (therefore, I still do not know)\nThese same sentences in the preterite would purely refer to the past actions, without any implication that they have repercussions now.\n\nIn English, this type of perfect is not possible if a precise time frame is added or even implied. One cannot say \"I have been born in 1978,\" because the date requires \"I was born,\" despite the fact there is arguably a present consequence in the fact that the person is still alive. Spanish sporadically uses the perfect in these cases.\n*''He nacido en 1978'' (usually ''Nac\u00ed en 1978'') = \"I was born in 1978\"\n*''Me he criado en Madrid'' (usually ''Me cri\u00e9 en Madrid'') = \"I grew up in Madrid\"\n\n====The event itself continues into the present: perfect or present====\nIf the event itself has been happening recently and is also happening right now or expected to continue happening soon, then the preterite is impossible in both languages. English requires the perfect, or better yet the perfect continuous. Spanish requires the perfect, or better yet the present simple:\n*''\u00daltimamente ha llovido mucho'' / ''\u00daltimamente llueve mucho'' = \"It has rained / It has been raining a lot recently\"\nThis is the only use of the perfect that is common in colloquial speech across Latin America.\n\n====Dialectal variation====\nIn the Canary Islands and across Latin America, there is a colloquial tendency to replace most uses of the perfect with the preterite. This use varies according to region, register, and education.\n* ''\u00bfY vos alguna vez estuviste all\u00e1?'' = ''\u00bfY t\u00fa alguna vez has estado all\u00ed?'' = \"And have you ever been there?\"\n\nThe one use of the perfect that does seem to be normal in Latin America is the perfect for actions that continue into the present (not just the time frame, but the action itself). Therefore, \"I have read a lot in my life\" and \"I read a lot this morning\" would both be expressed with ''le\u00ed'' instead of ''he le\u00eddo'', but \"I have been reading\" is expressed by ''he le\u00eddo''.\n\nA less standard use of the perfect is found in Ecuador and Colombia. It is used with present or occasionally even future meaning. For example, [[Shakira Mebarak]] in her song \"Ciega, Sordomuda\" sings,\n*''Bruta, ciega, sordomuda, / torpe, traste, testaruda; / es todo lo que he sido'' = \"Clumsy, blind, dumb, / blundering, useless, pig-headed; / that is all that I had been\"\n<!---===Contrasting the indicative and the subjunctive===\n===Contrasting the subjunctive and the conditional===--->\n\n===Contrasting the subjunctive and the imperative===\n\nThe subjunctive mood expresses wishes and hypothetical events. It is often employed together with a conditional verb:\n\n*''Desear\u00eda que estuvieses aqu\u00ed.'' = \"I wish that you were here.\"\n*''Me alegrar\u00eda mucho si volvieras ma\u00f1ana.'' = \"I would be very glad if you came back tomorrow.\"\n\nThe imperative mood shows commands given to the hearer (the second person). There is no imperative form in the third person, so the subjunctive is used. The expression takes the form of a command or wish directed at the hearer, but referring to the third person. The difference between a command and a wish is subtle, mostly conveyed by the absence of a wishing verb:\n\n*''Que venga el gerente.'' = \"Let the manager come.\", \"Have the manager come.\"\n*''Que se cierren las puertas.'' = \"Let the doors be closed.\", \"Have the doors closed.\"\n\nWith a verb that expresses wishing, the above sentences become plain subjunctive instead of direct commands:\n\n*''Deseo que venga el gerente.'' = \"I wish for the manager to come.\"\n*''Quiero que se cierren las puertas.'' = \"I want the doors (to be) closed.\"\n\n===Contrasting the present and the future subjunctive===\n\nThe future tense of the subjunctive is found mostly in old literature or [[Legal English|legal language]] and is even misused in conversation by confusing it with the past tense (often due to the similarity of its characteristic suffix, ''-ere'', as opposed to the suffixes of the past tense, ''-era'' and ''-ese''). It is very rare otherwise.\n\nIt survives in the common expression ''sea lo que fuere'' and the proverb ''all\u00e1 donde fueres, haz lo que vieres'' (''all\u00e1 donde'' can be replaced by ''a la tierra donde'' or ''si a Roma'').\n\nThe proverb illustrates how it used to be used:\n*With ''si'' referring to the future, as in ''si a Roma fueres...''.  This is now expressed with the present indicative: ''si vas a Roma...'' or ''si fueras a Roma...''\n*With ''cuando'', ''donde'', and the like, referring to the future, as in ''all\u00e1 donde fueres...''.  This is now expressed with the present subjunctive: ''vayas adonde vayas...''\n\n===Contrasting the preterite and the past anterior===\n\nThe past anterior is rare nowadays and restricted to formal use. It expresses a very fine nuance: the fact that an action occurs just after another (had) occurred, with words such as ''cuando'', ''nada m\u00e1s'', and ''en cuanto'' (\"when\", \"no sooner\", \"as soon as\").  In English, one must use either the simple past or the past perfect; Spanish has something specific between the two.\n*''En cuanto el delincuente hubo salido del cuarto, la v\u00edctima se ech\u00f3 a llorar'' = \"As soon as the criminal (had) left the room, the victim burst into tears\"\n\nThe use of ''hubo salido'' shows that the second action happened immediately after the first. ''Sali\u00f3'' might imply that it happened at the same time, and ''hab\u00eda salido'' might imply it happened some time after.\n\nHowever, colloquial Spanish has lost this tense and the corresponding nuance, and the preterite must be used instead in all but the most formal of writing.\n\n===Contrasting ''ser'' and ''estar''===\n{{Main|Romance copula}}\n\nThe differences between ''ser'' and ''estar'' are considered one of the most difficult concepts for non-native speakers. Both ''ser'' and ''estar'' translate into [[English language|English]] as \"to be\", but they have different uses, depending on whether they are used with nouns, with adjectives, with past [[participles]] (more precisely, ''passive'' participles), or to express location. \n\nOnly ''ser'' is used to equate one [[noun phrase]] with another, and thus it is the verb for expressing a person's occupation (\"Mi hermano es estudiante\"/\"My brother is a student\"). For the same reason, ''ser'' is used for telling the date or the time, regardless of whether the subject is explicit (\"Hoy es mi\u00e9rcoles\"/\"Today is Wednesday\") or merely implied (\"Son las ocho\"/\"It's eight o'clock\"). \n\nWhen these verbs are used with adjectives, the difference between them may be generalized by saying that ''ser'' expresses nature and ''estar'' expresses state. Frequently\u2014although not always\u2014adjectives used with ''ser'' express a permanent quality, while their use with ''estar'' expresses a temporary situation. There are exceptions to the generalization; for example, the sentence \"Tu mam\u00e1 est\u00e1 loca\" (\"Your mother is crazy\") can express either a temporary or a permanent state of craziness.\n\n''Ser'' generally focuses on the essence of the subject, and specifically on qualities that include:\n# Nationality\n# Possession\n# Physical and personality traits\n# Material\n# Origin\n\n''Estar'' generally focuses on the condition of the subject, and specifically on qualities that include:\n# Physical condition\n# Feelings, emotions, and states of mind\n# Appearance\n\nIn English, the sentence \"The boy is boring\" uses a different adjective than \"The boy is bored\". In Spanish, the difference is made by the choice of ''ser'' or ''estar''.\n*''El chico es aburrido'' uses ''ser'' to express a permanent trait (\"The boy is boring\").\n*''El chico est\u00e1 aburrido'' uses ''estar'' to express a temporary state of mind (\"The boy is bored\").\n\nThe same strategy is used with many adjectives to express either an inherent trait (''ser'') or a transitory state or condition (''estar''). For example: \n*\"Mar\u00eda es guapa\" uses ''ser'' to express an essential trait, meaning \"Mar\u00eda is a good-looking person.\"\n*\"Mar\u00eda est\u00e1 guapa\" uses ''estar'' to express a momentary impression: \"Mar\u00eda looks beautiful\" (a comment on her present appearance, without any implication about her inherent characteristics).\n\nWhen ''ser'' is used with the past participle of a verb, it forms the \"true\" [[passive voice]], expressing an event (\"El libro '''fue escrito''' en 2005\"/\"The book '''was written''' in 2005\"). When the past participle appears with ''estar'', it forms a \"passive of result\" or \"[[stative verb|stative]] passive\" (\"El libro ya '''est\u00e1 escrito'''\"/\"The book '''is''' already '''written'''\"\u2014see [[Spanish conjugation]]).\n\nLocation of a person or thing is expressed with ''estar''\u2014regardless of whether temporary or permanent (\"El hotel '''est\u00e1''' en la esquina\"/\"The hotel is on the corner\"). Location of an event is expressed with ''ser'' (\"La reuni\u00f3n '''es''' en el hotel\"/\"The meeting is [takes place] in the hotel\").\n\n===Contrasting ''haber'' and ''tener''===\n\nThe verbs ''haber'' and ''tener'' are easily distinguished, but they may pose a problem for learners of Spanish who speak other Romance languages (where the cognates of ''haber'' and ''tener'' are used differently), for English speakers (where \"have\" is used as a verb and as an auxiliary), and others. ''Haber'' derives from Latin ''habe\u014d'',; with the basic meaning of \"to have\". ''Tener'' derives from Latin ''tene\u014d'', with the basic meaning of \"to hold\", \"to keep\". As ''habe\u014d'' began to degrade and become reduced to just ambiguous monosyllables in the present tense, the Iberian Romance languages (Spanish, Gallician-Portuguese, and Catalan) restricted its use and started to use ''tene\u014d'' as the ordinary verb expressing having and possession. French instead reinforced ''habe\u014d'' with obligatory subject pronouns.\n\n====''Haber'': expressing existence====\n''Haber'' is used as an impersonal verb to show existence of an object or objects, which is generally expressed as an indefinite noun phrase. In English, this corresponds to the use of \"there\" + the corresponding inflected form of \"to be\".  When used in this sense, ''haber'' has a special present-tense form: ''hay'' instead of ''ha''. The ''y'' is presumed to be a fossilized form of the mediaeval Castilian [[clitic]] pronoun ''y'' or ''i'', once meaning \"there\", but now semantically empty, historically [[cognate]] with French ''y'', Catalan ''hi'' and Italian ''vi'' from Latin ''ibi''.\n\nUnlike in English, the thing that \"is there\" is not the subject of the sentence, and therefore there is no agreement between it and the verb. This echoes constructions seen in languages such as French (''il y a'' = \"it there has\"), Catalan (''hi ha'' = \"[it] there has\"), and even Chinese (\u6709 ''y\u01d2u'' = \"[it] has\"):\n\n*''Hay un gato en el jard\u00edn.'' = \"There is a cat in the garden.\"\n*''En el ba\u00fal hay fotograf\u00edas viejas.'' = \"In the trunk there are some old photos.\"\n\nTo form perfect constructions, the past participle ''habido'' is used:\n\n* ''Ha habido mucha confusi\u00f3n de esto.'' = \"There's been a lot of confusion about this.\"\n* ''Ha habido pocos hasta ahora.'' = \"There have been few so far.\"\n\nIt is possible, in certain types of emphasis, to put the verb after the object:\n\n*''\u00bfRevistas hay?'' = \"Are there any magazines?\"\n\nThere is a tendency to make ''haber'' agree with what follows, as though it were the subject, particularly in tenses other than the present indicative. There is heavier stigma on inventing plural forms for ''hay'', but ''hain'', ''han'', and suchlike are sometimes encountered in non-standard speech. The form ''habemos'' is common (meaning \"there are, including me\"); it very rarely replaces ''hemos'' to form the present perfect tense in modern language,<ref>See [http://www.corpusdelespanol.org/ Corpus del Espa\u00f1ol]</ref> and in certain contexts it is even acceptable in formal or literary language:\n\n*''Hab\u00eda un hombre en la casa.'' = \"There was a man in the house.\"\n*''Hab\u00eda unos hombres en la casa.'' = \"There were some men in the house.\" (standard)\n*''Hab\u00edan unos hombres en la casa.'' = \"There were some men in the house.\" (non-standard)\n*''En esta casa habemos cinco personas.'' = \"In this house there are five of us.\" (non-standard)<ref>''Diccionario panhisp\u00e1nico de dudas'', [http://rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=phjmVDAG4D6WPVG3Nr haber]</ref>\n*''Habr\u00eda habido muchos m\u00e1s si supiera.'' = \"There would have been a lot more if I knew.\" (standard)\n*''Nos las habemos con un gran jugador.'' = \"We are confronting a great player.\" (standard)\n\nAs an existential verb, ''haber'' is never used other than in the third person. To express the existence of a first or second person, the verb ''estar'' (\"to be [located/present]\") or ''existir'' (\"to exist\") is used, and there is subject\u2013verb agreement.\n\n====''Haber'': impersonal obligation====\nThe phrase ''haber que'' (in the third person singular and followed by a subordinated construction with the verb in the infinitive) carries the meaning of necessity or obligation without specifying an agent. It is translatable as \"it is necessary\", but a paraphrase is generally preferable in translation. Note that the present-tense form is ''hay''.\n\n*''Hay que abrir esa puerta.'' = \"That door needs opening\", \"We have to open that door\".\n*''Habr\u00e1 que abrir esa puerta.'' = \"That door will need opening\", \"We are going to have to open that door\".\n*''Aunque haya que abrir esa puerta.'' = \"Even if that door needs to be opened\".\n\nThis construction is comparable to French ''il faut'' and Catalan ''cal''. ''Hay que'' always goes with the infinitive.\n\n====''Haber'': personal obligation====\nA separate construction is ''haber de'' + infinitive. It is not impersonal. It tends to express a certain nuance of obligation and a certain nuance of future tense, much like the expression \"to be to\". It is also often used similarly to ''tener que'' and ''deber'' (\"must\", \"ought to\"). Note that the third personal singular of the present tense is ''ha''.\n\n*''Ma\u00f1ana he de dar una charla ante la Universidad'' = \"Tomorrow I am to give a speech before the University\".\n*''Ha de comer m\u00e1s verduras'' = \"She/he ought to eat more vegetables\".\n\n====''Haber'': forming the perfect====\n''Haber'' is also used as an auxiliary to form the perfect, as shown elsewhere. Spanish uses only ''haber'' for this, unlike French and Italian, which use the corresponding cognates of ''haber'' for most verbs, but cognates of ''ser'' (\"to be\") for certain others.\n\n*''Ella se ha ido al mercado'' = \"She has gone to the market\"\n*''Ellas se han ido de paseo'' = \"They have gone on a walk\"\n*''\u00bfHab\u00e9is fregado los platos?'' = \"Have you (all) done the washing-up?\"\n\n====''Tener''====\n''Tener'' is a verb with the basic meaning of \"to have\", in its essential sense of \"to possess\", \"to hold\", \"to own\".  As in English, it can also express obligation (''tener que'' + infinitive). It also appears in a number of phrases that show emotion or physical states, expressed by nouns, which in English tend to be expressed by \"to be\" and an adjective.\n\n*''Mi hijo tiene una casa nueva'' = \"My son has a new house\"\n*''Tenemos que hablar'' = \"We have to talk\"\n*''Tengo hambre'' = \"I am hungry\" (lit. \"I have hunger\")\n\nThere are numerous phrases like ''tener hambre'' that are not literally translated in English, such as:<ref name=\"abouttenernouns\">[http://spanish.about.com/cs/vocabulary/a/tenerplusnoun.htm Spanish Idioms of the Form 'Tener' + Noun \u2013 Learn Spanish Language<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*''tener hambre'' = \"to be hungry\"; \"to have hunger\"\n*''tener sed'' = \"to be thirsty\"; \"to have thirst\"\n*''tener cuidado'' = \"to be careful\"; \"to have caution\"\n*''tener __ a\u00f1os'' = \"to be __ years old\"; \"to have __ years\"\n*''tener celos'' = \"to be jealous\"; \"to have jealousy\"\n*''tener \u00e9xito'' = \"to be successful\"; \"to have success\"\n*''tener verg\u00fcenza'' = \"to be ashamed\"; \"to have shame\"\n\nNote: ''Estar hambriento'' is a literal translation of \"To be hungry\", but it is rarely used in Spanish nowadays.\n<!--===Use of the gerund===-->\n\n===Negation===\n\nVerbs are negated by putting ''no'' before the verb.\nOther negative words can either replace this ''no'' or occur after the verb:\n*''Hablo espa\u00f1ol'' = \"I speak Spanish\"\n*''No hablo espa\u00f1ol'' = \"I do not speak Spanish\"\n*''Nunca hablo espa\u00f1ol'' = \"I never speak Spanish\"\n*''No hablo nunca espa\u00f1ol'' = \"I do not ever speak Spanish\"\n\n===Expressing movement===\n\nSpanish verbs describing motion tend to emphasize direction instead of manner of motion. According to the pertinent classification, this makes Spanish a [[verb framing|verb-framed]] language. This contrasts with English, where verbs tend to emphasize manner, and the direction of motion is left to helper particles, [[preposition]]s, or [[adverb]]s.\n\n*\"We drove away\" = ''Nos fuimos en coche'' (lit. \"We went (away) by car\")\n*\"He swam to Ibiza\" = ''Fue a Ibiza nadando'' (lit. \"He went to Ibiza swimming\")\n*\"They ran off\" = ''Huyeron corriendo'' (lit. \"They fled running\")\n*\"She crawled in\" = ''Entr\u00f3 a gatas'' (lit. \"She entered on all fours\")\n\nQuite often, the important thing is the direction, not the manner. Therefore, although \"we drove away\" translates into Spanish as ''nos fuimos en coche'', it is often better to translate it as just ''nos fuimos''.  For example:\n\n{{quote|text=''La llev\u00e9 al aeropuerto en coche, pero se le hab\u00eda olvidado el tiquete, as\u00ed que fuimos a casa [en coche] por \u00e9l, luego volvimos [en coche] hacia el aeropuerto, pero luego tuvimos que volver [en coche] por el pasaporte, y ya era imposible que consigui\u00e9semos facturar el equipaje...'' = \"I drove her to the airport, but she had forgotten her ticket, so we drove home to get it, then drove back towards the airport, but then had to drive back home for her passport, by which time there was zero chance of checking in...\"}}\n\n==Verbal nouns==\nSpanish verbal nouns (e.g. \"running\", \"coming\", \"thinking\" in English) are identical in form to the infinitive of the verb from which they are derived, and their gender is masculine. They are generally used with the definite article, and [[Spanish_pronouns#Clitic_pronouns_and_enclitization|enclitic pronouns]] attach to them as they would a normal infinitive. Thus:\n\n* ''el comer'' = \"eating\"\n* ''el correr'' = \"running\"\n* ''el no esperar'' = \"not waiting\"\n* ''el darte un libro'' = \"giving you a book\"\n* ''el guard\u00e1rselos'' = \"saving them for him/her/you/them\"\n\n== References ==\n{{Wiktionary category|category=Spanish verbs|type=Spanish verbs}}\n{{wikibooks|Spanish}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spanish verbs}}\n[[Category:Spanish grammar|Verbs]]\n[[Category:Verbs by language]]\n", "text_old": "{{Spanish language}}\n'''Spanish verbs''' form one of the more complex areas of [[Spanish grammar]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is a relatively [[synthetic language]] with a moderate to high degree of [[inflection]], which shows up mostly in [[Spanish conjugation]].\n\nAs is typical of [[verbs]] in virtually all languages, Spanish verbs express an action or a state of being of a given subject, and like verbs in most [[Indo-European languages]], Spanish verbs undergo [[inflection]] according to the following categories:\n\n* [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]: [[Past Tense|past]], [[Present tense|present]], or [[future Tense|future]]\n* [[Grammatical number|Number]]: singular or [[plural]]\n* [[Grammatical person|Person]]: first, second or third\n* [[T\u2013V_distinction#Spanish|T\u2013V distinction]]: familiar or formal\n* [[Grammatical Mood|Mood]]: [[Indicative mood|indicative]], [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], or [[Imperative mood|imperative]]\n* [[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]]: [[perfective aspect|perfective]] or [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (distinguished only in the past tense as [[preterite]] and [[imperfect]])\n* [[Grammatical Voice|Voice]]: [[Active Voice|active]] or [[Passive Voice|passive]]\n\nThe modern Spanish verb system has sixteen distinct complete<ref>\"Complete\" here means having forms for all three grammatical persons in both singular and plural.</ref> paradigms, i.e. sets of forms for each combination of tense and mood (tense refers to when the action takes place, and mood or mode refers to the mood of the subject \u2013 e.g., certainty vs. doubt), plus one incomplete<ref>\"Incomplete\", with reference to the imperative, means having forms only for the second person and the first-person plural, and lacking third-person forms.</ref> paradigm (the imperative), as well as three [[Non-finite verb|non-temporal forms]] (the infinitive, gerund, and past participle).\n\nThe fourteen regular tenses are also subdivided into seven ''simple tenses'' and seven ''compound tenses'' (also known as the perfect). The seven ''compound tenses'' are formed with the [[auxiliary verb]] ''haber'' followed by the [[past participle]]. Verbs can be used in other forms, such as the present progressive, but in grammar treatises they are not usually considered a special tense but rather [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] verbal constructions.\n\n==Accidents of a verb==\nA verbal accident is defined as one of the changes of form that a verb can undergo. Spanish verbs have five accidents. Every verb changes according to the following:\n\n===Person and number===\nSpanish verbs are conjugated in three persons, each having a singular and a plural form. In some varieties of Spanish, such as that of the [[Rioplatense Spanish|R\u00edo de la Plata Region]], [[voseo|a special form of the second person]] is used.\n\nBecause Spanish is a \"[[pro-drop language]]\", subject pronouns are often omitted.\n\n====First person====\nThe grammatical first person refers to the speaker (\"I\"). The first person plural refers to the speaker together with at least one other person.\n\n* ''(Yo) '''soy''''': \"I am\"\n* ''(Nosotros/Nosotras) '''somos''''': \"We are\"; the feminine form ''nosotras'' is used only when referring to a group that is composed entirely of females; otherwise, ''nosotros'' is used.\n\n====Second person====\nThe grammatical second person refers to the addressee, the receiver of the communication (\"you\"). Spanish has different pronouns (and verb forms) for \"you,\" depending on the relationship, familiar or formal, between speaker and addressee.\n\n'''Singular forms'''\n* ''(T\u00fa) '''eres''''': \"You are\"; familiar singular; used when addressing someone who is of close affinity (a member of the family, a close friend, a child, a pet). Also the form used to address the [[deity]].\n* ''([[Voseo|Vos]]) '''sos''''': \"You are\"; familiar singular; generally used in the same way as ''t\u00fa''. Its use is restricted to some areas of [[Hispanic America]]; where ''t\u00fa'' and ''vos'' are both used, ''vos'' is used to denote a closer affinity.\n* ''(Usted) '''es''''': \"You are\"; formal singular; used when addressing a person respectfully, someone older, someone not known to the speaker, or someone of some social distance. Although it is a second-person pronoun, it uses third-person verb forms (and object pronouns and possessives) because it developed as a contraction of ''vuestra merced'' (literally, \"your mercy\" or \"your grace\").\n\n'''Plural forms'''\n* ''(Vosotros/Vosotras) '''sois''''': \"You (all) are\"; familiar plural; used when addressing people who are of close affinity (members of the family, friends, children, pets). The feminine form ''vosotras'' is used only when addressing a group composed entirely of females; otherwise, ''vosotros'' is used. Used primarily in [[Spain]] and [[Equatoguinean Spanish|Equatorial Guinea]], though it may appear in old, formal texts from other countries, such as the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Philippines]],<ref>In [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli me tangere]]'', Salom\u00e9 uses ''vosotros'' to refer to El\u00edas and his passengers that day. In its sequel, ''[[El filibusterismo]]'', in the chapter entitled ''Risas, llantos'', Sandoval addresses his fellow students using ''vosotros''.</ref> or in the initial line of the Argentine national anthem (\"O\u00edd, mortales, el grito sagrado\").\n* ''(Ustedes) '''son''''': \"You (all) are\"; formal plural where ''vosotros'' is used; both familiar and formal plural elsewhere. Where it is strictly formal, used when addressing people respectfully or addressing people of some social distance. Like ''usted'', it uses third-person verb forms, for the same reasons.\n\n====Third person====\nThe grammatical third person refers to a person or thing other than the speaker or the addressee.\n\n'''Singular forms'''\n* ''(\u00c9l) '''es''''': \"He/it is\"; used for a male person or a thing of [[grammatical gender|masculine]] (grammatical) gender.\n* ''(Ella) '''es''''': \"She/it is\"; used for a female person or a thing of [[grammatical gender|feminine]] (grammatical) gender.\n* ''(Ello) '''es''''': \"It is\"; used to refer to [[grammatical gender|neuter]] nouns such as facts, ideas, situations, and sets of things; rarely used as an explicit subject.\n\n'''Plural forms'''\n* ''(Ellos) '''son''''':  \"They are\"; used for a group of people or things that includes at least one person or thing of [[grammatical gender|masculine]] (grammatical) gender.\n* ''(Ellas) '''son''''': \"They are\"; used for a group of people or things that are all of [[grammatical gender|feminine]] (grammatical) gender.\n\n===Mood===\nGrammatical mood is one of a set of distinctive forms that are used to signal modality. In Spanish, every verb has forms in three moods.\n\n* Indicative mood: The indicative mood, or evidential mood, is used for factual statements and positive beliefs. The Spanish conditional, although semantically expressing the dependency of one action or proposition on another, is generally considered a tense of the indicative mood, because, syntactically, it can appear in an independent clause.\n* Subjunctive mood: The subjunctive mood expresses an imagined or desired action in the past, present, or future.\n* Imperative mood: The imperative mood expresses direct commands, requests, and prohibitions. In Spanish, using the imperative mood may sound blunt or even rude, so it is often used with care.\n\n===Tense===\nThe tense of a verb indicates the time when the action occurs. It may be in the past, present, or future.\n\n=== Impersonal or non-finite forms of the verb ===\n[[Non-finite verb|Non-finite]] verb forms refer to an action or state without indicating the time or person. Spanish has three impersonal forms: the infinitive, the gerund, and the past participle.\n\n==== Infinitive ====\nThe infinitive is generally the form found in dictionaries. It corresponds to the English \"base-form\" or \"dictionary form\" and is usually indicated in English by \"to _____\" (\"to sing,\" \"to write,\" etc.). The ending of the infinitive is the basis of the names given in English to the three classes of Spanish verbs:\n\n* \"''-ar''\" verbs (''primera conjugaci\u00f3n'' [\"first conjugation\"])\n: Examples: ''hablar'' (\"to speak\"); ''cantar'' (\"to sing\"); ''bailar'' (\"to dance\")\n\n* \"''-er''\" verbs (''segunda conjugaci\u00f3n'' [\"second conjugation\"])\n: Examples: ''beber'' (\"to drink\"); ''leer'' (\"to read\"); ''comprender'' (\"to understand\")\n\n* \"''-ir''\" verbs (''tercera conjugaci\u00f3n'' [\"third conjugation\"])\n: Examples: ''vivir'' (\"to live\"); ''sentir'' (\"to feel\"); ''escribir'' (\"to write\")\n\n==== Gerund ====\nAlthough in English grammar the [[gerund]] refers to the ''-ing'' form of the verb used as a noun, in Spanish the term refers to a verb form that behaves more like an adverb. It is created by adding the following endings to the stem of the verb (i.e. the infinitive without the last two letters):\n\n* ''-ar'' verbs: '''''-ando'''''\n: Examples: ''hablando'' (\"speaking\"); ''cantando'' (\"singing\"); ''bailando'' (\"dancing\")\n\n* ''-er'' verbs: '''''-iendo'''''\n: Examples: ''bebiendo'' (\"drinking\"); ''leyendo'' (with spelling change; \"reading\"); ''comprendiendo'' (\"understanding\")\n\n* ''-ir'' verbs: '''''-iendo'''''\n: Examples: ''viviendo'' (\"living\"); ''sintiendo'' (with stem-vowel change; \"feeling\"); ''escribiendo'' (\"writing\")\nCertain verbs have irregular gerund forms:\n* Most ''-ir'' verbs undergo a [[Spanish_irregular_verbs#Vowel_raising|predictable stem-vowel change]]: ''sentir'' \u2192 ''sintiendo'', ''medir'' \u2192 ''midiendo'', ''repetir'' \u2192 ''repitiendo'', ''dormir'' \u2192 ''durmiendo'', ''morir'' \u2192 ''muriendo''. One ''-er'' verb also belongs to this group: ''poder'' \u2192 ''pudiendo''.\n* In verbs whose stem ends in a vowel, the spelling of the ''-iendo'' ending is changed to ''-yendo'':  ''o\u00edr'' \u2192 ''oyendo'', ''caer'' \u2192 ''cayendo'', ''leer'' \u2192 ''leyendo'', ''traer'' \u2192 ''trayendo'', ''construir'' \u2192 ''construyendo'', ''huir'' \u2192 ''huyendo''. The \"stemless\" verb ''ir'' belongs to this group, with ''yendo''.\n* For ''-er'' and ''-ir'' verbs whose stem ends in <\u00f1> or <ll>, the ''-iendo'' ending is reduced to ''-endo'': ''ta\u00f1er'' \u2192 ''ta\u00f1endo'', ''bullir'' \u2192 ''bullendo''.<ref>http://www.rae.es/obras-academicas/diccionarios/diccionario-de-la-lengua-espanola</ref>\n\nThe gerund has a variety of uses and can mean (with ''haciendo'', for example) \"doing/while doing/by doing/because of one's doing/through doing\" and so on. It is also used to form [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]] constructions, such as ''estoy haciendo'' (\"I am doing\"). The gerund cannot be used as an adjective and, unlike in most European languages, generally has no corresponding adjectival forms. The now-mostly archaic present participle, which ended in ''-ante'' or ''-iente'' and formerly filled this function, in some cases survives as such an adjective (e.g. ''durmiente'' (\"sleeping\"), ''interesante'' (\"interesting\")), but such cases are limited, and in cases where it does not, other constructions must be used to express the same ideas: where in English one would say \"the crying baby\", one would say in Spanish ''el beb\u00e9 que llora'' (\"the baby who's crying\"; ''llorante'' is archaic).\n\n==== Past participle ====\n{{See also|List of Spanish irregular participles}}\nThe past participle corresponds to the English ''-en'' or ''-ed'' form of the verb. It is created by adding the following endings to the verb stem:\n\n* ''-ar'' verbs: '''''-ado'''''\n: Examples: ''hablado'' (\"spoken\"); ''cantado'' (\"sung\"); ''bailado'' (\"danced\")\n\n* ''-er'' verbs: '''''-ido'''''\n: Examples: ''bebido'' (\"drunk\"); ''le\u00eddo'' (requires accent mark; \"read\"); ''comprendido'' (\"understood\")\n\n* ''-ir'' verbs,: '''''-ido'''''\n: Examples: ''vivido'' (\"lived\"); ''sentido'' (\"felt\"); ''hervido'' (\"boiled\")\n\nThe past participle, ending invariably in ''-o'', is used following the [[auxiliary verb]] ''haber'' to form the compound or perfect: ''(Yo) he '''hablado''''' (\"I have spoken\"); ''(Ellos) hab\u00edan '''hablado''''' (\"They had spoken\"); etc.\n\nWhen the past participle is used as an adjective, it inflects for both gender and number \u2013 for example, ''una lengua '''hablada''' en Espa\u00f1a'' (\"a language spoken in Spain\").\n\n===Voice===\nIn grammar, the voice of a verb describes the relationship between the action (or state) that the verb expresses and the participants identified by its arguments ([[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[Object (grammar)|object]], etc.). When the subject is the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] or doer of the action, the verb is in the active voice. When the subject is the [[Patient (grammar)|patient]], target, or undergoer of the action, it is said to be in the passive voice.\n\n===Verbal aspect===\nVerbal aspect marks whether an action is completed (perfect), a completed whole (perfective), or not yet completed (imperfective).\n\n* Perfect: In Spanish, verbs that are conjugated with '''''haber''''' (\"to have [done something]\") are in the [[perfect aspect]].\n* Perfective: In Spanish, verbs in the preterite are in the [[perfective aspect]].\n* Imperfective: In Spanish, the present, imperfect, and future tenses are in the [[imperfective aspect]].\n\n==Conjugation==\n\n{{for|a set of conjugation tables|Spanish conjugation}}\n\nIn this page, verb conjugation is illustrated with the verb ''hablar'' (\"to talk,\" \"to speak\").\n\n===The indicative===\n[[File:Tiempos verbales del indicativo.png|thumb|right|Graphic representation of Spanish verbal tenses of the indicative]]\nThe indicative mood has five simple tenses, each of which has a corresponding perfect form. In older classifications, the conditional tenses were considered part of an independent ''conditional mood''. Continuous forms (such as ''estoy hablando'') are usually not considered part of the verbal paradigm, though they often appear in books addressed to English speakers who are learning Spanish. Modern grammatical studies count only the simple forms as tenses, and the other forms as products of tenses and [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]].\n\n==== Simple tenses (''tiempos simples'') ====\nThe simple tenses are the forms of the verb without the use of a modal or helping verb. The following are the simple tenses and their uses:\n\n===== Present (''presente'') =====\nThe present tense is formed with the endings shown below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !!

It does not focus on when the action ended.\n\n:''Cuando era peque\u00f1o, '''hablaba''' espa\u00f1ol con mi abuela'' = \"When I was young, I spoke Spanish with my grandmother\"\n\n* '''An action interrupted by another action''': This expresses an action that was in progress when another action took place.\n\n:'''''Tom\u00e1bamos''' la cena cuando entr\u00f3 Eduardo''  = \"We were having dinner when Eduardo came in\"\n\n*'''General description of the past''': This expresses a past setting, as, for example, the background for a narrative.\n\n:''Todo '''estaba''' tranquilo esa noche.

Juan Eduardo was watching the football match with his friend Alejandro. They were eating some slices of pizza.\"\n\n===== Preterite (''pret\u00e9rito indefinido'') =====\nThe preterite is formed with the endings shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !! ''-ar'' verbs !! ''-er'' and ''-ir'' verbs!!Most irregular verbs !! ''ser/ir''\n|-\n| yo || -\u00e9 || -\u00ed ||-e || fui\n|-\n| t\u00fa/vos || -aste || -iste ||-iste ||fuiste\n|-\n| \u00e9l/ella/ello/usted || -\u00f3 || -i\u00f3 || -o ||fue\n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -amos || -imos ||-imos ||fuimos\n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -asteis || -isteis ||-isteis ||fuisteis\n|-\n| ellos/ellas/ustedes || -aron || -ieron || -ieron ||fueron\n|}\n\n'''Uses'''\n\nThe preterite is used to express the following:\n\n* '''An action that was done in the past''': This use expresses an action that is viewed as a completed event. It is often accompanied by adverbial expressions of time, such as ''ayer'', ''anteayer'', or ''la semana pasada''.\n\n:''Ayer, '''encontr\u00e9''' la flor que t\u00fa me '''diste''''' = \"Yesterday, I found the flower that you gave me\"\n\n* '''An action that interrupts another action''': This expresses an event that happened (and was completed) while another action was taking place.\n\n:''Tom\u00e1bamos la cena cuando '''entr\u00f3''' Eduardo'' = \"We were having dinner when Eduardo came in\"\n\n*'''A general truth''': This expresses a past relationship that is viewed as finished.\n\n:''Las Filipinas '''fueron''' parte del Imperio Espa\u00f1ol'' = \"The Philippines were part of the Spanish Empire\"\n\n===== Future (''futuro simple'' or ''futuro imperfecto'') =====\nThe future tense uses the entire infinitive as a stem. The following endings are attached to it:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !! (All regular verbs) ''Infinitive form'' + !! Stem changing ''-dr''\n|-\n| yo || -\u00e9 ||-dr\u00e9\n|-\n| t\u00fa/vos || -\u00e1s ||-dr\u00e1s\n|-\n| \u00e9l/ella/ello/usted || -\u00e1 ||-dr\u00e1\n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -emos ||-dremos\n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -\u00e9is ||-dr\u00e9is\n|-\n| ellos/ellas/ustedes || -\u00e1n ||-dr\u00e1n\n|}\n\n'''Uses'''\n\nThe future is used to express the following:\n\n* '''A future action''': This expresses an action that will be done in the future.\n\n:''El a\u00f1o pr\u00f3ximo, '''visitar\u00e9''' Buenos Aires'' = \"Next year, I shall/will visit Buenos Aires\"\n\n* '''Uncertainty or probability''': This expresses inference, rather than direct knowledge.\n\n:''\u00bfQui\u00e9n '''estar\u00e1''' tocando a la puerta? \u2014 '''Ser\u00e1''' Fabio.'' = \"Who (do you suppose) is knocking at the door? \u2014 It must be Fabio\". (An analogous use of the future tense occurs [[English_modal_verbs#will|in English]], as in \"That'll be Fabio\".) \n\n* '''Command, prohibition, or obligation''':\n\n:''No '''llevar\u00e1s''' a ese hombre a mi casa'' = \"Do not bring that man to my house\" or, more accurately, \"You will not bring that man to my house\"; this form is also used to assert a command, prohibition, or obligation in English. The biblical [[Ten Commandments]] are commonly expressed in the future tense in Spanish (e.g. ''No '''matar\u00e1s''''').\n\n* '''Courtesy''':\n\n:''\u00bfTe '''importar\u00e1''' encender la televisi\u00f3n?'' = \"Would you mind turning on the television?\"\n\nAnother common way to represent future time is with a present indicative conjugation of ''ir'', followed by ''a'', followed by an infinitive verb: '''''Voy a viajar''' a Bolivia en el verano'' (\"I'm going to travel to Bolivia in the summer\"). The difference between the use of the two forms varies according to dialect, but the \"''ir a'' + [infinitive]\" construction tends to be more colloquial. Also, this construction\u2014unlike the simple future form\u2014is not used in the \"probability\" sense to express conjecture.<ref>https://cvc.cervantes.es/ensenanza/biblioteca_ele/asele/pdf/15/15_0666.pdf</ref>\n\n==== Compound tenses (''tiempos compuestos'') ====\nAll the compound tenses are formed with ''haber'' followed by the past participle of the main verb. ''Haber'' changes its form for person, number, and the like, while the past participle remains invariable, ending with ''-o'' regardless of the number or gender of the subject.\n\n===== Present perfect (''pret\u00e9rito perfecto'') =====\nIn the present perfect, the present indicative of ''haber'' is used as an auxiliary, and it is followed by the past participle of the main verb. In most of Spanish America, this tense has virtually the same use as the English present perfect:\n*''Te '''he dicho''' mi opini\u00f3n'' = \"I have told you my opinion\"\n\nIn most of Spain the tense has an additional use\u2014to express a past action or event that is contained in a still-ongoing period of time or that has effects in the present:\n*''Este mes '''ha llovido''' mucho, pero hoy hace buen d\u00eda'' = \"It has rained a lot this month, but today is a fine day\"\n\nOccasionally ''tener'' and ''llevar'' are used with the past participle of a transitive verb for an effect that is similar to the present perfect. In these cases the participle usually agrees in gender and number with the direct object:\n*''Ya '''tengo compradas''' las entradas para nosotros. = \"I have already bought the tickets for us\" (Speaking of the effects in the present)\n*'''''Llevo grabados''' tres discos'' = \"I have recorded three records\"\n\n===== Past perfect or pluperfect (''pret\u00e9rito pluscuamperfecto'') =====\nIn this tense, the imperfect form of ''haber'' is used as a modal, and it is followed by the past participle of the main verb:\n\n* ''(yo) hab\u00eda'' + past participle\n* ''(t\u00fa) hab\u00edas'' + past participle\n* ''(\u00e9l/ella/ello/usted) hab\u00eda'' + past participle\n* ''(nosotros/nosotras) hab\u00edamos'' + past participle\n* ''(vosotros/vosotras) hab\u00edais'' + past participle\n* ''(ellos/ellas/ustedes) hab\u00edan'' + past participle\n\n'''Uses'''\n\nThe past perfect is used to express the following:\n\n* '''A past action that occurred prior to another past action''':\n\n:''Yo '''hab\u00eda esperado''' tres horas cuando \u00e9l lleg\u00f3'' = \"I had waited for three hours when he arrived\"\n\n===== Past anterior (''pret\u00e9rito anterior'') =====\nThe past anterior combines the preterite form of ''haber'' with the past participle of the main verb. It is very rare in spoken Spanish, but it is sometimes used in formal written language, where it is almost entirely limited to subordinate (temporal, adverbial) clauses. Thus, it is usually introduced by temporal conjunctions such as ''cuando'', ''apenas'', or ''en cuanto''. It is used to express an action that ended immediately before another past action:\n\n* ''(yo) hube'' + past participle\n* ''(t\u00fa) hubiste'' + past participle\n* ''(\u00e9l/ella/ello/usted) hubo'' + past participle\n* ''(nosotros/nosotras) hubimos'' + past participle\n* ''(vosotros/vosotras) hubisteis'' + past participle\n* ''(ellos/ellas/ustedes) hubieron'' + past participle\n\nFor example:\n*''Cuando '''hubieron llegado''' todos, empez\u00f3 la ceremonia'' = \"When everyone had arrived, the ceremony began\"\n*''Apenas Mar\u00eda '''hubo terminado''' la canci\u00f3n, su padre entr\u00f3'' = \"As soon as Maria had finished the song, her father came in\"\n\nIt is often replaced by either the preterite or the pluperfect, with the same meaning:\n\n*''Apenas Mar\u00eda '''termin\u00f3''' la canci\u00f3n, su padre entr\u00f3''\n*''Apenas Mar\u00eda '''hab\u00eda terminado''' la canci\u00f3n, su padre entr\u00f3''\n\n===== Future perfect (''futuro compuesto'') =====\nThe future perfect is formed with the future indicative of ''haber'' followed by the past participle of the main verb:\n\n* ''(yo) habr\u00e9'' + past participle\n* ''(t\u00fa) habr\u00e1s'' + past participle\n* ''(\u00e9l/ella/ello/usted) habr\u00e1'' + past participle\n* ''(nosotros/nosotras) habremos'' + past participle\n* ''(vosotros/vosotras) habr\u00e9is'' + past participle\n* ''(ellos/ellas/ustedes) habr\u00e1n'' + past participle\n\nFor example:\n*''Habr\u00e9 hablado'' = \"I shall/will have spoken\"\n\nIt is used to indicate a future action that will be finished right before another action:\n\n*''Cuando yo llegue a la fiesta, ya se habr\u00e1n marchado todos'' = \"When I get to the party, everyone will already have left\"\n\n=== The conditional ===\n\n==== Simple conditional (''condicional simple'' or ''pospret\u00e9rito'') ====\nAs with the future, the conditional uses the entire infinitive as the stem.  The following endings are attached to it:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject || (All regular verbs) ''Infinitive form'' +\n|-\n| yo || -\u00eda \n|-\n| t\u00fa/vos || -\u00edas \n|-\n| \u00e9l/ella/ello/usted || -\u00eda \n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -\u00edamos \n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -\u00edais \n|-\n| ellos/ellas/ustedes || -\u00edan \n|}\n\n'''Uses'''\n\nThe conditional is used to express the following:\n\n* '''Courtesy''': Using this mood softens a request, making it more polite.\n\n:''Se\u00f1or, \u00bf'''podr\u00eda''' darme una copa de vino?'' = \"Sir, could you give me a glass of wine?\"\n\n* '''Polite expression of a desire (using ''querer'')''':\n\n:'''''Querr\u00eda''' ver la pel\u00edcula esta semana'' = \"I would like to see the film this week\"\n\n* '''In a ''then'' clause whose realization depends on a hypothetical ''if'' clause:\n\n:''Si yo fuera rico, '''viajar\u00eda''' a Sudam\u00e9rica'' = \"If I were rich, I would travel to South America\"\n\n* '''Speculation about past events''' (the speaker's knowledge is indirect, unconfirmed, or approximating):\n\n:''\u00bfCu\u00e1ntas personas asistieron a la inauguraci\u00f3n del Presidente? \u2014 No lo s\u00e9; '''habr\u00eda''' unas 5.000'' = \"How many people attended the President's inauguration? \u2014 I do not know; there must have been about 5,000\")\n\n* '''A future action in relation to the past''': This expresses future action that was imagined in the past.\n\n:''Cuando era peque\u00f1o, pensaba que me '''gustar\u00eda''' ser m\u00e9dico'' = \"When I was young, I thought that I would like to be a doctor\"\n\n* '''A suggestion''':\n\n:''Yo que t\u00fa, lo '''olvidar\u00eda''' completamente'' = \"If I were you, I would forget him completely\"\n\n==== Conditional perfect or compound conditional (''condicional compuesto'' or ''antepospret\u00e9rito'') ====\nThe conditional perfect refers to a hypothetical past action.\n\nFor example:\n\n*''Yo habr\u00eda hablado si me hubieran/hubiesen dado la oportunidad'' = \"I would have spoken if they had given me the opportunity to\"\n\n===The imperative===\nThe imperative mood has three specific forms, corresponding to the pronouns ''t\u00fa'', ''vos'', and ''vosotros'' (''t\u00fa'' and ''vos'' are used in different regional dialects; ''vosotros'' only in Spain). These forms are used only in positive expressions, not negative ones. The subjunctive supplements the imperative in all other cases (negative expressions and the conjugations corresponding to the pronouns ''nosotros'', ''\u00e9l/ella'', ''usted'', ''ellos/ellas'', and ''ustedes'').\n\nThe imperative can also be expressed in three other ways:<ref>[http://spanish.about.com/cs/verbs/a/not_imperative.htm Other Ways of Making Commands and Requests]</ref>\n* Using the present or future indicative to form an emphatic command: ''Comer\u00e1s la verdura'' (\"You will eat the vegetables\")\n* The first person plural imperative (\"Let's...\") can also be expressed by ''Vamos a'' + infinitive: ''\u00a1Vamos a comer!''\n* Indirect commands with ''que'': ''Que lo llame el secretario'' (\"Have the secretary call him\")\n\n==== Affirmative imperative (''imperativo positivo'') ====\nThe positive form of the imperative mood in regular verbs is formed by adding the following to the stem:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !! ''-ar'' verbs !! ''-er'' verbs  !! ''-ir'' verbs\n|-\n| t\u00fa || -a || colspan=\"2\" | -e\n|-\n| vos || -\u00e1 || -\u00e9 || -\u00ed\n|-\n| usted || -e || colspan=\"2\" | -a\n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -emos || colspan=\"2\" | -amos\n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -ad (-ar) || -ed (-er) || -id (-ir) \n|-\n| ustedes || -en || colspan=\"2\" | -an\n|}\n\nThe singular imperative ''t\u00fa'' coincides with the third-person singular of the indicative for all but a few irregular verbs.  The plural ''vosotros'' is always the same as the infinitive, but with a final ''-d'' instead of an ''-r'' in the formal, written form; the informal spoken form is the same as the infinitive. The singular ''vos'' drops the ''-r'' of the infinitive, requiring a written accent to indicate the stress.\n\n==== Negative imperative (''imperativo negativo'') ====\nFor the negative imperative, the adverb ''no'' is placed before the verb, and the following endings are attached to the stem:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !! ''-ar'' verbs !! ''-er'' and ''-ir'' verbs\n|-\n| t\u00fa/vos || -es || -as\n|-\n| usted || -e || -a\n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -emos || -amos\n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -\u00e9is || -\u00e1is\n|-\n| ustedes || -en || -an\n|}\n\nNote that in the imperative, the affirmative second-person forms differ from their negative counterparts; this is the only case of a difference in conjugation between affirmative and negative in Spanish.\n\n<small>Beginner's rule:\n#To conjugate something that is positive in the imperative mood for the ''t\u00fa'' form (which is used most often), conjugate for the ''t\u00fa'' form and drop the ''s''.\n#To conjugate something that is negative in the imperative mood for the ''t\u00fa'' form (which also is used most often), conjugate in the ''yo'' form, drop the ''o'', add the opposite ''t\u00fa'' ending (if it is an ''-ar'' verb add ''es''; for an ''-er'' or ''-ir'' verb add ''as''), and then put the word ''no'' in front.\n</small>\n\n=====Emphasizing the subject=====\nIf one wishes to place emphasis on the subject of a command, it is placed after the verbal word:\n* ''Hazlo '''t\u00fa''''' = \"You do it\"\n* ''No lo diga '''usted''''' = \"Don't you [polite] say it\"\n\n==== Examples ====\n\n===== Positive command forms of the verb ''comer'' =====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is used, almost exclusively in subordinate clauses, to express the speaker's opinion or judgment, such as doubts, possibilities, emotions, and events that may or may not occur.\n\n==== Simple tenses (''tiempos simples'') ====\n\n===== Present subjunctive (''presente de subjuntivo'') =====\nThe present subjunctive of regular verbs is formed with the endings shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In Spanish America, the ''-ra'' forms are virtually the only forms used, to the exclusion of the ''-se'' forms.  In Spain, both sets of forms are used, but the ''-ra'' forms are predominant as well.\n\n======Imperfect subjunctive, ''-ra'' forms======\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !!

The following endings are attached to the preterite stem:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pronoun subject !! ''-ar'' verbs !! ''-er'' and ''-ir'' verbs\n|-\n| yo || -are || -iere\n|-\n| t\u00fa/vos || -ares || -ieres\n|-\n| \u00e9l/ella/ello/usted || -are || -iere\n|-\n| nosotros/nosotras || -\u00e1remos || -i\u00e9remos\n|-\n| vosotros/vosotras || -areis || -iereis\n|-\n| ellos/ellas/ustedes || -aren || -ieren\n|}\n\nFor example:\n*''Cuando hablaren...'' = \"Whenever they might speak...\"\n\n==== Compound tenses (''tiempos compuestos'') ====\nIn the subjunctive mood, the subjunctive forms of the verb ''haber'' are used with the past participle of the main verb.\n\n===== Present perfect subjunctive (''pret\u00e9rito perfecto de subjuntivo'') =====\n*''Cuando yo haya hablado...'' = \"When I have spoken...\"\n\n===== Pluperfect subjunctive (''pluscuamperfecto de subjuntivo'') =====\n*''Si yo hubiera hablado...'' or ''Si yo hubiese hablado...'' = \"If I had spoken...\"\n\n===== Future perfect subjunctive (''futuro compuesto de subjuntivo'') =====\nLike the simple future subjunctive, this tense is no longer used in modern Spanish.\n*''Cuando yo hubiere hablado...'' = \"When I shall have spoken...\"\n\n<small>\nNotes:\n* The present subjunctive is formed from the stem of the first person present indicative of a verb. Therefore, for an irregular verb like ''salir'' with the first person ''salgo'', the present subjunctive would be ''salga'', not ''sala''.\n* The choice between present subjunctive and imperfect subjunctive is determined by the tense of the main verb of the sentence.\n* The future subjunctive is rarely used in modern Spanish and mostly appears in old texts, legal documents, and certain fixed expressions, such as ''venga lo que viniere'' (\"come what may\").\n</small>\n\n===Continuous tenses===\nIn Spanish grammar, continuous tenses are not formally recognized as in English. Although the imperfect expresses a continuity compared to the perfect (e.g., ''te esperaba'' [\"I was waiting for you\"]), the continuity of an action is usually expressed by a verbal [[periphrasis]] (''per\u00edfrasis verbal''), as in ''estoy leyendo'' (\"I am reading\"). However, one can also say ''sigo leyendo'' (\"I am ''still'' reading\"), ''voy leyendo'' (\"I am ''slowly but surely'' reading\"), ''ando leyendo'' (\"I am ''going around'' reading\"), and others.\n\n===The passive===\n====\"True\" passive====\nThe \"true\" passive is formed with ''ser'' + the past participle, which in this case behaves like a normal adjective. Thus:\n* ''Yo soy amado'' = \"I [masc.] am loved\"\n* ''T\u00fa eras amada'' = \"You [fem.] were being loved\"\n* ''Nosotros seremos amados'' = \"We [masc.] will be loved\"\n* ''Ellas habr\u00edan sido amadas'' = \"They [fem.] would have been loved\"\n\nThe \"true\" passive is used in a variety of situations, but its use is somewhat more limited than that of its English counterpart.\n\n====''Se'' passive====\nIn the third person, reflexive constructions are often used to express ideas that could also be expressed in the passive. In such constructions, the recipient of the action is said to do the action to itself. Thus:\n* ''Se habla espa\u00f1ol'' = \"Spanish is spoken\" (lit. \"Spanish speaks itself\")\n* ''Se me dio el libro'' = \"The book was given to me\" (lit. \"The book gave itself to me\")\n* ''Se perdieron los datos'' = \"The data were lost\" (lit. \"The data lost themselves\")\n* ''Se puede hacer [ello]'' = \"It can be done\" (lit. \"It can do itself\")\n\nThe ''se'' passive is very common in the third person, but equivalent constructions cannot be used for the first and second persons: ''Yo me amo'' always translates to \"I love myself\" and never \"I am loved\".\n\n==Irregular verbs==\n{{Main|Spanish irregular verbs}}\n\nA considerable number of verbs change the vowel ''e'' in the stem to the diphthong ''ie'', and the vowel ''o'' to ''ue''. This happens when the stem vowel receives the stress. These verbs are referred to as stem-changing verbs. Examples include ''p'''e'''nsar'' (\"to think\"; e.g., ''p'''ie'''nso'' [\"I think\"]), ''s'''e'''ntarse'' (\"to sit\"; e.g., ''me s'''ie'''nto'' [\"I sit\"]), ''emp'''e'''zar'' (\"to begin\"; e.g., ''emp'''ie'''zo'' [\"I begin\"]), ''v'''o'''lver'' (\"to return\"; e.g., ''v'''ue'''lvo'' [\"I return\"]), and ''ac'''o'''starse'' (\"to go to bed\"; e.g., ''me ac'''ue'''sto'' [\"I go to bed\"]).\n\nVirtually all verbs of the third conjugation (''-ir''), if they have an ''-e-'' or ''-o-'' as the last vowel of their stem, undergo a vowel-raising change whereby ''e'' changes to ''i'' and ''o'' changes to ''u'', in some of their forms (for details, see [[Spanish irregular verbs]]). Examples include ''p'''e'''dir'' (\"to ask for\"; e.g., ''p'''i'''de'' [\"he/she asks for\"]), ''comp'''e'''tir'' (\"to compete\"; e.g., ''comp'''i'''te'' [\"he/she competes\"]), and ''derr'''e'''tirse'' (\"to melt\"; e.g., ''se derr'''i'''te'' [\"it melts\"]).\n\nThe so-called I-go verbs add a medial ''-g-'' in the first-person singular present tense (making the ''Yo'' [\"I\"] form end in ''-go''; e.g., ''tener'' [\"to have\"] becomes ''tengo'' [\"I have\"]; ''venir'' [\"to come\"] becomes ''vengo'' [\"I come\"]). The ''-g-'' is present in the present subjunctive of such verbs.  These verbs are often irregular in other forms as well.\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Contrasting simple and continuous forms===\n\nThere is no strict distinction between simple and continuous forms in Spanish as there is in English. In English, \"I do\" is one thing (a habit) and \"I am doing\" is another (current activity). In Spanish, ''hago'' can be either of the two, and ''estoy haciendo'' stresses the latter. Although not as strict as English, Spanish is stricter than French or German, which have no systematic distinction between the two concepts at all. This optionally continuous meaning that can be underlined by using the continuous form is a feature of the present and imperfect. The preterite never has this meaning, even in the continuous form, and the future has it only when it is in the continuous form.\n\n;Present\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 haces?'' could be either \"What do you do?\" or \"What are you doing?\"\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 est\u00e1s haciendo?'' is only \"What are you doing?\"\n\n;Imperfect\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 hac\u00edas?'' could be either \"What did you use to do?\" or \"What were you doing?\"\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 estabas haciendo?'' is only \"What were you doing?\"\n\n;Preterite\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 hiciste?'' is \"What did you do?\"\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 estuviste haciendo?'' is \"What were you doing (all of that time)?\"\n\nNote that since the preterite by nature refers to an event seen as having a beginning and an end, and not as a context, the use of the continuous form of the verb only adds a feeling for the length of time spent on the action. The future has two main forms in Spanish, the imperfect (compound) future and the simple one. The difference between them is one of aspect. The compound future is done with the conjugated ''ir'' (which means \"to go,\" but may also mean \"will\" in this case) plus the infinitive and, sometimes, with a present progressive verb added as well.\n\n;Future:\n* ''\u00bfQu\u00e9 vas a hacer?'' is \"What are you going to do?\" (implies that it will be done again, as in a routine)\n* ''\u00bfQu\u00e9 vas a estar haciendo?'' is \"What are you going to be doing?\" (does not necessarily imply that it will be done)\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 har\u00e1s?'' is \"What will you do?\" (will be completed immediately, or done just once)\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 estar\u00e1s haciendo?'' is \"What will you be doing?\"\n\n===Contrasting the present and the future===\n\nBoth the present and the future can express future actions, the latter more explicitly so. There are also expressions that convey the future.\n*''Mi padre llega ma\u00f1ana'' = \"My father arrives tomorrow\" (out of context, ''llega'' could mean both \"he is arriving now\" or \"he usually arrives\")\n*''Mi padre estar\u00e1 llegando ma\u00f1ana'' = \"My father will be arriving tomorrow\"\n*''Mi padre va a llegar ma\u00f1ana'' = \"My father is going to arrive tomorrow\" (future with ''ir'')\n*''Mi padre llegar\u00e1 ma\u00f1ana'' = \"My father will arrive tomorrow\" (future tense)\n*''Mi padre est\u00e1 a punto de llegar'' = \"My father is about to arrive\" (immediate future with ''estar a punto'')\n\nThe future tense can also simply express guesses about the present and immediate future:\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 hora es?'' ''Ser\u00e1n las tres'' = \"What time is it?\" \"It is about three (but I have not checked)\"\n*''\u00bfQui\u00e9n llama a la puerta?  Ser\u00e1 Jos\u00e9'' = \"Who is at the door?  It must be Jos\u00e9\"\n\nThe same is applied to imperfect and conditional:\n*''\u00bfQu\u00e9 hora era?'' ''Ser\u00edan las tres'' = \"What time was it?\" \"It was about three (but I had not checked)\"\n*''\u00bfQui\u00e9n llamaba a la puerta? Ser\u00eda Jos\u00e9'' = \"Who was at the door? It must have been Jos\u00e9\"\n\nStudies have shown that Spanish-speaking children learn this use of the future tense before they learn to use it to express future events {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} (the English future with \"will\" can also sometimes be used with this meaning). The other constructions detailed above are used instead. Indeed, in some areas, such as Argentina and Uruguay, speakers hardly use the future tense to refer to the future.\n\nThe future tense of the subjunctive mood is also obsolete in practice. As of today, it is only found in legal documents and the like. In other contexts, the present subjunctive form always replaces it.\n\n===Contrasting the preterite and the imperfect===\n\n====Fundamental meanings of the preterite and the imperfect====\nSpanish has two fundamental past tenses, the preterite and the imperfect. Strictly speaking, the difference between them is one of not [[Grammatical tense|tense]] but [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], in a manner that is similar to that of the Slavic languages. However, within Spanish grammar, they are customarily called tenses.\n\nThe difference between the preterite and the imperfect (and in certain cases, the perfect) is often hard to grasp for English speakers. English has just one past-tense form, which can have aspect added to it by auxiliary verbs, but not in ways that reliably correspond to what occurs in Spanish. The distinction between them does, however, correspond rather well to the distinctions in other Romance languages, such as between the French ''imparfait'' and ''pass\u00e9 simple'' / ''pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9'' or between the Italian ''imperfetto'' and ''passato remoto'' / ''passato prossimo''.\n\nThe imperfect fundamentally presents an action or state as being a ''context'' and is thus essentially descriptive. It does not present actions or states as having ends and often does not present their beginnings either. Like the Slavic imperfective past, it tends to show actions that used to be done at some point, as in a routine. In this case, one would say ''Yo jugaba'' (\"I used to play\"), ''Yo le\u00eda'' (\"I used to read\"), or ''Yo escrib\u00eda'' (\"I used to write\"). \n\nThe preterite (as well as the perfect, when applicable) fundamentally presents an action or state as being an ''event'', and is thus essentially narrative. It presents actions or states as having beginnings and ends. This also bears resemblance to the Slavic perfective past, as these actions are usually viewed as done in one stroke. The corresponding preterite forms would be ''Yo jugu\u00e9'' (\"I played\"), ''Yo le\u00ed'' (\"I read\") or ''Yo escrib\u00ed'' (\"I wrote\").\n\nAs stated above, deciding whether to use the preterite or the imperfect can present some difficulty for English speakers. But there are certain topics, words, and key phrases that can help one decide if the verb should be conjugated in the preterite or the imperfect. These expressions co-occur significantly more often with one or the other of the two tenses, corresponding to a completed action (preterite) or a repetitive action or a continuous action or state (imperfect) in the past.\n\nKey words and phrases that tend to co-occur with the preterite tense:\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''ayer'' (\"yesterday\")\n* ''anteayer'' (\"the day before yesterday\")\n* ''anoche'' (\"last night\")\n* ''durante dos siglos'' (\"for two centuries\")\n* ''por un rato'' (\"for a while\")\n* ''el otro d\u00eda'' (\"the other day\")\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''entonces'' (\"then\")\n* ''luego'' (\"then\"; \"and then\")\n* ''esta ma\u00f1ana'' (\"this morning\")\n* ''esta tarde'' (\"this afternoon\")\n* ''la semana pasada'' (\"last week\")\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''el mes pasado'' (\"last month\")\n* ''el a\u00f1o pasado'' (\"last year\")\n* ''hace dos d\u00edas/a\u00f1os'' (\"two days/years ago\")\n* ''de repente'' (\"suddenly\")\n* ''en 1954'', etc. (years)\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''el 25 de enero'', etc. (dates)\n* ''durante'' (\"during\")\n* ''muchas veces'' (\"many times\")\n* ''dos/tres veces'' (\"twice\"/\"three times\")\n* ''tantas veces'' (\"so many times\")\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''varias veces'' (\"several times\")\n* ''nunca'' (\"never\")\n* ''tan pronto como'' (\"as soon as\")\n* ''despu\u00e9s de que'' (\"after\")\n* ''desde que'' (\"since\")\n{{col-end}}\n\nE.g.: ''Esta ma\u00f1ana com\u00ed huevos y pan tostado'' (\"This morning I ate eggs and toast\")\n\nKey words and phrases that tend to co-occur with the imperfect tense:\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''a menudo'' (\"often\")\n* ''a veces'' (\"sometimes\")\n* ''cada d\u00eda'' (\"every day\")\n* ''cada semana'' (\"every week\")\n* ''cada mes'' (\"every month\")\n* ''cada a\u00f1o'' (\"every year\")\n* ''con frecuencia'' (\"frequently\")\n* ''de vez en cuando'' (\"from time to time\")\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''en aquella \u00e9poca'' (\"at that time\")\n* ''frecuentemente'' (\"frequently\")\n* ''generalmente'' (\"usually\")\n* ''todas las semanas'' (\"every week\")\n* ''todos los d\u00edas'' (\"every day\")\n* ''todo el tiempo'' (\"all the time\")\n* ''constantemente'' (\"constantly\")\n{{Col-break}}\n* ''mientras'' (\"while\")\n* ''regularmente'' (\"regularly\")\n* ''por lo general'' (\"generally\")\n* ''todav\u00eda'' (\"still\")\n* ''ya'' (\"already\")\n* ''Eran las tres'', etc. (\"It was three o'clock,\" etc.)\n* ''Estaba nublado'', etc. (\"It was cloudy,\" etc.)\n{{col-end}}\n\nE.g.: ''Cada a\u00f1o mi familia iba a Puerto Rico.'' (\"Each year my family went to Puerto Rico.\")\n\n====Comparison with English usage====\nThe English simple past can express either of these concepts.  However, there are devices that allow us to be more specific.  Consider, for example, the phrase \"the sun shone\" in the following contexts:\n#\"The sun shone through his window; John knew that it was going to be a fine day.\"\n#\"The sun was shining through his window; John knew that it was going to be a fine day.\"\n#\"The sun shone through his window back in those days.\"\n#\"The sun used to shine through his window back in those days.\"\n#\"The sun shone through his window the moment that John pulled back the curtain.\"\n\nIn the first two, it is clear that the shining refers to the background to the events that are about to unfold in the story. It is talking about what ''was happening''.  One has a choice between making this explicit with the past continuous, as in (2), or using the simple past and allowing the context to make it clear what is intended, as in (1). In Spanish, these would be in the imperfect, optionally in the imperfect continuous.\n\nIn (3) and (4), it is clear that the shining refers to a regular, general, habitual event. It is talking about what ''used to happen''. One has a choice between making this explicit with the expression \"used to,\" as in (4), or using the simple past and allowing the context to make it clear what we mean, as in (3). In Spanish, these would be in the imperfect, optionally with the auxiliary verb ''soler''.\n\nIn (5), only the simple past is possible. It is talking about a single event presented as occurring at a specific point in time (the moment John pulled back the curtain). The action starts and ends with this sentence. In Spanish, this would be in the preterite (or alternatively in the perfect, if the event has only just happened).\n\n====Further examples====\n*''Cuando '''ten\u00eda''' quince a\u00f1os, me '''atropell\u00f3''' un coche'' = \"When I '''was''' fifteen years old, a car '''ran over''' me\"\nThe imperfect is used for \"was\" in Spanish because it forms the background to the specific event expressed by \"was run over\", which is in the preterite.\n*''Mientras '''cruzaba'''/'''estaba cruzando''' la calle, me '''atropell\u00f3''' un coche'' = \"While I crossed/was crossing the road, a car '''ran over''' me\"\nIn both languages, the continuous form for action in progress is optional, but Spanish requires the verb in either case to be in the imperfect, because it is the background to the specific event expressed by \"was run over\", in the preterite.\n*''Siempre '''ten\u00eda''' cuidado cuando '''cruzaba''' la calle'' = \"I '''was''' always/always '''used to be''' careful when I '''crossed'''/'''used to cross''' the road\"\nThe imperfect is used for both verbs since they refer to habits in the past. Either verb could optionally use the expression \"used to\" in English.\n*''Me ba\u00f1\u00e9'' = \"I took a bath\"\nThe preterite is used if this refers to a single action or event\u2014that is, the person took a bath last night.\n*''Me ba\u00f1aba'' = \"I took baths\"\nThe imperfect is used if this refers to any sort of habitual action\u2014that is, the person took a bath every morning. Optionally, ''sol\u00eda ba\u00f1arme'' can specifically express \"I used to take baths\".\n*''Tuvo una hija'' = \"She had a daughter\"\nThe preterite is used if this refers to an event\u2014here, a birth.\n*''Ten\u00eda una hija'' = \"She had a/one daughter\"\nThe imperfect is used if this refers to the number of children by a certain point, as in \"She had one daughter when I met her ten years ago; she may have more now\". A description.\n\nNote that when describing the life of someone who is now dead, the distinction between the two tenses blurs.  One might describe the person's life saying ''ten\u00eda una hija'', but ''tuvo una hija'' is very common because the person's whole life is viewed as a whole, with a beginning and an end.  The same goes for ''viv\u00eda/vivi\u00f3 en...'' \"he lived in...\".\n\nPerhaps the verb that English speakers find most difficult to translate properly is \"to be\" in the past tense (\"was\"). Apart from the choice between the verbs ''ser'' and ''estar'' (see below), it is often very hard for English speakers to distinguish between contextual and narrative uses.\n*''Alguien '''cogi\u00f3''' mis CD.  \u00bfQui\u00e9n '''fue'''?'' = \"Someone '''took''' my CDs.  Who '''was''' it?\"\nHere the preterite is used because it is an event.  A good clue is the tense in which ''cogi\u00f3'' is.\n*'''''Hab\u00eda''' una persona que '''miraba''' los CD.  \u00bfQui\u00e9n '''era'''?'' = \"There '''was''' a person who '''was looking''' at the CDs.  Who '''was''' it?\"\nHere the imperfect is used because it is a description (the start and end of the action is not presented; it is something that was in progress at a certain time). Again, a good clue is the tense of the other verbs.\n\n===Contrasting the preterite and the perfect===\nThe preterite and the perfect are distinguished in a similar way as the equivalent English tenses. Generally, whenever the present perfect (\"I have done\") is used in English, the perfect is also used in Spanish.  In addition, there are cases in which English uses a simple past (\"I did\") but Spanish requires a perfect.  In the remaining cases, both languages use a simple past.\n\nAs in English, the perfect expresses past actions that have some link to the present.  The preterite expresses past actions as being past, complete and done with.  In both languages, there are dialectal variations.\n\n====Frame of reference includes the present: perfect====\nIf it is implicitly or explicitly communicated that the [[linguistic frame of reference|frame of reference]] for the event includes the present and the event or events may therefore continue occurring, then both languages strongly prefer the perfect.\n;With references including \"this\" including the present:\n*''Este a\u00f1o me he ido de vacaciones dos veces'' = \"This year I have gone on vacation twice\"\n*''Esta semana ha sido muy interesante'' = \"This week has been very interesting\"\n;With other references to recent periods including the present:\n*''No he hecho mucho hoy'' = \"I have not done much today\"\n*''No ha pasado nada hasta la fecha'' = \"Nothing has happened to date\"\n*''Hasta ahora no se me ha ocurrido'' = \"Until now it has not occurred to me\"\n;With reference to someone's life experience (his/her life not being over):\n*''\u00bfAlguna vez has estado en \u00c1frica?'' = \"Have you ever been in Africa?\"\n*''Mi vida no ha sido muy interesante'' = \"My life has not been very interesting\"\n*''Jam\u00e1s he robado nada'' = \"Never have I stolen anything\"\n\n====Frame of reference superficially includes the present: perfect====\nSometimes expressions like \"today\", \"this year\", and \"this week\" are used to express the idea these periods are over. This requires the simple past in English. For example, in December one might speak of the year in the simple past because we are assuming that all of that year's important events have occurred and one can talk as though it were over. Other expressions\u2014such as \"this weekend,\" if today is Monday\u2014refer to a period which is definitely over; the word \"this\" just distinguishes it from other weekends.  There is a tendency in Spanish to use the perfect even for this type of time reference, even though the preterite is possible and seems more logical.\n*''Este fin de semana hemos ido al zoo'' = \"This weekend we went to the zoo\"\n*''Hoy he tenido una jornada muy aburrida'' = \"Today I had a very boring day at work\"\n\n====Consequences continue into the present: perfect====\nAs in English, the perfect is used when the consequences of which an event are referred.\n*''Alguien ha roto esta ventana'' = \"Someone has broken this window\" (the window is currently in a broken state)\n*''Nadie me ha dicho qu\u00e9 pas\u00f3 aquel d\u00eda'' = \"Nobody has told me what happened that day\" (therefore, I still do not know)\nThese same sentences in the preterite would purely refer to the past actions, without any implication that they have repercussions now.\n\nIn English, this type of perfect is not possible if a precise time frame is added or even implied. One cannot say \"I have been born in 1978,\" because the date requires \"I was born,\" despite the fact there is arguably a present consequence in the fact that the person is still alive. Spanish sporadically uses the perfect in these cases.\n*''He nacido en 1978'' (usually ''Nac\u00ed en 1978'') = \"I was born in 1978\"\n*''Me he criado en Madrid'' (usually ''Me cri\u00e9 en Madrid'') = \"I grew up in Madrid\"\n\n====The event itself continues into the present: perfect or present====\nIf the event itself has been happening recently and is also happening right now or expected to continue happening soon, then the preterite is impossible in both languages. English requires the perfect, or better yet the perfect continuous. Spanish requires the perfect, or better yet the present simple:\n*''\u00daltimamente ha llovido mucho'' / ''\u00daltimamente llueve mucho'' = \"It has rained / It has been raining a lot recently\"\nThis is the only use of the perfect that is common in colloquial speech across Latin America.\n\n====Dialectal variation====\nIn the Canary Islands and across Latin America, there is a colloquial tendency to replace most uses of the perfect with the preterite. This use varies according to region, register, and education.\n* ''\u00bfY vos alguna vez estuviste all\u00e1?'' = ''\u00bfY t\u00fa alguna vez has estado all\u00ed?'' = \"And have you ever been there?\"\n\nThe one use of the perfect that does seem to be normal in Latin America is the perfect for actions that continue into the present (not just the time frame, but the action itself). Therefore, \"I have read a lot in my life\" and \"I read a lot this morning\" would both be expressed with ''le\u00ed'' instead of ''he le\u00eddo'', but \"I have been reading\" is expressed by ''he le\u00eddo''.\n\nA less standard use of the perfect is found in Ecuador and Colombia. It is used with present or occasionally even future meaning. For example, [[Shakira Mebarak]] in her song \"Ciega, Sordomuda\" sings,\n*''Bruta, ciega, sordomuda, / torpe, traste, testaruda; / es todo lo que he sido'' = \"Clumsy, blind, dumb, / blundering, useless, pig-headed; / that is all that I had been\"\n<!---===Contrasting the indicative and the subjunctive===\n===Contrasting the subjunctive and the conditional===--->\n\n===Contrasting the subjunctive and the imperative===\n\nThe subjunctive mood expresses wishes and hypothetical events. It is often employed together with a conditional verb:\n\n*''Desear\u00eda que estuvieses aqu\u00ed.'' = \"I wish that you were here.\"\n*''Me alegrar\u00eda mucho si volvieras ma\u00f1ana.'' = \"I would be very glad if you came back tomorrow.\"\n\nThe imperative mood shows commands given to the hearer (the second person). There is no imperative form in the third person, so the subjunctive is used. The expression takes the form of a command or wish directed at the hearer, but referring to the third person. The difference between a command and a wish is subtle, mostly conveyed by the absence of a wishing verb:\n\n*''Que venga el gerente.'' = \"Let the manager come.\", \"Have the manager come.\"\n*''Que se cierren las puertas.'' = \"Let the doors be closed.\", \"Have the doors closed.\"\n\nWith a verb that expresses wishing, the above sentences become plain subjunctive instead of direct commands:\n\n*''Deseo que venga el gerente.'' = \"I wish for the manager to come.\"\n*''Quiero que se cierren las puertas.'' = \"I want the doors (to be) closed.\"\n\n===Contrasting the present and the future subjunctive===\n\nThe future tense of the subjunctive is found mostly in old literature or [[Legal English|legal language]] and is even misused in conversation by confusing it with the past tense (often due to the similarity of its characteristic suffix, ''-ere'', as opposed to the suffixes of the past tense, ''-era'' and ''-ese''). It is very rare otherwise.\n\nIt survives in the common expression ''sea lo que fuere'' and the proverb ''all\u00e1 donde fueres, haz lo que vieres'' (''all\u00e1 donde'' can be replaced by ''a la tierra donde'' or ''si a Roma'').\n\nThe proverb illustrates how it used to be used:\n*With ''si'' referring to the future, as in ''si a Roma fueres...''.  This is now expressed with the present indicative: ''si vas a Roma...'' or ''si fueras a Roma...''\n*With ''cuando'', ''donde'', and the like, referring to the future, as in ''all\u00e1 donde fueres...''.  This is now expressed with the present subjunctive: ''vayas adonde vayas...''\n\n===Contrasting the preterite and the past anterior===\n\nThe past anterior is rare nowadays and restricted to formal use. It expresses a very fine nuance: the fact that an action occurs just after another (had) occurred, with words such as ''cuando'', ''nada m\u00e1s'', and ''en cuanto'' (\"when\", \"no sooner\", \"as soon as\").  In English, one must use either the simple past or the past perfect; Spanish has something specific between the two.\n*''En cuanto el delincuente hubo salido del cuarto, la v\u00edctima se ech\u00f3 a llorar'' = \"As soon as the criminal (had) left the room, the victim burst into tears\"\n\nThe use of ''hubo salido'' shows that the second action happened immediately after the first. ''Sali\u00f3'' might imply that it happened at the same time, and ''hab\u00eda salido'' might imply it happened some time after.\n\nHowever, colloquial Spanish has lost this tense and the corresponding nuance, and the preterite must be used instead in all but the most formal of writing.\n\n===Contrasting ''ser'' and ''estar''===\n{{Main|Romance copula}}\n\nThe differences between ''ser'' and ''estar'' are considered one of the most difficult concepts for non-native speakers. Both ''ser'' and ''estar'' translate into [[English language|English]] as \"to be\", but they have different uses, depending on whether they are used with nouns, with adjectives, with past [[participles]] (more precisely, ''passive'' participles), or to express location. \n\nOnly ''ser'' is used to equate one [[noun phrase]] with another, and thus it is the verb for expressing a person's occupation (\"Mi hermano es estudiante\"/\"My brother is a student\"). For the same reason, ''ser'' is used for telling the date or the time, regardless of whether the subject is explicit (\"Hoy es mi\u00e9rcoles\"/\"Today is Wednesday\") or merely implied (\"Son las ocho\"/\"It's eight o'clock\"). \n\nWhen these verbs are used with adjectives, the difference between them may be generalized by saying that ''ser'' expresses nature and ''estar'' expresses state. Frequently\u2014although not always\u2014adjectives used with ''ser'' express a permanent quality, while their use with ''estar'' expresses a temporary situation. There are exceptions to the generalization; for example, the sentence \"Tu mam\u00e1 est\u00e1 loca\" (\"Your mother is crazy\") can express either a temporary or a permanent state of craziness.\n\n''Ser'' generally focuses on the essence of the subject, and specifically on qualities that include:\n# Nationality\n# Possession\n# Physical and personality traits\n# Material\n# Origin\n\n''Estar'' generally focuses on the condition of the subject, and specifically on qualities that include:\n# Physical condition\n# Feelings, emotions, and states of mind\n# Appearance\n\nIn English, the sentence \"The boy is boring\" uses a different adjective than \"The boy is bored\". In Spanish, the difference is made by the choice of ''ser'' or ''estar''.\n*''El chico es aburrido'' uses ''ser'' to express a permanent trait (\"The boy is boring\").\n*''El chico est\u00e1 aburrido'' uses ''estar'' to express a temporary state of mind (\"The boy is bored\").\n\nThe same strategy is used with many adjectives to express either an inherent trait (''ser'') or a transitory state or condition (''estar''). For example: \n*\"Mar\u00eda es guapa\" uses ''ser'' to express an essential trait, meaning \"Mar\u00eda is a good-looking person.\"\n*\"Mar\u00eda est\u00e1 guapa\" uses ''estar'' to express a momentary impression: \"Mar\u00eda looks beautiful\" (a comment on her present appearance, without any implication about her inherent characteristics).\n\nWhen ''ser'' is used with the past participle of a verb, it forms the \"true\" [[passive voice]], expressing an event (\"El libro '''fue escrito''' en 2005\"/\"The book '''was written''' in 2005\"). When the past participle appears with ''estar'', it forms a \"passive of result\" or \"[[stative verb|stative]] passive\" (\"El libro ya '''est\u00e1 escrito'''\"/\"The book '''is''' already '''written'''\"\u2014see [[Spanish conjugation]]).\n\nLocation of a person or thing is expressed with ''estar''\u2014regardless of whether temporary or permanent (\"El hotel '''est\u00e1''' en la esquina\"/\"The hotel is on the corner\"). Location of an event is expressed with ''ser'' (\"La reuni\u00f3n '''es''' en el hotel\"/\"The meeting is [takes place] in the hotel\").\n\n===Contrasting ''haber'' and ''tener''===\n\nThe verbs ''haber'' and ''tener'' are easily distinguished, but they may pose a problem for learners of Spanish who speak other Romance languages (where the cognates of ''haber'' and ''tener'' are used differently), for English speakers (where \"have\" is used as a verb and as an auxiliary), and others. ''Haber'' derives from Latin ''habe\u014d'',; with the basic meaning of \"to have\". ''Tener'' derives from Latin ''tene\u014d'', with the basic meaning of \"to hold\", \"to keep\". As ''habe\u014d'' began to degrade and become reduced to just ambiguous monosyllables in the present tense, the Iberian Romance languages (Spanish, Gallician-Portuguese, and Catalan) restricted its use and started to use ''tene\u014d'' as the ordinary verb expressing having and possession. French instead reinforced ''habe\u014d'' with obligatory subject pronouns.\n\n====''Haber'': expressing existence====\n''Haber'' is used as an impersonal verb to show existence of an object or objects, which is generally expressed as an indefinite noun phrase. In English, this corresponds to the use of \"there\" + the corresponding inflected form of \"to be\".  When used in this sense, ''haber'' has a special present-tense form: ''hay'' instead of ''ha''. The ''y'' is presumed to be a fossilized form of the mediaeval Castilian [[clitic]] pronoun ''y'' or ''i'', once meaning \"there\", but now semantically empty, historically [[cognate]] with French ''y'', Catalan ''hi'' and Italian ''vi'' from Latin ''ibi''.\n\nUnlike in English, the thing that \"is there\" is not the subject of the sentence, and therefore there is no agreement between it and the verb. This echoes constructions seen in languages such as French (''il y a'' = \"it there has\"), Catalan (''hi ha'' = \"[it] there has\"), and even Chinese (\u6709 ''y\u01d2u'' = \"[it] has\"):\n\n*''Hay un gato en el jard\u00edn.'' = \"There is a cat in the garden.\"\n*''En el ba\u00fal hay fotograf\u00edas viejas.'' = \"In the trunk there are some old photos.\"\n\nTo form perfect constructions, the past participle ''habido'' is used:\n\n* ''Ha habido mucha confusi\u00f3n de esto.'' = \"There's been a lot of confusion about this.\"\n* ''Ha habido pocos hasta ahora.'' = \"There have been few so far.\"\n\nIt is possible, in certain types of emphasis, to put the verb after the object:\n\n*''\u00bfRevistas hay?'' = \"Are there any magazines?\"\n\nThere is a tendency to make ''haber'' agree with what follows, as though it were the subject, particularly in tenses other than the present indicative. There is heavier stigma on inventing plural forms for ''hay'', but ''hain'', ''han'', and suchlike are sometimes encountered in non-standard speech. The form ''habemos'' is common (meaning \"there are, including me\"); it very rarely replaces ''hemos'' to form the present perfect tense in modern language,<ref>See [http://www.corpusdelespanol.org/ Corpus del Espa\u00f1ol]</ref> and in certain contexts it is even acceptable in formal or literary language:\n\n*''Hab\u00eda un hombre en la casa.'' = \"There was a man in the house.\"\n*''Hab\u00eda unos hombres en la casa.'' = \"There were some men in the house.\" (standard)\n*''Hab\u00edan unos hombres en la casa.'' = \"There were some men in the house.\" (non-standard)\n*''En esta casa habemos cinco personas.'' = \"In this house there are five of us.\" (non-standard)<ref>''Diccionario panhisp\u00e1nico de dudas'', [http://rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=phjmVDAG4D6WPVG3Nr haber]</ref>\n*''Habr\u00eda habido muchos m\u00e1s si supiera.'' = \"There would have been a lot more if I knew.\" (standard)\n*''Nos las habemos con un gran jugador.'' = \"We are confronting a great player.\" (standard)\n\nAs an existential verb, ''haber'' is never used other than in the third person. To express the existence of a first or second person, the verb ''estar'' (\"to be [located/present]\") or ''existir'' (\"to exist\") is used, and there is subject\u2013verb agreement.\n\n====''Haber'': impersonal obligation====\nThe phrase ''haber que'' (in the third person singular and followed by a subordinated construction with the verb in the infinitive) carries the meaning of necessity or obligation without specifying an agent. It is translatable as \"it is necessary\", but a paraphrase is generally preferable in translation. Note that the present-tense form is ''hay''.\n\n*''Hay que abrir esa puerta.'' = \"That door needs opening\", \"We have to open that door\".\n*''Habr\u00e1 que abrir esa puerta.'' = \"That door will need opening\", \"We are going to have to open that door\".\n*''Aunque haya que abrir esa puerta.'' = \"Even if that door needs to be opened\".\n\nThis construction is comparable to French ''il faut'' and Catalan ''cal''. ''Hay que'' always goes with the infinitive.\n\n====''Haber'': personal obligation====\nA separate construction is ''haber de'' + infinitive. It is not impersonal. It tends to express a certain nuance of obligation and a certain nuance of future tense, much like the expression \"to be to\". It is also often used similarly to ''tener que'' and ''deber'' (\"must\", \"ought to\"). Note that the third personal singular of the present tense is ''ha''.\n\n*''Ma\u00f1ana he de dar una charla ante la Universidad'' = \"Tomorrow I am to give a speech before the University\".\n*''Ha de comer m\u00e1s verduras'' = \"She/he ought to eat more vegetables\".\n\n====''Haber'': forming the perfect====\n''Haber'' is also used as an auxiliary to form the perfect, as shown elsewhere. Spanish uses only ''haber'' for this, unlike French and Italian, which use the corresponding cognates of ''haber'' for most verbs, but cognates of ''ser'' (\"to be\") for certain others.\n\n*''Ella se ha ido al mercado'' = \"She has gone to the market\"\n*''Ellas se han ido de paseo'' = \"They have gone on a walk\"\n*''\u00bfHab\u00e9is fregado los platos?'' = \"Have you (all) done the washing-up?\"\n\n====''Tener''====\n''Tener'' is a verb with the basic meaning of \"to have\", in its essential sense of \"to possess\", \"to hold\", \"to own\".  As in English, it can also express obligation (''tener que'' + infinitive). It also appears in a number of phrases that show emotion or physical states, expressed by nouns, which in English tend to be expressed by \"to be\" and an adjective.\n\n*''Mi hijo tiene una casa nueva'' = \"My son has a new house\"\n*''Tenemos que hablar'' = \"We have to talk\"\n*''Tengo hambre'' = \"I am hungry\" (lit. \"I have hunger\")\n\nThere are numerous phrases like ''tener hambre'' that are not literally translated in English, such as:<ref name=\"abouttenernouns\">[http://spanish.about.com/cs/vocabulary/a/tenerplusnoun.htm Spanish Idioms of the Form 'Tener' + Noun \u2013 Learn Spanish Language<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*''tener hambre'' = \"to be hungry\"; \"to have hunger\"\n*''tener sed'' = \"to be thirsty\"; \"to have thirst\"\n*''tener cuidado'' = \"to be careful\"; \"to have caution\"\n*''tener __ a\u00f1os'' = \"to be __ years old\"; \"to have __ years\"\n*''tener celos'' = \"to be jealous\"; \"to have jealousy\"\n*''tener \u00e9xito'' = \"to be successful\"; \"to have success\"\n*''tener verg\u00fcenza'' = \"to be ashamed\"; \"to have shame\"\n\nNote: ''Estar hambriento'' is a literal translation of \"To be hungry\", but it is rarely used in Spanish nowadays.\n<!--===Use of the gerund===-->\n\n===Negation===\n\nVerbs are negated by putting ''no'' before the verb.\nOther negative words can either replace this ''no'' or occur after the verb:\n*''Hablo espa\u00f1ol'' = \"I speak Spanish\"\n*''No hablo espa\u00f1ol'' = \"I do not speak Spanish\"\n*''Nunca hablo espa\u00f1ol'' = \"I never speak Spanish\"\n*''No hablo nunca espa\u00f1ol'' = \"I do not ever speak Spanish\"\n\n===Expressing movement===\n\nSpanish verbs describing motion tend to emphasize direction instead of manner of motion. According to the pertinent classification, this makes Spanish a [[verb framing|verb-framed]] language. This contrasts with English, where verbs tend to emphasize manner, and the direction of motion is left to helper particles, [[preposition]]s, or [[adverb]]s.\n\n*\"We drove away\" = ''Nos fuimos en coche'' (lit. \"We went (away) by car\")\n*\"He swam to Ibiza\" = ''Fue a Ibiza nadando'' (lit. \"He went to Ibiza swimming\")\n*\"They ran off\" = ''Huyeron corriendo'' (lit. \"They fled running\")\n*\"She crawled in\" = ''Entr\u00f3 a gatas'' (lit. \"She entered on all fours\")\n\nQuite often, the important thing is the direction, not the manner. Therefore, although \"we drove away\" translates into Spanish as ''nos fuimos en coche'', it is often better to translate it as just ''nos fuimos''.  For example:\n\n{{quote|text=''La llev\u00e9 al aeropuerto en coche, pero se le hab\u00eda olvidado el tiquete, as\u00ed que fuimos a casa [en coche] por \u00e9l, luego volvimos [en coche] hacia el aeropuerto, pero luego tuvimos que volver [en coche] por el pasaporte, y ya era imposible que consigui\u00e9semos facturar el equipaje...'' = \"I drove her to the airport, but she had forgotten her ticket, so we drove home to get it, then drove back towards the airport, but then had to drive back home for her passport, by which time there was zero chance of checking in...\"}}\n\n==Verbal nouns==\nSpanish verbal nouns (e.g. \"running\", \"coming\", \"thinking\" in English) are identical in form to the infinitive of the verb from which they are derived, and their gender is masculine. They are generally used with the definite article, and [[Spanish_pronouns#Clitic_pronouns_and_enclitization|enclitic pronouns]] attach to them as they would a normal infinitive. Thus:\n\n* ''el comer'' = \"eating\"\n* ''el correr'' = \"running\"\n* ''el no esperar'' = \"not waiting\"\n* ''el darte un libro'' = \"giving you a book\"\n* ''el guard\u00e1rselos'' = \"saving them for him/her/you/them\"\n\n== References ==\n{{Wiktionary category|category=Spanish verbs|type=Spanish verbs}}\n{{wikibooks|Spanish}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spanish verbs}}\n[[Category:Spanish grammar|Verbs]]\n[[Category:Verbs by language]]\n", "name_user": "71.167.34.123", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_verbs"}

They begin to have feelings for one another, and it causes some awkwardness at work, particularly after her supervising resident [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] discovers their relationship. Meredith's housemates and fellow interns George O'Malley and Izzie Stevens both antagonized her for some time as they felt she was using her relationship with Derek to further her career. He generally tolerated them despite his dislike of sharing his living space with the interns who worked under him.

In the season one finale, his past eventually catches up with him when his estranged wife Addison moves to Seattle and is offered a position by Dr. Webber. Shortly after that, his childhood best friend Mark joins Seattle Grace as the new head of plastic surgery. Derek and Addison attempt to repair their marriage but attempts were futile. Since their divorce, they have remained on amicable terms, with Addison even admonishing Meredith for breaking up with Derek in season three. He admits to Meredith that Addison cheating on him with Mark was partly his fault as an absentee husband.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Yesterday|episodelink=Grey's Anatomy (season 2)#ep27|series=Grey's Anatomy|serieslink=Grey's Anatomy|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=February 19, 2006|season=2|number=18}}</ref> Addison eventually leaves Seattle for a private practice in [[Los Angeles]], spawning the spin-off ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]''. (In the ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'' episode \"[[Private Practice (season 2)#ep25|Ex-Life]]\" Derek finally tells Addison that his mother never liked her in the first place. ). In the season eight episode \"[[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)#ep161|If/Then]]\", Meredith dreams of an alternate universe where her mother never had Alzheimer's; Derek and Addison are still married, but their strained relationship and Shepherd's disillusionment causes his career to stagnate, earning him the nicknames \"Bad Shepherd\" and \"McDreary\".\n\nWhen Derek is offered the Chief of Surgery position for the second time, he persuades the board to keep Dr. Webber on the staff. \nDuring the merger of Seattle Grace with Mercy West their relationship sours when Derek disagreed with Richard's handling of the merger and Richard begins to display uncharacteristic behavior, not unnoticed by his fellow surgeons. Derek learns from Meredith that Richard has since resumed drinking and feels forced to have him removed as Chief of Surgery. With mixed feelings, Derek offers him an ultimatum: go into rehab and possibly pick up where he left off after, or quit altogether.\n\nIn seasons three and four, Meredith and Derek's relationship becomes rocky, and they each take time to date, other people. Derek's plans to propose were ruined by a series of unfortunate events in season five. In the season finale, they decide to give their planned wedding to Alex and Izzie. Due to their tight schedule, they instead informally marry, and Derek writes down their \"promises\" on a [[post-it note]]. They legalize their marriage in season seven to adopt Zola, a young African orphan treated for [[spina bifida]].<ref>{{Cite episode|title=White Wedding|episodelink=Grey's Anatomy (season 5)#ep146|series=Grey's Anatomy|serieslink=Grey's Anatomy|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=May 5, 2011|season=7|number=20}}</ref> They briefly separate after Meredith tampers with their Alzheimer's trial, jeopardizing her career and tarnishing Derek's reputation. Zola is taken away from Meredith after a social worker finds out she and Derek are living separately. In later seasons, Derek often griped about how his subsequent interns and residents \u2013 mainly Lexie Grey, Shane Ross, and Heather Brooks \u2013 did not quite measure up to Meredith.<ref name=\"S08E06\"/><ref name=\"S08E04\"/> The social worker comes back and announces they are the official parents of Zola. As Meredith nears the end of her fifth year of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]], she and Derek are torn between staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West or leaving for Boston where Derek would work at Harvard while Meredith would be at the [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]].\n\nFollowing his rescue from the plane crash that killed Mark and Lexie, Derek learns that he may only regain 80 percent of his hand's function. He comes to terms with the fact that his career as a surgeon may be over and is grateful that he is alive. When [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]), head of orthopedic surgery, tells him a more risky surgery could give him back full function of his hand or reduce its function if it goes wrong, he agrees, accepting the possibility of never again holding a scalpel. Derek recovers well, and Callie clears him to return to work, but it is still weeks later that he feels ready to operate. Derek, Callie, and fellow resident, Jackson Avery, decide to do nerve transplant for his hand. Meredith, newly pregnant with their second child, goes behind his back and calls his sisters so they can donate a nerve to him. Lizzie ([[Neve Campbell]]), Derek's younger sister, agrees to donate a nerve and the surgery is a success.\n\nDerek and Meredith's marriage is strained after he accepted an invitation from the President to participate in the Brain-Mapping Initiative. He went back on his promise to her that he would not add to his current workload to devote time to their two young children and allow her the chance to establish her career as a full-fledged attending. Eventually, he was offered a position at the [[National Institutes of Health]] in Washington, D.C., but Meredith puts her foot down and refuses to leave her hometown and uproot their young family. His youngest sister [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] ([[Caterina Scorsone]]) takes over his position at Grey Sloan. Meanwhile, he and Meredith fight bitterly on and off over whether they should move. After a tense argument, he accepts the job in the heat of the moment and leaves for Washington. While there, he and Meredith talk things out over the phone and come to a mutual conclusion that they both did not want to end their marriage. He tells her that just being with her, raising their children and operating on patients was more satisfying than \"saving the world\".\n\nIn season 11, Derek is involved in a fatal car accident while driving to the airport for his final trip to Washington. He can hear and process auditory input but is unable to speak. He is recognized by Winnie, one of the victims of a crash he assisted in earlier, who tells the surgeons that their patient's name is Derek and that he is a surgeon as well. The hospital he was taken to was understaffed and under-equipped, and his head injury was not detected quickly enough by the arrogant doctors and inexperienced interns on duty that night; although one intern did suspect Derek had a head injury, her superior repeatedly shut down her attempts to get him a head CT, prioritizing his abdominal bleeding beforehand and having him rushed into surgery even though he was stable enough for the CT. Although the neurosurgeon on call is paged multiple times, he takes too long to arrive, and Derek is declared brain dead. Police arrive at Meredith's door and take her to see Derek, where she consents to remove him from life support. At the time of his death, Meredith was pregnant with their third child. She gives birth to a daughter whom she names Ellis after her mother.\n\nDerek was mentioned or referenced several times in season 12 as the other characters struggle to cope with his sudden death. In the episode \"[[Grey's Anatomy (season 12)#ep257|My Next Life]]\", Meredith had a flashback of their first ever surgery together when a patient named Katie Bryce was admitted to the hospital with a brain aneurysm. Amelia took his death especially hard as he was the sibling she was closest to. At the end of the season, before her wedding to Derek's long-time colleague [[Owen Hunt]], Amelia goes on a nervous rant about how Derek was supposed to be the one to give her away, him having given away their three other sisters at their weddings.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Casting and creation===\nWhen [[Patrick Dempsey]] auditioned for the role of Derek Shepherd, he was afraid that he was not going to get the part. Creator Shonda Rhimes' first reaction was: \"The very first time I met him, I was absolutely sure that he was my guy. Reading the lines of Derek Shepherd, Patrick had a vulnerable charm that I just fell for. And he had amazing chemistry with Ellen Pompeo.\" Rhimes admitted that Dempsey's dyslexia threw her at first, particularly at the first few [[Read-through|table readings]]: \"I did not know about Patrick's dyslexia in the beginning. I actually thought that he didn't like the scripts from the way he approached the readings. When I found out, I completely understood his hesitation.

Meredith and Derek's love had to remain Meredith and Derek's love. As painful as it was for me as a storyteller, because I had never really thought that was going to happen, it preserved what felt true to me, was that Derek was going to have to die in order for that love to remain honest.

A man who is charming, devilishly handsome and the type of guy every girl dreams of, and a man that often makes the wrong decisions, and is often known as a jerk or the ultimate heartbreaker.

They begin to have feelings for one another, and it causes some awkwardness at work, particularly after her supervising resident [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] discovers their relationship. Meredith's housemates and fellow interns George O'Malley and Izzie Stevens both antagonized her for some time as they felt she was using her relationship with Derek to further her career. He generally tolerated them despite his dislike of sharing his living space with the interns who worked under him.

In the season one finale, his past eventually catches up with him when his estranged wife Addison moves to Seattle and is offered a position by Dr. Webber. Shortly after that, his childhood best friend Mark joins Seattle Grace as the new head of plastic surgery. Derek and Addison attempt to repair their marriage but attempts were futile. Since their divorce, they have remained on amicable terms, with Addison even admonishing Meredith for breaking up with Derek in season three. He admits to Meredith that Addison cheating on him with Mark was partly his fault as an absentee husband.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Yesterday|episodelink=Grey's Anatomy (season 2)#ep27|series=Grey's Anatomy|serieslink=Grey's Anatomy|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=February 19, 2006|season=2|number=18}}</ref> Addison eventually leaves Seattle for a private practice in [[Los Angeles]], spawning the spin-off ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]''. (In the ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'' episode \"[[Private Practice (season 2)#ep25|Ex-Life]]\" Derek finally tells Addison that his mother never liked her in the first place. ). In the season eight episode \"[[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)#ep161|If/Then]]\", Meredith dreams of an alternate universe where her mother never had Alzheimer's; Derek and Addison are still married, but their strained relationship and Shepherd's disillusionment causes his career to stagnate, earning him the nicknames \"Bad Shepherd\" and \"McDreary\".\n\nWhen Derek is offered the Chief of Surgery position for the second time, he persuades the board to keep Dr. Webber on the staff. \nDuring the merger of Seattle Grace with Mercy West their relationship sours when Derek disagreed with Richard's handling of the merger and Richard begins to display uncharacteristic behavior, not unnoticed by his fellow surgeons. Derek learns from Meredith that Richard has since resumed drinking and feels forced to have him removed as Chief of Surgery. With mixed feelings, Derek offers him an ultimatum: go into rehab and possibly pick up where he left off after, or quit altogether.\n\nIn seasons three and four, Meredith and Derek's relationship becomes rocky, and they each take time to date, other people. Derek's plans to propose were ruined by a series of unfortunate events in season five. In the season finale, they decide to give their planned wedding to Alex and Izzie. Due to their tight schedule, they instead informally marry, and Derek writes down their \"promises\" on a [[post-it note]]. They legalize their marriage in season seven to adopt Zola, a young African orphan treated for [[spina bifida]].<ref>{{Cite episode|title=White Wedding|episodelink=Grey's Anatomy (season 5)#ep146|series=Grey's Anatomy|serieslink=Grey's Anatomy|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=May 5, 2011|season=7|number=20}}</ref> They briefly separate after Meredith tampers with their Alzheimer's trial, jeopardizing her career and tarnishing Derek's reputation. Zola is taken away from Meredith after a social worker finds out she and Derek are living separately. In later seasons, Derek often griped about how his subsequent interns and residents \u2013 mainly Lexie Grey, Shane Ross, and Heather Brooks \u2013 did not quite measure up to Meredith.<ref name=\"S08E06\"/><ref name=\"S08E04\"/> The social worker comes back and announces they are the official parents of Zola. As Meredith nears the end of her fifth year of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]], she and Derek are torn between staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West or leaving for Boston where Derek would work at Harvard while Meredith would be at the [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]].\n\nFollowing his rescue from the plane crash that killed Mark and Lexie, Derek learns that he may only regain 80 percent of his hand's function. He comes to terms with the fact that his career as a surgeon may be over and is grateful that he is alive. When [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]), head of orthopedic surgery, tells him a more risky surgery could give him back full function of his hand or reduce its function if it goes wrong, he agrees, accepting the possibility of never again holding a scalpel. Derek recovers well, and Callie clears him to return to work, but it is still weeks later that he feels ready to operate. Derek, Callie, and fellow resident, Jackson Avery, decide to do nerve transplant for his hand. Meredith, newly pregnant with their second child, goes behind his back and calls his sisters so they can donate a nerve to him. Lizzie ([[Neve Campbell]]), Derek's younger sister, agrees to donate a nerve and the surgery is a success.\n\nDerek and Meredith's marriage is strained after he accepted an invitation from the President to participate in the Brain-Mapping Initiative. He went back on his promise to her that he would not add to his current workload to devote time to their two young children and allow her the chance to establish her career as a full-fledged attending. Eventually, he was offered a position at the [[National Institutes of Health]] in Washington, D.C., but Meredith puts her foot down and refuses to leave her hometown and uproot their young family. His youngest sister [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] ([[Caterina Scorsone]]) takes over his position at Grey Sloan. Meanwhile, he and Meredith fight bitterly on and off over whether they should move. After a tense argument, he accepts the job in the heat of the moment and leaves for Washington. While there, he and Meredith talk things out over the phone and come to a mutual conclusion that they both did not want to end their marriage. He tells her that just being with her, raising their children and operating on patients was more satisfying than \"saving the world\".\n\nIn season 11, Derek is involved in a fatal car accident while driving to the airport for his final trip to Washington. He can hear and process auditory input but is unable to speak. He is recognized by Winnie, one of the victims of a crash he assisted in earlier, who tells the surgeons that their patient's name is Derek and that he is a surgeon as well. The hospital he was taken to was understaffed and under-equipped, and his head injury was not detected quickly enough by the arrogant doctors and inexperienced interns on duty that night; although one intern did suspect Derek had a head injury, her superior repeatedly shut down her attempts to get him a head CT, prioritizing his abdominal bleeding beforehand and having him rushed into surgery even though he was stable enough for the CT. Although the neurosurgeon on call is paged multiple times, he takes too long to arrive, and Derek is declared brain dead. Police arrive at Meredith's door and take her to see Derek, where she consents to remove him from life support. At the time of his death, Meredith was pregnant with their third child. She gives birth to a daughter whom she names Ellis after her mother.\n\nDerek was mentioned or referenced several times in season 12 as the other characters struggle to cope with his sudden death. In the episode \"[[Grey's Anatomy (season 12)#ep257|My Next Life]]\", Meredith had a flashback of their first ever surgery together when a patient named Katie Bryce was admitted to the hospital with a brain aneurysm. Amelia took his death especially hard as he was the sibling she was closest to. At the end of the season, before her wedding to Derek's long-time colleague [[Owen Hunt]], Amelia goes on a nervous rant about how Derek was supposed to be the one to give her away, him having given away their three other sisters at their weddings.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Casting and creation===\nWhen [[Patrick Dempsey]] auditioned for the role of Derek Shepherd, he was afraid that he was not going to get the part. Creator Shonda Rhimes' first reaction was: \"The very first time I met him, I was absolutely sure that he was my guy. Reading the lines of Derek Shepherd, Patrick had a vulnerable charm that I just fell for. And he had amazing chemistry with Ellen Pompeo.\" Rhimes admitted that Dempsey's dyslexia threw her at first, particularly at the first few [[Read-through|table readings]]: \"I did not know about Patrick's dyslexia in the beginning. I actually thought that he didn't like the scripts from the way he approached the readings. When I found out, I completely understood his hesitation. Now that we all know, if he is struggling with a word, the other actors are quick to step up and help him out. Everyone is very respectful.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[Isaiah Washington]] also auditioned for the part and when he did not get it, he said his reaction was like \"I'd been kicked in the stomach by 14 mules.\" Washington was, however, later cast as [[Preston Burke]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/isaiah-washington-greys-41872.aspx|title=Today's News: Our Take&nbsp;\u2013 Vet Earns M.D. on Grey's Anatomy|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=July 15, 2005| accessdate=September 3, 2012|author=Rhodes, Joe}}</ref> [[Rob Lowe]] was also considered to portray Shepherd but turned the role down.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keck|first=William|title=Lowe knows political roles|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-11-16-rob-lowe_x.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=September 8, 2012|date=November 17, 2006}}</ref> Some of the character's medical cases were inspired by real-life patients of Steve Giannotta, Chair of Neurological Surgery at the [[University of Southern California]] [[Keck School of Medicine of USC|Keck School of Medicine]], whom Rhimes had consulted in writing for Shepherd's storylines and patients.<ref>{{citenews|title=Meet the Real-Life McDreamy: The Doctor Behind 'Grey's Anatomy'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/meet-real-life-mcdreamy-doctor-731487|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2014, Dempsey signed a two-year contract to remain on ''Grey's Anatomy'' (then in its tenth season) that would ensure his presence for potential 11th and 12th seasons.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Lesley|title='Grey's Anatomy's' Patrick Dempsey, Ellen Pompeo Ink New Two-Year Deals|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/greys-anatomys-patrick-dempsey-ellen-673644|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=April 25, 2014|date=January 23, 2014}}</ref> However, in April 2015, Dempsey's character was killed off<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wagmeister|first1=Elizabeth|title=\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy': Patrick Dempsey Officially Leaving After 11 Seasons|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/patrick-dempsey-leaving-greys-anatomy-derek-dies-1201478891/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=April 25, 2015|date=April 23, 2015}}</ref> while his contract was not over yet.

Meredith and Derek's love had to remain Meredith and Derek's love. As painful as it was for me as a storyteller, because I had never really thought that was going to happen, it preserved what felt true to me, was that Derek was going to have to die in order for that love to remain honest. Because I really couldn't have the idea that he just turned out to be a bad guy who walked out on his wife and kids be a true story.

He was planned to be a doctor who doesn't really care about anything, who lives in his \"own\" universe and has a big [[sex appeal]]. A man who is charming, devilishly handsome and the type of guy every girl dreams of, and a man that often makes the wrong decisions, and is often known as a jerk or the ultimate heartbreaker.

Unlike the A140E counterpart which is electronically controlled, the A140L uses a plastic governor gear to select which gear to go into. Over time and wear, this plastic gear's teeth shred and eventually cease to be able to control gears. This results in a transmission that can only shift to first and reverse, but not to any further forward gears. Replacement of this governor gear is relatively inexpensive compared to a replacement transmission as it can be serviced without taking the transmission out of the car.\n\n==A2xx==\nFF Transaxle\n\n===A240L===\n4 Speed Automatic Transaxle\n\nApplications (calendar years):\n* 1985\u20131992 Corolla (4 spd.)

Unlike the A140E counterpart which is electronically controlled, the A140L uses a plastic governor gear to select which gear to go into. Over time and wear, this plastic gear's teeth shred and eventually cease to be able to control gears. This results in a transmission that can only shift to first and reverse, but not to any further forward gears. Replacement of this governor gear is relatively inexpensive compared to a replacement transmission as it can be serviced without taking the transmission out of the car.\n\n==A2xx==\nFF Transaxle\n\n===A240L===\n4 Speed Automatic Transaxle\n\nApplications (calendar years):\n* 1985\u20131992 Corolla (4 spd.)
