The first generation A4 succeeded the [[Audi 80]]. The automaker's internal numbering treats the A4 as a continuation of the Audi 80 lineage, with the initial A4 designated as the B5-series, followed by the B6, B7, B8 and the B9. The B8 and B9 versions of the A4 are built on the [[Volkswagen Group MLB platform]] shared with many other Audi models and potentially one Porsche model within Volkswagen Group.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2009/11/vw-60-models-one-platform/|first=Edward |last=Niedermeyer |title=VW: 60 Models, One Platform |date=16 November 2009 |publisher=The Truth About Cars |access-date=7 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Audi A4 [[automobile layout]] consists of a [[front-engine design]], with [[transaxle]]-type [[transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]] mounted at the rear of the engine. The cars are [[front-wheel drive]], or on some models, \"[[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]]\" [[all-wheel drive]].\n\nThe A4 is available as a [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and [[station wagon]]. The second (B6) and third generations (B7) of the A4 also had a [[convertible]] version, but the B8 version of the convertible became a variant of the [[Audi A5]] instead as Audi got back into the compact executive coup\u00e9 segment.\n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|B5}}B5 (''Typ'' 8D; 1994\u20132001)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation (B5/8D)\n| image = 1996 Audi A4 SE 1.8 Front (1).jpg\n| aka =\n| production = November 1994-2001 <br /> 1,674,943 built<ref name=\"AudiHistory_90s\">{{cite web |title=A history of Audi \u2013 The 1990s |publisher=Audi UK |url=https://www.audi.co.uk/content/dam/audi/production/RestOfSite/FleetSales/03_2010/PDF/History/AudiHistory_90s_161009.pdf |accessdate=2017-03-05}}</ref>\n| model_years =1995\u20132001\n| designer = Imre Hasani\u0107 (1991)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5453/8956302074_d77142cf68_o.jpg |title=Design skecht front quarter view |format=JPG |access-date=4 June 2018}}</ref><br>J\u00fcrgen Albamonte (1992)\n| body_style = 4 door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]],<br/>5-door Avant ([[station wagon|estate/wagon]])\n| platform = [[Volkswagen Group B platform#B5|Volkswagen Group B5 (PL45) platform]]<!--| production = November 1994 \u2013 2001 (Germany)<br/>1998\u20132003 (China; [[FAW-Volkswagen|FAW-VW]])<br/>1997\u20132000 (Indonesia)-->\n| related = [[Audi S4#B5|Audi S4 (B5)]],<br/>[[Audi RS4#B5|Audi RS4 (B5)]],<br/>[[\u0160koda Superb]],<br/>[[Volkswagen Passat (B5)]]\n| engine = {{collapsible list|framestyle=border:none; padding:0;| title = Inline-four petrol engine\n|1 = 1.6&nbsp;L [[inline-four engine|I4]]\n|2 = 1.8&nbsp;L I4 [[multi-valve|20v]]\n|3 = 1.8&nbsp;L I4 20v [[turbocharger|Turbo]]\n}}\n{{collapsible list|framestyle=border:none; padding:0;| title = V6 petrol engine<br/>\n|1 = 2.4&nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]] 12v\n|2 = 2.4&nbsp;L V6 30v\n|3 = 2.6&nbsp;L V6\n|4 = 2.7&nbsp;L V6 Biturbo\n|5 = 2.8&nbsp;L V6 12v\n|6 = 2.8&nbsp;L V6 30v\n}}\n{{collapsible list|framestyle=border:none; padding:0;| title = Inline-four diesel engine\n|1 = 1.9&nbsp;L I4 [[Diesel engine|DI]]\n|2 = 1.9&nbsp;L I4 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]]\n}}\n{{collapsible list|framestyle=border:none; padding:0;| title = V6 diesel engine\n|1 = 2.5&nbsp;L V6 24v TDI\n}}\n| transmission = {{collapsible list|framestyle=border:none; padding:0;| title = Manual transmission\n|1 = 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|2 = 6-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n}}\n{{collapsible list|framestyle=border:none; padding:0;| title = Automatic transmission\n|1 = 4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|2 = 5-speed [[ZF 5HP19 transmission|ZF 5HP19]] automatic\n}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2615|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4520|mm|1|abbr=on}};<br/>Avant: {{convert|4488|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1733|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1415|mm|1|abbr=on}};<br/>Avant: {{convert|1440|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight =\n| sp = uk\n| predecessor =\n| successor =\n}}\n\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1 = 1996 Audi A4 SE 1.8 Rear (1).jpg | caption1 = Sedan (pre-facelift)\n| image2 = Audi A4 B5 Avant 20090815 rear.JPG | caption2 = Avant (pre-facelift)\n}}\n\nThe first generation Audi A4 (known internally as the '''''Typ'' 8D''') debuted in October 1994,<ref>{{cite book| last=Buckley| first= Martin| title=BMW Cars| year=2002| publisher=Motorbooks| isbn= 978-0-7603-0921-6| page=158| chapter=The 1990s: New Models, New Markets, New Directions}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autogush.com/6671-audi-a4.html#.Ucx_o_nVCK9 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-27 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601162129/http://www.autogush.com/6671-audi-a4.html |archivedate=1 June 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> with production starting November 1994 and European sales commencing in January 1995 for the 1995 model year.

Many variations of the A4 were also available with Audi's [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] [[four-wheel drive]] system. The A4 was initially introduced as a four-door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]]; the Avant ([[station wagon|estate/wagon]]) was introduced in November 1995 and went on sale in February 1996.\n\nDevelopment began in 1988, with the first design sketches being created later that year. By 1991, an exterior design by Imre Hasanic was chosen and frozen for November 1994 production by 1992. The interior design was later finalized in 1992, with pilot production commencing in the first half of 1994.

The 2.6 and 2.8-litre [[V6 engine]]s which had been carried over from the old [[Audi 80|80/90]] proved popular, although in North America, the 2.8-litre engine was the only V6 that was available there until 1997. A 2.4-liter version was developed especially for the Thai market, where import duty jumped from 60 to 100 percent on cars of over 2,400&nbsp;cc displacement.<ref name=Fujita>{{cite book|last1=Fujita|first1=Mai|editor1-last=Omura|editor1-first=Keiji|title=The Deepening Economic Interdependence in the APEC Region|date=1998|publisher=APEC Study Center, Institute of Developing Economies|location=Singapore|url=http://202.244.105.129/English/Publish/Download/Apec/pdf/1997_06.pdf|chapter=Industrial Policies and Trade Liberalization: The Automotive Industry in Thailand and Malaysia | page = 152 }}</ref>\n\nThe Audi A4 was the first model in the Volkswagen Group to feature the new 1.8-litre 20v engine with [[multi-valve|five valves per cylinder]], based on the unit [[Audi Sport]] had developed for their [[Supertouring]] race car. A [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] 1.8T version produced {{convert|150|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|210|Nm|lbft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} torque. Moreover, a [[quattro GmbH]] special edition of the B5 1.8T was later available in Germany and Europe, for which the engine's power output was raised to {{convert|178|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|235|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}. Five-valve technology was also added to a reengineered V6 family of engines in 1997, starting with the 2.8-litre V6 30v, which now produced {{convert|193|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, followed by a 2.4-litre V6 which was a downsize from the previous 2.6 litre, 150&nbsp;hp engine, but with a power increase to {{convert|165|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAudi also debuted their new [[tiptronic]] automatic transmission on the B5 platform, based on the unit [[Porsche]] developed for their [[Porsche 964|964]]-generation [[Porsche 911|911]]. The transmission is a conventional [[automatic transmission|automatic]] gearbox with a torque converter offering the driver fully automatic operation or manual selection of the gear ratios.\n\nThe B5 marked Audi's continued move into the midsize luxury car segment, having started this trajectory notably with later model years of the preceding [[Audi 80#B4 .281991.E2.80.931996.29|Audi 80/90 B4]]. Despite initial mechanical problems, overall build and assembly quality were lauded both by the automotive press and within Audi and Volkswagen, and at the time, parent company Volkswagen declared the B5 the company-wide build quality benchmark for all its other models.\n\n===Facelift (1999.5\u20132001.5)===\n\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image3 = Audi A4 B5 Facelift front 20090923.jpg\n| image4 = 1999-2001 Audi A4 (8D) 1.8 T quattro sedan (2011-08-17) 02.jpg\n| caption4 = Sedan (facelift)\n| image5 = Audi A4 B5 Avant 1.9 TDI Facelift Heck.jpg\n| caption5 = Avant (facelift)\n}}\n\nThe Audi A4 B5 saw nearly constant minor changes and alterations throughout its seven-year run. Moreover, a significant [[facelift (automobile)|facelift]] was introduced for the 1998 B5 model year at the 1997 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], with sales beginning in Europe in early 1998. The 2.8-litre 30-valve [[V6 engine]] replaced the 2.8-litre 12-valve. A 2.5-litre V6 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[diesel engine]] with {{convert|150|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} was standard on the quattro. A six-speed manual gearbox was available, as well as the new high-performance [[Audi S4]], now part of the A4 lineup (the previous S4 had been an [[Audi 100]]). Cosmetic updates included new rear lights, headlights, door handles, and other minor exterior/interior changes.\n\nIn mid-1998, the 1.8 20vT engine available outside Europe had its power output raised to {{convert|170|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}. The previous [[K\u00fchnle, Kopp & Kausch|KKK]] K03 [[turbocharger]], although fundamentally unchanged, received revisions on the turbine side to prevent cracking due to heat.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The 12-valve V6 was replaced by the 30-valve unit which had been available in Europe for two years.\n\nA further facelift took place across the A4 and S4 platform in February 1999 as a 1999.5 model; changes were largely cosmetic, but affected many components, such as both front and rear bumpers, the front and rear lights, the center console, and door handles.<ref>[http://www.audi-sport.net/vb/a4-s4-forum-b5-chassis/21095-a4-s4-faq-look-here-first-before-posting-questions.html?s=effa15359f9df4e926e0cde2e5cab52d#post548541 audi sport FAQ], retrieved

\"8D'''2'''\".\n\nIn 1999 Audi also debuted an even higher performance '''''R'''enn'''S'''port'' model (rennsport literally translates as ''racing sport''), the [[Audi RS4|RS4 Avant]], like its

internally designated '''''Typ'' 8E''', debuted on 10 October 2000, now riding on the [[Volkswagen Group B platform#B6|Volkswagen Group B6 (PL46) platform]]. The car's new styling was developed under Peter Schreyer between 1996\u20131998, inspired by the Bauhaus design language of the C5 (second-generation) [[Audi A6]] introduced in 1997. The 1.6-litre base model powerplant remained unchanged, but most other [[petrol engine|petrol/gasoline engines]] received either displacement increases, or power upgrades. The 1.8-litre 20-valve [[turbocharger|Turbo]] was now available in two additional versions, with {{convert|150|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|180|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, this one with a standard six-speed [[manual gearbox]], while the naturally aspirated 1.6-litre [[inline-four engine]] and 2.8-litre [[V6 engine|V6]] were replaced by 2.0-litre, and all-[[aluminium alloy]] 3.0-litre units, still with five valves per cylinder, the most powerful of which was capable of {{convert|220|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The 1.9 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) engine was upgraded to {{convert|130|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, with [[Unit Injector|Pumpe D\u00fcse (Unit Injector)]] (PD) technology, and was now available with [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]], while the 2.5 [[V6 engine|V6]] TDI high-end model was introduced with {{convert|180|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and standard quattro. This generation of quattro consisted of default of 50:50 front to rear dynamic torque distribution. A [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;5.7 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP) system, with [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), [[brake assist]], and [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] (EBD) were standard across the range.\n\nThe Avant was introduced in June 2001 and arrived in European showrooms in September 2001.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nFor 2002, Audi increased power in the 1.8 Turbo engines to {{convert|183|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|190|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} \u2013 the 190&nbsp;PS variant designated by a red 'T' on the boot lid. Available with four wheel drive and in the 2.5 TDI intermediate version to {{convert|163|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}. A 2.0 engine with [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) was also available. A year later, Audi reintroduced the S4, now powered by a {{convert|344|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} 4.2&nbsp;L [[V8 engine]], as well as an A4 Cabriolet [[convertible (car)|convertible]] variant ('''''Typ'' 8H'''), finally replacing the [[Audi 80|80]]-based Audi Cabriolet which had been discontinued in 2000. It included an electro-hydraulic operated roof, which lowered in under 30 seconds and incorporated some styling changes, such as body-coloured lower bumper and sill panels, which later found their way to the saloon version.\n\nAudi introduced a [[continuously variable transmission]] developed by [[LuK]], named [[multitronic]], which replaced the dated conventional automatic transmission on [[front-wheel drive]] models. The transmission won considerable praise from the automotive press, and is generally regarded{{by whom|date=February 2014}} as being the best of its type in the world, due to its light weight and promptness in response.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} This high strength chain driven CVT was made from highly durable metals and used a very high grade, purpose-designed fully synthetic lubricant. However, there have been widespread complaints from consumers around the world that the transmission box is prone to electronic glitches as well as mechanical problems.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.audi-gearbox-problems.co.uk |title= Audi Gearbox Problems |accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audi-forums.com/b6-forum/47603-cvt-reality-check.html|title=CVT reality check|accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref>\n\nBorrowing from the [[Audi A6]], the boot was redesigned to remove the extension of the top edge with a smoother fold line. The rear light assemblies now formed part of the top line, these styling cues were eventually borrowed by other European as well as Asian manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boldride.com/ride/2000/audi-a4#gallery/4 |title=Audi A4 specification |date=2011 |access-date=29 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409145742/http://www.boldride.com/ride/2000/audi-a4#gallery/4 |archive-date=9 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA sport package named 'Ultra Sport' was introduced in the North American market shortly before the B6 was replaced by the B7.

Although given a new platform designation, the B7 was essentially a heavily facelifted and revised version of the B6, with revised steering settings, suspension geometry,{{specify|date=February 2014}} new [[internal combustion engine]] ranges, navigation systems and chassis electronics (including a new advanced [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;8.0 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP) system). The front grille assembly changed to a tall trapezoidal shape in the same manner as the C6 (third-generation) [[Audi A6]]; however, the dashboard and interior were virtually unchanged from the B6 aside from minor detailing.\n\nAudi's internal platform nomenclature uses PL46 ('''p'''assenger car '''l'''ongitudinal platform, size '''4''', generation '''6''') for both B6 and B7 chassis. The '''''Typ'' 8E''' and '''''Typ'' 8H''' internal designations are also carried over from the B6 A4 range, but now have an additional identifying suffix \u2013 8EC for the saloon, 8ED for the Avant, and 8HE for the Cabriolet.\n\nThe engine lineup received many additions. The 2005 introduction of [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) on the 2.0 TFSI and 3.2 [[V6 engine|V6]] FSI [[petrol engine|petrol/gasoline engines]], as well as other refinements, increased power output to {{convert|200|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|255|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. These engines both use a four-valve per cylinder configuration. The prior 5-valve design was incompatible with the FSI direct injection system (due to the siting of the fuel injector, now discharging directly into the combustion chamber). The 2.0 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[diesel engine]] now combined [[Unit Injector|Pumpe D\u00fcse (Unit Injector)]] (PD) technology with 16 valves, while the larger 2.5 TDI V6 diesel was superseded by a 3.0 V6 TDI, offering a {{convert|204|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} model during the year 2005 which was upgraded to a {{convert|233|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} model in 2006. A 2.7 V6 TDI was added later.\n\n[[Torsen]] T-2 based [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] remained as an option on most A4 models. Audi retired its 5-speed [[manual transmission]]s in favour of a new [[Getrag]] 6-speed. As before, [[multitronic]] [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT), now with selectable 'seven-speeds', was an option on front-wheel drive models, whilst a conventional [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[list of ZF transmissions#6-speed auto|6HP 6-speed]] [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] was an option on the quattro [[four-wheel drive]] models.\n\nIn addition to the [[Audi S4]], which carried over the [[powertrain]] from the B6 S4 \u2013 Audi reintroduced the [[quattro GmbH]] developed [[Audi RS4]] ('''RS''' for '''''R'''enn'''S'''port'') to the lineup, for the first time on the [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] and [[Convertible (car)|Cabriolet]] body, and with a naturally aspirated, but high-revving 4.2-litre [[V8 engine|V8]] FSI engine. Another notable{{according to whom|date=February 2014}} inclusion on the RS4 is the latest generation [[Torsen]] T-3 quattro 4wd system, which uses a 'default' asymmetric 40:60 front-rear dynamic torque distribution bias. This new asymmetric centre differential was initially only available on the RS4, but was added a year later on the S4. The remainder of the B7 A4 range still used the T-2 50:50 default dynamic split centre diff.\n\n[[File:Audi A4 DTM Edition front.JPG|thumb|left|Audi A4 DTM Edition]]\n\nA variant, developed by [[quattro GmbH]], was first introduced in May 2005, named \"Audi A4 DTM [[special edition|Edition]]\". It was inspired from Audi's race cars of the 2004 [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]], and was reintroduced in 2006 as a regular option. The 2.0T FSI engine received revised software mapping to the ECU, which increased the output to {{convert|220|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. It was available with front-wheel drive, or quattro four-wheel drive.\n\nThe B7 Cabriolet model arrived later than the other two body variants, with sales beginning in February 2006. New on the Cabriolet was an entry-level 2.0 TDI version, which was not offered with the multitronic CVT gearbox.\n\nIn 2007 Audi introduced a version of the B7 named the 'Special Edition', which built on the S-Line specification and also included the black optics pack, the RS4 style 8J X 18 '7-arm double spoke' design alloy wheels, Two-tone Graphite/Black Volterra leather, 3-spoke sports leather/Alcantara multi-function steering wheel with gear knob and hand brake\nhandle in Alcantara with silver stitching, ventilated cross-drilled front disc-brakes, black tailpipes and black roof rails (Avant model only).

For North America destined models, the B8 continued in production for the 2016 model year, while Europe began deliveries on the 2016 B9 model.\n\nThe B8 A4 is built on a variant of the [[Volkswagen Group MLB platform|Audi Modular Longitudinal Platform]], a platform which is also used in the [[Audi A5]] [[coup\u00e9]]. While prior A4 chassis were limited in [[wheelbase]] due to the relationship between the engine, transmission and front axle, the MLP allows for a reduced front overhang, resulting in a greater wheelbase length without the same increase in overall length.<ref>{{Citation | last =Monticello | first =Mike | title =2009 Audi A4 3.2 Quattro | journal =[[Road & Track]] | volume =60 | issue =2 | page =104 | date =October 2008 | url = | doi = | id = }}</ref> This effectively redistributes the centre of gravity slightly rearwards, improving handling by better balancing vehicle mass between the front and rear axles. The estimated static front:rear weight ratio of the B8 A4 is approximately 55:45, depending on body style and engine. The relocation of the steering rack in front of the axle also improves handling over previous A4 platforms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Key to the implementation of MLB is the novel mounting of the [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] in front of the clutch. This is achieved by driving the flywheel/clutch remotely by means of a 'top hat' shaped drive plate, between which the differential lay shaft passes, whilst power transmission to the final drive is via an inclined transfer shaft which runs the length of the transmission unit. Whilst the platform retains Audi's \"overhung\" engine mounting position, the front axle is now 152mm further forward than the previous B6/B7 generation platform.<ref>{{cite book|title=Audi A5 \u2013 Self Study Programme|date=January 2007|publisher=Audi AG|page=30|url=http://training.avme.net/admin/Upload/SSP/4801_392%20Audi%20A5%20generell.pdf|accessdate=5 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105113255/http://training.avme.net/admin/Upload/SSP/4801_392%20Audi%20A5%20generell.pdf|archive-date=5 January 2015|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The transfer shaft, however, has the effect of creating a large \"bulge\" on one side of the transmission tunnel, which on right-hand drive versions forces the pedals to be badly offset, which has attracted criticism from the British motoring press in particular.\n\nThe B8 A4 has increased in wheelbase by {{convert|160|mm|in|1}} and in length by {{convert|117|mm|in|1}} over the prior B7, which has allowed for increased rear seating legroom. Although the overall dimensions have increased, the kerb weight has dropped some 10%. The boot (trunk) has also increased to {{convert|480|L|cuft|1}} for the saloon (sedan) version.

It features redesigned LED headlamps and tail lights, front air dam with fog lamps, and closely set twin exhausts. Interior changes include bluetooth connectivity for audio streaming (nav equipped models only) and a redesigned ignition key. Controls for air-conditioning, infotainment, and power windows gain chrome clasps. Other detail interior changes include larger steering column stalk switches first seen in the D4-series [[Audi A8]] and a simplified layout for the HVAC control panel \u2013 for example the temperature setting for the heated seats is now directly set by a single button and is no longer controlled using the MMI dial. The A4 includes radio with eight speakers as standard, while MMI navigation system with voice dialogue is optional. A new \"Drive Select System\" allows drivers to choose comfort, dynamic, individual, or efficiency modes for fuel efficiency. Power output of the 1.8 TFSI engine is 170 BHP and 320 Nm of torque \u2013 up 10 BHP and 70 Nm from the previous versions. Electro-mechanical power steering is standard.\n\nIn Europe, the wide range of Audi A4 saloon and Avant estate are available with the 1.8 TFSI, 2.0 TFSI gasoline engine, as well as 2.0 TDI, 2.0 TDIe, and 3.0 TDI diesel motor. Trim levels are Attraction, Ambition, and Ambiente. In the UK, the A4 range is offered in SE, SE Technik, Technik, S line, and Black Edition model grades. All wheel drive quattro are offered in most engine and grade combinations.\n\nFor North America, the facelift model Audi A4 sedan is only offered with 2.0 TFSI gasoline engine. Model grades are Premium, Premium Plus, and Prestige. The Avant was discontinued, leaving the Allroad quattro as the only station wagon body style. For the 2016 model year, the A4 and S4 continued in B8 production. The B9 A4 would not reach the North American market until the 2017 model year, while the S4 variant would not be available until the 2018 model year.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|B9}}B9 (''Typ'' 8W; 2016\u2013present)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Fifth generation (B9/8W)\n|image = 2017 Audi A4 (8W) sport quattro sedan (2018-10-19) 01.jpg\n|production = 2015\u2013present<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/4328 |title=High tech all the way \u2013 the new Audi A4 and A4 Avant |publisher=Audi AG |website=www.audi-mediacenter.com |date=4 September 2015 }}</ref>\n|model_years = 2016\u2013present\n|assembly = \n|designer = Frank Rimili<br/>R\u00fcdiger M\u00fcller (interior)\n|body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]],<br/>5-door Avant ([[station wagon|estate/wagon]])\n|platform = [[Volkswagen Group MLB platform#MLBevo|Volkswagen Group MLBevo platform]]\n|engine = {{collapsible list|framestyle=border:none; padding:0;| title = Inline-four petrol engine\n|1 = 1.4L [[Turbocharger|T]][[gasoline direct injection|FSI]] [[inline-four engine|I4]]\n|2 = 2.0L T[[gasoline direct injection|FSI]] I4\n}}\n{{collapsible list|framestyle=border:none; padding:0;| title = V6 petrol engine\n|1 = 3.0L V6 [[Turbocharger|T]][[gasoline direct injection|FSI]]\n}}\n{{collapsible list|framestyle=border:none; padding:0;| title = Inline-four diesel engine\n|1 = 2.0L [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] I4\n}}\n{{collapsible list|framestyle=border:none; padding:0;| title = V6 diesel engine\n|1 = 3.0L V6 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]]\n}}\n|transmission = 6-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br> 7-speed [[Direct-Shift Gearbox|S-tronic]]<br/> 8-speed Tiptronic\n|wheelbase = {{convert|2820|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n|length = {{convert|4726|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{convert|1842|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|1427|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n|weight =\n|related=[[Audi A5#Second generation (2016\u2013present)|Audi A5]]<br>[[Audi Q7#4M|Audi Q7]]\n|predecessor =\n|successor =\n}}\n\nThe next-generation B9 version of the A4 was revealed in June 2015 \u2013 the fifth model to carry the A4 badge, and the ninth generation of the Audi 80/A4 series overall.

A 2.4-liter version was developed especially for the Thai market, where import duty jumped from 60 to 100 percent on cars of over 2,400&nbsp;cc displacement.<ref name=Fujita>{{cite book|last1=Fujita|first1=Mai|editor1-last=Omura|editor1-first=Keiji|title=The Deepening Economic Interdependence in the APEC Region|date=1998|publisher=APEC Study Center, Institute of Developing Economies|location=Singapore|url=http://202.244.105.129/English/Publish/Download/Apec/pdf/1997_06.pdf|chapter=Industrial Policies and Trade Liberalization: The Automotive Industry in Thailand and Malaysia | page = 152 }}</ref>\n\nThe Audi A4 was the first model in the Volkswagen Group to feature the new 1.8-litre 20v engine with [[multi-valve|five valves per cylinder]], based on the unit [[Audi Sport]] had developed for their [[Supertouring]] race car. A [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] 1.8T version produced {{convert|150|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|210|Nm|lbft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} torque. Moreover, a [[quattro GmbH]] special edition of the B5 1.8T was later available in Germany and Europe, for which the engine's power output was raised to {{convert|178|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|235|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}. Five-valve technology was also added to a reengineered V6 family of engines in 1997, starting with the 2.8-litre V6 30v, which now produced {{convert|193|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, followed by a 2.4-litre V6 which was a downsize from the previous 2.6 litre, 150&nbsp;hp engine, but with a power increase to {{convert|165|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAudi also debuted their new [[tiptronic]] automatic transmission on the B5 platform, based on the unit [[Porsche]] developed for their [[Porsche 964|964]]-generation [[Porsche 911|911]]. The transmission is a conventional [[automatic transmission|automatic]] gearbox with a torque converter offering the driver fully automatic operation or manual selection of the gear ratios.\n\nThe B5 marked Audi's continued move into the midsize luxury car segment, having started this trajectory notably with later model years of the preceding [[Audi 80#B4 .281991.E2.80.931996.29|Audi 80/90 B4]]. Despite initial mechanical problems, overall build and assembly quality were lauded both by the automotive press and within Audi and Volkswagen, and at the time, parent company Volkswagen declared the B5 the company-wide build quality benchmark for all its other models.\n\n===Facelift (1999.5\u20132001.5)===\n\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image3 = Audi A4 B5 Facelift front 20090923.jpg\n| image4 = 1999-2001 Audi A4 (8D) 1.8 T quattro sedan (2011-08-17) 02.jpg\n| caption4 = Sedan (facelift)\n| image5 = Audi A4 B5 Avant 1.9 TDI Facelift Heck.jpg\n| caption5 = Avant (facelift)\n}}\n\nThe Audi A4 B5 saw nearly constant minor changes and alterations throughout its seven-year run. Moreover, a significant [[facelift (automobile)|facelift]] was introduced for the 1998 B5 model year at the 1997 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], with sales beginning in Europe in early 1998. The 2.8-litre 30-valve [[V6 engine]] replaced the 2.8-litre 12-valve. A 2.5-litre V6 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[diesel engine]] with {{convert|150|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} was standard on the quattro. A six-speed manual gearbox was available, as well as the new high-performance [[Audi S4]], now part of the A4 lineup (the previous S4 had been an [[Audi 100]]). Cosmetic updates included new rear lights, headlights, door handles, and other minor exterior/interior changes.\n\nIn mid-1998, the 1.8 20vT engine available outside Europe had its power output raised to {{convert|170|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}. The previous [[K\u00fchnle, Kopp & Kausch|KKK]] K03 [[turbocharger]], although fundamentally unchanged, received revisions on the turbine side to prevent cracking due to heat.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The 12-valve V6 was replaced by the 30-valve unit which had been available in Europe for two years.\n\nA further facelift took place across the A4 and S4 platform in February 1999 as a 1999.5 model; changes were largely cosmetic, but affected many components, such as both front and rear bumpers, the front and rear lights, the center console, and door handles.<ref>[http://www.audi-sport.net/vb/a4-s4-forum-b5-chassis/21095-a4-s4-faq-look-here-first-before-posting-questions.html?s=effa15359f9df4e926e0cde2e5cab52d#post548541 audi sport FAQ], retrieved 2012-04-01</ref> This facelift was known at Audi as a ''Grosse Produktaufwertung'' (''Major Product Upgrade''), as was also signified by facelift cars now carrying the denomination \"8D'''2'''\".\n\nIn 1999 Audi also debuted an even higher performance '''''R'''enn'''S'''port'' model (rennsport literally translates as ''racing sport''), the [[Audi RS4|RS4 Avant]], like its predecessor [[Audi RS2 Avant|RS2]], available only in the Avant bodystyle.\n\n===Engines===\nThe following [[internal combustion engine|engines]] were available:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"

internally designated '''''Typ'' 8E''', debuted on 10 October 2000, now riding on the [[Volkswagen Group B platform#B6|Volkswagen Group B6 (PL46) platform]]. The car's new styling was developed under Peter Schreyer between 1996\u20131998, inspired by the Bauhaus design language of the C5 (second-generation) [[Audi A6]] introduced in 1997. The 1.6-litre base model powerplant remained unchanged, but most other [[petrol engine|petrol/gasoline engines]] received either displacement increases, or power upgrades. The 1.8-litre 20-valve [[turbocharger|Turbo]] was now available in two additional versions, with {{convert|150|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|180|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, this one with a standard six-speed [[manual gearbox]], while the naturally aspirated 1.6-litre [[inline-four engine]] and 2.8-litre [[V6 engine|V6]] were replaced by 2.0-litre, and all-[[aluminium alloy]] 3.0-litre units, still with five valves per cylinder, the most powerful of which was capable of {{convert|220|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The 1.9 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) engine was upgraded to {{convert|130|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, with [[Unit Injector|Pumpe D\u00fcse (Unit Injector)]] (PD) technology, and was now available with [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]], while the 2.5 [[V6 engine|V6]] TDI high-end model was introduced with {{convert|180|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and standard quattro. This generation of quattro consisted of default of 50:50 front to rear dynamic torque distribution. A [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;5.7 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP) system, with [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), [[brake assist]], and [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] (EBD) were standard across the range.\n\nThe Avant was introduced in June 2001 and arrived in European showrooms in September 2001.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nFor 2002, Audi increased power in the 1.8 Turbo engines to {{convert|183|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|190|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} \u2013 the 190&nbsp;PS variant designated by a red 'T' on the boot lid. Available with four wheel drive and in the 2.5 TDI intermediate version to {{convert|163|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}. A 2.0 engine with [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) was also available. A year later, Audi reintroduced the S4, now powered by a {{convert|344|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} 4.2&nbsp;L [[V8 engine]], as well as an A4 Cabriolet [[convertible (car)|convertible]] variant ('''''Typ'' 8H'''), finally replacing the [[Audi 80|80]]-based Audi Cabriolet which had been discontinued in 2000. It included an electro-hydraulic operated roof, which lowered in under 30 seconds and incorporated some styling changes, such as body-coloured lower bumper and sill panels, which later found their way to the saloon version.\n\nAudi introduced a [[continuously variable transmission]] developed by [[LuK]], named [[multitronic]], which replaced the dated conventional automatic transmission on [[front-wheel drive]] models. The transmission won considerable praise from the automotive press, and is generally regarded{{by whom|date=February 2014}} as being the best of its type in the world, due to its light weight and promptness in response.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} This high strength chain driven CVT was made from highly durable metals and used a very high grade, purpose-designed fully synthetic lubricant. However, there have been widespread complaints from consumers around the world that the transmission box is prone to electronic glitches as well as mechanical problems.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.audi-gearbox-problems.co.uk |title= Audi Gearbox Problems |accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audi-forums.com/b6-forum/47603-cvt-reality-check.html|title=CVT reality check|accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref>\n\nBorrowing from the [[Audi A6]], the boot was redesigned to remove the extension of the top edge with a smoother fold line. The rear light assemblies now formed part of the top line, these styling cues were eventually borrowed by other European as well as Asian manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boldride.com/ride/2000/audi-a4#gallery/4 |title=Audi A4 specification |date=2011 |access-date=29 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409145742/http://www.boldride.com/ride/2000/audi-a4#gallery/4 |archive-date=9 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA sport package named 'Ultra Sport' was introduced in the North American market shortly before the B6 was replaced by the B7.

Although given a new platform designation, the B7 was essentially a heavily facelifted and revised version of the B6, with revised steering settings, suspension geometry,{{specify|date=February 2014}} new [[internal combustion engine]] ranges, navigation systems and chassis electronics (including a new advanced [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ESP&nbsp;8.0 [[electronic stability control|Electronic Stability Programme]] (ESP) system). The front grille assembly changed to a tall trapezoidal shape in the same manner as the C6 (third-generation) [[Audi A6]]; however, the dashboard and interior were virtually unchanged from the B6 aside from minor detailing.\n\nAudi's internal platform nomenclature uses PL46 ('''p'''assenger car '''l'''ongitudinal platform, size '''4''', generation '''6''') for both B6 and B7 chassis. The '''''Typ'' 8E''' and '''''Typ'' 8H''' internal designations are also carried over from the B6 A4 range, but now have an additional identifying suffix \u2013 8EC for the saloon, 8ED for the Avant, and 8HE for the Cabriolet.\n\nThe engine lineup received many additions. The 2005 introduction of [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) on the 2.0 TFSI and 3.2 [[V6 engine|V6]] FSI [[petrol engine|petrol/gasoline engines]], as well as other refinements, increased power output to {{convert|200|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|255|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. These engines both use a four-valve per cylinder configuration. The prior 5-valve design was incompatible with the FSI direct injection system (due to the siting of the fuel injector, now discharging directly into the combustion chamber). The 2.0 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[diesel engine]] now combined [[Unit Injector|Pumpe D\u00fcse (Unit Injector)]] (PD) technology with 16 valves, while the larger 2.5 TDI V6 diesel was superseded by a 3.0 V6 TDI, offering a {{convert|204|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} model during the year 2005 which was upgraded to a {{convert|233|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} model in 2006. A 2.7 V6 TDI was added later.\n\n[[Torsen]] T-2 based [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] permanent [[four-wheel drive]] remained as an option on most A4 models. Audi retired its 5-speed [[manual transmission]]s in favour of a new [[Getrag]] 6-speed. As before, [[multitronic]] [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT), now with selectable 'seven-speeds', was an option on front-wheel drive models, whilst a conventional [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[list of ZF transmissions#6-speed auto|6HP 6-speed]] [[tiptronic]] [[automatic transmission]] was an option on the quattro [[four-wheel drive]] models.\n\nIn addition to the [[Audi S4]], which carried over the [[powertrain]] from the B6 S4 \u2013 Audi reintroduced the [[quattro GmbH]] developed [[Audi RS4]] ('''RS''' for '''''R'''enn'''S'''port'') to the lineup, for the first time on the [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]] and [[Convertible (car)|Cabriolet]] body, and with a naturally aspirated, but high-revving 4.2-litre [[V8 engine|V8]] FSI engine. Another notable{{according to whom|date=February 2014}} inclusion on the RS4 is the latest generation [[Torsen]] T-3 quattro 4wd system, which uses a 'default' asymmetric 40:60 front-rear dynamic torque distribution bias. This new asymmetric centre differential was initially only available on the RS4, but was added a year later on the S4. The remainder of the B7 A4 range still used the T-2 50:50 default dynamic split centre diff.\n\n[[File:Audi A4 DTM Edition front.JPG|thumb|left|Audi A4 DTM Edition]]\n\nA variant, developed by [[quattro GmbH]], was first introduced in May 2005, named \"Audi A4 DTM [[special edition|Edition]]\". It was inspired from Audi's race cars of the 2004 [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]], and was reintroduced in 2006 as a regular option. The 2.0T FSI engine received revised software mapping to the ECU, which increased the output to {{convert|220|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. It was available with front-wheel drive, or quattro four-wheel drive.\n\nThe B7 Cabriolet model arrived later than the other two body variants, with sales beginning in February 2006. New on the Cabriolet was an entry-level 2.0 TDI version, which was not offered with the multitronic CVT gearbox.\n\nIn 2007 Audi introduced a version of the B7 named the 'Special Edition', which built on the S-Line specification and also included the black optics pack, the RS4 style 8J X 18 '7-arm double spoke' design alloy wheels, Two-tone Graphite/Black Volterra leather, 3-spoke sports leather/Alcantara multi-function steering wheel with gear knob and hand brake\nhandle in Alcantara with silver stitching, ventilated cross-drilled front disc-brakes, black tailpipes and black roof rails (Avant model only). It also had a power increase of 20 PS, giving an output of 220 PS on the 2.0T model.\n\nAccording to 2007 Swedish vehicle inspection data, the Audi A4 Avant with [[diesel engine]] is the most reliable vehicle available on the market, with vehicle inspection rejection rate of 0.0% in three-year-old category.<ref>[http://www.tuulilasi.fi/valokeila/?subarea=uutiset&article=149985&page=2 Car unserviceabilities frequency sequence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218221850/http://www.tuulilasi.fi/valokeila/?subarea=uutiset&article=149985&page=2 |date=18 December 2008 }}{{Failed verification|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===SEAT Exeo===\n{{Main|SEAT Exeo}}\n\nWhen the successor B8 A4 range was introduced, the B7 series A4 was restyled and [[rebadged]] as the [[SEAT Exeo]] in 2008 with changes to the front and rear plus interior trim from the A4 Cabriolet.

[[sedan (automobile)|Saloon/sedan]] and Avant ([[station wagon|estate/wagon]]) models are offered. The Avant was unveiled to the public at the March 2008 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. For North America destined models, the B8 continued in production for the 2016 model year, while Europe began deliveries on the 2016 B9 model.\n\nThe B8 A4 is built on a variant of the [[Volkswagen Group MLB platform|Audi Modular Longitudinal Platform]], a platform which is also used in the [[Audi A5]] [[coup\u00e9]]. While prior A4 chassis were limited in [[wheelbase]] due to the relationship between the engine, transmission and front axle, the MLP allows for a reduced front overhang, resulting in a greater wheelbase length without the same increase in overall length.<ref>{{Citation | last =Monticello | first =Mike | title =2009 Audi A4 3.2 Quattro | journal =[[Road & Track]] | volume =60 | issue =2 | page =104 | date =October 2008 | url = | doi = | id = }}</ref> This effectively redistributes the centre of gravity slightly rearwards, improving handling by better balancing vehicle mass between the front and rear axles. The estimated static front:rear weight ratio of the B8 A4 is approximately 55:45, depending on body style and engine. The relocation of the steering rack in front of the axle also improves handling over previous A4 platforms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Key to the implementation of MLB is the novel mounting of the [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] in front of the clutch. This is achieved by driving the flywheel/clutch remotely by means of a 'top hat' shaped drive plate, between which the differential lay shaft passes, whilst power transmission to the final drive is via an inclined transfer shaft which runs the length of the transmission unit. Whilst the platform retains Audi's \"overhung\" engine mounting position, the front axle is now 152mm further forward than the previous B6/B7 generation platform.<ref>{{cite book|title=Audi A5 \u2013 Self Study Programme|date=January 2007|publisher=Audi AG|page=30|url=http://training.avme.net/admin/Upload/SSP/4801_392%20Audi%20A5%20generell.pdf|accessdate=5 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105113255/http://training.avme.net/admin/Upload/SSP/4801_392%20Audi%20A5%20generell.pdf|archive-date=5 January 2015|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The transfer shaft, however, has the effect of creating a large \"bulge\" on one side of the transmission tunnel, which on right-hand drive versions forces the pedals to be badly offset, which has attracted criticism from the British motoring press in particular.\n\nThe B8 A4 has increased in wheelbase by {{convert|160|mm|in|1}} and in length by {{convert|117|mm|in|1}} over the prior B7, which has allowed for increased rear seating legroom. Although the overall dimensions have increased, the kerb weight has dropped some 10%. The boot (trunk) has also increased to {{convert|480|L|cuft|1}} for the saloon (sedan) version.

It features redesigned LED headlamps and tail lights, front air dam with fog lamps, and closely set twin exhausts. Interior changes include bluetooth connectivity for audio streaming (nav equipped models only) and a redesigned ignition key. Controls for air-conditioning, infotainment, and power windows gain chrome clasps. Other detail interior changes include larger steering column stalk switches first seen in the D4-series [[Audi A8]] and a simplified layout for the HVAC control panel \u2013 for example the temperature setting for the heated seats is now directly set by a single button and is no longer controlled using the MMI dial. The A4 includes radio with eight speakers as standard, while MMI navigation system with voice dialogue is optional. A new \"Drive Select System\" allows drivers to choose comfort, dynamic, individual, or efficiency modes for fuel efficiency. Power output of the 1.8 TFSI engine is 170 BHP and 320 Nm of torque \u2013 up 10 BHP and 70 Nm from the previous versions. Electro-mechanical power steering is standard.\n\nIn Europe, the wide range of Audi A4 saloon and Avant estate are available with the 1.8 TFSI, 2.0 TFSI gasoline engine, as well as 2.0 TDI, 2.0 TDIe, and 3.0 TDI diesel motor. Trim levels are Attraction, Ambition, and Ambiente. In the UK, the A4 range is offered in SE, SE Technik, Technik, S line, and Black Edition model grades. All wheel drive quattro are offered in most engine and grade combinations.\n\nFor North America, the facelift model Audi A4 sedan is only offered with 2.0 TFSI gasoline engine. Model grades are Premium, Premium Plus, and Prestige. The Avant was discontinued, leaving the Allroad quattro as the only station wagon body style. For the 2016 model year, the A4 and S4 continued in B8 production.

Upon the creation of the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (DPRK, informally \"North Korea\") and the [[Republic of Korea]] (ROK, informally \"South Korea\") in 1948, it became a ''[[de facto]]'' international border and one of the most tense fronts in the [[Cold War]].\n\nBoth the North and the South remained dependent on their sponsor states from 1948 to the outbreak of the [[Korean War]]. That conflict, which claimed over three million lives and divided the Korean Peninsula along ideological lines, commenced on 25 June 1950, with a full-front DPRK invasion across the 38th parallel, and ended in 1953 after international intervention pushed the [[Front (military)|front]] of the war back to near the 38th parallel.\n\nIn the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] of 27 July 1953, the DMZ was created as each side agreed to move their troops back {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=in}} from the front line, creating a buffer zone {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. The [[Military Demarcation Line]] (MDL) goes through the center of the DMZ and indicates where the front was when the agreement was signed.\n\nOwing to this theoretical [[stalemate]], and genuine hostility between the North and the South, large numbers of troops are stationed along both sides of the line, each side guarding against potential aggression from the other side, even {{Age|1953|July|27}} years after its establishment. The armistice agreement explains exactly how many military personnel and what kind of weapons are allowed in the DMZ. Soldiers from both sides may patrol inside the DMZ, but they may not cross the MDL. However, heavily armed ROK soldiers patrol under the aegis of [[military police]], and have memorized each line of the armistice.<ref name=\"On Patrol in the DMZ\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/21/north-korea-south-korea-dmz-landmines |title=On patrol in the DMZ: North Korean landmines, biting winds and tin cans: As tensions on the peninsula escalate, a former South Korean guard describes life at one of the world's most fortified borders.

The JSA is the location where all [[Inter-Korean summits|negotiations]] since 1953 have been held, including statements of Korean solidarity, which have generally amounted to little except a slight decline of [[Inter-Korean conflict|tensions]]. The MDL goes through the conference rooms and down the middle of the conference tables where the North Koreans and the United Nations Command (primarily South Koreans and Americans) meet face to face.\n\nWithin the JSA are a number of buildings for joint meetings called Conference Rooms. These are used for direct talks between the Korean War participants and parties to the armistice. Facing the Conference Row buildings are the North Korean ''[[Panmungak]]'' ({{lang-en|Panmun Hall}}) and the South Korean [[Freedom House (Joint Security Area)|Freedom House]]. In 1994, North Korea enlarged Panmungak by adding a third floor. In 1998, South Korea built a new Freedom House for its [[Red Cross]] staff and to possibly host reunions of families separated by the [[Korean War]]. The new building incorporated the old Freedom House Pagoda within its design.\n\nSince 1953 there have been occasional confrontations and skirmishes within the JSA. The [[Korean axe murder incident|axe murder incident]] in August 1976 involved the attempted trimming of a tree which resulted in two deaths ([[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Arthur Bonifas and [[First Lieutenant]] Mark Barrett). Another incident occurred on 23 November 1984, when a Soviet tourist named Vasily Matuzok (sometimes spelled Matusak), who was part of an official trip to the JSA (hosted by the North), ran across the MDL shouting that he wanted to [[defection|defect]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/general-revisits-deadly-1984-thanksgiving-firefight-at-dmz-1.161443 |title=General revisits deadly 1984 Thanksgiving firefight at DMZ |work=Stars and Stripes |accessdate=13 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309182210/http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/general-revisits-deadly-1984-thanksgiving-firefight-at-dmz-1.161443 |archivedate=9 March 2016 }}</ref> North Korean troops immediately chased after him, opening fire.

The orientation of the blasting lines within each tunnel indicated they were dug by North Korea. North Korea claimed that the tunnels were for [[coal mining]]; however, no coal was found in the tunnels, which were dug through granite. Some of the tunnel walls were painted black to give the appearance of [[anthracite]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Jim|last=Sides|title=Almost Home|publisher=Xulon Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60791-740-3|page=118}}</ref>\n\nThe tunnels are believed to have been planned as a military invasion route by North Korea. They run in a north\u2013south direction and do not have branches. Following each discovery, engineering within the tunnels has become progressively more advanced. For example, the third tunnel sloped slightly upwards as it progressed southward, to prevent [[water stagnation]]. Today, visitors from the south may visit the second, third and fourth tunnels through guided tours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Demilitarized Zone |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/dmz.htm |accessdate=2007-11-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105034940/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/dmz.htm |archivedate=5 November 2007 }}</ref>\n\n====First tunnel====\nThe first of the tunnels was discovered on 20 November 1974, by a South Korean Army patrol, noticing steam rising from the ground.

Five days later, during a subsequent exploration of this tunnel, [[United States Navy|US Navy]] Commander Robert M.

The kingdom consisted of much of central Korea, including areas around the DMZ. He placed his capital in [[Cheorwon]], a mountainous region that was easily defensible (in the Korean War, this same region would earn the name \"the [[Iron Triangle (Korea)|Iron Triangle]]\").\n\nAs a former Buddhist monk, [[Gung Ye]] actively promoted the religion of [[Buddhism]] and incorporated Buddhist ceremonies into the new kingdom.

Upon the creation of the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (DPRK, informally \"North Korea\") and the [[Republic of Korea]] (ROK, informally \"South Korea\") in 1948, it became a ''[[de facto]]'' international border and one of the most tense fronts in the [[Cold War]].\n\nBoth the North and the South remained dependent on their sponsor states from 1948 to the outbreak of the [[Korean War]]. That conflict, which claimed over three million lives and divided the Korean Peninsula along ideological lines, commenced on 25 June 1950, with a full-front DPRK invasion across the 38th parallel, and ended in 1953 after international intervention pushed the [[Front (military)|front]] of the war back to near the 38th parallel.\n\nIn the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] of 27 July 1953, the DMZ was created as each side agreed to move their troops back {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=in}} from the front line, creating a buffer zone {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. The [[Military Demarcation Line]] (MDL) goes through the center of the DMZ and indicates where the front was when the agreement was signed.\n\nOwing to this theoretical [[stalemate]], and genuine hostility between the North and the South, large numbers of troops are stationed along both sides of the line, each side guarding against potential aggression from the other side, even {{Age|1953|July|27}} years after its establishment. The armistice agreement explains exactly how many military personnel and what kind of weapons are allowed in the DMZ.

However, the resurrection of this line was short-lived, as it closed again in July 2008 following an incident in which a South Korean tourist was shot and killed.\n\nThere are several buildings on both the north and the south side of the [[Military Demarcation Line]] (MDL), and there have been some built on top of it. The JSA is the location where all [[Inter-Korean summits|negotiations]] since 1953 have been held, including statements of Korean solidarity, which have generally amounted to little except a slight decline of [[Inter-Korean conflict|tensions]]. The MDL goes through the conference rooms and down the middle of the conference tables where the North Koreans and the United Nations Command (primarily South Koreans and Americans) meet face to face.\n\nWithin the JSA are a number of buildings for joint meetings called Conference Rooms. These are used for direct talks between the Korean War participants and parties to the armistice. Facing the Conference Row buildings are the North Korean ''[[Panmungak]]'' ({{lang-en|Panmun Hall}}) and the South Korean [[Freedom House (Joint Security Area)|Freedom House]]. In 1994, North Korea enlarged Panmungak by adding a third floor. In 1998, South Korea built a new Freedom House for its [[Red Cross]] staff and to possibly host reunions of families separated by the [[Korean War]]. The new building incorporated the old Freedom House Pagoda within its design.\n\nSince 1953 there have been occasional confrontations and skirmishes within the JSA. The [[Korean axe murder incident|axe murder incident]] in August 1976 involved the attempted trimming of a tree which resulted in two deaths ([[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Arthur Bonifas and [[First Lieutenant]] Mark Barrett). Another incident occurred on 23 November 1984, when a Soviet tourist named Vasily Matuzok (sometimes spelled Matusak), who was part of an official trip to the JSA (hosted by the North), ran across the MDL shouting that he wanted to [[defection|defect]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/general-revisits-deadly-1984-thanksgiving-firefight-at-dmz-1.161443 |title=General revisits deadly 1984 Thanksgiving firefight at DMZ |work=Stars and Stripes |accessdate=13 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309182210/http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/general-revisits-deadly-1984-thanksgiving-firefight-at-dmz-1.161443 |archivedate=9 March 2016 }}</ref> North Korean troops immediately chased after him, opening fire.

They run in a north-south direction and do not have branches. Following each discovery, engineering within the tunnels has become progressively more advanced. For example, the third tunnel sloped slightly upwards as it progressed southward, to prevent [[water stagnation]].

Even after Gung Ye was [[Dethroning|dethroned]] by his own generals and replaced by [[Wang Geon]], the man who would rule over a united Korea as the first king of [[Goryeo]], this Buddhist influence would continue, playing a major role in shaping the culture of medieval Korea.\n\nAs the ruins of Gung Ye's capital lie in the DMZ itself, visitors cannot see them. Moreover, excavation work and research have been hampered by political realities. In the future, inter-Korean peace may allow for proper archaeological studies to be conducted on the castle site and other historical sites within and underneath the DMZ.<ref>Koehler, Rober.
