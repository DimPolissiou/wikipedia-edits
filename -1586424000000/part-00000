The next step that had to be taken for Haiti to commence full free trade in goods within the CSME was therefore for the Haitian Parliament to pass legislation adopting the Caricom External tariff as Haiti's national tariff. In mid 2009, the Government of Haiti announced that it would be ready to participate fully in free trade in goods within the CSME by 1 January 2010; and in fact through a revised Custom Act adopted by the Haitian Parliament in late 2009, 20-30% of the Caricom CET was incorporated into the Haitian national tariff. However soon after Haiti's progress towards full adoption of the CET began to stall with the dismissal of the Government of Prime Minister [[Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis|<big>Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis</big>]] in November 2009 and was then put on hold as a result of the January 2010 earthquake.<ref name=\"Haiti CSME Project\" /> To assist in stimulating economic activity, the Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED) in December, approved a request for some Haitian products to be exported within the Single Market on a non-reciprocal preferential basis for three years. Consultations are on-going towards approval of additional items from an original list which Haiti submitted. The concession became effective from 1 January 2011. CARICOM Secretariat officials are continuing their training exercises with Haitian customs officials to facilitate their understanding of the CSME's trading regime.<ref name=\"Haiti one year later\" />\n\nIn regards to the inclusion of Haitians in the free movement of skilled nationals under the CSME regime and a review of the visa policy towards Haitian nationals by other Caricom states some progress has been made. By early 2009, representation to the Caricom Heads of Government on the issue, particularly arising out of difficulties faced by Government officials travelling to Caricom meetings, led the Conference of Heads of Government to waive visa requirements for Haitian Government officials bearing official Government passports. In 2010 Caricom Heads of Government went a step further to facilitate travel by Haitian businesses persons and agreed that Haitians possessing US and Schengen visas would not require visas to enter other Caricom member states.<ref name=\"Haiti CSME Project\" /> In regards to participation in the free movement of skilled nationals, Haiti has also been included in the relevant legislation of at least some CSME states as a participating member state.<ref name=\"Skilled Nationals Act -

It has a long gestation period commencing in 1970 when the Jamaican delegation at the Sixth Heads of Government Conference, which convened in Jamaica, proposed the establishment of a Caribbean Court of Appeal in substitution for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Caribbean Court of Justice has been designed to be more than a court of last resort for Member States of the Caribbean Community of the Privy Council, the CCJ was vested with an original jurisdiction in respect of the interpretation and application of the Treaty Establishing the Caribbean Community (Treaty of Chaguramas) In effect, the CCJ would exercise both an appellate and an original jurisdiction.\n\nIn the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, the CCJ considers and determines appeals in both civil and criminal matters from common law courts within the jurisdiction of Member States of the Community and which are parties to the Agreement Establishing the CCJ. In the discharge of its appellate jurisdiction, the CCJ is the highest municipal court in the Region. In the exercise of its original jurisdiction, the CCJ will be discharging the functions of an international tribunal applying rules of international law in respect of the interpretation and application of the Treaty and so will be the court of arbitration for trade disputes under the CSME.\n\nBy 2006, only two countries were full signatories to the Court: Barbados and Guyana, it was expected that by the end of 2010, all 14 member countries would be fully involved. However, only Belize acceded to the appellate jurisdiction in 2010 while all other states were in various stages of moving towards full accession to the court's appellate jurisdiction.  Dominica thereafter acceded to the appellate jurisdiction in March 2015.\n\n(Source; CARICOM's official website at<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/|title=Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \u2014Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat|first=CARICOM|last=Secretariat|website=www.caricom.org}}</ref>)\n\n==Trade in goods==\n\nAll goods which meet the CARICOM rules of origin are traded duty-free throughout the region (except The Bahamas), therefore all goods originating within the region can be traded without restrictions. In addition, most member states apply a Common External Tariff (CET) on good originating from non-CARICOM countries. There are, however, some areas still to be developed:\n\n*Treatment of products made in Free Zones \u2013 there is need for regional agreement on how these goods are to be treated since they are usually manufactured at reduced tariff by foreign companies.\n*The removal of some specific non-tariff barriers in various member-states.\n\nAnother key element in relations to goods is Free Circulation. This provision allows for the free movement of goods imported from extra regional sources which would require collection of taxes at first point of entry into the CSME and for the sharing of collected customs revenue.\n\n(Sources; JIS website on the CSME at<ref name=\"JIS website on CSME\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/caricomnew/CSME1.html|title=JIS website on CSME|access-date=2006-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709134341/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/CARICOMNew/CSME1.html|archive-date=2006-07-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> and CARICOM website on the CSME at<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/single_market/single_market_index.jsp?menu=csme|title=CARICOM website on the CSME|access-date=2006-09-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821234732/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/single_market/single_market_index.jsp?menu=csme|archive-date=2006-08-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>)\n\n==Harmonization of standards==\n\nComplementary to the free movement of goods will be the guarantee of acceptable standards of these goods and services. To accomplish this, CARICOM members have established the Caribbean Regional Organization on Standards and Quality (CROSQ). The Organization will be responsible for establishing regional standards in the manufacture and trade of goods which all Member States must adhere to. This Organization was established by a separate agreement from the CSME.<ref name=\"JIS website on CSME\"/>\n\nAs an example of the work of the CROSQ, in conjunction with other regional bodies, on 6 October 2017, COTED approved nine poultry processing plants in Barbados, Belize<ref name=\"Way cleared for regional trade in poultry products\">{{cite web|url=http://today.caricom.org/2017/10/12/way-cleared-for-regional-trade-in-poultry-poultry-products/#more-24402|title=Way cleared for regional trade in poultry, poultry products|date=12 October 2017|publisher=}}</ref> (including Quality Poultry Products' plant and Caribbean Chicken's plant),<ref name=\"Belize chicken cleared for Region\">{{cite web|url=https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2017/10/13/caricom-clears-belize-chickens-export/|title=CARICOM clears Belize chickens for export|website=www.breakingbelizenews.com}}</ref><ref name=\"CARICOM open to Belize chicken\">[http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=42238 CARICOM open to Belize chicken]</ref> Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago to trade poultry and poultry products across the region after assessments by Regional Risk Assessment Teams (coordinated by the Caribbean Agricultural Health and Food Safety Agency (CAHFSA) and reviewed and finalized by the CARICOM Committee of Chief Veterinary Officers) proved they met the sanitary requirements (Specifications for Poultry and Poultry Products) developed by CROSQ and approved by COTED in 2013.

After entry has been granted the CARICOM National must submit to the Competent Authority, relevant proof, such as Police Certificate, Financial Resources, Business Names Certificate / Certificate of Incorporation. The Competent Authority will determine if all requirements to establish the particular business have been satisfied. Once all requirements are satisfied, the Competent Authority will issue a letter of approval to the CARICOM national copied to the Immigration Department. If the business is established within the 6 months period then the CARICOM National must report to the Immigration Department to further regularize his / her stay with the Letter of Approval from the Competent Authority. Immigration will grant the CARICOM National an indefinite stay.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n \nMember States will determine through the national mechanisms which have been established for that purpose, whether the business is operational. If the CARICOM National is no longer operating the business or another business the Competent Authority for Rights of Establishment will inform the Immigration Department, which has the right to rescind the indefinite stay or to indicate to the person \nthat he / she needs to apply for a permit of stay and / or a work permit until such time that there is full free movement in the Community.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n\n=====Extension for right of establishment=====\nIn the event that the business is not established within the 6-month period, the CARICOM National should present to the Immigration Department or other relevant department so designated by the Member State, evidence from the Competent Authority that concrete steps have been undertaken to establish the business.  Where such evidence is provided, the CARICOM National will be granted an extension \nof 6 months.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n\n=====Stamps for right of establishment=====\nThere are specific stamps for the definite entry of 6 months, the extension of 6 months and the indefinite stay with the following text \u2013 <ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n\n* (i) Right of Establishment \u2013 Definite Entry of 6 Months; \n* (ii) Right of Establishment \u2013 Extension; and \n* (iii) Right of Establishment \u2013 Indefinite Entry.\n\nA CARICOM national whose passport is stamped with one of the above is automatically \nentitled to multiple entry into that Member State.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n\n=====Integrated Online Registry=====\nFrom 8\u201310 December 2014, a meeting by Registrars of Companies from the 12 participating CSME member states was held to discuss the development of a complete online registry.

This harmonization would be facilitated by the web interface and interoperability of the respective systems allowing users access to information from participating Member States. The objective of the initiative is for interested parties to be able to register businesses/companies online across Member States thereby increasing cross-border economic activity. The other issues that are down for discussion are the software and hardware requirements of the systems to be installed as well as training for data entry operators and other relevant users in the registries.<ref name=\"Regional Company Registrars Consider Integrated Online Registry\"/>   \n \nThe beneficiary Member States under the project are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.

A regime has also been approved in respect of the granting of extensions under this regime.<ref name=\"Temporary Service Providers Info\"/>\n\n=====Entry procedure at point of entry for provision of temporary services=====\nCARICOM Nationals specifically wishing to move from one Member State to another to provide services on a temporary basis must present their certificate of registration as a CARICOM service provider at the point of entry to the Immigration Officer as proof that the CARICOM National is a service provider who is seeking to enter to provide services on a temporary basis.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/> \nOther documents required are - <ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/> \n* (i) a valid passport; \n*(ii) contract to offer service or invitation letter from a client.\n \nThe Immigration Officer will grant the CARICOM National sufficient time to provide \nthe service.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n\n=====Procedure for the automatic extension of the stay for provision of temporary services=====\nIn cases where the temporary service is not completed within the stipulated time period, an automatic extension must be requested from the Immigration Department. The automatic extension will be granted in order to enable the CARICOM National to complete the service once the service provider submits proof that the service is not yet completed.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n \nThe automatic extension is based on rights enshrined in the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, namely non-discrimination (national treatment) and the right to provide a service through mode 4 \u2013 the movement of national persons.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n\nThe process to extend the stay should not take longer than ten working days.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n\n(Main Source; JIS website on the CSME - see references)\n\n===Abolition of work permits and the free movement of labour===\nThe Free Movement of Skilled Persons, arises from an agreed CARICOM policy that was originally separate but related to the original Protocol II of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfabahamas.org/Persaud-Davenport%20Report.htm|title=Implications for the Bahamas of Participation in the CSME|access-date=2006-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710163746/http://mfabahamas.org/Persaud-Davenport%20Report.htm|archive-date=2006-07-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> The agreed policy, called The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Free Movement of Persons Act, is now enacted legislation in all the CSME Member States.

At the July 2006 CARICOM Summit, it was agreed to allow for free movement of two more categories of skilled persons; tertiary-trained Teachers and Nurses.

The Skills Certificate essentially replaces work permits and are obtained from the requisite ministry once all the essential documents/qualifications (which varies with each category of skilled persons) are handed in with an application. The issuing ministry varies depending upon the CARICOM Member State. In Antigua and Barbuda, Jamaica and Suriname the Skills Ceritificates are issued by the Ministry of Labour. Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago have Ministries for Caribbean Community Affairs which deal with the Certificates. Meanwhile, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines issue the Certificates through the Ministries of Immigration. The Skills Certificate can be applied for in either the home or host country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/caricomnew/jamaicansEncouragedTo.html|title=Jamaicans encouraged to apply for Skills Certificates|access-date=2006-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627004014/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/CARICOMNew/jamaicansEncouragedTo.html|archive-date=2006-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the eighteenth Inter-Sessional CARICOM Heads of Government Conference in February, it was agreed that artisans would not be immediately granted free movement status from January (as was originally envisaged), but would rather be granted free movement by mid-2007. The free movement of artisans will be facilitated through the award of Caribbean Vocational Qualifications (CVQ) based on industrial occupational standards.

This legislation has been amended, as of 2005, to remove the discriminatory provisions. This will allow CARICOM nationals, for example, to be eligible for registration in their respective professions on an equal basis.\n\nHowever, shortly before signing onto the CSM, the second batch of member states (all in the OECS) negotiated an opt-out agreement with regards to land ownership by non-nationals. As the OECS members of the CSM are all small countries and have limited available land, they are allowed to keep their Alien Land Holding Laws or Alien Landholders Acts (which apply to the ownership of land by non-nationals), but will put in place mechanisms to ensure compliance with the Revised Treaty that will monitor the granting of access to land and the conditions of such access.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2006/06/060629_csmgonzo.shtml|title=BBCCaribbean.com - Kingstown wins single market land deal|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> As it now stands foreign companies or nationals have to seek legal permission to buy land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000005/000501.htm|title=What the business sector should know about the CSM|publisher=}}</ref> All other laws relating to discrimination in favour of member state nationals only have been amended though.

The member states have also signed and ratified an Intra-Regional [[Double taxation|Double Taxation]] [[Tax treaty|Agreement]].\n\n==Single currency==<!-- This section is linked from [[Caribbean Community]] -->\n\nAlthough not expected until between 2010 and 2015,<ref name=\"Towards a Single Economy and a Single\nDevelopment Vision\" /> it is intended that the CSME will have a single currency. As it stands a number of the CSME members are already in a [[currency union]] with the [[Eastern Caribbean dollar]] and the strength of most regional currencies (with the exception of Jamaica's and Guyana's) should make any future exchange-rate harmonization between CSME members fairly straightforward as a step towards a monetary union.\n\nThe aim of forming a CARICOM monetary union is not new. As a precursor to this idea the various CARICOM countries established a compensation procedure to favour the use of the member states currencies. The procedure was aimed at ensuring monetary stability and promoting trade development. This monetary compensation scheme was at first bilateral, but this system was limited and unwieldy because each member state had to have a separate account for each of its CARICOM trade partners and the accounts had to be individually balanced at the end of each credit period. The system became multilateral in 1977 and was called the [[CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility]] (CMCF). The CMCF was supposed to favour the use of internal CARICOM currencies for transaction settlement and to promote banking cooperation and monetary cooperation between member states. Each country was allowed a fixed credit line and initially the CMCF was successful enough that both the total credit line and the credit period were extended by 1982. However, the CMCF failed shortly thereafter in the early 1980s due to Guyana's inability to settle its debts and Barbados being unable to grant new payment terms<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sta.uwi.edu/salises/workshop/csme/paper/omanioc.pdf|title=404 Error - Page not found|website=sta.uwi.edu}}</ref>\n\nDespite the failure of the CMCF, in 1992 the [[CARICOM Heads of Government]] determined that CARICOM should move towards monetary integration and commissioned their central bankers to study the possible creation of a monetary union among CARICOM countries. It was argued that monetary integration would provide benefits such as exchange rate and price stability and reduced transaction costs in regional trade. It was also thought that these benefits in turn would stimulate capital flows, intra-regional trade and investment, improve balance of payments performance and increase growth and employment.\n\nThe Central Bank Governors produced a report in March 1992 that outlined the necessary steps and criteria for a monetary union by 2000. The 1992 criteria were amended in 1996 and were known as the 3-12-36-15 criteria. They required that:\n* countries maintain foreign reserves equivalent to 3 months of import cover or 80% of central bank current liabilities (whichever was greater) for 12 months;\n*the exchange rate be maintained at a fixed rate to the [[US dollar]] (for [[Fixed exchange rate|Fixers]]) or within a band of 1.5% on either side of parity (for [[Floating exchange rate|Floaters]]) for 36 consecutive months without external debt payment arrears and;\n*the [[debt service ratio]] to be maintained within 15% of the export of goods and services.\n\nThe report envisioned the fulfilment of a monetary union in 3 phases on the basis of grouping the member states into 2 categories, A and B. Category A included the Bahamas, Belize and [[OECS]] states.  Category A countries had already met the original criteria in 1992 and only had to maintain economic stability to begin the monetary union. Category B consisted of Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago (Suriname and Haiti were not yet members and so were not included). These countries had to make the necessary adjustments to meet the entry criteria.\n\nPhase 1 of the monetary union process was scheduled to conclude in 1996. It was to include the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the OECS states and Trinidad and Tobago and there was to have been a common currency as a unit of account (cf. the [[Euro]] from 1999\u20132002) amongst these states with the exception of the Bahamas and Belize. This phase would also involve the coordination of monetary policies and the movement towards intra-regional currency convertibility among all member states. Phase 1 would also have seen the formation of a Council of CARICOM Central Bank Governors to oversee the entire process.\n\nPhase 2 was to have occurred between 1997 and 2000 and should have seen a number of initiatives:\n*the formation of a [[Caribbean Monetary Authority]] (CMA), which would be accountable to a Council of Ministers of Finance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/13hgc_1992_communique.jsp|title=Communique Issued at the conclusion of the Thirteenth CARICOM Heads of Government Conference, 1992|access-date=2006-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527120500/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/13hgc_1992_communique.jsp|archive-date=2006-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*the issuance and circulation of a physical common currency in all Phase 1 countries except the Bahamas.\n*the use of the new currency in the other countries (the Bahamas, Guyana and Jamaica) as a unit of account in settling regional transactions.\n*the continued efforts by Guyana and Jamaica to meet the criteria for entry into the monetary union if they had not already done so and achieved economic stability.\n\nPhase 3 was planned to begin in 2000 and had as its ultimate goal to have all CARICOM countries entering into the monetary union and membership of the CMA.\n\nHowever, the implementation of Phase 1  was put on hold in 1993 as a result of Trinidad and Tobago floating its [[Trinidad and Tobago dollar|dollar]]. In response and in an effort to continue pursuing monetary cooperation and integration, CARICOM Central Bank Governors made their regional currencies fully inter-convertible. A subsequent proposal called for Barbados, Belize and the OECS states to form a currency union by 1997 but this also failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caribank.org/uploads/publications-reports/staff-papers/EXCHANGE%20RATE%20CONVERGENCE%20IN%20CARICOM.pdf|title=Exchange Rate Convergence in CARICOM|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==CARICOM Development Fund==\n\nOne of the institutions and regimes created to give life to the regional integration movement through the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, is the CARICOM Development Fund (CDF).

The idea for the CDF was borrowed substantially from a similar mechanism successfully employed the European Union<ref name=\"CDF another brick\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres422_09.jsp|title=The Caribbean Development Fund: Another Brick in the building of the Caribbean Community|access-date=2014-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727094710/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres422_09.jsp|archive-date=2014-07-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> (the EU's [[Cohesion Fund]])<ref name=\"CDF Vital\">{{cite web|url=http://jis.gov.jm/caricom-development-fund-vital-aspect-of-csme/|title=CARICOM Development Fund: Vital Aspect of CSME - Jamaica Information Service|date=7 December 2005|publisher=}}</ref> in helping bring certain of its member states, such as Ireland, up to a certain economic level to assist them in effectively participating and benefiting from the integration process.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nThe CDF was established under Article 158 of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas \u201cfor the purpose of providing financial or technical assistance to disadvantaged countries, regions and sectors.\u201d It is the centre-piece of a regime to address the disparities among the Member States of the Community which may result from the implementation of the CSME. The signing of the Agreement Relating to the Operations of the Fund in July 2008, followed years of negotiations by CARICOM Member States regarding the principles, size and structure of a regional development fund.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nThere was a sense of achievement when the agreement was finally signed and technicians employed by the CDF got down to the task of making the mechanism operational. In an interview, CDF Chief Executive Officer Ambassador Lorne McDonnough said \u201cThe CDF start-up team was always confident it would meet the projected launch date....\u201d Despite this confidence he admitted that \u201c...along the way there were always the glitches and frustrating delays that called for an extra dose of perseverance as well as the need to step back and revisit the problem with a fresh resolve\u201d. Ambassador McDonnough noted that heightened expectations and the desire to see the CDF operational in the shortest possible time, meant that Member States sometimes underestimated the work which had to be done to make the CDF ready for full operations.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nNotwithstanding all the challenges, on 24 August 2009, in keeping with expectations, the CDF officially opened its doors. This was achieved after nine months of feverish effort by the start-up staff to put systems in place to allow for the receipt of requests for loans and grants.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nThe CDF has 12 members: Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts & Nevis, Saint Vincent & the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad & Tobago.<ref name=\"CDF.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caricomdevelopmentfund.org/website/|title=CARICOM Development Fund website|access-date=2014-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725115815/http://www.caricomdevelopmentfund.org/website/|archive-date=2014-07-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===CDF governance===\n\nThe CDF, as established in the agreement, has its own legal identity but is linked to CARICOM through several Ministerial Councils. The CDF is governed by its own corporate board and is managed by the CEO.

These two officers were seconded from the CARICOM Secretariat.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nThe CDF began its existence from three temporary offices within CARICOM's CSME Unit in the Tom Adams Financial Centre, Bridgetown, Barbados. The team spent the first three months looking for alternative office space, preparing the work plan and budget, seeking funding for the preparation of its governance rules and procedures in addition to beginning the process of recruiting the core executive and administrative staff.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nThe CDF moved into its current temporary office in the renovated Old Town Hall Building in Bridgetown at the end of January 2009. This space was provided by the Government of Barbados as the CDF continued to work with it on acquiring its more permanent premises by middle of 2010.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/> The new permanent facilities for the CDF were located in a new building located at Mall Internationale, Haggatt Hall, St. Michael, Barbados.

In 2009 the CDF was capitalised at US$79.9 million. It was envisaged that by the end of the 2009 member states would have contributed approximately US$87 million. The CDF also has the remit to raise a further US$130 million from donors and friendly states.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nThe CDF also benefited in 2009 from technical assistance grants of US$149,000 from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and \u20ac834,000 from the European Union (EU) Institutional Support Facility in addition to a 2009 contribution of \u20ac300,000 signalling the start of a closer relationship between the Government of Finland and CARICOM. The Government of Turkey also provided support to the countries of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to assist them in making their contribution to the CDF's capital fund.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nBy 2011 the CDF was capitalised at US$100.7 million, with the total funds increasing to US$107 million by 2012.<ref name=\"CDF Annual Report 2012\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caricomdevelopmentfund.org/website/images/stories/documents/cdf_annual_report_2012.pdf|title=CDF Annual Report 2012|access-date=2014-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725124236/http://www.caricomdevelopmentfund.org/website/images/stories/documents/cdf_annual_report_2012.pdf|archive-date=2014-07-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a meeting of a CDF team with the member states' Technical Working Group (TWG), Ambassador McDonnough made recommendation on the replenishment of the CDF during the Second Funding Cycle.

A project was commissioned in 2003 by the CARICOM Secretariat with a grant from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The object of the project was to support CARICOM in its efforts to establish an effective regional regime for Public Procurement which would facilitate the full implementation of the CSME and to participate effectively in external trade negotiations relating to Public Procurement.  The project comprised three main components.  Component 1 \u2013 National Government Procurement Frameworks: Analysis, Comparison and Recommended Improvements; Component 2 \u2013 Collection and Analysis of Government Procurement Statistics; and Component 3 \u2013 Recommendations for a Regional Best-practice Regime for Government Procurement.<ref name=\"CSME and Procurement\">{{cite web|url=http://roselawcaribbean.com/csme-procurement/|title=CSME and Procurement|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAltogether, the outputs of the project informed the preparation of the first draft of the Framework Regional Integration Policy on Public Procurement (FRIP).<ref name=\"regional integration of public procurement\"/> The First Draft of the Community Policy on Public Procurement was developed and disseminated to Member States for review in 2005. By April 2006 the Second Draft was finalized.<ref name=\"CSME and Procurement\"/>  In 2011, the Fourth Draft, which reflects the recommended amendments to the Third Draft, was adopted.<ref name=\"regional integration of public procurement\"/> The proposed policy now called the Framework for Regional Integration of Public Procurement (FRIPP) is in its fifth draft stage.<ref name=\"CSME and Procurement\"/>\n\nAmong the findings of the 2003 project were that:<ref name=\"CSME and Procurement\"/>\n\n*competitive public procurement regimes in the CARICOM Member States are in a disarray and dysfunctional; Public Procurement accounts for a significant percentage of public expenditure\n*the current legislation governing procurement in CARICOM Member States is made up of poorly coordinated and outdated enactments, regulations and decrees\n*the weakness of legislation and/or their enforcement breeds many abusive and manipulative practices in public procurement\n*enforcement of procurement rules is extremely weak and sometimes non-existent due to the absence of a single regulatory authority\n*the rights of bidders are not adequately protected; capacity to conduct procurement is extremely weak\n*Public Procurement is severely under-developed and rated as high risk\n*internal and external procurement controls are inadequate\n*procurement related corruption is a major problem\n*due to the small size of individual economies, the private sector actively seeks public procurement opportunities, albeit with little or no confidence in the integrity of the public procurement system\n\nThe general conclusion was that the present procurement regimes are counter productive towards the efforts of CSME. The dismal picture painted by the findings of the CARICOM research project demonstrated the dire need for comprehensive procurement reform. One of the significant recommendations of the project was that the proposed regional and domestic public procurement legislative and policy reforms should be based on the UNCITRAL Model Law.<ref name=\"CSME and Procurement\"/>\n\nBetween April and June 2014, a consultancy conducted by Analysis Mason Ltd. was conducted in 13 Caricom countries (excepting Haiti and the Bahamas)<ref name=\"CARICOM kicks off govt procurement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres207_14.jsp|title=CARICOM Kicks Off Government Procurement Consultations|access-date=2014-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103948/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres207_14.jsp|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> and provided the CARICOM Secretariat and its Member States with the recommendations on the required Information Technology (IT) infrastructure for the establishment of a fully functioning Regional Integration Electronic Public Procurement System (RIEPPS).<ref name=\"govt contracts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestkittsnevisobserver.com/2014/09/05/govt-contracts.html|title=New System To Allow Regional Bidding For Gov\u2019t Contracts|access-date=2014-10-06|archive-url=https://archive.today/20141006031932/http://www.thestkittsnevisobserver.com/2014/09/05/govt-contracts.html|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe new IT-based system is being proposed whereby businesses in Caricom countries can bid on government contracts in member states. The proposed regionally integrated Government Procurement system would bring further life to the CSME single market component, allowing for an effective means for businesses of CARICOM member states to operate in each other's countries. The arrangement is being structured in such manner as to allow certain contracts to be retained for national businesses, while others are open to regional bidding processes.<ref name=\"govt contracts\"/>\n\nThe work plan calls for a common regional IT infrastructure, supported by legislative protocols and a business development component that would help to stimulate the intra-regional procurement activities. All of these components are being undertaken simultaneously with a view towards achieving possible implementation by the end of 2014<ref name=\"govt contracts\"/> but certainly by 2016.<ref name=\"benefit from regional procurement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Jamaica-to-benefit-from-regional-procurement-system_17478311|title=Jamaica to benefit from regional procurement system|first=Jamaica Observer|last=Limited|website=Jamaica Observer}}</ref>\n\nThe estimated market for regional procurement is approximately US$17 billion annually among the region of five and a half million people (with the exception of Haiti). The government is one of the biggest single sectors in every economy in Caricom, so one of the possible solutions to the aim of boosting intra-regional trade, and for each country to generate business and create employment, is to open the market for government procurement.<ref name=\"benefit from regional procurement\"/>\n\nA reform of the procurement systems and processes in every country where the project is to be implemented will also be undertaken, as well as the installation of relevant IT hardware and software and the training of required personnel. One of the important hurdles to be overcome for full implementation of the programme will be the need to ensure that every country has legislation that allows transactions of this type to be done electronically.\n\n\u201cMany states up to this point still operate with Finance and Administration Acts, rather than a procurement law. Several of them do have an Electronic Transactions Act, but it may not speak specifically to procurement in the public domain. So, one of the things that CARICOM will be responsible for doing under the project is to prepare the protocol and the supporting implementing law and rules,\u201d explained Ivor Carryl, Programme Manager, Caricom Single Market and Economy, CARICOM Secretariat.<ref name=\"JIS regional procurement\">{{cite web|url=http://jis.gov.jm/regional-procurement-system-established/|title=Regional Procurement System To Be Established - Jamaica Information Service|date=4 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nUnder the CARICOM Regional Integration Electronic Public Procurement System, traders of goods and services will have protection from the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ).<ref name=\"CCJ and public procurement\">{{cite web|url=http://jis.gov.jm/ccj-provide-protection-new-procurement-regime/|title=CCJ to Provide Protection Under New Procurement Regime - Jamaica Information Service|date=1 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivor Carryl, a Regional public procurement notice board will be created for member states to post their contracts, and where any player feels that unfairness is involved in the award of the contracts, the CCJ can be called on to adjudicate.<ref name=\"CCJ and public procurement\"/>\n\n\u201cIn Article 7, which deals with non-discriminatory, equal treatment and fairness, all of your domestic laws and practices relating to CARICOM, must mirror those provisions,\u201d Carryl told JIS News in an interview.<ref name=\"CCJ and public procurement\"/>\n\n\u201cIf a Jamaican company under the protocol submits a bid, and for some reason he feels aggrieved that the process (the tender evaluation) didn\u2019t go right, he would have the right under the Treaty to challenge the procuring entity, and ask them to explain why he did not win the bid; and he has the right to go to court and challenge the decision,\u201d the CARICOM official added.<ref name=\"CCJ and public procurement\"/>\n\nMr. Carryl explains that under the Regional Procurement Regime, the appeal mechanism has been strengthened, so persons will have easier access in seeking redress.<ref name=\"CCJ and public procurement\"/>\n\n==Single Jurisdiction for Companies==\n\nIn August 2014, CARICOM initiated work towards creating a harmonized framework for companies and other businesses can be established and operate within the CSME. This Single Jurisdiction should ensure that the rules for establishing and operating a business in one country apply throughout the CSME.<ref name=\"CARICOM Moves to Harmonize Business Rules in CSME\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres205_14.jsp|title=CARICOM Moves to Harmonize Business Rules in CSME|access-date=2015-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711005423/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres205_14.jsp|archive-date=2015-07-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nStarting in June 2015, the CARICOM Secretariat began a series of national consultations to discuss the Draft Framework Policy on the Single Jurisdiction.  The aim of the Single Jurisdiction is to create a seamless space for companies can conduct business. When established it would enable businesses, once registered in one participating member state of the CSME, to operate in any other CSME member state without needing to register in that other member state. Thus in essence it will allow businesses to register anywhere within the CSME and operate throughout the Single Market. The creation of the Single Jurisdiction is seen to be crucial to allow for the proper implementation of the Right Establishment under the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas and should be of significant benefit to those exercising this right.<ref name=\"CARICOM Convenes National Consultations on Single Jurisdiction for Companies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2015/pres95_15.jsp|title=CARICOM Convenes National Consultations on Single Jurisdiction for Companies|access-date=2015-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711010810/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2015/pres95_15.jsp|archive-date=2015-07-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007110837/http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=131 Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas]\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Caribbean}}\n*[http://www.sta.uwi.edu/iir/news/theworldtoday/article57.pdf CSME Contingent Rights]\n*[http://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2013/08/24/implementation-of-contingent-rights-protocol-could-lessen-migration-woes-caricom-official/  Implementation of Contingent Rights Protocol could lessen migration woes ] Kaieteur News, August 24, 2013\n*[http://www.caricomstats.org/ CARICOM Statistics] - Statistical information compiled through the CARICOM Secretariat\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051124183315/http://www.radiocaricom.org/ Radio CARICOM]- the voice of the Caribbean Community [https://web.archive.org/web/20060212172618/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres103_04.htm Press Release]\n*[http://csmeonline.org/news/about-the-csme The CSME website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070609083722/http://www.caricomlaw.org/ Caricom Law] - Website and online database of the CARICOM Legislative Drafting Facility (CLDF)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080216075048/http://www.caricomtradesupport.org/ Caricom Trade Support Programme] - Government of Trinidad and Tobago\n*[http://www.pancap.org/ PANCAP] Pan Caribbean Partnership Against HIV/AIDS\n*[http://www.sice.oas.org/TPD/CAR/MatxMarch16_2005.asp Establishment of the CSME: Status of the Key Elements] - Summary Table of the status of the various member states in relation to the treaty obligations\n*[http://www.talkcsme.com/ CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME)]\n*- blog which discusses the impact of the CSME on Caricom member nations\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231600/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/Business/html/20061026T190000-0500_114553_OBS_HOW_VIABLE_IS_A_SINGLE_CARIBBEAN_CURRENCY____PART___.asp How viable is a single Caribbean currency?

The next step that had to be taken for Haiti to commence full free trade in goods within the CSME was therefore for the Haitian Parliament to pass legislation adopting the Caricom External tariff as Haiti\u2019s national tariff. In mid 2009, the Government of Haiti announced that it would be ready to participate fully in free trade in goods within the CSME by 1 January 2010; and in fact through a revised Custom Act adopted by the Haitian Parliament in late 2009, 20-30% of the Caricom CET was incorporated into the Haitian national tariff. However soon after Haiti's progress towards full adoption of the CET began to stall with the dismissal of the Government of Prime Minister [[Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis|<big>Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis</big>]] in November 2009 and was then put on hold as a result of the January 2010 earthquake.<ref name=\"Haiti CSME Project\" /> To assist in stimulating economic activity, the Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED) in December, approved a request for some Haitian products to be exported within the Single Market on a non-reciprocal preferential basis for three years. Consultations are on-going towards approval of additional items from an original list which Haiti submitted. The concession became effective from 1 January 2011.

By early 2009, representation to the Caricom Heads of Government on the issue, particularly arising out of difficulties faced by Government officials travelling to Caricom meetings, led the Conference of Heads of Government to waive visa requirements for Haitian Government officials bearing official Government passports. In 2010 Caricom Heads of Government went a step further to facilitate travel by Haitian businesses persons and agreed that Haitians possessing US and Schengen visas would not require visas to enter other Caricom member states.<ref name=\"Haiti CSME Project\" /> In regards to participation in the free movement of skilled nationals, Haiti has also been included in the relevant legislation of at least some CSME states as a participating member state.<ref name=\"Skilled Nationals Act -

It has a long gestation period commencing in 1970 when the Jamaican delegation at the Sixth Heads of Government Conference, which convened in Jamaica, proposed the establishment of a Caribbean Court of Appeal in substitution for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Caribbean Court of Justice has been designed to be more than a court of last resort for Member States of the Caribbean Community of the Privy Council, the CCJ was vested with an original jurisdiction in respect of the interpretation and application of the Treaty Establishing the Caribbean Community (Treaty of Chaguramas) In effect, the CCJ would exercise both an appellate and an original jurisdiction.\n\nIn the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, the CCJ considers and determines appeals in both civil and criminal matters from common law courts within the jurisdiction of Member States of the Community and which are parties to the Agreement Establishing the CCJ. In the discharge of its appellate jurisdiction, the CCJ is the highest municipal court in the Region. In the exercise of its original jurisdiction, the CCJ will be discharging the functions of an international tribunal applying rules of international law in respect of the interpretation and application of the Treaty and so will be the court of arbitration for trade disputes under the CSME.\n\nBy 2006, only two countries were full signatories to the Court: Barbados and Guyana, it was expected that by the end of 2010, all 14 member countries would be fully involved. However, only Belize acceded to the appellate jurisdiction in 2010 while all other states were in various stages of moving towards full accession to the court's appellate jurisdiction.  Dominica thereafter acceded to the appellate jurisdiction in March 2015.\n\n(Source; CARICOM's official website at<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/|title=Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \u2014Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat|first=CARICOM|last=Secretariat|website=www.caricom.org}}</ref>)\n\n==Trade in goods==\n\nAll goods which meet the CARICOM rules of origin are traded duty-free throughout the region (except The Bahamas), therefore all goods originating within the region can be traded without restrictions. In addition, most member states apply a Common External Tariff (CET) on good originating from non-CARICOM countries. There are, however, some areas still to be developed:\n\n*Treatment of products made in Free Zones \u2013 there is need for regional agreement on how these goods are to be treated since they are usually manufactured at reduced tariff by foreign companies.\n*The removal of some specific non-tariff barriers in various member-states.\n\nAnother key element in relations to goods is Free Circulation. This provision allows for the free movement of goods imported from extra regional sources which would require collection of taxes at first point of entry into the CSME and for the sharing of collected customs revenue.\n\n(Sources; JIS website on the CSME at<ref name=\"JIS website on CSME\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/caricomnew/CSME1.html|title=JIS website on CSME|access-date=2006-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709134341/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/CARICOMNew/CSME1.html|archive-date=2006-07-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> and CARICOM website on the CSME at<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/single_market/single_market_index.jsp?menu=csme|title=CARICOM website on the CSME|access-date=2006-09-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821234732/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/single_market/single_market_index.jsp?menu=csme|archive-date=2006-08-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>)\n\n==Harmonization of standards==\n\nComplementary to the free movement of goods will be the guarantee of acceptable standards of these goods and services. To accomplish this, CARICOM members have established the Caribbean Regional Organization on Standards and Quality (CROSQ). The Organization will be responsible for establishing regional standards in the manufacture and trade of goods which all Member States must adhere to. This Organization was established by a separate agreement from the CSME.<ref name=\"JIS website on CSME\"/>\n\nAs an example of the work of the CROSQ, in conjunction with other regional bodies, on 6 October 2017, COTED approved nine poultry processing plants in Barbados, Belize<ref name=\"Way cleared for regional trade in poultry products\">{{cite web|url=http://today.caricom.org/2017/10/12/way-cleared-for-regional-trade-in-poultry-poultry-products/#more-24402|title=Way cleared for regional trade in poultry, poultry products|date=12 October 2017|publisher=}}</ref> (including Quality Poultry Products' plant and Caribbean Chicken's plant),<ref name=\"Belize chicken cleared for Region\">{{cite web|url=https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2017/10/13/caricom-clears-belize-chickens-export/|title=CARICOM clears Belize chickens for export|website=www.breakingbelizenews.com}}</ref><ref name=\"CARICOM open to Belize chicken\">[http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=42238 CARICOM open to Belize chicken]</ref> Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago to trade poultry and poultry products across the region after assessments by Regional Risk Assessment Teams (coordinated by the Caribbean Agricultural Health and Food Safety Agency (CAHFSA) and reviewed and finalized by the CARICOM Committee of Chief Veterinary Officers) proved they met the sanitary requirements (Specifications for Poultry and Poultry Products) developed by CROSQ and approved by COTED in 2013.

To this end, the Member States have  concluded the Agreement on Accreditation for Education in Medical and other Health Professions. By this agreement, an Authority (the [[Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medical and Other Health Professions]]) is established which will be responsible for accrediting doctors and other health care personnel throughout the CSME.

After entry has been granted the CARICOM National must submit to the Competent Authority, relevant proof, such as Police Certificate, Financial Resources, Business Names Certificate / Certificate of Incorporation. The Competent Authority will determine if all requirements to establish the particular business have been satisfied. Once all requirements are satisfied, the Competent Authority will issue a letter of approval to the CARICOM national copied to the Immigration Department. If the business is established within the 6 months period then the CARICOM National must report to the Immigration Department to further regularize his / her stay with the Letter of Approval from the Competent Authority. Immigration will grant the CARICOM National an indefinite stay.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n \nMember States will determine through the national mechanisms which have been established for that purpose, whether the business is operational. If the CARICOM National is no longer operating the business or another business the Competent Authority for Rights of Establishment will inform the Immigration Department, which has the right to rescind the indefinite stay or to indicate to the person \nthat he / she needs to apply for a permit of stay and / or a work permit until such time that there is full free movement in the Community.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n\n=====Extension for right of establishment=====\nIn the event that the business is not established within the 6-month period, the CARICOM National should present to the Immigration Department or other relevant department so designated by the Member State, evidence from the Competent Authority that concrete steps have been undertaken to establish the business.  Where such evidence is provided, the CARICOM National will be granted an extension \nof 6 months.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n\n=====Stamps for right of establishment=====\nThere are specific stamps for the definite entry of 6 months, the extension of 6 months and the indefinite stay with the following text \u2013 <ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n\n* (i) Right of Establishment \u2013 Definite Entry of 6 Months; \n* (ii) Right of Establishment \u2013 Extension; and \n* (iii) Right of Establishment \u2013 Indefinite Entry.\n\nA CARICOM national whose passport is stamped with one of the above is automatically \nentitled to multiple entry into that Member State.<ref name=\"Entry procedures establishment and services\"/>\n\n=====Integrated Online Registry=====\nFrom 8\u201310 December 2014, a meeting by Registrars of Companies from the 12 participating CSME member states was held to discuss the development of a complete online registry.

This harmonization would be facilitated by the web interface and interoperability of the respective systems allowing users access to information from participating Member States. The objective of the initiative is for interested parties to be able to register businesses/companies online across Member States thereby increasing cross-border economic activity. The other issues that are down for discussion are the software and hardware requirements of the systems to be installed as well as training for data entry operators and other relevant users in the registries.<ref name=\"Regional Company Registrars Consider Integrated Online Registry\"/>   \n \nThe beneficiary Member States under the project are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.

The Skills Certificate essentially replaces work permits and are obtained from the requisite ministry once all the essential documents/qualifications (which varies with each category of skilled persons) are handed in with an application. The issuing ministry varies depending upon the CARICOM Member State. In Antigua and Barbuda, Jamaica and Suriname the Skills Ceritificates are issued by the Ministry of Labour. Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago have Ministries for Caribbean Community Affairs which deal with the Certificates. Meanwhile, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines issue the Certificates through the Ministries of Immigration. The Skills Certificate can be applied for in either the home or host country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/caricomnew/jamaicansEncouragedTo.html|title=Jamaicans encouraged to apply for Skills Certificates|access-date=2006-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627004014/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/CARICOMNew/jamaicansEncouragedTo.html|archive-date=2006-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the eighteenth Inter-Sessional CARICOM Heads of Government Conference in February, it was agreed that artisans would not be immediately granted free movement status from January (as was originally envisaged), but would rather be granted free movement by mid-2007. The free movement of artisans will be facilitated through the award of Caribbean Vocational Qualifications (CVQ) based on industrial occupational standards.

This legislation has been amended, as of 2005, to remove the discriminatory provisions. This will allow CARICOM nationals, for example, to be eligible for registration in their respective professions on an equal basis.\n\nHowever, shortly before signing onto the CSM, the second batch of member states (all in the OECS) negotiated an opt-out agreement with regards to land ownership by non-nationals. As the OECS members of the CSM are all small countries and have limited available land, they are allowed to keep their Alien Land Holding Laws or Alien Landholders Acts (which apply to the ownership of land by non-nationals), but will put in place mechanisms to ensure compliance with the Revised Treaty that will monitor the granting of access to land and the conditions of such access.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2006/06/060629_csmgonzo.shtml|title=BBCCaribbean.com - Kingstown wins single market land deal|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> As it now stands foreign companies or nationals have to seek legal permission to buy land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000005/000501.htm|title=What the business sector should know about the CSM|publisher=}}</ref> All other laws relating to discrimination in favour of member state nationals only have been amended though.

The member states have also signed and ratified an Intra-Regional [[Double taxation|Double Taxation]] [[Tax treaty|Agreement]].\n\n==Single currency==<!-- This section is linked from [[Caribbean Community]] -->\n\nAlthough not expected until between 2010 and 2015,<ref name=\"Towards a Single Economy and a Single\nDevelopment Vision\" /> it is intended that the CSME will have a single currency. As it stands a number of the CSME members are already in a [[currency union]] with the [[Eastern Caribbean dollar]] and the strength of most regional currencies (with the exception of Jamaica's and Guyana's) should make any future exchange-rate harmonization between CSME members fairly straightforward as a step towards a monetary union.\n\nThe aim of forming a CARICOM monetary union is not new. As a precursor to this idea the various CARICOM countries established a compensation procedure to favour the use of the member states currencies. The procedure was aimed at ensuring monetary stability and promoting trade development. This monetary compensation scheme was at first bilateral, but this system was limited and unwieldy because each member state had to have a separate account for each of its CARICOM trade partners and the accounts had to be individually balanced at the end of each credit period. The system became multilateral in 1977 and was called the [[CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility]] (CMCF). The CMCF was supposed to favour the use of internal CARICOM currencies for transaction settlement and to promote banking cooperation and monetary cooperation between member states. Each country was allowed a fixed credit line and initially the CMCF was successful enough that both the total credit line and the credit period were extended by 1982. However, the CMCF failed shortly thereafter in the early 1980s due to Guyana's inability to settle its debts and Barbados being unable to grant new payment terms<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sta.uwi.edu/salises/workshop/csme/paper/omanioc.pdf|title=404 Error - Page not found|website=sta.uwi.edu}}</ref>\n\nDespite the failure of the CMCF, in 1992 the [[CARICOM Heads of Government]] determined that CARICOM should move towards monetary integration and commissioned their central bankers to study the possible creation of a monetary union among CARICOM countries. It was argued that monetary integration would provide benefits such as exchange rate and price stability and reduced transaction costs in regional trade. It was also thought that these benefits in turn would stimulate capital flows, intra-regional trade and investment, improve balance of payments performance and increase growth and employment.\n\nThe Central Bank Governors produced a report in March 1992 that outlined the necessary steps and criteria for a monetary union by 2000. The 1992 criteria were amended in 1996 and were known as the 3-12-36-15 criteria. They required that:\n* countries maintain foreign reserves equivalent to 3 months of import cover or 80% of central bank current liabilities (whichever was greater) for 12 months;\n*the exchange rate be maintained at a fixed rate to the [[US dollar]] (for [[Fixed exchange rate|Fixers]]) or within a band of 1.5% on either side of parity (for [[Floating exchange rate|Floaters]]) for 36 consecutive months without external debt payment arrears and;\n*the [[debt service ratio]] to be maintained within 15% of the export of goods and services.\n\nThe report envisioned the fulfilment of a monetary union in 3 phases on the basis of grouping the member states into 2 categories, A and B. Category A included the Bahamas, Belize and [[OECS]] states.  Category A countries had already met the original criteria in 1992 and only had to maintain economic stability to begin the monetary union. Category B consisted of Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago (Suriname and Haiti were not yet members and so were not included). These countries had to make the necessary adjustments to meet the entry criteria.\n\nPhase 1 of the monetary union process was scheduled to conclude in 1996. It was to include the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the OECS states and Trinidad and Tobago and there was to have been a common currency as a unit of account (cf. the [[Euro]] from 1999\u20132002) amongst these states with the exception of the Bahamas and Belize. This phase would also involve the coordination of monetary policies and the movement towards intra-regional currency convertibility among all member states. Phase 1 would also have seen the formation of a Council of CARICOM Central Bank Governors to oversee the entire process.\n\nPhase 2 was to have occurred between 1997 and 2000 and should have seen a number of initiatives:\n*the formation of a [[Caribbean Monetary Authority]] (CMA), which would be accountable to a Council of Ministers of Finance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/13hgc_1992_communique.jsp|title=Communique Issued at the conclusion of the Thirteenth CARICOM Heads of Government Conference, 1992|access-date=2006-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527120500/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/13hgc_1992_communique.jsp|archive-date=2006-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*the issuance and circulation of a physical common currency in all Phase 1 countries except the Bahamas.\n*the use of the new currency in the other countries (the Bahamas, Guyana and Jamaica) as a unit of account in settling regional transactions.\n*the continued efforts by Guyana and Jamaica to meet the criteria for entry into the monetary union if they had not already done so and achieved economic stability.\n\nPhase 3 was planned to begin in 2000 and had as its ultimate goal to have all CARICOM countries entering into the monetary union and membership of the CMA.\n\nHowever, the implementation of Phase 1  was put on hold in 1993 as a result of Trinidad and Tobago floating its [[Trinidad and Tobago dollar|dollar]]. In response and in an effort to continue pursuing monetary cooperation and integration, CARICOM Central Bank Governors made their regional currencies fully inter-convertible. A subsequent proposal called for Barbados, Belize and the OECS states to form a currency union by 1997 but this also failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caribank.org/uploads/publications-reports/staff-papers/EXCHANGE%20RATE%20CONVERGENCE%20IN%20CARICOM.pdf|title=Exchange Rate Convergence in CARICOM|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==CARICOM Development Fund==\n\nOne of the institutions and regimes created to give life to the regional integration movement through the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, is the CARICOM Development Fund (CDF).

The signing of the Agreement Relating to the Operations of the Fund in July 2008, followed years of negotiations by CARICOM Member States regarding the principles, size and structure of a regional development fund.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nThere was a sense of achievement when the agreement was finally signed and technicians employed by the CDF got down to the task of making the mechanism operational. In an interview, CDF Chief Executive Officer Ambassador Lorne McDonnough said \u201cThe CDF start-up team was always confident it would meet the projected launch date....\u201d Despite this confidence he admitted that \u201c...along the way there were always the glitches and frustrating delays that called for an extra dose of perseverance as well as the need to step back and revisit the problem with a fresh resolve\u201d. Ambassador McDonnough noted that heightened expectations and the desire to see the CDF operational in the shortest possible time, meant that Member States sometimes underestimated the work which had to be done to make the CDF ready for full operations.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nNotwithstanding all the challenges, on 24 August 2009, in keeping with expectations, the CDF officially opened its doors. This was achieved after nine months of feverish effort by the start-up staff to put systems in place to allow for the receipt of requests for loans and grants.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nThe CDF has 12 members: Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts & Nevis, Saint Vincent & the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad & Tobago.<ref name=\"CDF.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caricomdevelopmentfund.org/website/|title=CARICOM Development Fund website|access-date=2014-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725115815/http://www.caricomdevelopmentfund.org/website/|archive-date=2014-07-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===CDF governance===\n\nThe CDF, as established in the agreement, has its own legal identity but is linked to CARICOM through several Ministerial Councils.

In 2009 the CDF was capitalised at US$79.9 million. It was envisaged that by the end of the 2009 member states would have contributed approximately US$87 million. The CDF also has the remit to raise a further US$130 million from donors and friendly states.<ref name=\"CDF another brick\"/>\n\nThe CDF also benefited in 2009 from technical assistance grants of US$149,000 from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and \u20ac834,000 from the European Union (EU) Institutional Support Facility in addition to a 2009 contribution of \u20ac300,000 signalling the start of a closer relationship between the Government of Finland and CARICOM.

A project was commissioned in 2003 by the CARICOM Secretariat with a grant from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The object of the project was to support CARICOM in its efforts to establish an effective regional regime for Public Procurement which would facilitate the full implementation of the CSME and to participate effectively in external trade negotiations relating to Public Procurement.  The project comprised three main components.  Component 1 \u2013 National Government Procurement Frameworks: Analysis, Comparison and Recommended Improvements; Component 2 \u2013 Collection and Analysis of Government Procurement Statistics; and Component 3 \u2013 Recommendations for a Regional Best-practice Regime for Government Procurement.<ref name=\"CSME and Procurement\">{{cite web|url=http://roselawcaribbean.com/csme-procurement/|title=CSME and Procurement|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAltogether, the outputs of the project informed the preparation of the first draft of the Framework Regional Integration Policy on Public Procurement (FRIP).<ref name=\"regional integration of public procurement\"/> The First Draft of the Community Policy on Public Procurement was developed and disseminated to Member States for review in 2005. By April 2006 the Second Draft was finalized.<ref name=\"CSME and Procurement\"/>  In 2011, the Fourth Draft, which reflects the recommended amendments to the Third Draft, was adopted.<ref name=\"regional integration of public procurement\"/> The proposed policy now called the Framework for Regional Integration of Public Procurement (FRIPP) is in its fifth draft stage.<ref name=\"CSME and Procurement\"/>\n\nAmong the findings of the 2003 project were that:<ref name=\"CSME and Procurement\"/>\n\n*competitive public procurement regimes in the CARICOM Member States are in a disarray and dysfunctional; Public Procurement accounts for a significant percentage of public expenditure\n*the current legislation governing procurement in CARICOM Member States is made up of poorly coordinated and outdated enactments, regulations and decrees\n*the weakness of legislation and/or their enforcement breeds many abusive and manipulative practices in public procurement\n*enforcement of procurement rules is extremely weak and sometimes non-existent due to the absence of a single regulatory authority\n*the rights of bidders are not adequately protected; capacity to conduct procurement is extremely weak\n*Public Procurement is severely under-developed and rated as high risk\n*internal and external procurement controls are inadequate\n*procurement related corruption is a major problem\n*due to the small size of individual economies, the private sector actively seeks public procurement opportunities, albeit with little or no confidence in the integrity of the public procurement system\n\nThe general conclusion was that the present procurement regimes are counter productive towards the efforts of CSME. The dismal picture painted by the findings of the CARICOM research project demonstrated the dire need for comprehensive procurement reform. One of the significant recommendations of the project was that the proposed regional and domestic public procurement legislative and policy reforms should be based on the UNCITRAL Model Law.<ref name=\"CSME and Procurement\"/>\n\nBetween April and June 2014, a consultancy conducted by Analysis Mason Ltd. was conducted in 13 Caricom countries (excepting Haiti and the Bahamas)<ref name=\"CARICOM kicks off govt procurement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres207_14.jsp|title=CARICOM Kicks Off Government Procurement Consultations|access-date=2014-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103948/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres207_14.jsp|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> and provided the CARICOM Secretariat and its Member States with the recommendations on the required Information Technology (IT) infrastructure for the establishment of a fully functioning Regional Integration Electronic Public Procurement System (RIEPPS).<ref name=\"govt contracts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestkittsnevisobserver.com/2014/09/05/govt-contracts.html|title=New System To Allow Regional Bidding For Gov\u2019t Contracts|access-date=2014-10-06|archive-url=https://archive.today/20141006031932/http://www.thestkittsnevisobserver.com/2014/09/05/govt-contracts.html|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe new IT-based system is being proposed whereby businesses in Caricom countries can bid on government contracts in member states. The proposed regionally integrated Government Procurement system would bring further life to the CSME single market component, allowing for an effective means for businesses of CARICOM member states to operate in each other\u2019s countries. The arrangement is being structured in such manner as to allow certain contracts to be retained for national businesses, while others are open to regional bidding processes.<ref name=\"govt contracts\"/>\n\nThe work plan calls for a common regional IT infrastructure, supported by legislative protocols and a business development component that would help to stimulate the intra-regional procurement activities. All of these components are being undertaken simultaneously with a view towards achieving possible implementation by the end of 2014<ref name=\"govt contracts\"/> but certainly by 2016.<ref name=\"benefit from regional procurement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Jamaica-to-benefit-from-regional-procurement-system_17478311|title=Jamaica to benefit from regional procurement system|first=Jamaica Observer|last=Limited|website=Jamaica Observer}}</ref>\n\nThe estimated market for regional procurement is approximately US$17 billion annually among the region of five and a half million people (with the exception of Haiti). The government is one of the biggest single sectors in every economy in Caricom, so one of the possible solutions to the aim of boosting intra-regional trade, and for each country to generate business and create employment, is to open the market for government procurement.<ref name=\"benefit from regional procurement\"/>\n\nA reform of the procurement systems and processes in every country where the project is to be implemented will also be undertaken, as well as the installation of relevant IT hardware and software and the training of required personnel. One of the important hurdles to be overcome for full implementation of the programme will be the need to ensure that every country has legislation that allows transactions of this type to be done electronically.\n\n\u201cMany states up to this point still operate with Finance and Administration Acts, rather than a procurement law. Several of them do have an Electronic Transactions Act, but it may not speak specifically to procurement in the public domain. So, one of the things that CARICOM will be responsible for doing under the project is to prepare the protocol and the supporting implementing law and rules,\u201d explained Ivor Carryl, Programme Manager, Caricom Single Market and Economy, CARICOM Secretariat.<ref name=\"JIS regional procurement\">{{cite web|url=http://jis.gov.jm/regional-procurement-system-established/|title=Regional Procurement System To Be Established - Jamaica Information Service|date=4 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nUnder the CARICOM Regional Integration Electronic Public Procurement System, traders of goods and services will have protection from the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ).<ref name=\"CCJ and public procurement\">{{cite web|url=http://jis.gov.jm/ccj-provide-protection-new-procurement-regime/|title=CCJ to Provide Protection Under New Procurement Regime - Jamaica Information Service|date=1 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ivor Carryl, a Regional public procurement notice board will be created for member states to post their contracts, and where any player feels that unfairness is involved in the award of the contracts, the CCJ can be called on to adjudicate.<ref name=\"CCJ and public procurement\"/>\n\n\u201cIn Article 7, which deals with non-discriminatory, equal treatment and fairness, all of your domestic laws and practices relating to CARICOM, must mirror those provisions,\u201d Carryl told JIS News in an interview.<ref name=\"CCJ and public procurement\"/>\n\n\u201cIf a Jamaican company under the protocol submits a bid, and for some reason he feels aggrieved that the process (the tender evaluation) didn\u2019t go right, he would have the right under the Treaty to challenge the procuring entity, and ask them to explain why he did not win the bid; and he has the right to go to court and challenge the decision,\u201d the CARICOM official added.<ref name=\"CCJ and public procurement\"/>\n\nMr. Carryl explains that under the Regional Procurement Regime, the appeal mechanism has been strengthened, so persons will have easier access in seeking redress.<ref name=\"CCJ and public procurement\"/>\n\n==Single Jurisdiction for Companies==\n\nIn August 2014, CARICOM initiated work towards creating a harmonized framework for companies and other businesses can be established and operate within the CSME. This Single Jurisdiction should ensure that the rules for establishing and operating a business in one country apply throughout the CSME.<ref name=\"CARICOM Moves to Harmonize Business Rules in CSME\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres205_14.jsp|title=CARICOM Moves to Harmonize Business Rules in CSME|access-date=2015-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711005423/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres205_14.jsp|archive-date=2015-07-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nStarting in June 2015, the CARICOM Secretariat began a series of national consultations to discuss the Draft Framework Policy on the Single Jurisdiction.  The aim of the Single Jurisdiction is to create a seamless space for companies can conduct business. When established it would enable businesses, once registered in one participating member state of the CSME, to operate in any other CSME member state without needing to register in that other member state. Thus in essence it will allow businesses to register anywhere within the CSME and operate throughout the Single Market. The creation of the Single Jurisdiction is seen to be crucial to allow for the proper implementation of the Right Establishment under the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas and should be of significant benefit to those exercising this right.<ref name=\"CARICOM Convenes National Consultations on Single Jurisdiction for Companies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2015/pres95_15.jsp|title=CARICOM Convenes National Consultations on Single Jurisdiction for Companies|access-date=2015-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711010810/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2015/pres95_15.jsp|archive-date=2015-07-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007110837/http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=131 Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas]\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Caribbean}}\n*[http://www.sta.uwi.edu/iir/news/theworldtoday/article57.pdf CSME Contingent Rights]\n*[http://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2013/08/24/implementation-of-contingent-rights-protocol-could-lessen-migration-woes-caricom-official/  Implementation of Contingent Rights Protocol could lessen migration woes ] Kaieteur News, August 24, 2013\n*[http://www.caricomstats.org/ CARICOM Statistics] - Statistical information compiled through the CARICOM Secretariat\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051124183315/http://www.radiocaricom.org/ Radio CARICOM]- the voice of the Caribbean Community [https://web.archive.org/web/20060212172618/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres103_04.htm Press Release]\n*[http://csmeonline.org/news/about-the-csme The CSME website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070609083722/http://www.caricomlaw.org/ Caricom Law] - Website and online database of the CARICOM Legislative Drafting Facility (CLDF)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080216075048/http://www.caricomtradesupport.org/ Caricom Trade Support Programme] - Government of Trinidad and Tobago\n*[http://www.pancap.org/ PANCAP] Pan Caribbean Partnership Against HIV/AIDS\n*[http://www.sice.oas.org/TPD/CAR/MatxMarch16_2005.asp Establishment of the CSME: Status of the Key Elements] - Summary Table of the status of the various member states in relation to the treaty obligations\n*[http://www.talkcsme.com/ CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME)]\n*- blog which discusses the impact of the CSME on Caricom member nations\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231600/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/Business/html/20061026T190000-0500_114553_OBS_HOW_VIABLE_IS_A_SINGLE_CARIBBEAN_CURRENCY____PART___.asp How viable is a single Caribbean currency?

In 1938 an Act of the [[New South Wales Parliament]] created a \"City of Greater Newcastle\", incorporating 11 municipalities into one local government area, including Waratah. Until it was subdivided by Scholey and the land put up for sale, it was largely semi-forested scrub and fields. However, St Andrew's Church at North Waratah was opened as early as 1861, and fell within the [[Church of England]] [[Diocese of Newcastle, New South Wales]]. In 1924 a new church was dedicated at St.Andrews, Mayfield, to replace the aging colonial church.\n\nMayfield was originally a pleasant garden suburb on the outskirts of Newcastle, and by 1901 contained a Roman Catholic monastery, and several fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansions belonging to prominent businessmen and lawyers. Of note, there was N.B.Creer (three times Mayor of Waratah), [[Charles Upfold]] (Soap Manufacturer) built a large mansion on a piece of land in Crebert Street, North Waratah (now called Mayfield), given to him by his friend John Scholey. It was later sold to [[Arnott's Biscuits Holdings|biscuit manufacturer]], William Arnott who named the mansion \"Arnott Holme\". Arnott then sold it in 1898 to Isaac Winn, owner of the big Newcastle department store. Winn renamed the mansion \"Winn Court\"<ref>Newcastle Morning Herald dated Saturday 13 November 1965</ref> and John Scholey's \"Mayfield House\", for which the sandstone was brought from England. [[BHP]] constructed, in the early 1920s, a very fine mansion in Crebert Street (named after Peter Crebert [1825-1895], an immigrant from [[Wiesbaden]] in [[Germany]]), with extensive gardens, for their General Manager. Now privately owned and named The Bella Vista, it is used as a weddings and functions centre.\n\n=== Arrival of industry ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nIn 1896, the [[BHP|Broken Hill Proprietary Company]] acquired land on the river shore at Mayfield East for [[smelter]]s, and in 1910 it was decided that they would construct here a major steel works and foundries, with a 350-ton [[blast furnace]] and three 65-ton open hearth steel furnaces, a bloom mill and heavy rail mill, with by-product [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens to supply coke for the blast furnaces. The advantages of the site played a major part in this decision: for transport both rail and shipping already existed, and they had close proximity to the Newcastle and [[South Maitland coalfields]], (the coal consumption in 1947 was 30,000 tons each week). The task of reclaiming swampland at Port Waratah for the main site began in January 1913, and the New South Wales Government undertook to [[dredge]] and maintain a river channel between the works and the sea, {{convert|500|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|25|ft|m}} deep at low water to the steelwork's basin and wharves. Altogether the company acquired {{convert|1225|acre|km2}}. The blast furnace commenced operations in March 1915.\n\nOther industries followed, such as galvanized iron manufacturers [[Lysaght (Australian company)|John Lysaght & Co.]], (1921), Rylands Bros (wire, nails, rivets, bolts, springs etc.), tubemakers Stewarts & Lloyds (1934), and the Newcastle Chemical Co, (1940), and sited themselves adjacent to the steel works. The result was pollution which began to affect Mayfield which lost its fashionable status. The housing erected during and after [[World War I]] was overwhelmingly for those with employment in the heavy industries. A large proportion of the Steel Works closed down in September 1999 which had a knock on effect with adjacent industries, several of whom were now struggling with developing world markets. The remaining steel mills which are Australian Tube Mills, Newcastle Wire Mill and Rod Mill remain in operation to this day under the company of Liberty Steel.\n\n== Today ==\nToday Mayfield is the most culturally diverse suburb in Newcastle and home to over 14,000 residents from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Maitland_Rd_0.JPG|Shops on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Maitland_Rd_1.JPG|Shopping district along Maitland Road\nImage:Maitland_Rd_2.JPG|Shopping district along Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_History_Mosiac1.jpg|History of Mayfield mosaic located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_History_Mosiac2.jpg|A closeup of the History of Mayfield mosaic located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_Hotel.JPG|The Mayfield Hotel on Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_Industrial.jpg|Smorgon Steel works located in the residential area of Mayfield\nFile:Mayfield Catholic Church St Columban's.jpg|Mayfield Catholic Church of St Columban's.\nImage:Mayfield_Map_Mosiac1.jpg|A mosaic map of Mayfield located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_old_house1.JPG|''Winahra'' is a grand old Victorian style house located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Highfield Street.\nImage:Mayfield_old_house2.JPG|A well maintained old house located on Highfield Street\nImage:Mayfield_Streetscape.jpg|A view south towards Merewether Heights, overlooking residential housing\nImage:Mayfield_Woolworths.jpg|Woolworths Supermarket, Mayfield\nImage:Texas_Street.jpg|Texas Street, a typical residential street in Mayfield\nImage:Webb_Park.JPG|Webb Park is located on the corner of Waratah and Hanbury Streets\nImage:New_Architecture.JPG|This set of townhouses was built as retirement homes for the local convent.

In 1938 an Act of the [[New South Wales Parliament]] created a \"City of Greater Newcastle\", incorporating 11 municipalities into one local government area, including Waratah. Until it was subdivided by Scholey and the land put up for sale, it was largely semi-forested scrub and fields. However, St Andrew's Church at North Waratah was opened as early as 1861, and fell within the [[Church of England]] [[Diocese of Newcastle, New South Wales]]. In 1924 a new church was dedicated at St.Andrews, Mayfield, to replace the aging colonial church.\n\nMayfield was originally a pleasant garden suburb on the outskirts of Newcastle, and by 1901 contained a Roman Catholic monastery, and several fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansions belonging to prominent businessmen and lawyers. Of note, there was N.B.Creer (three times Mayor of Waratah), [[Charles Upfold]] (Soap Manufacturer) built a large mansion on a piece of land in Crebert Street, North Waratah (now called Mayfield), given to him by his friend John Scholey. It was later sold to [[Arnott's Biscuits Holdings|biscuit manufacturer]], William Arnott who named the mansion ''\"Arnott Holme\"''. Arnott then sold it in 1898 to Isaac Winn, owner of the big Newcastle department store. Winn renamed the mansion ''\"Winn Court\"''<ref>Newcastle Morning Herald dated Saturday 13 November 1965</ref> and John Scholey's ''\"Mayfield House\"'', for which the sandstone was brought from England. [[BHP]] constructed, in the early 1920s, a very fine mansion in Crebert Street (named after Peter Crebert [1825-1895], an immigrant from [[Wiesbaden]] in [[Germany]]), with extensive gardens, for their General Manager.

{"title_page": "Typhoon", "text_new": "\n\n\nWithin the northwestern Pacific, there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year. Like any tropical cyclone, there are few main requirements for typhoon formation and development: (1) sufficiently warm [[sea surface temperature]]s, (2) atmospheric instability, (3) high [[relative humidity|humidity]] in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, (4) enough [[Coriolis effect]] to develop a [[low-pressure area|low pressure center]], (5) a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and (6) a low vertical [[wind shear]]. While the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms do occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the [[subtropical ridge]] towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of [[Japan]]. The Philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls, with [[China]] and Japan being impacted slightly less. Some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region, with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives.

For organizational purposes, the northern Pacific Ocean is divided into three regions: the eastern (North America to [[140th meridian west|140\u00b0W]]), central (140\u00b0W to 180\u00b0), and western (180\u00b0 to 100\u00b0E). The [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] (RSMC) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in [[Japan]], with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in [[Hawaii]] (the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]), the [[Philippines]] and [[Hong Kong]]. While the RSMC names each system, the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year.<ref name=\"HCT\">{{cite web | title = What is the difference between a hurricane, a cyclone, and a typhoon? | work = OCEAN FACTS | publisher = [[National Ocean Service]]  | url = http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/cyclone.html | accessdate = 2016-12-24 }}</ref>\n\nWithin the northwestern Pacific, there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year. Like any tropical cyclone, there are few main requirements for typhoon formation and development: (1) sufficiently warm [[sea surface temperature]]s, (2) atmospheric instability, (3) high [[relative humidity|humidity]] in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, (4) enough [[Coriolis effect]] to develop a [[low-pressure area|low pressure center]], (5) a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and (6) a low vertical [[wind shear]]. While the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms do occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the [[subtropical ridge]] towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of [[Japan]]. The Philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls, with [[China]] and Japan being impacted slightly less. Some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region, with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives. [[Taiwan]] has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest Pacific [[tropical cyclone basin]]s.\n<!--\n<ref name=\"AOML\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A1.html|title=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|accessdate=2009-10-19}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cawcr.gov.au/bmrc/pubs/tcguide/globa_guide_intro.htm|title=Global Guide to Tropical Cyclone Forecasting|accessdate=2009-10-19 | work = (Holland 1993). # Holland, G.J.
