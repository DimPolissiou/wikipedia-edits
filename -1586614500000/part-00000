The character was introduced by executive producer [[Leonard Lewis]] and appeared initially from 1993 to 1999, when Palmer opted to leave. In 2002 executive producer [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] brought the character back for a special spin-off show. She returned to ''EastEnders'' as a full-time character in April 2008, reintroduced by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]]. Palmer took maternity leave in 2010 and Bianca left the series in January 2011. The character returned in December 2011 after Palmer signed a \"working mums\" contract, which granted her leave from the soap between April and November 2012. The actress quit ''EastEnders'' in 2014 and Bianca departed in September that year. Palmer reprised the role in 2019 and 2020 for two respective guest stints.\n\nDuring her first run on the show during the 1990s, she was known for her bizarre sense of style, her sharp tongue, fiery temper and for screaming \"Rickaaaaaaay!\"<ref>\"{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7068667.stm|title=Owen to join Palmer in EastEnders|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=30 October 2007|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> at her husband. Bianca has been featured in storylines including affairs, feuds, bereavements, family problems, spina bifida and abortion; two problematic marriages to [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) \u2013 the first of which ended after it transpired that she had a previous affair with her mother's boyfriend [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]); her troubled and dysfunctional reconciliation with her estranged biological father [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]); her friendship with [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]); discovering her 15-year-old stepdaughter, [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), is being sexually abused by her finac\u00e9, [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), and his subsequent arrest for paedophilia; and forming a relationship with [[Terry Spraggan]] ([[Terry Alderton]]).\n\n==Storylines==\n===1993\u20131999===\nBianca arrives with her family, mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), Carol's partner [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan Jackson]] ([[Howard Antony]]), and her half-siblings [[Robbie Jackson]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]), [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) and [[Billie Jackson]] ([[Devon Anderson]]).  She initially works at her uncle [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) fish and chip shop before becoming the market assistant of [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay Kapoor]] ([[Deepak Verma]]). Later she runs her own clothing stall on Bridge Street market. Bianca has a short relationship with an older man, [[Richard Cole (EastEnders)|Richard Cole]] ([[Ian Reddington]]), but he swiftly dumps her when he grows bored and Bianca gets revenge by harassing him with [[prank]]s and stealing his credit card.<ref name=\"20years\"/> [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]) then enjoys mutual flirtation with Bianca until Carol informs David that Bianca is his daughter. Horrified, David promptly keeps his distance, and Bianca remains unaware of their biological relationship.<ref name=\"who\"/> Bianca enters into a relationship with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and they move into a bedsit together. Bianca spends much time clubbing with her childhood friend [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]) and Ricky starts an affair with Bianca's other childhood friend [[Natalie Evans|Natalie Price]] ([[Lucy Speed]]). When Bianca discovers the affair, she breaks up with Ricky and drives Natalie from Walford. One night an intoxicated Bianca is nearly assaulted. She is rescued by David and when she tries to kiss him, he confesses that he is her father. Bianca is left stunned and humiliated. Initially she feels hostile and resentful over David's absence for the majority of her life. Eventually, Bianca has a change of heart and comes to accept David as her father, becoming keen to bond with him. The relationship is further complicated, when during July 1995 David confides in the Samaritans charity (unbeknownst to any of his family) that he still feels sexually attracted to Bianca despite the knowledge that he is her biological father. A case of [[Genetic Sexual Attraction|GSA]], this was one of ''EastEnders''{{'}} most controversial and daring storylines at this point in the show's history. There is further tension when Bianca makes David uncomfortable by reconciling with and dating his stepbrother Ricky again. Bianca is confused by David's unexplained strange and occasionally hostile behaviour. David never admits to Bianca the truth behind his initial feelings towards her, but she and David eventually bond naturally as a father and daughter.<ref name=\"20years\"/>\n\nRicky and Bianca reunite and get engaged but she has sex with [[Lenny Wallace]] ([[Des Coleman]]), but soon regrets it when she fears she is pregnant by him. It's a false alarm, but she realises how much Ricky means to her, so she marries him. She becomes pregnant, but a prenatal scan shows her unborn child has spina bifida and hydrocephalus. Distraught, Bianca has an abortion, which strains her marriage. Ricky learns of her infidelity with Lenny after a [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]] scare. Ricky considers ending their marriage, but Bianca convinces him to give her another chance and she becomes pregnant again. She gives birth to baby [[Liam Butcher|Liam]] on Christmas Day in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], helped by her enemy [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), her best friend Tiffany's volatile husband. Carol returns to [[Albert Square]] with her new fianc\u00e9 [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]), unaware that Bianca had a past relationship with him when she was underage (although Dan was unaware of this fact). Bianca and Dan rekindle their affair behind Carol and Ricky's backs, until Carol discovers she is pregnant by Dan. Bianca and Ricky plan to move to [[Manchester]] so Bianca can attend fashion college there. After finding an old photo of Bianca and Dan together, Carol demands to know their history. Dan tells Carol they had a romance years ago and swears on his unborn child's life that it's all over, but Bianca confesses when questioned and is disowned by Carol. Bianca leaves for Manchester after confessing to Ricky that she no longer loves him.<ref name=\"20years\"/>\n\n===\"Ricky & Bianca\"===\n\nIn the two-part special episode, \"[[Ricky & Bianca]]\", Ricky visits Bianca in Manchester in 2002, to discuss Liam. Bianca has been expelled from university and is working in a nightclub. Struggling to support Liam, Bianca gets caught up in a plan to steal \u00a350,000 from her drug-dealing boss, Vince. Ricky persuades her to return the money but Vince catches them and forces them to become his drug couriers. He sets them up, the dealers turn violent, and Bianca and Ricky narrowly escape when armed police raid the establishment. Fleeing, Ricky and Bianca spend the night together in a hotel room and decide to reunite. Ricky breaks the news to his fianc\u00e9e Cassie, who refuses to let him go and tries to convince Bianca that she'll be bored with Ricky and to give Ricky custody of Liam. Bianca decides that this is right, and Ricky looks on heartbroken as she hitches a ride in a car and departs for a destination unknown.<ref name=\"r&b\">{{cite episode |title=EastEnders: Ricky & Bianca|series=EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]]|airdate=13 May 2002}}</ref>\n\n===Off-screen events (2002\u20132008)===\n\nOff-screen, unbeknownst to Ricky, Bianca is pregnant.

Bianca acts as stepmother to Nathan's daughter [[Whitney Dean|Whitney]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), but Nathan is killed in a traffic accident. Bianca becomes Whitney's guardian and gives birth to a daughter, [[Tiffany Butcher|Tiffany]] ([[Maisie Smith]]), named after her deceased best friend, but struggles financially. She becomes pregnant again during a brief relationship with [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]). Bianca meets [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), who supports her through her pregnancy and adopts Ray's son, [[Morgan Butcher|Morgan Jackson-King]] (Devon Higgs), when he is born. Tony appears to be a good father figure to her children; however, he is a paedophile. Tony [[Child grooming|grooms]] a 12-year-old Whitney and they begin a sexual relationship. After giving birth to Morgan, Liam returns to live with Bianca when Ricky begins dating a woman named [[Melinda (EastEnders)|Melinda]] ([[Siobhan Hayes]]), who does not like children. Tony and Whitney's relationship continues secretly until Tony is imprisoned for assaulting a boy who propositions Whitney.\n\n===2008\u20132014===\n\nBianca is evicted from her home and her children are taken into care. Bianca moves in with her grandmother [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) in Walford and with Ricky's help, she gets her children back and a waitress job. She rebuffs Ricky's declaration of love, deciding to stand by imprisoned lover Tony. When he is released, Tony resumes his affair with Whitney while Bianca wants to set a date for their wedding. He eventually agrees after winding down his affair with Whitney, to whom he is no longer attracted. Whitney tells Bianca about their relationship, just as she thinks that she and Tony will run away together. There is a massive row and Tony leaves but he is arrested by the police on suspicion of rape of a minor. Bianca and Whitney's relationship is tested while they deal with what has happened but they eventually bond again and Bianca supports Whitney through Tony's trial.\n\nA [[DNA paternity testing|DNA paternity test]], confirms that Ricky is Tiffany's father. Bianca slowly realises she is in love with him, but her attempt to rekindle their romance is ruined when Ricky announces his engagement to [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]). Knowing Sam is evading a prison sentence, Bianca reports her whereabouts and Sam is arrested. A rift forms between Bianca and Ricky when the truth is revealed. However, Bianca's discovery that Sam is cheating on Ricky ends the engagement and Bianca and Ricky reunite, when Ricky accepts her marriage proposal. The couple remarry. During the ceremony, Carol arrives and brawls with Bianca but they settle their differences and begin to rebuild their relationship. When Bianca's younger brother, Billie, dies from [[alcohol poisoning]], Carol is distraught. She is comforted by Billie's friend, [[Connor Stanley]] ([[Arinze Kene]]), and they begin an affair, while Connor is also dating Whitney. Bianca vows to remove Connor from her family's life and attacks Connor, leaving him hospitalised and eventually turns herself in to the police, refusing bail. She is sentenced to six months imprisonment. Bianca is released for Christmas and is devastated when Pat dies from [[pancreatic cancer]]. When Bianca discovers Ricky had sex with [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]) in her absence, they separate and he leaves Walford. Bianca struggles as a single parent and gets into debt. Owing money, Bianca steals from a market trader in desperation, but she is caught and sent back to prison. In prison, she passes a hair and beauty course and on her release, is offered a trial at [[Tanya Branning|Tanya Cross]]' ([[Jo Joyner]]) salon. However, Bianca struggles to cope and breaks down when she is alone.\n\nBianca and [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) form a friendship and set up a market stall together. Liam plays truant from school and Bianca worries when the police tell her she may face prison again if Liam does not return. Bianca discovers that Liam is involved in a mugging and that he has some dubious new friends. When Liam does not come home, she goes to an estate to confront the gang and collect Liam  but he decides to stay with the gang and when he does come home, Bianca locks him in his room to stop him seeing the gang. She seeks advice from [[Ava Hartman]] ([[Clare Perkins]]), whose son [[Dexter Hartman|Dexter]] (Khali Best) used to be in a gang. Liam returns to the gang and eventually they are arrested and released on police bail. They blame Liam and he is stabbed but is not seriously injured. When Bianca lets Liam stay at home alone, Kane sneaks in and invites Liam back to the gang. Bianca finds them as Kane is attacking Liam and attacks Kane; he is arrested. Bianca allows Liam to stay with his father. When Bianca, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) break into Ian's restaurant, Shirley accidentally starts a fire. Bianca worries that she could go back to prison, and tells Whitney, who has been blamed for it. Jean tells Ian what happened and Ian agrees not to involve the police on the condition that Tiffany and Bobby are no longer friends.\n\nWhen Carol sees that Bianca is still interested in fashion, she arranges for her to attend a course in Manchester. During this time Bianca's father, David, returns and moves in. When Bianca returns, she surprises her family by announcing that her new boyfriend, [[Terry Spraggan]] ([[Terry Alderton]]), and his children, [[TJ Spraggan]] (George Sargeant) and [[Rosie Spraggan]] (Jerzey Swingler), are moving in. Bianca is devastated when Carol learns that she has [[breast cancer]]. Carol and David get engaged and Bianca learns that she has not inherited Carol's faulty cancer gene and supports her mother throughout her cancer. She ends her relationship with Terry due to the jealousy of his former wife, [[Nikki Spraggan]] (Rachel Wilde), and David leaves before marrying Carol. Bianca and Terry continue their relationship in secret and she learns that he is planning to move out of London. Terry and Bianca reunite, and at the last minute, Bianca gives Liam and Whitney her blessing to stay with Carol before taking Tiffany and Morgan to live in [[Milton Keynes]].\n\nThe following year, Robbie moves with his son [[Sami Jackson]] (Shiven Shankar) to Milton Keynes near Bianca. Bianca is invited to Whitney's wedding to [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) the following year, however, she cannot attend and Tiffany and Morgan attend instead. Whitney later visits Bianca after her engagement to [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) ends. Months later, Bianca is informed that Abi has died, but cannot attend. When Tiffany returns to Walford, she reveals that Bianca has tried to kill herself, but later confesses that she is lying and actually feels neglected by Bianca and Terry; Bianca consequently agrees to Tiffany living with Whitney. When Tiffany becomes involved in a drug ring, Sonia informs Bianca, who is unable to return to help.\n\n=== 2019\u22122020 ===\nBianca returns to Walford for Whitney's wedding to [[Callum \"Halfway\" Highway]] (Tony Clay) and wakes up in a police cell with Kat after a night out. Bianca mentions she has recently been released from prison. When [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Max Bowden) arrives at the venue and reveals the truth about his affair with Callum, Bianca threatens him. She then tries to discourage Whitney from marrying Callum but Whitney, albeit doubtful, is determined. Whilst at the wedding reception, Bianca witnesses a man giving Tiffany a kiss on the cheek and threatens him to stay away. She attempts to make amends with Tiffany, who is upset with her for her absence. When Bianca sees Whitney getting drunk at The Queen Vic, she suggests that she attends her honeymoon alone to take her mind off Callum. Bianca then arranges a spa day with Tiffany, and when she sees the man from the wedding again, she threatens him to stay away, revealing him to be Tony's son, [[Leo King (EastEnders)|Leo King]] (Tom Wells). Leo reveals that Bianca inherited his grandmother's money and threatens to hurt Whitney and Tiffany if Bianca does not give him the money. After spending time with Sonia and Robbie, Bianca leaves Walford for a holiday for Tiffany. Bianca later returns off-screen to console Whitney after she learns Leo, who she has been dating, is Tony's son.\n\n== Creation ==\n=== Background ===\nIn his book ''EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration'', ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] describes 1994 as a \"historic\" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April, a third weekly episode was introduced.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among them were the Jackson family, created by [[Tony McHale]]:<ref name=\"All of Me\" /> mother [[Carol Jackson|Carol]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]), her four children, Bianca (Patsy Palmer), [[Robbie Jackson|Robbie]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]), [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), and [[Billie Jackson|Billie]] ([[Devon Anderson]]), as well as Carol's partner [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan Jackson]] ([[Howard Antony]]). Though Carol and Alan were not initially married in the serial, and though Alan was only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. It later transpired that [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]) was Bianca's father.\n\nVarious members of the family began to appear sporadically from November 1993 onwards, but in episodes that aired early in 1994, the Jacksons moved from Walford Towers, a block of flats, to the soap's focal setting of [[Albert Square]].

At the end of the class, Palmer was asked by McHale to do something so Anna Scher asked her to improvise a monologue based on the line \"I can't believe you just said that.\" The next day Scher contacted Palmer to say she had been offered an audition.

She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family\".<ref name=\"controversial\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/13/eastenders.television|title=Dark days in Albert Square |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Aida |last=Edemariam|date=13 September 2008|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> They pitched the idea to [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]], controller of BBC drama production, who said that \"It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most ''EastEnders'' stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for.\" However, paedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk.<ref name=\"controversial\"/> Diederick Santer commented, \"We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show.\"<ref name=\"controversial\"/> It has been noted in the media that paedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although ''EastEnders'' had broached it in 2001 with [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and her abusive uncle [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry]] ([[Michael Elphick]]), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult.<ref name=\"controversial\"/>\n\nYorke was initially unconvinced at the Jackson paedophilia storyline proposal. He  commented to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2008, \"My standpoint has always been that there has to be a good editorial justification. If it's just entertainment, or just sensation, or just the bogeyman in this case, then I don't think that's a good enough reason.\"<ref name=\"controversial\"/> However, Yorke was convinced by Santer who opined that \"it would be a talking point that could truly educate and inform\".<ref name=\"controversial\"/> It was decided that Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney would be the character that Bianca's boyfriend Tony groomed for sex. According to Bianca's backstory, Tony was \"a Mancunian who [...] had one day given Bianca a lift home, three years before her return to Walford, and noticed, standing in the hallway, 12-year-old Whitney in her pyjamas.\" ''EastEnders'' worked closely with [[NSPCC]] when devising the storyline. The NSPCC's statistics suggested that 11% of children under 16 experienced \"sexual abuse by a person known but unrelated to them, often a boyfriend or girlfriend, while only 5% have been interfered with by someone unknown or whom they had just met; 1% by a parent or carer; and fewer than 1% by a professional in a position of trust\". Thus it was decided that Whitney, unrelated to Tony in any biological sense, would be his victim and that Tony deliberately targeted the Jackson family, wooing Bianca, in order to groom Whitney. This idea, according to a BBC researcher, was based on real life cases.<ref name=\"controversial\"/> The truth was revealed to Bianca in an episode that aired in December 2008, when Whitney confessed to her stepmother, professing to love Tony. There followed Tony's imprisonment and a court case in 2009. Palmer was widely praised by critics for her performance during the reveal episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TV+CRITIC%3a+Taking+on+big+issues.-a0190453951|title=Taking on big issues.|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date=13 December 2008|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> The storyline prompted an increase in calls to the children's help-line, [[ChildLine]].

She commented in 2000, \"It makes me feel bad. I sometimes think I should go back [to ''EastEnders''] for everyone else's sake.\"<ref name=\"life\"/> When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the ''[[Birmingham Post|Birmingham Evening Post]]'' said \"Good riddance!\" She described Bianca as a \"king-sized pain in the backside [...] A screeching and screaming virago with a big mouth and pea-sized brain\" and a \"prize slapper [who] tormented all those whose paths [she] crossed.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-60218751|title= Good riddance!; Bianca bows out of Albert Square in EastEnders tonight|work=[[Birmingham Post|Birmingham Evening Post]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] | date = 10 September 1999| accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Chris Barker carried out television research on post-transmission perspectives of [[British Asian]] teenage viewers of ''EastEnders'', using the character Bianca as one of the focus points. He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender. The males regarded Bianca as a \"saucy cow\", with implications of unacceptable assertiveness in women. They disliked that Ricky was pushed around by Bianca and treated as a subordinate by her friends. The author comments that \"such a relationship appears to these boys as the world turned upside down.\" Girls also viewed Bianca unfavourably in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \"girl-culture\" \u2013 attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public \u2013 manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a \"nice person\" in contrast to Bianca, \"she can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]\", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chris Barker|title= Global Television: An Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri/page/144 144]|quote=eastenders bianca natalie.|year=1997|publisher=Oxford: Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-20150-2}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote_box |width=35% |align=right|quote=\"Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game.

In 2002 executive producer [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] brought the character back for a special spin-off show. She returned to ''EastEnders'' as a full-time character in April 2008, reintroduced by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]].

Palmer reprised the role in 2019 and 2020 for two respective guest stints.\n\nDuring her first run on the show during the 1990s, she was known for her bizarre sense of style, her sharp tongue, fiery temper and for screaming \"Rickaaaaaaay!\"<ref>\"{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7068667.stm|title=Owen to join Palmer in EastEnders|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=30 October 2007|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> at her husband.

Bianca spends much time clubbing with her childhood friend [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]) and Ricky starts an affair with Bianca's other childhood friend [[Natalie Evans|Natalie Price]] ([[Lucy Speed]]). When Bianca discovers the affair, she breaks up with Ricky and drives Natalie from Walford. One night an intoxicated Bianca is nearly assaulted. She is rescued by David and when she tries to kiss him, he confesses that he is her father. Bianca is left stunned and humiliated. Initially she feels hostile and resentful over David's absence for the majority of her life. Eventually, Bianca has a change of heart and comes to accept David as her father, becoming keen to bond with him. The relationship is further complicated, when during July 1995 David confides in the Samaritans charity (unbeknownst to any of his family) that he still feels sexually attracted to Bianca despite the knowledge that he is her biological father. A case of [[Genetic Sexual Attraction|GSA]], this was one of ''EastEnders''{{'}} most controversial and daring storylines at this point in the show's history. There is further tension when Bianca makes David uncomfortable by reconciling with and dating his stepbrother Ricky again. Bianca is confused by David's unexplained strange and occasionally hostile behaviour. David never admits to Bianca the truth behind his initial feelings towards her, but she and David eventually bond naturally as a father and daughter.<ref name=\"20years\"/>\n\nRicky and Bianca reunite and get engaged but she has sex with [[Lenny Wallace]] ([[Des Coleman]]), but soon regrets it when she fears she is pregnant by him. It's a false alarm, but she realises how much Ricky means to her, so she marries him. She becomes pregnant, but a prenatal scan shows her unborn child has spina bifida and hydrocephalus. Distraught, Bianca has an abortion, which strains her marriage. Ricky learns of her infidelity with Lenny after a [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]] scare. Ricky considers ending their marriage, but Bianca convinces him to give her another chance and she becomes pregnant again. She gives birth to baby [[Liam Butcher|Liam]] on Christmas Day in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], helped by her enemy [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), her best friend Tiffany's volatile husband. Carol returns to [[Albert Square]] with her new fianc\u00e9 [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]), unaware that Bianca had a past relationship with him when she was underage (although Dan was unaware of this fact). Bianca and Dan rekindle their affair behind Carol and Ricky's backs, until Carol discovers she is pregnant by Dan. Bianca and Ricky plan to move to [[Manchester]] so Bianca can attend fashion college there. After finding an old photo of Bianca and Dan together, Carol demands to know their history. Dan tells Carol they had a romance years ago and swears on his unborn child's life that it's all over, but Bianca confesses when questioned and is disowned by Carol.

After giving birth to Morgan, Liam returns to live with Bianca when Ricky begins dating a woman named [[Melinda (EastEnders)|Melinda]] ([[Siobhan Hayes]]), who does not like children. Tony and Whitney's relationship continues secretly until Tony is imprisoned for assaulting a boy who propositions Whitney.\n\n===2008\u20132014===\n\nBianca is evicted from her home and her children are taken into care. Bianca moves in with her grandmother [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) in Walford and with Ricky's help, she gets her children back and a waitress job. She rebuffs Ricky's declaration of love, deciding to stand by imprisoned lover Tony. When he is released, Tony resumes his affair with Whitney while Bianca wants to set a date for their wedding. He eventually agrees after winding down his affair with Whitney, to whom he is no longer attracted. Whitney tells Bianca about their relationship, just as she thinks that she and Tony will run away together. There is a massive row and Tony leaves but he is arrested by the police on suspicion of rape of a minor. Bianca and Whitney's relationship is tested while they deal with what has happened but they eventually bond again and Bianca supports Whitney through Tony's trial.\n\nA [[DNA paternity testing|DNA paternity test]], confirms that Ricky is Tiffany's father. Bianca slowly realises she is in love with him, but her attempt to rekindle their romance is ruined when Ricky announces his engagement to [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]). Knowing Sam is evading a prison sentence, Bianca reports her whereabouts and Sam is arrested. A rift forms between Bianca and Ricky when the truth is revealed. However, Bianca's discovery that Sam is cheating on Ricky ends the engagement and Bianca and Ricky reunite, when Ricky accepts her marriage proposal. The couple remarry. During the ceremony, Carol arrives and brawls with Bianca but they settle their differences and begin to rebuild their relationship. When Bianca's younger brother, Billie, dies from [[alcohol poisoning]], Carol is distraught. She is comforted by Billie's friend, [[Connor Stanley]] ([[Arinze Kene]]), and they begin an affair, while Connor is also dating Whitney. Bianca vows to remove Connor from her family's life and attacks Connor, leaving him hospitalised and eventually turns herself in to the police, refusing bail. She is sentenced to six months imprisonment. Bianca is released for Christmas and is devastated when Pat dies from [[pancreatic cancer]]. When Bianca discovers Ricky had sex with [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]) in her absence, they separate and he leaves Walford. Bianca struggles as a single parent and gets into debt. Owing money, Bianca steals from a market trader in desperation, but she is caught and sent back to prison.

When Liam does not come home, she goes to an estate to confront the gang and collect Liam  but he decides to stay with the gang and when he does come home, Bianca locks him in his room to stop him seeing the gang. She seeks advice from [[Ava Hartman]] ([[Clare Perkins]]), whose son [[Dexter Hartman|Dexter]] (Khali Best) used to be in a gang. Liam returns to the gang and eventually they are arrested and released on police bail. They blame Liam and he is stabbed but is not seriously injured. When Bianca lets Liam stay at home alone, Kane sneaks in and invites Liam back to the gang. Bianca finds them as Kane is attacking Liam and attacks Kane; he is arrested. Bianca allows Liam to stay with his father. When Bianca, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) break into Ian's restaurant, Shirley accidentally starts a fire. Bianca worries that she could go back to prison, and tells Whitney, who has been blamed for it. Jean tells Ian what happened and Ian agrees not to involve the police on the condition that Tiffany and Bobby are no longer friends.\n\nWhen Carol sees that Bianca is still interested in fashion, she arranges for her to attend a course in Manchester. During this time Bianca's father, David, returns and moves in. When Bianca returns, she surprises her family by announcing that her new boyfriend, [[Terry Spraggan]] ([[Terry Alderton]]), and his children, [[TJ Spraggan]] (George Sargeant) and [[Rosie Spraggan]] (Jerzey Swingler), are moving in. Bianca is devastated when Carol learns that she has [[breast cancer]]. Carol and David get engaged and Bianca learns that she has not inherited Carol's faulty cancer gene and supports her mother throughout her cancer. She ends her relationship with Terry due to the jealousy of his former wife, [[Nikki Spraggan]] (Rachel Wilde), and David leaves before marrying Carol.

Bianca is invited to Whitney's wedding to [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) the following year, however, she cannot attend and Tiffany and Morgan attend instead. Whitney later visits Bianca after her engagement to [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) ends. Months later, Bianca is informed that Abi has died, but cannot attend. When Tiffany returns to Walford, she reveals that Bianca has tried to kill herself, but later confesses that she is lying and actually feels neglected by Bianca and Terry; Bianca consequently agrees to Tiffany living with Whitney. When Tiffany becomes involved in a drug ring, Sonia informs Bianca, who is unable to return to help.\n\n=== 2019\u22122020 ===\nBianca returns to Walford for Whitney's wedding to [[Callum Highway]] (Tony Clay) and wakes up in a police cell with Kat after a night out.

She then tries to discourage Whitney from marrying Callum but Whitney, albeit doubtful, is determined. Whilst at the wedding reception, Bianca witnesses a man giving Tiffany a kiss on the cheek and threatens him to stay away. She attempts to make amends with Tiffany, who is upset with her for her absence. When Bianca sees Whitney getting drunk at The Queen Vic, she suggests that she attends her honeymoon alone to take her mind off Callum. Bianca then arranges a spa day with Tiffany, and when she sees the man from the wedding again, she threatens him to stay away, revealing him to be Tony's son, [[Leo King (EastEnders)|Leo King]] (Tom Wells).

Though Carol and Alan were not initially married in the serial, and though Alan was only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. It later transpired that [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]) was Bianca's father.\n\nVarious members of the family began to appear sporadically from November 1993 onwards, but in episodes that aired early in 1994, the Jacksons moved from Walford Towers, a block of flats, to the soap's focal setting of [[Albert Square]].

At the end of the class, Palmer was asked by McHale to do something so Anna Scher asked her to improvise a monologue based on the line \"I can't believe you just said that.\" The next day Scher contacted Palmer to say she had been offered an audition.

The idea for the storyline was conceptualised by writer [[Simon Ashdown]] and other scriptwriters, when they were brainstorming ideas for Bianca's return to ''EastEnders''. They had seen a documentary about homelessness and had been struck by an image of a woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go, a scene that was used to similar effect in Bianca and her family's return episode. They considered the homeless family's predicament and were left pondering \"What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... What if a paedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family\".<ref name=\"controversial\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/13/eastenders.television|title=Dark days in Albert Square |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Aida |last=Edemariam|date=13 September 2008|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> They pitched the idea to [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]], controller of BBC drama production, who said that \"It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most ''EastEnders'' stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for.\" However, paedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk.<ref name=\"controversial\"/> Diederick Santer commented, \"We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show.\"<ref name=\"controversial\"/> It has been noted in the media that paedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although ''EastEnders'' had broached it in 2001 with [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and her abusive uncle [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry]] ([[Michael Elphick]]), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult.<ref name=\"controversial\"/>\n\nYorke was initially unconvinced at the Jackson paedophilia storyline proposal. He  commented to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2008, \"My standpoint has always been that there has to be a good editorial justification. If it's just entertainment, or just sensation, or just the bogeyman in this case, then I don't think that's a good enough reason.\"<ref name=\"controversial\"/> However, Yorke was convinced by Santer who opined that \"it would be a talking point that could truly educate and inform\".<ref name=\"controversial\"/> It was decided that Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney would be the character that Bianca's boyfriend Tony groomed for sex. According to Bianca's backstory, Tony was \"a Mancunian who [...] had one day given Bianca a lift home, three years before her return to Walford, and noticed, standing in the hallway, 12-year-old Whitney in her pyjamas.\" ''EastEnders'' worked closely with [[NSPCC]] when devising the storyline. The NSPCC's statistics suggested that 11% of children under 16 experienced \"sexual abuse by a person known but unrelated to them, often a boyfriend or girlfriend, while only 5% have been interfered with by someone unknown or whom they had just met; 1% by a parent or carer; and fewer than 1% by a professional in a position of trust\". Thus it was decided that Whitney, unrelated to Tony in any biological sense, would be his victim and that Tony deliberately targeted the Jackson family, wooing Bianca, in order to groom Whitney. This idea, according to a BBC researcher, was based on real life cases.<ref name=\"controversial\"/> The truth was revealed to Bianca in an episode that aired in December 2008, when Whitney confessed to her stepmother, professing to love Tony. There followed Tony's imprisonment and a court case in 2009. Palmer was widely praised by critics for her performance during the reveal episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TV+CRITIC%3a+Taking+on+big+issues.-a0190453951|title=Taking on big issues.|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date=13 December 2008|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref> The storyline prompted an increase in calls to the children's help-line, [[ChildLine]]. A ChildLine director, Julie Crossan, said, \"Child sex abuse storylines on programmes such as EastEnders also encourage children to speak out. As a result, more children now understand what sexual abuse is and are increasingly willing to turn to ChildLine for help.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soap's+child+sex+abuse+storyline+prompts+more+victims+to+call.-a0193283716|title=Soap's child sex abuse storyline prompts more victims to call.|work=[[South Wales Echo]]|date=9 February 2009|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked how she felt about the storyline, Palmer commented: \"It would be brilliant if it helped somebody.

She commented in 2000, \"It makes me feel bad. I sometimes think I should go back [to ''EastEnders''] for everyone else's sake.\"<ref name=\"life\"/> When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the ''[[Birmingham Post|Birmingham Evening Post]]'' said \"Good riddance!\" She described Bianca as a \"king-sized pain in the backside [...] A screeching and screaming virago with a big mouth and pea-sized brain\" and a \"prize slapper [who] tormented all those whose paths [she] crossed.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-60218751|title= Good riddance!; Bianca bows out of Albert Square in EastEnders tonight|work=[[Birmingham Post|Birmingham Evening Post]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] | date = 10 September 1999| accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Chris Barker carried out television research on post-transmission perspectives of [[British Asian]] teenage viewers of ''EastEnders'', using the character Bianca as one of the focus points. He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender. The males regarded Bianca as a \"saucy cow\", with implications of unacceptable assertiveness in women. They disliked that Ricky was pushed around by Bianca and treated as a subordinate by her friends. The author comments that \"such a relationship appears to these boys as the world turned upside down.\" Girls also viewed Bianca unfavourably in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \"girl-culture\" \u2013 attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public \u2013 manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a \"nice person\" in contrast to Bianca, \"she can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]\", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chris Barker|title= Global Television: An Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri/page/144 144]|quote=eastenders bianca natalie.|year=1997|publisher=Oxford: Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-20150-2}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote_box |width=35% |align=right|quote=\"Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game.
