This is considered by the band as the best DTH album as of 1988.\n\nThe LP is mainly a [[concept album]] based on the film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' by [[Stanley Kubrick]], which in turn is based on [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|the book of the same name]] by [[Anthony Burgess]], although not all of the songs are about the main theme. The idea of the LP has its origin during a performance of ''A Clockwork Orange'' at [[Theater Bonn]] where the band acted as supernumeraries and as supporting band. Songs 1, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12 are from the play and these are the ones recorded in Schauspielhaus [[Bonn]], other songs were recorded in Berlin and [[Cologne]].\n\nThe songs are linked together by snippets of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] (played by a [[symphony orchestra]]), whose music plays a prominent role in ''A Clockwork Orange'' (especially the 9th symphony). The cover features a famous painting of Beethoven by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]]. The word 'Horrorschau' is a play on the [[Nadsat]] word '[[wikt:Concordance:A Clockwork Orange#H|horrorshow]]', which comes from the [[Russian language|Russian]] \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e (''khorosho'') and means 'good' or 'well'. A couple of Nadsat words are used in songs too.\n\nThe song \"[[Hier kommt Alex]]\" appears as a bonus track in the game ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''.

This is considered by the band as the best DTH album as of 1988.\n\nThe LP is mainly a [[concept album]] based on the film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' by [[Stanley Kubrick]], which in turn is based on [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|the book of the same name]] by [[Anthony Burgess]], although not all of the songs are about the main theme. The idea of the LP has its origin during a performance of ''A Clockwork Orange'' at [[Theater Bonn]] where the band acted as supernumeraries and as supporting band. Songs 1, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12 are from the play and these are the ones recorded in Schauspielhaus [[Bonn]], other songs were recorded in Berlin and [[Cologne]].\n\nThe songs are linked together by snippets of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th Symphony]] (played by a [[symphony orchestra]]), whose music plays a prominent role in ''A Clockwork Orange'' (especially the 9th symphony). The cover features a famous painting of Beethoven by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]]. The word 'Horrorschau' is a play on the [[Nadsat]] word '[[wikt:Concordance:A Clockwork Orange#H|horrorshow]]', which comes from the [[Russian language|Russian]] \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e (''khorosho'') and means 'good' or 'well'. A couple of Nadsat words are used in songs too.\n\nThe song \"[[Hier kommt Alex]]\" appears as a bonus track in the game ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''. It is also included in the European release of ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'', and as a downloadable track on the American version. The song is also available for download in [[Guitar Hero World Tour]].\n\n\"Bye, bye Alex\" is structurally and musically similar to \"Hier kommt Alex\".\n\n==Track listing==\n# \"[[Hier kommt Alex]]\" (\"Here comes [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]]\") (Meurer, Frege) \u2013 3:53\n# \"[[1000 gute Gr\u00fcnde]]\" (\"1000 good reasons\") (Breitkopf, Frege) \u2013 3:33\n# \"Ein Schritt zuviel\" (\"One step too much\") (von Holst, Frege) \u2013 2:22\n# \"Keine Ahnung\" (\"No idea\") (Frege, Frege) \u2013 2:08\n# \"Die Farbe Grau\" (\"The colour [[grey]]\") (Frege, Frege) \u2013 3:52\n# \"180 Grad\" (\"180 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s\") (Meurer, Frege) \u2013 4:33\n# \"[[Mehr davon]]\" (\"More of it\") (von Holst, Frege) \u2013 5:10\n# \"Zahltag\" (\"Payday\") (Breitkopf, Frege) \u2013 2:42\n# \"35 Jahre\" (\"35 years\") (Rohde, Frege, von Holst) \u2013 2:15\n# \"Musterbeispiel\" (\"Prime example\") (Frege, von Holst) \u2013 3:55\n# \"Testbild\" (\"[[Test card]]\", lit. \"Test picture\") (Frege, Frege) \u2013 3:17\n# \"Bye, bye Alex\" (Rohde, Frege) \u2013 2:58\n\n===2007 remastered anniversary edition bonus tracks===\n<ol start=13>\n<li> \"Zum Chef (Sp\u00e4ter Dank)\" (''To the boss (Later gratitude)'') (von Holst, Frege) \u2013 2:10 <small>(from \"[[Hier kommt Alex]]\")</small>\n<li> \"Jo singt (Das Wort zum Sonntag)\" (''Jo sings (The word to Sunday)'') (von Holst, Frege) \u2013 0:46 <small>(from \"Hier kommt Alex\"; \"Das Wort zum Sonntag\" from ''[[Damenwahl]]'')</small>\n<li> \"Liebeslied\" (''Love song'') (Breitkopf, Frege) \u2013 3:50 <small>(from \"Hier kommt Alex\")</small>\n<li> \"Die Farbe Grau\" \u2013 3:51 <small>(from the play \"A Clockwork Orange\" in Schauspielhaus Bonn)</small>\n<li> \"Zahltag\" \u2013 2:43 <small>(from the play \"A Clockwork Orange\" in Schauspielhaus Bonn)</small>\n<li> \"Musterbeispiel\" \u2013 3:51 <small>(from the play \"A Clockwork Orange\" in Schauspielhaus Bonn)</small>\n<li> \"1200 Grad\" (Breitkopf, Frege) \u2013 4:35 <small>(''Ein kleines bi\u00dfchen Horrorschau'' demo)</small>\n<li> \"Einmal in vier Jahren\" (''Once in four years'') (Breitkopf, Frege) \u2013 4:49 <small>(''[[Kauf MICH!

In 2010, the Royals demoted Gordon to the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]] for a substantial period of time, and moved Gordon from third base to [[outfielder|the outfield]].  He returned to the Royals later that season as a full-time outfielder, and his play improved substantially.  A member of the Royals' [[2015 World Series]] championship team, Gordon signed a four-year [[free agent]] contract that offseason to remain with the team. Gordon has won seven [[Gold Glove Award]]s, four [[Fielding Bible Award]]s, and a [[Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award]], all after the move to the outfield.\n\n==Early life==\nGordon was born on February 10, 1984, to a family heavily involved in baseball.

Everard established his farm Ashford, on sections 44 and 52 on the west side of the Bay Road.
