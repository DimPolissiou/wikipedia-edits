{"title_page": "Q&A software", "text_new": "{{short description|Online question and answer software}}\n'''Q&A software''' is [[online software]] that attempts to answer questions asked by users (Q&A stands for \"question and answer\"). Q&A software is frequently integrated by large and specialist [[corporation]]s and tends to be implemented as a [[Online community|community]] that allows users in similar fields to discuss questions and provide answers to common and specialist questions.\n\nThere are numerous examples of Q&A software in both [[open-source model|open source]] and [[SaaS]] formats, including [[Qhub]], [[OSQA]], [https://www.tistip.com tistip] Question2Answer, and [[Stack Exchange]]. Standalone Q&A communities such as [[Quora]] or [[Yahoo! Answers]] aren't traditionally in either category while operating in the Q&A market.<ref name=\"Inspired\">{{cite web|title=HOW TO: Set Up a Q&A Website in Minutes \u2013 the Best Options Reviewed & Compared|url=http://inspiredm.com/qa-websites/|publisher=Inspired Mag|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nQ&A software is often provided to corporate and specialist sites, so the site and its users can be asked questions as well as provide or receive [[expert]] answers to them. This kind of software is particularly useful for responding to questions regarding specific industries. Users may learn by regularly answering questions or exchanging views with other industry specialists using the website.\n\nIn the late 1990s, a free online service called Answer Point provided by Ask Jeeves, was launched, allowing users to ask questions and with the help of other people, have them answered. The slogan of the service, \"The Ask Jeeves Answer Point is the place where you can ask and answer questions. Have a question? Post it! Know the answer? Post it!\",<ref name=\"searchenginewatch.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/news/2060212/web-search-history-before-google-answers-yahoo-answers-there-was-answer-point-from-ask-jeeves|title=Web Search History: Before Google Answers and Yahoo Answers There Was \"Answer Point\" From Ask Jeeves {{!}} Search Engine Watch|website=searchenginewatch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04}}</ref> indicated the main function of it, which inspired the creation of later Q&A sites. The last archived version of the Ask Point was from late 2001 when it still allowed registration.\n\nSince then, more and more sites have begun to offer Q&A services. Google launched its Q&A service called [[Google Questions and Answers]] in August 2001 which used Google staffers to answer questions by e-mail. A flat fee (US$3.00) was involved for an answer. In April 2002, Google launched Google Answers, which allowed users to post answers to questions, to replace its predecessor. Google Answers cost askers $2 to $200 for an accepted answer. By late December 2006, it was fully closed to new activity.\n\nIn early 2000s, Yahoo! launched its online Q&A service called [[Ask Yahoo!]], which was later replaced by the beta version of Yahoo! Answers on December 8, 2005. Ask Yahoo! was discontinued in March 2006. Yahoo! Answers give members the chance to earn points, thus encouraging user participation. To support countries using non-English characters, [[Yahoo! Answers]] operate different platforms in some Asian countries, such as Yahoo! Chiebukuro (Yahoo!\u77e5\u6075\u888b[[Help:Installing Japanese character sets|?]]) in Japan and as Yahoo! Knowledge in Korea, Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong.\n\n[[Quora]] was founded in June 2009, while the website was made available to the public on June 21, 2010. Users can collaborate by editing questions and suggesting edits to other users' answers.\n\nFrom 2010 with the widespread use of smartphones and tablets, there is an increasing number of Q&A sites that decide to launch mobile applications. Popular Q&A sites like Yahoo! Answers and Quora have launched their own mobile applications. There is also a booming of new Q&A software such as Canvass which purely rely on mobile applications as their service channel.\n\n==Motivation==\nBased on the characteristics of an online Q&A community, which including no reputation-ranking mechanism and no financial reward for users\u2019 knowledge-contribution behaviors, and no mutual interest or conflict between users, people are wondering about the reason that motivates users to contribute their knowledge on the Q&A software. Feeling safe and trusting the software and the Internet environment provides a foundation for users to share their knowledge. People who trust the software more tend to be involved more in question and answer activities. The knowledge contribution from others leads to even more people to share their knowledge. Users who read more contributed knowledge tend to contribute more generally. Users are also seeking recognition when they contribute knowledge on the Q&A software. Social rewards such as approval, status, and respect play a very important role in motivating people to contribute to the Q&A software. User's eagerness of showing their knowledge and expertise and the potential chance of being noticed by recruiters also play a role in motivating people to answer questions and contribute questions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Jiahua|last2=Li|first2=Yijun|last3=Zhong|first3=Xiaojia|last4=Zhai|first4=Li|date=2015-11-01|title=Why users contribute knowledge to online communities: An empirical study of an online social Q&A community|journal=Information & Management|series=Novel applications of social media analytics|volume=52|issue=7|pages=840\u2013849|doi=10.1016/j.im.2015.07.005}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n== Classification ==\nAn online Q&A service serves the public with its ease of getting access without temporal and spatial constraints. The mechanism over all Q&A services is the same: Questioners express their information needs in the form of a question, and people (experts, or other users in the system) answer those questions based on their knowledge. Online Q&A service can be classified into several types in terms of who answer questions, and how services maintain and control the quality of information. Shah et al. (2009)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shah|first=Chirag|last2=Oh|first2=Sanghee|last3=Oh|first3=Jung Sun|title=Research agenda for social Q&A|journal=Library & Information Science Research|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=205\u2013209|doi=10.1016/j.lisr.2009.07.006|year=2009}}</ref> classified online Q&A service into three categories:\n* [[Digital reference services]]: Also known as virtual reference, it is an extended version of traditional reference service where users in the library can get help from librarians with identifying desired materials. The advantage comes from the fact that users can have access anytime without physical constraints. The current services in this type include Ask an IPL Librarian of the Internet Public Library, and the Educators\u2019 Reference Desk\n* Expert services: Organizations other than libraries offer Q&A service where experts in a specific area answer questions. Some are fee-based (e.g., NetWellness (<nowiki>http://www.netwellness.org</nowiki>), whereas others offer free-service (e.g., PickAnswer (<nowiki>http://pickanswer.com</nowiki>)\n* Social Q&A (community Q&A): In social Q&A services, any user in the community can ask or answer questions. Since a question can receive attention from many people unlike expert service, questioners are likely to benefit from the wisdom of crowds. The set of answers made by a large number of people often surpasses answers from experts in a traditional Q&A service. Harper, Raban, Rafaeli, and Konstan (2008)<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motivations for Answering Questions Online Abstract|last=Raban|first=Daphne R.|last2=Harper|first2=F. Maxwell|citeseerx = 10.1.1.119.1962}}</ref> proved that a social Q&A system ended up with a better quality of answers than those of library reference services by comparing existing services.\n\n== Online community ==\n'''The change of Q&A community features:''' Early definition described three types of Q&A Sites: \"digital reference services\", \"ask an expert service\", and \"community Q&A sites.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=Harper|year=2008|title=Predictors of answer quality in online Q&A sites|url=|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \"Ask an expert service\" represents a technological and social way of providing quality question answering service. This service is staffed by domain experts. In comparison, community Q&A sites involved everyday users in answering questions \u2013 it largely increased the number of contributors. Established examples of community Q&A sites are [[Yahoo! Answers]] and [[Quora]]. One of the problems of these communities is that it is hard to control the quality of answers compared with \"ask an expert service\".\n\nHowever, in recent years, community Q&A sites tend to embrace newer interaction designs than the other types of Q&A sites, by providing features like tagging and rating interfaces, RSS feeds, and highly interactive browsing and searching capabilities. These features used the crowd power to evaluate the quality of answers and also the reliability of the contributors. Some communities as [[Zhihu]] tags the users received highest votes in a given domain as \"Excellent answer provider\". These new features generally integrate expert verification and service into Q&A community sites.\n\n'''Social and information structure:''' Originally, Q&A communities have little structural or role-based organization. In recent years, we found that some communities started to form social and information structures. This is driven by the increasing number of contributors and the adoption of new features as mentioned above. Research shows that there are three different connection networks (or graphs) inside communities such as [[Quora]]. A graph connecting topics to users, a social graph connecting users, and a graph connecting related questions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Gang|year=2013|title=Wisdom in the social crowd: an analysis of quora|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web. ACM|volume=|pages=1341\u20131352|doi=10.1145/2488388.2488506|isbn=9781450320351}}</ref> These connections help users find the topic that they are looking for and build a social connection with people sharing the same interests. Also, as contributors gather according to a common theme, their votes help to screen out the domain expert and the high quality questions in that field. Also, the heterogeneity in the user and question graphs are significant contributors to the quality of the community's knowledge base.\n\n==Mechanics==\n\n===Motivations===\nThe social capital theory, social exchange theory, and social cognitive theory<ref name=\":0\" /> explain why users continuously contribute knowledge to online social Q&A communities. On the other hand, many feel hesitant to contribute due to fear of criticism or of misleading the online community members<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ardichvili|first=Alexander|last2=Page|first2=Vaughn|last3=Wentling|first3=Tim|date=2003-03-01|title=Motivation and barriers to participation in virtual knowledge\u2010sharing communities of practice|journal=Journal of Knowledge Management|volume=7|issue=1|pages=64\u201377|doi=10.1108/13673270310463626|issn=1367-3270}}</ref> The contributors can have intrinsic or extrinsic motivation to contribute. Further, the motivations to share knowledge can be categorized into and individual-based and organization or website based motivations. Website based motivations (extrinsic) include rewards and incentives to the contributions like upvotes or coupons.<ref name=\":0\" /> Individual-based motivations (intrinsic) would constitute factors like a belief in knowledge ownership, individual characteristics, interpersonal trust, and will for justice.<ref name=\":0\" /> Specifically, two kinds of motivations drive people to participate in online Q&A: Why do people ask questions, and answer questions?\n\n'''Motivation for asking:''' While there are other ways of fulfilling information needs, more people have been asking questions in online Q&A services. What motivates people to take advantage of those systems? And what do users expect from using systems? Choi (2014) surveyed 200 people who actively asked questions on Yahoo! Answers, and asked them the motivations and expectations of asking behaviors in online Q&A system. The five most significant factors of asking behaviors in the survey are:\n* Learning; Self-education through acquiring information\n* Having fun asking a question\n* Seeking advice or opinions for making decisions\n* Finding relevant information\n* Gaining a sense of security through knowledge\n'''Expectation from askers:''' The next step regarding the cycle of question and answering behaviors is for askers to assess answers to see if answers meet their expectations from information needs. In the same survey examined by Choi (2014),<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Erik|date=|title=Motivations and Expectations for Asking Questions Within Online Q&A|url=http://www.ieee-tcdl.org/Bulletin/v9n2/papers/choi.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> the most desired factor was \u201cAdditional or alternative information (4.03 / 5)\u201d, followed by \u201cAccurate and complete information\u201d. It is interesting that factors related to information itself surpassed \u201csocial and emotional support (2.47 / 5)\u201d which is related to affective needs.\n\n'''Motivation for answering:''' Answering behaviors have raised the curiosity among researchers, because there will be no explicit compensations against the activity. Raban and Harper (2008)<ref name=\":1\" /> asked people who answered questions on social Q&A about the motivation of their answering behavior as well in the same survey. The top ranked motivations are:\n* Reputation enhancement\n* Enjoyment in helping others\n* Reciprocity\n* Knowledge self-efficacy\n* Satisfaction\n* Confirmation\n* Continuance intention\n\n===Crowdsourcing===\nQ&A software uses a sourcing model called [[crowdsourcing]] to obtain answers to the questions that are posted.[[Q&A software#cite note-8|<sup>[8]</sup>]] Crowdsourcing is the act of outsourcing work to an undefined, networked labor using an open call for participation,<ref name=\":3\">Mao, Ke; Capra, Licia; Harman, Mark; Jia, Yue; A survey of the use of crowdsourcing in software engineering.

This technique allows the user to obtain answers from a large community, with lower costs and defect rates to the developers.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe user asks their question which can be answered by any member of that online community. The answers then go through an assessment, wherein the good answers are upvoted and the bad answers are downvoted by the users (or a similar parallel on different platforms).<ref>Yao, Tong, et al. \u201cDetecting high-quality posts in community question answering sites\u201d</ref> The members of the online community can find a question that needs answering to and answer that question.\n\nThis type of crowd participation in a Q&A platform has the potential to increase the knowledge of individual users, thus improving and speeding up their work process.<ref name=\":4\">Vasilescu, Bogdan, et al. \u201cStackOverflow and GitHub: Associations Between Software Development and Crowdsourced Knowledge.\u201d</ref> The abundance of information to which users are exposed through this system is effectively changing the way people collaborate, communicate and learn in online communities.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nSome other defining features of a Q&A software includes:\n* differentiation of questions and answers (features that affect answers should not affect the question)\n* differentiation of answers (replies to the question) and comments (replies to an answer)\n* user voting of answers\n* sorting of answers by votes and questions by answered status\n* approval of an answer\n* question tagging and tag search\n* marking a question as a duplicate of another one (if the event occurs)\n\n==Impact==\nQ&A sites and software as a way of coordinating development and user support activities, compared to the traditional mail list, have a significant impact on the user behavior.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Vasilescu|first=Bogdan|last2=Serebrenik|first2=Alexander|last3=Devanbu|first3=Prem|last4=Filkov|first4=Vladimir|date=2014|title=How Social Q&A Sites Are Changing Knowledge Sharing in Open Source Software Communities|journal=Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing|series=CSCW '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=342\u2013354|doi=10.1145/2531602.2531659|isbn=9781450325400}}</ref>\n\nA large number of users shift from the mail list to the Q&A software. The number of the user of Q&A significantly increased and the number of activities of the traditional mail list decreased. In addition, users of the Q&A software tend to provide answer faster.

By late December 2006, it was fully closed to new activity.\n\nIn early 2000s, Yahoo! launched its online Q&A service called [[Ask Yahoo!]], which was later replaced by the beta version of Yahoo! Answers on December 8, 2005. Ask Yahoo! was discontinued in March 2006. Yahoo! Answers give members the chance to earn points, thus encouraging user participation. To support countries using non-English characters, [[Yahoo! Answers]] operate different platforms in some Asian countries, such as Yahoo! Chiebukuro (Yahoo!\u77e5\u6075\u888b[[Help:Installing Japanese character sets|?]]) in Japan and as Yahoo! Knowledge in Korea, Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong.\n\n[[Quora]] was founded in June 2009, while the website was made available to the public on June 21, 2010. Users can collaborate by editing questions and suggesting edits to other users' answers.\n\nFrom 2010 with the widespread use of smartphones and tablets, there is an increasing number of Q&A sites that decide to launch mobile applications. Popular Q&A sites like Yahoo! Answers and Quora have launched their own mobile applications. There is also a booming of new Q&A software such as Canvass which purely rely on mobile applications as their service channel.\n\n==Motivation==\nBased on the characteristics of an online Q&A community, which including no reputation-ranking mechanism and no financial reward for users\u2019 knowledge-contribution behaviors, and no mutual interest or conflict between users, people are wondering about the reason that motivates users to contribute their knowledge on the Q&A software. Feeling safe and trusting the software and the Internet environment provides a foundation for users to share their knowledge. People who trust the software more tend to be involved more in question and answer activities. The knowledge contribution from others leads to even more people to share their knowledge. Users who read more contributed knowledge tend to contribute more generally. Users are also seeking recognition when they contribute knowledge on the Q&A software. Social rewards such as approval, status, and respect play a very important role in motivating people to contribute to the Q&A software. User's eagerness of showing their knowledge and expertise and the potential chance of being noticed by recruiters also play a role in motivating people to answer questions and contribute questions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Jiahua|last2=Li|first2=Yijun|last3=Zhong|first3=Xiaojia|last4=Zhai|first4=Li|date=2015-11-01|title=Why users contribute knowledge to online communities: An empirical study of an online social Q&A community|journal=Information & Management|series=Novel applications of social media analytics|volume=52|issue=7|pages=840\u2013849|doi=10.1016/j.im.2015.07.005}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n== Classification ==\nAn online Q&A service serves the public with its ease of getting access without temporal and spatial constraints. The mechanism over all Q&A services is the same: Questioners express their information needs in the form of a question, and people (experts, or other users in the system) answer those questions based on their knowledge. Online Q&A service can be classified into several types in terms of who answer questions, and how services maintain and control the quality of information. Shah et al. (2009)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shah|first=Chirag|last2=Oh|first2=Sanghee|last3=Oh|first3=Jung Sun|title=Research agenda for social Q&A|journal=Library & Information Science Research|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=205\u2013209|doi=10.1016/j.lisr.2009.07.006|year=2009}}</ref> classified online Q&A service into three categories:\n* [[Digital reference services]]: Also known as virtual reference, it is an extended version of traditional reference service where users in the library can get help from librarians with identifying desired materials. The advantage comes from the fact that users can have access anytime without physical constraints. The current services in this type include Ask an IPL Librarian of the Internet Public Library, and the Educators\u2019 Reference Desk\n* Expert services: Organizations other than libraries offer Q&A service where experts in a specific area answer questions. Some are fee-based (e.g., NetWellness (<nowiki>http://www.netwellness.org</nowiki>), whereas others offer free-service (e.g., PickAnswer (<nowiki>http://pickanswer.com</nowiki>)\n* Social Q&A (community Q&A): In social Q&A services, any user in the community can ask or answer questions. Since a question can receive attention from many people unlike expert service, questioners are likely to benefit from the wisdom of crowds. The set of answers made by a large number of people often surpasses answers from experts in a traditional Q&A service. Harper, Raban, Rafaeli, and Konstan (2008)<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motivations for Answering Questions Online Abstract|last=Raban|first=Daphne R.|last2=Harper|first2=F. Maxwell|citeseerx = 10.1.1.119.1962}}</ref> proved that a social Q&A system ended up with a better quality of answers than those of library reference services by comparing existing services.\n\n== Online community ==\n'''The change of Q&A community features:''' Early definition described three types of Q&A Sites: \"digital reference services\", \"ask an expert service\", and \"community Q&A sites.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=Harper|year=2008|title=Predictors of answer quality in online Q&A sites|url=|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \"Ask an expert service\" represents a technological and social way of providing quality question answering service. This service is staffed by domain experts. In comparison, community Q&A sites involved everyday users in answering questions \u2013 it largely increased the number of contributors. Established examples of community Q&A sites are [[Yahoo! Answers]] and [[Quora]]. One of the problems of these communities is that it is hard to control the quality of answers compared with \"ask an expert service\".\n\nHowever, in recent years, community Q&A sites tend to embrace newer interaction designs than the other types of Q&A sites, by providing features like tagging and rating interfaces, RSS feeds, and highly interactive browsing and searching capabilities. These features used the crowd power to evaluate the quality of answers and also the reliability of the contributors. Some communities as [[Zhihu]] tags the users received highest votes in a given domain as \"Excellent answer provider\". These new features generally integrate expert verification and service into Q&A community sites.\n\n'''Social and information structure:''' Originally, Q&A communities have little structural or role-based organization. In recent years, we found that some communities started to form social and information structures. This is driven by the increasing number of contributors and the adoption of new features as mentioned above. Research shows that there are three different connection networks (or graphs) inside communities such as [[Quora]]. A graph connecting topics to users, a social graph connecting users, and a graph connecting related questions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Gang|year=2013|title=Wisdom in the social crowd: an analysis of quora|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web. ACM|volume=|pages=1341\u20131352|doi=10.1145/2488388.2488506|isbn=9781450320351}}</ref> These connections help users find the topic that they are looking for and build a social connection with people sharing the same interests. Also, as contributors gather according to a common theme, their votes help to screen out the domain expert and the high quality questions in that field. Also, the heterogeneity in the user and question graphs are significant contributors to the quality of the community's knowledge base.\n\n==Mechanics==\n\n===Motivations===\nThe social capital theory, social exchange theory, and social cognitive theory<ref name=\":0\" /> explain why users continuously contribute knowledge to online social Q&A communities. On the other hand, many feel hesitant to contribute due to fear of criticism or of misleading the online community members<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ardichvili|first=Alexander|last2=Page|first2=Vaughn|last3=Wentling|first3=Tim|date=2003-03-01|title=Motivation and barriers to participation in virtual knowledge\u2010sharing communities of practice|journal=Journal of Knowledge Management|volume=7|issue=1|pages=64\u201377|doi=10.1108/13673270310463626|issn=1367-3270}}</ref> The contributors can have intrinsic or extrinsic motivation to contribute. Further, the motivations to share knowledge can be categorized into and individual-based and organization or website based motivations. Website based motivations (extrinsic) include rewards and incentives to the contributions like upvotes or coupons.<ref name=\":0\" /> Individual-based motivations (intrinsic) would constitute factors like a belief in knowledge ownership, individual characteristics, interpersonal trust, and will for justice.<ref name=\":0\" /> Specifically, two kinds of motivations drive people to participate in online Q&A: Why do people ask questions, and answer questions?\n\n'''Motivation for asking:''' While there are other ways of fulfilling information needs, more people have been asking questions in online Q&A services. What motivates people to take advantage of those systems? And what do users expect from using systems? Choi (2014) surveyed 200 people who actively asked questions on Yahoo! Answers, and asked them the motivations and expectations of asking behaviors in online Q&A system. The five most significant factors of asking behaviors in the survey are:\n* Learning; Self-education through acquiring information\n* Having fun asking a question\n* Seeking advice or opinions for making decisions\n* Finding relevant information\n* Gaining a sense of security through knowledge\n'''Expectation from askers:''' The next step regarding the cycle of question and answering behaviors is for askers to assess answers to see if answers meet their expectations from information needs. In the same survey examined by Choi (2014),<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Erik|date=|title=Motivations and Expectations for Asking Questions Within Online Q&A|url=http://www.ieee-tcdl.org/Bulletin/v9n2/papers/choi.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> the most desired factor was \u201cAdditional or alternative information (4.03 / 5)\u201d, followed by \u201cAccurate and complete information\u201d. It is interesting that factors related to information itself surpassed \u201csocial and emotional support (2.47 / 5)\u201d which is related to affective needs.\n\n'''Motivation for answering:''' Answering behaviors have raised the curiosity among researchers, because there will be no explicit compensations against the activity. Raban and Harper (2008)<ref name=\":1\" /> asked people who answered questions on social Q&A about the motivation of their answering behavior as well in the same survey. The top ranked motivations are:\n* Reputation enhancement\n* Enjoyment in helping others\n* Reciprocity\n* Knowledge self-efficacy\n* Satisfaction\n* Confirmation\n* Continuance intention\n\n===Crowdsourcing===\nQ&A software uses a sourcing model called [[crowdsourcing]] to obtain answers to the questions that are posted.[[Q&A software#cite note-8|<sup>[8]</sup>]] Crowdsourcing is the act of outsourcing work to an undefined, networked labor using an open call for participation,<ref name=\":3\">Mao, Ke; Capra, Licia; Harman, Mark; Jia, Yue; A survey of the use of crowdsourcing in software engineering. (2016, September 20)</ref> and it is used to support the activities on most Q&A software (such as [[Stack Exchange]], Quora, etc.). This technique allows the user to obtain answers from a large community, with lower costs and defect rates to the developers.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe user asks their question which can be answered by any member of that online community. The answers then go through an assessment, wherein the good answers are upvoted and the bad answers are downvoted by the users (or a similar parallel on different platforms).<ref>Yao, Tong, et al. \u201cDetecting high-quality posts in community question answering sites\u201d</ref> The members of the online community can find a question that needs answering to and answer that question.\n\nThis type of crowd participation in a Q&A platform has the potential to increase the knowledge of individual users, thus improving and speeding up their work process.<ref name=\":4\">Vasilescu, Bogdan, et al. \u201cStackOverflow and GitHub: Associations Between Software Development and Crowdsourced Knowledge.\u201d</ref> The abundance of information to which users are exposed through this system is effectively changing the way people collaborate, communicate and learn in online communities.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nSome other defining features of a Q&A software includes:\n* differentiation of questions and answers (features that affect answers should not affect the question)\n* differentiation of answers (replies to the question) and comments (replies to an answer)\n* user voting of answers\n* sorting of answers by votes and questions by answered status\n* approval of an answer\n* question tagging and tag search\n* marking a question as a duplicate of another one (if the event occurs)\n\n==Impact==\nQ&A sites and software as a way of coordinating development and user support activities, compared to the traditional mail list, have a significant impact on the user behavior.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Vasilescu|first=Bogdan|last2=Serebrenik|first2=Alexander|last3=Devanbu|first3=Prem|last4=Filkov|first4=Vladimir|date=2014|title=How Social Q&A Sites Are Changing Knowledge Sharing in Open Source Software Communities|journal=Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing|series=CSCW '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=342\u2013354|doi=10.1145/2531602.2531659|isbn=9781450325400}}</ref>\n\nA large number of users shift from the mail list to the Q&A software. The number of the user of Q&A significantly increased and the number of activities of the traditional mail list decreased. In addition, users of the Q&A software tend to provide answer faster. Because Q&A software and websites are considered forms of crowdsourcing systems, it's inevitable that they have wide-ranging impacts that can be either positive or negative.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Comparison of Q&A software==\nA complete comparison of Q&A sites can be found in the wiki pages listed below. {{see also|Comparison of Q&A sites|Comparison of wiki software}}\n\nOnly self-hostable solutions are in scope for this table.<ref>There are potentially more. https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/37953</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 85%; width: auto; table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 12em\" |\n!

RHDVa (also referred to as RHDV, RHDV1, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref name=Liu1984>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=S.J. |last2=Xue |first2=H.P. |last3=Pu |first3=B.Q. |last4=Qian |first4=N.H. |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDVa in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nIn 2010, a new lagovirus with a distinct antigenic profile was identified in France. This virus also caused rabbit hemorrhagic disease but behaved differently from RHDVa in that it affected vaccinated and young European rabbits as well as hares ''(Lepus spp.)''.<ref name=Capucci2017 /> All these features strongly suggested that the virus was not derived from RHDVa but from some other unknown source.<ref name=Capucci2017 />  The new virus was named rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (abbreviated as RHDV-2 or RHDVb). RHDV-2 is distinct enough from RHDVa that the two require different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. RHDV-2 has since spread to the majority of Europe as well as to Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\n==Epidemiology & Transmission==\n\nBoth viruses causing RHD are extremely contagious. Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals, carcasses, bodily fluids (urine, feces, respiratory secretions), and hair.  Surviving rabbits may be contagious for up to 2 months.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />  Contaminated fomites such as clothing, food, cages, bedding, feeders and water also spread the virus. Flies, fleas, and mosquitoes can carry the virus between rabbits.<ref name=Kerr2013>{{cite journal |last1=Kerr |first1=Peter J. |last2=Donnelly |first2=Thomas M. |title=Viral Infections of Rabbits |journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Exotic Animal Practice |date=May 2013 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=437\u2013468 |doi=10.1016/j.cvex.2013.02.002}}</ref><ref name=IAS/> Predators and scavengers can also spread the virus by shedding it in their feces.<ref name=Kerr2013 />  Caliciviruses are highly resistant in the environment, and can survive freezing for prolonged periods. Virus can persist in infected meat for months, and for prolonged periods in decomposing carcasses. Importation of rabbit meat may be a major contributor in the spread of the virus to new geographic regions.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nRHD outbreaks tend to be seasonal in wild rabbit populations, where most adults have survived infection and are immune. As young kits grow up and stop nursing, they no longer receive the antibodies provided in their mother's milk and become susceptible to infection. Thus RHD [[epizootic]]s occur more often during the rabbits' breeding season.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> \n\nThere is generally high host specificity among lagoviruses.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Classic RHDVa only affects European rabbits, a species native to Europe and from which the domestic rabbit is descended. The new variant RHDV-2 affects European rabbits as well but also causes fatal RHD in various ''Lepus'' species, including Sardinian Cape hares ''(Lepus capensis mediterraneus)'', Italian hares ''(Lepus corsicanus)'' and mountain hares ''(Lepus timidus)''.\n<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Reports of RHD in ''Sylvilagus'' species have been coming from the current outbreak in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Southwest US faces lethal rabbit disease outbreak |url=https://news.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=210&Id=9597414 |website=Veterinary Information Network |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRHD caused by classic RHDVa demonstrates high morbidity (up to 100%) and mortality (70-90%) in adult European rabbits. Young rabbits that are 6-8 weeks old are less likely to be infected, and kits younger than 4 weeks old do not become ill.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> The more recently emerged RHDV-2 causes death and disease in rabbits as young as 15 to 20 days old. Mortality rates from RHDV-2 were initially only 20-30%, but over time the virulence of the strain has been increasing and is now similar to that found with RHDVa. Deaths from RHDV-2 have been confirmed in rabbits previously vaccinated against RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nBoth viral strains of RHDV replicate in the liver, causing hepatic [[necrosis]] and liver failure. Liver failure can in turn lead to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]], and [[nephrosis]].<ref name=Kerr2013 /> Bleeding may occur as clotting factors and platelets are used up.\n\n== Clinical Signs ==\n[[File:Rabbit with jaundice (eye).jpg|thumb|European rabbit with yellowing of [[conjunctiva]] and [[sclera]] due to jaundice]]\n[[File:Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease.jpg|thumb|European rabbit with [[epistaxis]]]]\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease causes hepatitis. The incubation period for RHDVa is one to two days, and for RHDV-2 three to five days. Rabbits infected with RHDV-2 are more likely to show subacute or chronic signs than are those infected with RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> In rabbitries, an epidemic with high mortality rates in adult and subadult rabbits is typical.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> If the outbreak is caused by RHDV-2 than deaths will also occur in young rabbits.  \n\nRHD can vary in how quickly or slowly clinical signs occur. In peracute cases rabbits are usually found dead with no premonitory symptoms.<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Rabbits may be observed grazing normally immediately before death.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> \n\nIn acute cases rabbits are inactive and reluctant to move. They may develop a fever of up to 42\u00b0 C (107.6\u00b0 F) and have increased heart and respiratory rates. Bloody discharge from the nose, mouth, or vulva is common, as is blood in the feces or urine. Lateral recumbency, coma, and convulsions may be observed before death.<ref name=Kerr2013 />  Rabbits with the acute form generally die within 12 to 36 hours from the onset of fever.<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> \n\nSubacute to chronic RHD has a more protracted clinical course, and is more commonly noted with RHDV-2 infections. Clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, and [[jaundice]]. Gastrointestinal dilation, cardiac [[arrhythmia]]s, [[heart murmur]]s, and neurologic abnormalities can also occur.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Death, if it occurs, usually happens 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, and is due to liver failure. <ref name=Rocchi2018 />\n\nNot all rabbits exposed to RHDVa or RHDV-2 become overtly ill. A small proportion of infected rabbits clear the virus without developing signs of disease.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> [[Asymptomatic carriers]] also occur, and can continue to shed virus for months, thereby infecting other animals. Surviving rabbits develop a strong immunity to the specific viral variant they were infected with.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nA presumptive diagnosis of RHD can often be made based on clinical presentation, infection pattern within a population, and post-mortem lesions. Definitive diagnosis requires detection of the virus. As most caliciviruses cannot be grown in cell culture, molecular and serologic methods of viral detection are often used.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nComplete blood counts from rabbits with RHD often show low levels of white blood cells and platelets, and chemistry panels show elevated liver enzymes. Evidence of liver failure may also be present, including increased bile acids and bilirubin, and decreased glucose and cholesterol. Prolonged prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times are typical. Urinalysis can show bilirubinuria, proteinuria, and high urinary GGT.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />  \n\nThe classic postmortem lesion seen in rabbits with RHD is extensive hepatic necrosis and jaundice. There may also be multifocal hemorrhages, splenomegaly, bronchopneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage or edema, and myocardial necrosis. <ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nA variety of molecular tests can be used to identify RHD viruses. [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR) tests are a commonly used and accurate testing modality for viruses. Other tests used include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]), [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], [[immunostaining]], [[Western blot]], and [[in situ hybridization]].<ref name=Gleeson2020 />   The tissue of choice for molecular testing is fresh or frozen liver, as it usually contains the largest amount of virus, but if this is not available spleen and serum can also be used. It is important to identify the strain of RHDV so that vaccination protocols can be adjusted accordingly.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Prevention & Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie. All last for 12 months and contain inactivated strains of VHD. A live combination vaccine, Nobivac Myxo-RHD, made by MSD Animal Health, has recently become available.

The affected breeds included [[List of rabbit breeds|Palominos]] and [[Californian rabbit|California Whites]]. By April 6, 25 of the 27 affected rabbits had died of the infection. In order to contain the disease, the remaining two rabbits were euthanized. No new introductions of rabbits were placed on the farm for two years after the discovery of RHDVa and August 1999 was the last time rabbits left and/or returned to the farm. The United States experienced other outbreaks of RHDVa in 2001 ([[Utah]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) and 2005 ([[Indiana]]).<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn 2010, a new virus variant called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV-2) emerged in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Gall-Recul\u00e9|first=Ghislaine|last2=Lavazza|first2=Antonio|last3=Marchandeau|first3=St\u00e9phane|last4=Bertagnoli|first4=St\u00e9phane|last5=Zwingelstein|first5=Fran\u00e7oise|last6=Cavadini|first6=Patrizia|last7=Martinelli|first7=Nicola|last8=Lombardi|first8=Guerino|last9=Gu\u00e9rin|first9=Jean-Luc|date=2013-09-08|title=Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus|journal=Veterinary Research|language=En|volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-44-81|pmc=3848706|pmid=24011218|pages=81}}</ref> RHDV-2 has since spread from France to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.

An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up. Ten years on, rabbit populations (in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] in particular) are beginning to reach near pre-plague proportions once again though they have not yet returned to pre RCD levels.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Munro|editor1-first=Robert K. |editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=Richard T. |title=Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease: Issues in Assessment for biological control |date=1994 |publisher=Bureau of Resource Sciences |location=Canberra |isbn=9780644335126}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Plan for 1080 drops in MacKenzie Basin |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/2441711/Mackenzie-1080-drop-plan |last=Williams |first=David |date=26 May 2009 |newspaper= The Press |accessdate = 2009-06-14}}</ref>\n\nResistance to RHD in New Zealand rabbits has led to the widespread use of [[1080 usage in New Zealand|Compound 1080 (Sodium fluoroacetate)]].

RHDVa (also referred to as RHDV, RHDV1, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref name=Liu1984>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=S.J. |last2=Xue |first2=H.P. |last3=Pu |first3=B.Q. |last4=Qian |first4=N.H. |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDVa in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nIn 2010, a new lagovirus with a distinct antigenic profile was identified in France. This virus also caused rabbit hemorrhagic disease but behaved differently from RHDVa in that it affected vaccinated and young European rabbits as well as hares ''(Lepus spp.)''.<ref name=Capucci2017 /> All these features strongly suggested that the virus was not derived from RHDVa but from some other unknown source.<ref name=Capucci2017 />  The new virus was named rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (abbreviated as RHDV-2 or RHDVb). RHDV-2 is distinct enough from RHDVa that the two require different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. RHDV-2 has since spread to the majority of Europe as well as to Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\n==Epidemiology & Transmission==\n\nBoth viruses causing RHD are extremely contagious. Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals, carcasses, bodily fluids (urine, feces, respiratory secretions), and hair.  Surviving rabbits may be contagious for up to 2 months.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />  Contaminated fomites such as clothing, food, cages, bedding, feeders and water also spread the virus. Flies, fleas, and mosquitoes can carry the virus between rabbits.<ref name=Kerr2013>{{cite journal |last1=Kerr |first1=Peter J. |last2=Donnelly |first2=Thomas M. |title=Viral Infections of Rabbits |journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Exotic Animal Practice |date=May 2013 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=437\u2013468 |doi=10.1016/j.cvex.2013.02.002}}</ref><ref name=IAS/> Predators and scavengers can also spread the virus by shedding it in their feces.<ref name=Kerr2013 />  Caliciviruses are highly resistant in the environment, and can survive freezing for prolonged periods. Virus can persist in infected meat for months, and for prolonged periods in decomposing carcasses. Importation of rabbit meat may be a major contributor in the spread of the virus to new geographic regions.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nRHD outbreaks tend to be seasonal in wild rabbit populations, where most adults have survived infection and are immune. As young kits grow up and stop nursing, they no longer receive the antibodies provided in their mother's milk and become susceptible to infection. Thus RHD [[epizootic]]s occur more often during the rabbits' breeding season.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> \n\nThere is generally high host specificity among lagoviruses.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Classic RHDVa only affects European rabbits, a species native to Europe and from which the domestic rabbit is descended. The new variant RHDV-2 affects European rabbits as well but also causes fatal RHD in various ''Lepus'' species, including Sardinian Cape hares ''(Lepus capensis mediterraneus)'', Italian hares ''(Lepus corsicanus)'' and mountain hares ''(Lepus timidus)''.\n<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Reports of RHD in ''Sylvilagus'' species have been coming from the current outbreak in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Southwest US faces lethal rabbit disease outbreak |url=https://news.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=210&Id=9597414 |website=Veterinary Information Network |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRHD caused by classic RHDVa demonstrates high morbidity (up to 100%) and mortality (70-90%) in adult European rabbits. Young rabbits that are 6-8 weeks old are less likely to be infected, and kits younger than 4 weeks old do not become ill.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> The more recently emerged RHDV-2 causes death and disease in rabbits as young as 15 to 20 days old. Mortality rates from RHDV-2 were initially only 20-30%, but over time the virulence of the strain has been increasing and is now similar to that found with RHDVa. Deaths from RHDV-2 have been confirmed in rabbits previously vaccinated against RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nBoth viral strains of RHDV replicate in the liver, causing hepatic [[necrosis]] and liver failure. Liver failure can in turn lead to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]], and [[nephrosis]].<ref name=Kerr2013 /> Bleeding may occur as clotting factors and platelets are used up.\n\n== Clinical Signs ==\n[[File:Rabbit with jaundice (eye).jpg|thumb|European rabbit with yellowing of [[conjunctiva]] and [[sclera]] due to jaundice]]\n[[File:Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease.jpg|thumb|European rabbit with [[epistaxis]]]]\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease causes hepatitis. The incubation period for RHDVa is one to two days, and for RHDV-2 three to five days. Rabbits infected with RHDV-2 are more likely to show subacute or chronic signs than are those infected with RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> In rabbitries, an epidemic with high mortality rates in adult and subadult rabbits is typical.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> If the outbreak is caused by RHDV-2 than deaths will also occur in young rabbits.  \n\nRHD can vary in how quickly or slowly clinical signs occur. In peracute cases rabbits are usually found dead with no premonitory symptoms.<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Rabbits may be observed grazing normally immediately before death.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> \n\nIn acute cases rabbits are inactive and reluctant to move. They may develop a fever of up to 42\u00b0 C (107.6\u00b0 F) and have increased heart and respiratory rates. Bloody discharge from the nose, mouth, or vulva is common, as is blood in the feces or urine. Lateral recumbency, coma, and convulsions may be observed before death.<ref name=Kerr2013 />  Rabbits with the acute form generally die within 12 to 36 hours from the onset of fever.<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> \n\nSubacute to chronic RHD has a more protracted clinical course, and is more commonly noted with RHDV-2 infections. Clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, and [[jaundice]]. Gastrointestinal dilation, cardiac [[arrhythmia]]s, [[heart murmur]]s, and neurologic abnormalities can also occur.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Death, if it occurs, usually happens 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, and is due to liver failure. <ref name=Rocchi2018 />\n\nNot all rabbits exposed to RHDVa or RHDV-2 become overtly ill. A small proportion of infected rabbits clear the virus without developing signs of disease.<ref name=Kerr2013 /> [[Asymptomatic carriers]] also occur, and can continue to shed virus for months, thereby infecting other animals. Surviving rabbits develop a strong immunity to the specific viral variant they were infected with.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nA presumptive diagnosis of RHD can often be made based on clinical presentation, infection pattern within a population, and post-mortem lesions. Definitive diagnosis requires detection of the virus. As most caliciviruses cannot be grown in cell culture, molecular and serologic methods of viral detection are often used.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nComplete blood counts from rabbits with RHD often show low levels of white blood cells and platelets, and chemistry panels show elevated liver enzymes. Evidence of liver failure may also be present, including increased bile acids and bilirubin, and decreased glucose and cholesterol. Prolonged prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times are typical. Urinalysis can show bilirubinuria, proteinuria, and high urinary GGT.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />  \n\nThe classic postmortem lesion seen in rabbits with RHD is extensive hepatic necrosis and jaundice. There may also be multifocal hemorrhages, splenomegaly, bronchopneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage or edema, and myocardial necrosis. <ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nA variety of molecular tests can be used to identify RHD viruses. [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR) tests are a commonly used and accurate testing modality for viruses. Other tests used include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]), [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], [[immunostaining]], [[Western blot]], and [[in situ hybridization]].<ref name=Gleeson2020 />   The tissue of choice for molecular testing is fresh or frozen liver, as it usually contains the largest amount of virus, but if this is not available spleen and serum can also be used. It is important to identify the strain of RHDV so that vaccination protocols can be adjusted accordingly.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Prevention & Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.

The affected breeds included [[List of rabbit breeds|Palominos]] and [[Californian rabbit|California Whites]]. By April 6, 25 of the 27 affected rabbits had died of the infection. In order to contain the disease, the remaining two rabbits were euthanized. No new introductions of rabbits were placed on the farm for two years after the discovery of RHDVa and August 1999 was the last time rabbits left and/or returned to the farm. The United States experienced other outbreaks of RHDVa in 2001 ([[Utah]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) and 2005 ([[Indiana]]).<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn 2010, a new virus variant called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV-2) emerged in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Gall-Recul\u00e9|first=Ghislaine|last2=Lavazza|first2=Antonio|last3=Marchandeau|first3=St\u00e9phane|last4=Bertagnoli|first4=St\u00e9phane|last5=Zwingelstein|first5=Fran\u00e7oise|last6=Cavadini|first6=Patrizia|last7=Martinelli|first7=Nicola|last8=Lombardi|first8=Guerino|last9=Gu\u00e9rin|first9=Jean-Luc|date=2013-09-08|title=Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus|journal=Veterinary Research|language=En|volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-44-81|pmc=3848706|pmid=24011218|pages=81}}</ref> RHDV-2 has since spread from France to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.

This was backed up in an early August review of the decision by the Director-General of Agriculture. However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDVa had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]]. An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up. Ten years on, rabbit populations (in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] in particular) are beginning to reach near pre-plague proportions once again though they have not yet returned to pre RCD levels.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Munro|editor1-first=Robert K. |editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=Richard T. |title=Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease: Issues in Assessment for biological control |date=1994 |publisher=Bureau of Resource Sciences |location=Canberra |isbn=9780644335126}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Plan for 1080 drops in MacKenzie Basin |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/2441711/Mackenzie-1080-drop-plan |last=Williams |first=David |date=26 May 2009 |newspaper= The Press |accessdate = 2009-06-14}}</ref>\n\nResistance to RHD in New Zealand rabbits has led to the widespread use of [[1080 usage in New Zealand|Compound 1080 (Sodium fluoroacetate)]].
