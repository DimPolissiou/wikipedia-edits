First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

It comes from a spelling alteration of the abbreviation \"docs\" (for \"documents\") and refers to \"compiling and releasing a dossier of personal information on someone\".<ref name=Wired>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/03/doxing/ |title= What Is Doxing? |first=Mat |last=Honan |date=2014-03-06 |magazine=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |accessdate=2014-12-10 }}</ref> Essentially, doxing is revealing and publicizing records of an individual, which were previously private or difficult to obtain.\n\nThe term dox derives from the slang \"dropping dox\" which, according to ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' writer Mat Honan, was \"an old-school revenge tactic that emerged from hacker culture in 1990s\". Hackers operating outside the law in that era used the breach of an opponent's [[anonymity]] as a means to expose opponents to harassment or legal repercussions.<ref name=Wired />\n\nConsequently, doxing often comes with a negative connotation, because it can be a vehicle for revenge via the violation of privacy.<ref name=\"theatlantic.com\">{{cite magazine |title=Doxing: An Etymology |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/doxing-an-etymology/284283/ |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |first=Megan |last=Garber |date=2014-03-06 |accessdate=2014-12-10 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nInitial efforts around doxing were largely related to internet discussion forums on [Usenet]. One of the first documented doxing events was the publication of a \"Blacklist of Net.Nazis and Sandlot Bullies\"<ref>\n{{cite web|author=Fomin, V. |title=Usenet: Blacklist of Net.Nazis and Sandlot Bullies |url= https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.culture.usenet/i7615F8Fnak/YA_jh0BfhGYJ}}</ref> which listed names, email addresses, phone numbers, and mailing addresses of individuals the author objected to.\n\n[[Doxware]] is a [[cryptovirology]] attack invented by Adam Young and further developed with Moti Yung that carries out doxing extortion via [[malware]]. It was first presented at [[West Point]] in 2003. The attack is rooted in game theory and was originally dubbed \"non-zero sum games and survivable malware\".<ref name=\"iaw2003\">{{Cite conference | last1 = Young | first1 = A. | title = Non-Zero Sum Games and Survivable Malware | pages = 24\u201329| conference = IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society Information Assurance Workshop| year = 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe attack is summarized in the book ''Malicious Cryptography'' as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The attack differs from the extortion attack in the following way. In the extortion attack, the victim is denied access to its own valuable information and has to pay to get it back, where in the attack that is presented here the victim retains access to the information but its disclosure is at the discretion of the computer virus.<ref name=\"maliciouscrypto\">{{cite book|author=A. Young, [[Moti Yung|M. Yung]]|title=Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=0-7645-4975-8}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDoxware is the converse of [[ransomware]]. In a ransomware attack (originally called cryptoviral extortion), the malware encrypts the victim's data and demands payment to provide the needed decryption key. In the doxware cryptovirology attack, the attacker or malware steals the victim's data and threatens to publish it unless a fee is paid.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Common techniques ==\nOnce people have been exposed through doxing, they may be targeted for harassment through methods such as harassment in person, fake signups for mail and pizza deliveries, or through [[swatting]] (dispatching armed police to their house through spoofed tips).\n\nA hacker may obtain an individual's dox without making the information public. A hacker may look for this information in order to extort or coerce a known or unknown target. Also, a hacker may harvest a victim's information in order to break into their Internet accounts, or to take over their social media accounts.<ref>{{cite web|title = What Is Doxing?|url = https://www.wired.com/2014/03/doxing/|website = WIRED|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref>\n\nThe victim may also be shown their details as proof that they have been doxed in order to intimidate. The perpetrator may use this fear and intimidation to gain power over the victim in order to extort or coerce. Doxing is therefore a standard tactic of online harassment and has been used by people associated with [[4chan]] and in the [[Gamergate controversy|Gamergate]] and [[vaccine controversies]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/10/16/doxx-dark-web-letter-bitcoin-ransom/|title=Someone is blackmailing dark web users to pay up or get doxxed|last=Mix|date=2017-10-16|work=The Next Web|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=Gamergate hits new low with attempts to send Swat teams to critics|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/13/gamergate-hits-new-low-with-attempts-to-send-swat-teams-to-critics|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Mulvaney|first1=Nicole|title=Recent wave of swatting nationwide fits definition of terrorism, Princeton police chief says|url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2015/06/princeton_swatting_incidents_schools_malls_hoaxes.html|website=NJ.com|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Liebl|first1=Lance|title=The dangers and ramifications of doxxing and swatting|url=http://www.gamezone.com/originals/the-dangers-and-ramifications-of-doxxing-and-swatting|website=Gamezone}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Diresta & Lotan|title=How antivaxxers influence legislation|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/06/antivaxxers-influencing-legislation/|website=Wired|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe ethics of doxing by journalists, on matters that they assert are issues of [[public interest]], is an area of much controversy.

It comes from a spelling alteration of the abbreviation \"docs\" (for \"documents\") and refers to \"compiling and releasing a dossier of personal information on someone\".<ref name=Wired>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/03/doxing/ |title= What Is Doxing? |first=Mat |last=Honan |date=2014-03-06 |magazine=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |accessdate=2014-12-10 }}</ref> Essentially, doxing is revealing and publicizing records of an individual, which were previously private or difficult to obtain.\n\nThe term dox derives from the slang \"dropping dox\" which, according to ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' writer Mat Honan, was \"an old-school revenge tactic that emerged from hacker culture in 1990s\". Hackers operating outside the law in that era used the breach of an opponent's [[anonymity]] as a means to expose opponents to harassment or legal repercussions.<ref name=Wired />\n\nConsequently, doxing often comes with a negative connotation, because it can be a vehicle for revenge via the violation of privacy.<ref name=\"theatlantic.com\">{{cite magazine |title=Doxing: An Etymology |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/doxing-an-etymology/284283/ |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |first=Megan |last=Garber |date=2014-03-06 |accessdate=2014-12-10 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nInitial efforts around doxing were largely related to internet discussion forums on [Usenet]. One of the first documented doxing events was the publication of a \"Blacklist of Net.Nazis and Sandlot Bullies\"<ref>\n{{cite web|author=Fomin, V. |title=Usenet: Blacklist of Net.Nazis and Sandlot Bullies |url= https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.culture.usenet/i7615F8Fnak/YA_jh0BfhGYJ}}</ref> which listed names, email addresses, phone numbers, and mailing addresses of individuals the author objected to.\n\n[[Doxware]] is a [[cryptovirology]] attack invented by Adam Young and further developed with Moti Yung that carries out doxing extortion via [[malware]]. It was first presented at [[West Point]] in 2003. The attack is rooted in game theory and was originally dubbed \"non-zero sum games and survivable malware\".<ref name=\"iaw2003\">{{Cite conference | last1 = Young | first1 = A. | title = Non-Zero Sum Games and Survivable Malware | pages = 24\u201329| conference = IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society Information Assurance Workshop| year = 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe attack is summarized in the book ''Malicious Cryptography'' as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The attack differs from the extortion attack in the following way. In the extortion attack, the victim is denied access to its own valuable information and has to pay to get it back, where in the attack that is presented here the victim retains access to the information but its disclosure is at the discretion of the computer virus.<ref name=\"maliciouscrypto\">{{cite book|author=A. Young, [[Moti Yung|M. Yung]]|title=Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=0-7645-4975-8}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDoxware is the converse of [[ransomware]]. In a ransomware attack (originally called cryptoviral extortion), the malware encrypts the victim's data and demands payment to provide the needed decryption key. In the doxware cryptovirology attack, the attacker or malware steals the victim's data and threatens to publish it unless a fee is paid.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Common techniques ==\nOnce people have been exposed through doxing, they may be targeted for harassment through methods such as harassment in person, fake signups for mail and pizza deliveries, or through [[swatting]] (dispatching armed police to their house through spoofed tips).\n\nA hacker may obtain an individual's dox without making the information public. A hacker may look for this information in order to extort or coerce a known or unknown target. Also, a hacker may harvest a victim's information in order to break into their Internet accounts, or to take over their social media accounts.<ref>{{cite web|title = What Is Doxing?|url = https://www.wired.com/2014/03/doxing/|website = WIRED|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref>\n\nThe victim may also be shown their details as proof that they have been doxed in order to intimidate. The perpetrator may use this fear and intimidation to gain power over the victim in order to extort or coerce. Doxing is therefore a standard tactic of online harassment and has been used by people associated with [[4chan]] and in the [[Gamergate controversy|Gamergate]] and [[vaccine controversies]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/10/16/doxx-dark-web-letter-bitcoin-ransom/|title=Someone is blackmailing dark web users to pay up or get doxxed|last=Mix|date=2017-10-16|work=The Next Web|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=Gamergate hits new low with attempts to send Swat teams to critics|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/13/gamergate-hits-new-low-with-attempts-to-send-swat-teams-to-critics|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Mulvaney|first1=Nicole|title=Recent wave of swatting nationwide fits definition of terrorism, Princeton police chief says|url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2015/06/princeton_swatting_incidents_schools_malls_hoaxes.html|website=NJ.com|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Liebl|first1=Lance|title=The dangers and ramifications of doxxing and swatting|url=http://www.gamezone.com/originals/the-dangers-and-ramifications-of-doxxing-and-swatting|website=Gamezone}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Diresta & Lotan|title=How antivaxxers influence legislation|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/06/antivaxxers-influencing-legislation/|website=Wired|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe ethics of doxing by journalists, on matters that they assert are issues of [[public interest]], is an area of much controversy.

''Defender'' won the  America's Cup in 1895 over Lord Dunraven's ''Valkyrie III'', and she was used as an effective trial-horse for Herreshoff's new Cup defender '' Columbia'' in 1899.

Herreshoff provided the engineering expertise and his brother provided the business expertise, managing the firm's personnel and interacting with clients.

His designs ranged from the [[Herreshoff 12\u00bd (keelboat)|12\u00bd]], a 16-foot (12\u00bd foot waterline) sailboat for training the children of yachtsmen, to the 144-foot [[America's Cup]] [[Reliance (yacht)|''Reliance'']], with a sail area of 16,000 square feet.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Pastore\n | first = Christopher \n | title = Temple to the Wind: The Story of America's Greatest Naval Architect and His Masterpiece, Reliance\n | publisher = Lyons Press\n | date = September 1, 2005\n | location = Guilford, Connecticut\n | pages = 312\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Oi8VaLsNDq4C&pg=PA88 \n | isbn = 1592285570 }}</ref> He received the first US patent for a sailing [[catamaran]]. The firm built the America's Cup winning Cup yachts ''Enterprise'' - 1930, and ''Rainbow'' - 1934 (designed by [[Starling Burgess]]). Every winning America's Cup Yacht from 1893 to 1934 was built by the Herreshoff yard.\n\nThe 123-foot ''[[Defender (1895 yacht)|Defender]]'' featured [[steel]]-framing, [[bronze]] plating up to the waterline and [[aluminum]] topsides to achieve a lighter and faster boat. This combination of materials had been pioneered in the French fresh-water racing yacht ''Vendenesse'', which had been described in a [[New York Times]] article and caught the attention of the Vanderbilt Americacup syndicate. In salt water, ''Defender'' was subject to [[galvanic corrosion]], which limited its durability in water. ''Defender'' won the  America's Cup in 1895 over Lord Dunraven's ''Valkyrie III'', and she was used as an effective trial-horse for Herreshoff's new Cup defender '' Columbia'' in 1899.  She was broken up in 1901.\n\nThose of the 2,000-plus designs by Herreshoff that survive are sought by connoisseurs of classic yachts. Herreshoff S-Class sailboats, designed in 1919 and built until 1941, are still actively raced in [[Narragansett Bay]], Buzzards Bay and Western Long Island Sound ([[Larchmont, New York]]).<!---<ref>[http://www.herreshoff-s-wlis.org Herreshoff S-Class of Western Long Island Sound]</ref>----> His 12\u00bd design of 1914 is still being built and raced in New England as well. The New York 30 is well regarded as a one-design racer/cruiser.\n\nThe [[Herreshoff Marine Museum]] preserves Herreshoff's legacy at the former site of the Herreshoff Manufacturing Co.\n\n==Notable vessels==\n[[File:Herreshoff Duplex Catamaran sailing in the Thames River--1880.png|thumb|Herreshoff catamaran, ''Duplex'', on the [[River Thames]]\u2014built in 1877, was 31 ft long.]]\n[[File:Yacht Defender.jpg|thumb|Nathanael Herreshoff climbing aboard ''[[Defender (1895 yacht)|Defender]]'' in 1895; photograph by [[John S.

No. 189,459). The craft, ''Amaryllis'', raced at her maiden regatta on June 22, 1876 and performed exceedingly well. Her debut demonstrated the distinct performance advantages afforded by [[catamaran]]s over the standard monohulls. It was as a result of this event, the Centennial Regatta of the New York Yacht Club, that catamarans were barred from regular sailing classes, and this remained the case until the 1970s.<ref name=ban>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulstc.org/Herreshoff.html |title=The Spirit of the Times, November 24, 1877 (reprint) |author=L.
