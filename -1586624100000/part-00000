{"title_page": "German Unification Transport Projects", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Karte_Verkehrsprojekte_Deutsche_Einheit.svg|thumb|Map of the German Unification Transport Projects]]\n\nThe '''German Unification Transport Projects''' ({{lang-de|Verkehrsprojekte Deutsche Einheit}} or '''VDE''') are a set of major construction projects to increase and improve transport links between [[Eastern Germany|Eastern]] and [[Western Germany]] after [[German reunification]]. These projects are planned to positively impact regional development and infrastructure in the [[New states of Germany|new federal states]] and across the [[inner German border]].\n\n== Background ==\nUntil the 1970s, [[East Germany]] (officially the German Democratic Republic or GDR) had not made any large-scale investment into its transport infrastructure. Many of its motorways, roads, and railways had not been upgraded since the 1940s (with the exception of some that were repaired in the 1950s as needed) and were largely neglected: trunk roads, the long-distance counterparts to the ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n'' of the GDR, were still mostly unpaved in rural areas in 1990 and had numerous potholes.\n[[File:Fotothek_df_rp-a_0950004_Triebischtal-Tanneberg._Autobahn_bei_der_Dammm\u00fchle.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Autobahn in the GDR (1981)]]\nThe autobahns were, essentially, the same as they were before [[World War II]]. Exceptions included the six-lane expansion of a short section of the southern segment of the [[Bundesautobahn 10|Berlin ring road]] and the largest section of the [[Bundesautobahn 24|A&nbsp;24]] from Hamburg to Berlin, at a cost of 1.2 billion [[East German mark]] (around 1.1 billion [[euro]]), which West Germany funded. In contrast, the GDR hardly invested in the Nazi-era [[Reichsautobahn]] network. By 1990, most of the autobahns had deteriorated significantly and did not have [[Shoulder (road)|shoulders]]. There was a lack of accelerating and decelerating ramps at [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]], and there was also no continuous protective guardrail on long stretches. Routes to West Germany had been brought up to better standards over the years, but had also been in the shadows for decades.\n\nThe railroads were the most important means of transport in the east - the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany)|Reichsbahn]] carried more goods on a network that was half as long as the West German [[Deutsche Bundesbahn|Bundesbahn]] - but that did not save them from the effects of the historically poor East German economy. The replacement and repairing of [[Railroad tie|sleepers]], [[Railroad switch|switches]], and drain pipes was continually delayed. To make matters worse, faulty concrete mixes had been installed in sleepers for many years, and they became unusable much earlier than planned due to \"[[Alkali\u2013silica reaction|concrete cancer]]\". In addition, many lines had second and third tracksets dismantled by the [[Soviet Union]] as a form of [[WWII reparations|reparations]] in the 1940s, and these tracks were only rebuilt on a few main lines. In addition, all rail electrification infractructure was removed, and was only replaced hesitantly, especially in the 1970s. Despite great efforts in the 1980s, electrification was still not at the level of the West. Although the usage of steam locomotives was officialy phased out in 1987, the lack of diesel counterparts meant that [[Plandampf|\"Plandampf]]\" (scheduled steam) was a common practice. Slowness was the norm - in fact, trains in the GDR often took more time to travel the same route in 1989 than they did in the 1930s. For example, the ''Fliegender Hamburger'' express train on the [[Berlin\u2013Hamburg Railway]] took 138 minutes to travel between those two cities in 1933, but typically took 243 minutes on the same route by 1989.\n\nWith the fall of the wall and the opening of the borders in Europe, west-east traffic grew and added the then-dominant north-south transport corridors on a massive scale, especially in Germany and other countries on the former [[Iron Curtain]]. The north-south direction (Rheinschiene and Hamburg \u2013 Stuttgart / Munich) still dominates in western Germany, but since 1989 the importance of the historical west-east axes and the north-south connection between Bavaria and Thuringia / Saxony has increased. A explosion in demand broke out over the GDR transport network, which had been neglected for decades. The number of traffic fatalities rose substantially. While this affected all [[Types of road|road types]], it was recognized that a number of dangerous areas had developed on federal highways and roads running east to west that were previously sparsely travelled.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unfallserien und deutsche Einheit|date=1993|publisher=Munkelt Verlag|pages=28\u201329}} {{ISSN|0936-5370}}.</ref> Alongside the expansion of existing roads, it was also clear that the transport network between the East and the bordering [[States of Germany|states]] of Schleswig-Holstein, Niedersachsen, Hessen and Bayern would need to be consolidated.\n\n== History ==\nOn January 9, 1990, the constituent meeting of the German-German ''Transport Infrastructure'' Commission [[East Berlin]] dealing with cross-border transport connections and medium and long-term traffic route planning in road and air transport.<ref name=\"db-1990-1-10\">''Schnellbahnverbindung zwischen Hannover und Berlin''. In: ''Die Bahn informiert'', {{ZDB|2003143-9}}, Heft 1/1990, S.&nbsp;10.</ref> On October 3, 1990, the reunification of Germany took place.\n\nIn January 1991, [[G\u00fcnther Krause]] took over the position of Federal Minister of Transport and initiated an inventory of the traffic situation in the new federal states. This was the founding moment for the plans of the German Unification Transport Projects. On April 9, 1991, the Federal Minister of Transport presented the cabinet with the VDE program, which decided on this in anticipation of the 1992 Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan.<ref name=\"baukultur-1994-3-20\">Frank Kniestedt: ''Erste Weichen gestellt: Eisenbahn-Neubautrasse Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle''.

Krause expected the completion of all VDE projects by the year 2000.\n[[File:Judental180802.JPG|left|thumb|250x250px|Construction of VDE&nbsp;16, the [[Bundesautobahn 71|''Th\u00fcringer-Wald-Autobahn'' A&nbsp;71]] (Erfurt\u2013Schweinfurt), 2002]]\nIn January 1992 the information campaign ''Neue Wege braucht das Land. Jetzt!'' was launched to promote the VDE to citizens in the new federal states.\n\nBy the end of 1994, around ten billion DM (5.1 billion euros) had been invested in the VDE projects. In December 1991 the Traffic Planning Acceleration Act came into force to accelerate the planning of the VDE projects. On December 1, 1993, the first of several investment measure laws followed , which were to replace plan approval procedures in sections of the VDE projects..\n\nThe cost of the VDE projects in 1991 was estimated at 56 billion [[Deutsche Mark|Deustch Mark]] (28.6 billion euros). Of this, DM 32 billion was accounted for the nine rail transport projects.<ref name=\"ei-2015-08-10\">{{Cite book|title=Verkehrsprojekte Deutsche Einheit \"Schiene\": Versprechen eingel\u00f6st|date=2015|volume=65|pages=10\u201315|issue=8}}</ref> Aufgrund der Preisentwicklung sei es bis 1993 auf 64 Milliarden DM (32,7 Milliarden Euro) angehoben worden.

These projects are planned to positively impact regional development and infrastructure in the [[New states of Germany|new federal states]] and across the [[inner German border]].\n\n== Background ==\nUntil the 1970s, [[East Germany]] (officially the German Democratic Republic or GDR) had not made any large-scale investment into its transport infrastructure. Many of its motorways, roads, and railways had not been upgraded since the 1940s (with the exception of some that were repaired in the 1950s as needed) and were largely neglected: trunk roads, the long-distance counterparts to the ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n'' of the GDR, were still mostly unpaved in rural areas in 1990 and had numerous potholes.\n[[File:Fotothek_df_rp-a_0950004_Triebischtal-Tanneberg._Autobahn_bei_der_Dammm\u00fchle.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|Autobahn in the GDR (1981)]]\nThe autobahns were, essentially, the same as they were before [[World War II]]. Exceptions included the six-lane expansion of a short section of the southern segment of the [[Bundesautobahn 10|Berlin ring road]] and the largest section of the [[Bundesautobahn 24|A&nbsp;24]] from Hamburg to Berlin, at a cost of 1.2 billion [[East German mark]] (around 1.1 billion [[euro]]), which West Germany funded. In contrast, the GDR hardly invested in the Nazi-era [[Reichsautobahn]] network. By 1990, most of the autobahns had deteriorated significantly and did not have [[Shoulder (road)|shoulders]]. There was a lack of accelerating and decelerating ramps at [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]], and there was also no continuous protective guardrail on long stretches. Routes to West Germany had been brought up to better standards over the years, but had also been in the shadows for decades.\n\nThe railroads were the most important means of transport in the east - the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany)|Reichsbahn]] carried more goods on a network that was half as long as the West German [[Deutsche Bundesbahn|Bundesbahn]] - but that did not save them from the effects of the historically poor East German economy. The replacement and repairing of [[Railroad tie|sleepers]], [[Railroad switch|switches]], and drain pipes was continually delayed. To make matters worse, faulty concrete mixes had been installed in sleepers for many years, and they became unusable much earlier than planned due to \"[[Alkali\u2013silica reaction|concrete cancer]]\". In addition, many lines had second and third tracksets dismantled by the [[Soviet Union]] as a form of [[WWII reparations|reparations]] in the 1940s, and these tracks were only rebuilt on a few main lines. In addition, all rail electrification infractructure was removed, and was only replaced hesitantly, especially in the 1970s. Despite great efforts in the 1980s, electrification was still not at the level of the West. Although the usage of steam locomotives was officialy phased out in 1987, the lack of diesel counterparts meant that [[Plandampf|\"Plandampf]]\" (scheduled steam) was a common practice. Slowness was the norm - in fact, trains in the GDR often took more time to travel the same route in 1989 than they did in the 1930s. For example, the ''Fliegender Hamburger'' express train on the [[Berlin\u2013Hamburg Railway]] took 138 minutes to travel between those two cities in 1933, but typically took 243 minutes on the same route by 1989.\n\nWith the fall of the wall and the opening of the borders in Europe, west-east traffic grew and added the then-dominant north-south transport corridors on a massive scale, especially in Germany and other countries on the former [[Iron Curtain]]. The north-south direction (Rheinschiene and Hamburg \u2013 Stuttgart / Munich) still dominates in western Germany, but since 1989 the importance of the historical west-east axes and the north-south connection between Bavaria and Thuringia / Saxony has increased. A explosion in demand broke out over the GDR transport network, which had been neglected for decades. The number of traffic fatalities rose substantially.
