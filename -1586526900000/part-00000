Roma]], making his debut in [[Serie A]] on 11 February 1990, in a league match against [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]] ended in a 1\u20131 tie, and scoring his first goal the following season. With Roma, he won the [[1990\u201391 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] in 1991, also helping his side to reach an all-Italian [[1991 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]] that season, losing out to Inter, also missing out on the [[1991 Supercoppa Italiana]], which was won by [[U.C.

He then returned to Rome to join [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for the [[2003\u201304 Serie A|2003\u201304 season]]; although he was not a regular first-team member, his performances often proved to be decisive on the pitch, as shown by his goal which enabled Lazio to avoid relegation during the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305 season]]; during his time with the club, he won the [[2003\u201304 Coppa Italia]], also reaching the semi-finals of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Cup]], but missed out on the [[2004 Supercoppa Italiana]] to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. In September 2005, he joined [[Serie B]] side [[Torino F.C.|Torino]], and was one of the protagonists in the ''granata'''s return to the [[2006\u201307 Serie A|top flight]]. His second season with Torino, now in Serie A, saw Muzzi scoring only 3 goals.<ref name=gndesign.it/>\n\nOn September 2006, at the age of 35, and after having turned down a youth coach role at Torino, he agreed a two-year contract with [[Serie C1]]'s [[Calcio Padova|Padova]].

Roma]], making his debut in [[Serie A]] on 11 February 1990, in a league match against [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]] ended in a 1\u20131 tie, and scoring his first goal the following season. With Roma, he won the [[1990\u201391 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] in 1991, also helping his side to reach an all-Italian [[1991 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]] that season, losing out to Inter, also missing out on the [[1991 Supercoppa Italiana]], which was won by [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]].<ref name=gndesign.it/>\n\nMuzzi was loaned to [[Serie B]] club [[Pisa]] in November 1993, where he scored 8 goals in 23 games. He then returned to Roma only to be sold in November 1994 to [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]], where he then spent four seasons, playing a total 144 games with 31 [[Serie A]] goals and 17 in [[Serie B]].<ref name=gndesign.it/>\n\nMuzzi joined [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] during the [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|1999\u20132000 season]], spending four more seasons with the ''zebrette''; in total, he played 103 games for the club, scoring 39 goals, winning the [[2000 UEFA Intertoto Cup]], which enabled the Friuli side to qualify for the [[2000\u201301 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] the following season. He then returned to Rome to join [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for the [[2003\u201304 Serie A|2003\u201304 season]]; although he was not a regular first-team member, his performances often proved to be decisive on the pitch, as shown by his goal which enabled Lazio to avoid relegation during the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305 season]]; during his time with the club, he won the [[2003\u201304 Coppa Italia]], also reaching the semi-finals of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Cup]], but missed out on the [[2004 Supercoppa Italiana]] to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. In September 2005, he joined [[Serie B]] side [[Torino F.C.|Torino]], and was one of the protagonists in the ''granata'''s return to the [[2006\u201307 Serie A|top flight]]. His second season with Torino, now in Serie A, saw Muzzi scoring only 3 goals.<ref name=gndesign.it/>\n\nOn September 2006, at the age of 35, and after having turned down a youth coach role at Torino, he agreed a two-year contract with [[Serie C1]]'s [[Calcio Padova|Padova]].

Trained as an artist and a lawyer, his main interests were literature, philosophy, [[archaeology]], and especially art. Roerich was a dedicated activist for the cause of preserving art and architecture during times of war. He was nominated several times to the long list for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=7805 Nobel Prize] Nomination Database</ref> The so-called [[Roerich Pact]] was signed into law by the United States and most nations of the [[Pan-American Union]] in April 1935.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[Image:Nicholas Roerich, Guests from Overseas.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Guests from Overseas'', 1901 ([[Varangian]]s in Rus')]]\n\nRaised in late-19th-century St. Petersburg, Roerich enrolled simultaneously at [[St. Petersburg University]] and the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] during 1893. He received the title of \"artist\" in 1897 and a degree in law the next year. He found early employment with the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]], whose school he directed from 1906 to 1917. Despite early tensions with the group, he became a member of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s \"[[Mir Iskusstva|World of Art]]\" society; he was president of the society from 1910 to 1916.\n\nArtistically, Roerich became known as his generation's most talented painter of Russia's ancient past, a topic that was compatible with his lifelong interest in archaeology. He also succeeded as a stage designer, achieving his greatest fame as one of the designers for Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]. His best-known designs were for [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin's]] ''[[Prince Igor]]'' (1909 and later productions), and costumes and set for ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913),<ref name=\"NYT\">Julie Besonen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/nyregion/visions-of-a-forgotten-utopian.html \"Visions of a Forgotten Utopian\"], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 6, 2014.</ref> composed by [[Igor Stravinsky]].\n\nAlong with [[Mikhail Vrubel]] and [[Mikhail Nesterov]], Roerich is considered a major representative of [[Russian Symbolism]] in art.<ref name=\"symbolism\">https://books.google.com/books?id=k44-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT22</ref> From an early period of his life, he was influenced by apocrypha and medieval sectarian writings such as the mysterious [[Dove Book]].<ref>\u041d. \u0412. \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430. \u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435 \u041d.\u041a. \u0420\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0445\u0430. \u041c.: \u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u0420\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432, 2003. {{ISBN|5-86988-080-7}}. Page 87.</ref>\n\nAnother of Roerich's artistic subjects was architecture. His acclaimed publication \"Architectural Studies\" (1904\u20131905), consisting of dozens of paintings he made of fortresses, monasteries, churches, and other monuments during two long trips through Russia, inspired his decades-long career as an activist on behalf of artistic and architectural preservation. He also designed religious art for places of worship throughout Russia and [[Ukraine]], most notably the ''Queen of Heaven'' fresco for the Church of the Holy Spirit which the patroness [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Maria Tenisheva]] built near her [[Talashkino]] estate; and the stained glass windows for the [[Datsan Gunzechoinei]] during 1913\u20131915. His designs for the [[Talashkino]] church were so radical that the Orthodox church refused to consecrate the building.<ref name=\"symbolism\" />\n\nDuring the first decade of the 1900s and in the early 1910s, Roerich, largely due to the influence of his wife Helena, developed an interest in eastern religions, as well as alternative (to Christianity) belief systems such as [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]]. Both Roerichs became avid readers of the Vedantist essays of [[Ramakrishna]] and [[Vivekananda]], the poetry of [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''. \n\nThe Roerichs' commitment to occult mysticism increased steadily. It was especially intense during [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution|Russian revolutions of 1917]], to which the couple, like many Russian intellectuals, accorded apocalyptic significance.<ref>John McCannon, \"Apocalypse and Tranquility: The World War I Paintings of Nicholas Roerich,\u201d Russian History/Histoire Russe 30 (Fall 2003): 301-21</ref> The influence of Theosophy, [[Vedanta]], [[Buddhism]], and other mystical topics can be detected not only in many of Roerich's paintings, but in the many short stories and poems Roerich wrote before and after the 1917 revolutions, including the ''Flowers of [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]'' cycle, begun in 1907 and completed in 1921.\n\n===Revolution, emigration, and the United States===\n[[Image:N.Roerich by B.Kustodiev (1913).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nicholas Roerich by [[Kustodiev]]. 1913]]\nAfter the [[February Revolution of 1917]] and the end of the czarist regime, Roerich, a political moderate who valued Russia's cultural heritage more than ideology and party politics, had an active part in artistic politics. With [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Aleksandr Benois]], he participated with the so-called \"Gorky Commission\" and its successor organization, the Arts Union (SDI). Both attempted to gain the attention of the [[Provisional Government]] and [[Petrograd Soviet]] on the need to form a coherent cultural policy and, most urgently, protect art and architecture from destruction and vandalism. \n\nAt the same time, illness forced Roerich to leave the capital and reside in [[Karelia]], the district bordering Finland. He had already quit the presidency of the World of Art society, and he now quit the directorship of the School of the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts. After the October Revolution and the acquisition of power of Lenin's [[Bolshevik Party]], Roerich became increasingly discouraged about Russia's political future. During early 1918, he, Helena, and their two sons [[George de Roerich|George]] and [[Svetoslav Roerich|Svetoslav]] emigrated to Finland.\n\nTwo unresolved historical debates are associated with Roerich's departure. First, it is often claimed that Roerich was a major candidate to direct a people's commissariat of culture (the Soviet equivalent of a ministry of culture) which the Bolsheviks considered establishing during 1917\u20131918, but that he refused to accept the job. In fact, Benois was the most likely choice to direct any such commissariat.  It seems that Roerich was a preferred choice to manage its department of artistic education; the topic is rendered moot by the fact that the Soviets elected not to establish such a commissariat.\n\nSecond, when Roerich later wished to reconcile with the USSR, he maintained that he had not left Soviet Russia deliberately, but that he and his family, living in [[Karelia]], had been isolated from their homeland when the [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] began in [[Finland]]. However, Roerich's extreme hostility to the Bolshevik regime \u2013 prompted not so much by a dislike of communism as by his revulsion at [[Lenin]]'s ruthlessness and his fear that Bolshevism would result in the destruction of Russia's artistic and architectural heritage \u2013 was amply documented.  He illustrated [[Leonid Andreyev]]'s anti-communist polemic \"S.O.S.\" and had a widely published pamphlet, \"Violators of Art\" (1918\u20131919). Roerich believed that \"the triumph of Russian culture would come about through a new appreciation of ancient myth and legend\".<ref>{{cite book  | last = Bowlt  | first = John E.  | title = Moscow and St. Petersburg 1900\u20131920: Art, Life and Culture  | publisher = The Vendome Press  | year = 2008  | location = New York  | pages = 69   | isbn =978-0-86565-191-3}}</ref>\n\nAfter some months in Finland and Scandinavia, the Roerichs relocated to London, arriving in mid-1919. Engrossed with Theosophical mysticism, they now had [[millenarianism|millenarian]] expectations that a new age was imminent, and they wished to travel to India as soon as possible. They joined the English-Welsh chapter of the Theosophical Society. It was in London, in March 1920, that the Roerichs founded their own school of mysticism, ''[[Agni Yoga]]'', which they referred to also as \"the system of living ethics.\" \n\nTo earn passage to India, Roerich worked as a stage designer for [[Thomas Beecham]]'s [[Covent Garden Theatre]], but the enterprise ended unsuccessfully in 1920, and the artist never received full payment for his work. Among the notable people Roerich befriended while in England were the famed British Buddhist [[Christmas Humphreys]], philosopher-author [[H. G. Wells]], and the poet and Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (whose grand-niece [[Devika Rani]] would later marry Roerich's son [[Svetoslav Roerich|Svetoslav]]).\n\nA successful exhibition in London resulted in an invitation from a director at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], offering to arrange for Roerich's art to tour the United States. During the autumn of 1920, the Roerichs traveled to America by sea.\n\n[[File:NicholasRoerichcar.jpg|thumb|Car of Nicolas Roerich in his museum at Naggar]]\n\nThe Roerichs remained in the United States from October 1920 until May 1923. A large exhibition of Roerich's art, organized partly by U.S. impresario Christian Brinton and partly by the [[Chicago Art Institute]], began in New York in December 1920 and toured the country, to San Francisco and back, during 1921 and early 1922.  Roerich befriended acclaimed soprano [[Mary Garden]] of the [[Chicago Opera]] and received a commission to design a 1922 production of [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[The Snow Maiden]]'' for her. During the exhibition, the Roerichs spent significant amounts of time in Chicago, New Mexico, and California.\n\nPolitically, Roerich was at first anti-Bolshevik. He gave lectures and wrote articles to White Russian populations in which he criticized the Soviet Union. However, his aversion to Communism - \"the impertinent monster that lies to humanity\" - changed in America. Roerich claimed that his spiritual masters, the \"Mahatmas\" in the Himalayas, were communicating telepathically with him, through his wife, Helena, who was a mystic and a clairvoyant. \n\nThese beings from an esoteric Buddhist community in India were said to have told Roerich that Russia was destined for a mission on Earth. This led him to formulate his \"Great Plan\", envisaging the unification of millions of Asian peoples through a religious movement using the Future Buddha, or [[Maitreya]], into a \"Second Union of the East.\" Here, the King of [[Shambhala]] would, following the Maitreya prophecies, make his appearance to fight a great battle against all evil forces on Earth. Roerich understood this as \"perfection towards Common Good\". This new polity was to include southwestern [[Altai Krai|Altai]], [[Tuva]], [[Buryatia]], Outer and Inner Mongolia, [[Xinjiang]] and Tibet, with its capital situated in \"Zvenigorod\", the \"City of Tolling Bells\", which was to be built at the foot of [[Mount Belukha]] in Altai. According to Roerich, the same Mahatmas revealed to him in 1922 that he was an incarnation of the [[Fifth Dalai Lama]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Andreyev |first=Alexandre |date=2003 |title=Soviet Russia and Tibet: The Debacle of Secret Diplomacy, 1918-1930s |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Soviet_Russia_and_Tibet.html?id=MqXnOBX4dREC&redir_esc=yid=MqXnOBX4dREC&printsec=frontcover&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Brill |page=294 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, Roerich, the \"practical idealist\", set out to the Himalayas with his wife and son Yuri. Roerich initially settled in Darjeeling, in the same house where the [[13th Dalai Lama]] had stayed during his exile in India. Roerich spent his time painting the Himalayas with visitors such as [[Frederick Marshman Bailey|F. M. Bailey]], [[Lady Lytton]], and members of the [[1924 British Mount Everest expedition|1924 British Everest Expedition]], as well as [[Sonam Wangfel Laden La]], [[Kusho Doring]], and [[Tsarong|Tsarong Shape]], influential Tibetans. According to British intelligence, lamas from the Moru monastery recognized Roerich as the incarnation of the Fifth Dalai Lama due to a [[nevus|mole]] pattern on his right cheek. It was during his stay in the Himalayas that Roerich learned about the flight of the [[9th Panchen Lama]], which he interpreted as the fulfillment of the Matreiya prophecies and the bringing about of the Age of Shambhala.<ref>{{cite book |last=Andreyev |first=Alexandre |date=2003 |title=Soviet Russia and Tibet: The Debacle of Secret Diplomacy, 1918-1930s |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Soviet_Russia_and_Tibet.html?id=MqXnOBX4dREC&redir_esc=yid=MqXnOBX4dREC&printsec=frontcover&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Brill |page=295 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, the Roerichs returned to the West. On his way to America, Roerich stopped at the Soviet embassy in Berlin, where he told the local [[plenipotentiary]] about a Central Asian expedition he wanted to take. He asked for Soviet protection on his way, and shared his impressions of politics in India and Tibet. Roerich commented on the \"occupation of Tibet by the British\", claiming that they \"infiltrate in small parties... conduct extensive anti-Soviet propaganda\" by talking about \"anti-religious activity of the Bolsheviks\". The plenipotentiary later pointed out to one of Roerich's old university classmates, Chicherin, that he had \"absolutely pro-Soviet leanings, which looked somewhat Buddho-Communistic\", and that his son, who spoke 28 Asian languages, helped him in gaining good favor with the Indians and Tibetans.<ref>AVPRF, op. 04, op. 13, papka 87, d. 50117, 1. 13a. Krestinsky to Checherin, 2 January 1925</ref>\n\nThe Roerichs settled in New York City, which became the base of their many American operations. They founded several institutions during these years: ''Cor Ardens'' (\"Flaming Heart\") and ''Corona Mundi'' (\"Crown of the World\"), both of which were meant to unite artists around the globe in the cause of civic activism; the Master Institute of United Arts, an art school with a versatile curriculum, and the eventual home of the first [[Nicholas Roerich Museum]]; and an American Agni Yoga Society. They also joined various theosophical societies; their activities with these groups dominated their lives.\n\n===Asian Expedition (1925\u20131929)===\n[[File:Family Roerich.JPG|thumb|left|230px|<center>Roerich's family (Kullu valley, India)</center>]]\n\nAfter leaving New York, the Roerichs \u2013 together with their son [[George de Roerich|George]] and six friends \u2013 began the five-year-long 'Roerich Asian Expedition' that, in Roerich's own words: \"started from Sikkim through Punjab, Kashmir, [[Ladakh]], the [[Karakoram Mountains]], [[Khotan]], [[Kashgar]], [[Karasahr|Qara Shar]], [[Urumchi]], [[Irtysh]], the [[Altai Mountains]], the [[Gorno-Altai Autonomous Oblast|Oyrot]] region of Mongolia, the Central [[Gobi]], [[Kansu]], [[Tsaidam]], and [[Tibet]]\" with a detour through Siberia to Moscow in 1926. \n\nRoerichs' Asian expedition attracted attention from the foreign services and intelligence agencies of the USSR, the United States, Great Britain, and Japan. In fact, prior to this expedition, Roerich himself solicited the help of the Soviet government and Bolshevik secret police to assist him in his expedition, promising in return to monitor British activities in the area, but received only a lukewarm response from Michail Abramowitsch Trilisser, chief of the Soviet foreign intelligence at that time. \n\nThe Bolsheviks assisted Roerich with logistics while he was traveling through Siberia and Mongolia. However. they did not commit themselves to his reckless utopian project of the Sacred Union of the East \u2013 a spiritual utopia that boiled down to Roerich's ambitious attempts to stir the Buddhist masses of inner Asia to create a highly spiritual cooperative commonwealth under the patronage of Bolshevik Russia. \n\nThe official mission of his expedition, as Roerich put it, was to act as the embassy of [[Western Buddhism]] to Tibet. To the Western media, it was presented as an artistic and scientific enterprise.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxPIHCsXnuI|title = Andrei Znamenski, \"Nicholas Roerich Shambhala Warrior\"}}.</ref> Between the summer of 1927 and June 1928 the expedition was thought to have been lost, as communication with them had ceased. They had, in fact, been attacked in Tibet.\n\nRoerich wrote that only the \"superiority of our firearms prevented bloodshed... In spite of our having Tibet passports, the expedition was forcibly stopped by Tibetan authorities.\" They were detained by the government for five months, and forced to live in tents in sub-zero conditions and to subsist on meagre rations. Five men of the expedition died during this time. In March 1928 they were allowed to leave Tibet, and trekked south to settle in [[India]], where they founded a research center, the Himalayan Research Institute.\n\nIn 1929 Roerich was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] by the [[University of Paris]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author2= |title=Roerich Nominated for Peace Award |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0911F8385A127A93C1A91788D85F4D8285F9 |quote=|work=[[New York Times]] |date=March 3, 1929 |accessdate=2009-02-03 }}</ref> He received two more nominations in 1932 and 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/nomination.php?string=Nicholas%20Roerich&action=simplesearch&submit.x=0&submit.y=0|title=Nomination Database - Peace|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}</ref> His concern for peace resulted in his creation of the [[Pax Cultura]], the \"[[Red Cross]]\" of art and culture. His work for this cause also resulted in the United States and the twenty other nations of the [[Pan-American Union]] signing the [[Roerich Pact]], an early international instrument protecting cultural property, on April 15, 1935 at the White House.\n\n===Manchurian expedition===\nIn 1934\u20131935, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]], then headed by Roerich admirer [[Henry A. Wallace]], sponsored an expedition by Roerich and USDA scientists H. G. MacMillan and James F. Stephens to [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Manchuria]], and China. The expedition's purpose was to collect seeds of plants whitch prevented [[soil erosion]].\n\nThe expedition consisted of two parts. In 1934, they explored the [[Greater Khingan]] mountains and Bargan plateau in western Manchuria. In 1935, they explored parts of Inner Mongolia: the [[Gobi Desert]], [[Ordos Desert]], and [[Helan Mountains]]. The expedition found almost 300 species of [[xerophyte]]s, collected herbs, conducted archeological studies, and found antique manuscripts of great scientific importance.\n\n=== Later life and World War II ===\n[[File:Nehru Gandhi Roerich.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Indira Gandhi]], Nicholas Roerich, and [[Mohammad Yunus (diplomat)|Mohammad Yunus]].

Trained as an artist and a lawyer, his main interests were literature, philosophy, [[archaeology]], and especially art.

He received the title of \"artist\" in 1897 and a degree in law the next year. He found early employment with the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]], whose school he directed from 1906 to 1917. Despite early tensions with the group, he became a member of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s \"[[Mir Iskusstva|World of Art]]\" society; he was president of the society from 1910 to 1916.\n\nArtistically, Roerich became known as his generation's most talented painter of Russia's ancient past, a topic that was compatible with his lifelong interest in archaeology. He also succeeded as a stage designer, achieving his greatest fame as one of the designers for Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]. His best-known designs were for [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin's]] ''[[Prince Igor]]'' (1909 and later productions), and costumes and set for ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913),<ref name=\"NYT\">Julie Besonen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/nyregion/visions-of-a-forgotten-utopian.html \"Visions of a Forgotten Utopian\"], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 6, 2014.</ref> composed by [[Igor Stravinsky]].\n\nAlong with [[Mikhail Vrubel]] and [[Mikhail Nesterov]], Roerich is considered a major representative of [[Russian Symbolism]] in art.<ref name=\"symbolism\">https://books.google.com/books?id=k44-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT22</ref> From an early period of his life, he was influenced by apocrypha and medieval sectarian writings such as the mysterious [[Dove Book]].<ref>\u041d. \u0412. \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430. \u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435 \u041d.\u041a. \u0420\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0445\u0430. \u041c.: \u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u0420\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432, 2003. {{ISBN|5-86988-080-7}}. Page 87.</ref>\n\nAnother of Roerich's artistic subjects was architecture. His acclaimed publication \"Architectural Studies\" (1904\u20131905), consisting of dozens of paintings he made of fortresses, monasteries, churches, and other monuments during two long trips through Russia, inspired his decades-long career as an activist on behalf of artistic and architectural preservation. He also designed religious art for places of worship throughout Russia and [[Ukraine]], most notably the ''Queen of Heaven'' fresco for the Church of the Holy Spirit which the patroness [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Maria Tenisheva]] built near her [[Talashkino]] estate; and the stained glass windows for the [[Datsan Gunzechoinei]] during 1913\u20131915. His designs for the [[Talashkino]] church were so radical that the Orthodox church refused to consecrate the building.<ref name=\"symbolism\" />\n\nDuring the first decade of the 1900s and in the early 1910s, Roerich, largely due to the influence of his wife Helena, developed an interest in eastern religions, as well as alternative (to Christianity) belief systems such as [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]]. Both Roerichs became avid readers of the Vedantist essays of [[Ramakrishna]] and [[Vivekananda]], the poetry of [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''. \n\nThe Roerichs' commitment to occult mysticism increased steadily. It was especially intense during [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution|Russian revolutions of 1917]], to which the couple, like many Russian intellectuals, accorded apocalyptic significance.<ref>John McCannon, \"Apocalypse and Tranquility: The World War I Paintings of Nicholas Roerich,\u201d Russian History/Histoire Russe 30 (Fall 2003): 301-21</ref> The influence of Theosophy, [[Vedanta]], [[Buddhism]], and other mystical topics can be detected not only in many of Roerich's paintings, but in the many short stories and poems Roerich wrote before and after the 1917 revolutions, including the ''Flowers of [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]'' cycle, begun in 1907 and completed in 1921.\n\n===Revolution, emigration, and the United States===\n[[Image:N.Roerich by B.Kustodiev (1913).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nicholas Roerich by [[Kustodiev]]. 1913]]\nAfter the [[February Revolution of 1917]] and the end of the czarist regime, Roerich, a political moderate who valued Russia's cultural heritage more than ideology and party politics, had an active part in artistic politics. With [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Aleksandr Benois]], he participated with the so-called \"Gorky Commission\" and its successor organization, the Arts Union (SDI). Both attempted to gain the attention of the [[Provisional Government]] and [[Petrograd Soviet]] on the need to form a coherent cultural policy and, most urgently, protect art and architecture from destruction and vandalism. \n\nAt the same time, illness forced Roerich to leave the capital and reside in [[Karelia]], the district bordering Finland. He had already quit the presidency of the World of Art society, and he now quit the directorship of the School of the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts. After the October Revolution and the acquisition of power of Lenin's [[Bolshevik Party]], Roerich became increasingly discouraged about Russia's political future. During early 1918, he, Helena, and their two sons [[George de Roerich|George]] and [[Svetoslav Roerich|Svetoslav]] emigrated to Finland.\n\nTwo unresolved historical debates are associated with Roerich's departure. First, it is often claimed that Roerich was a major candidate to direct a people's commissariat of culture (the Soviet equivalent of a ministry of culture) which the Bolsheviks considered establishing during 1917\u20131918, but that he refused to accept the job. In fact, Benois was the most likely choice to direct any such commissariat.  It seems that Roerich was a preferred choice to manage its department of artistic education; the topic is rendered moot by the fact that the Soviets elected not to establish such a commissariat.\n\nSecond, when Roerich later wished to reconcile with the USSR, he maintained that he had not left Soviet Russia deliberately, but that he and his family, living in [[Karelia]], had been isolated from their homeland when the [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] began in [[Finland]]. However, Roerich's extreme hostility to the Bolshevik regime \u2013 prompted not so much by a dislike of communism as by his revulsion at [[Lenin]]'s ruthlessness and his fear that Bolshevism would result in the destruction of Russia's artistic and architectural heritage \u2013 was amply documented.  He illustrated [[Leonid Andreyev]]'s anti-communist polemic \"S.O.S.\" and had a widely published pamphlet, \"Violators of Art\" (1918\u20131919). Roerich believed that \"the triumph of Russian culture would come about through a new appreciation of ancient myth and legend\".<ref>{{cite book  | last = Bowlt  | first = John E.  | title = Moscow and St. Petersburg 1900\u20131920: Art, Life and Culture  | publisher = The Vendome Press  | year = 2008  | location = New York  | pages = 69   | isbn =978-0-86565-191-3}}</ref>\n\nAfter some months in Finland and Scandinavia, the Roerichs relocated to London, arriving in mid-1919. Engrossed with Theosophical mysticism, they now had [[millenarianism|millenarian]] expectations that a new age was imminent, and they wished to travel to India as soon as possible. They joined the English-Welsh chapter of the Theosophical Society. It was in London, in March 1920, that the Roerichs founded their own school of mysticism, ''[[Agni Yoga]]'', which they referred to also as \"the system of living ethics.\" \n\nTo earn passage to India, Roerich worked as a stage designer for [[Thomas Beecham]]'s [[Covent Garden Theatre]], but the enterprise ended unsuccessfully in 1920, and the artist never received full payment for his work. Among the notable people Roerich befriended while in England were the famed British Buddhist [[Christmas Humphreys]], philosopher-author [[H. G. Wells]], and the poet and Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (whose grand-niece [[Devika Rani]] would later marry Roerich's son [[Svetoslav Roerich|Svetoslav]]).\n\nA successful exhibition in London resulted in an invitation from a director at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], offering to arrange for Roerich's art to tour the United States. During the autumn of 1920, the Roerichs traveled to America by sea.\n\n[[File:NicholasRoerichcar.jpg|thumb|Car of Nicolas Roerich in his museum at Naggar]]\n\nThe Roerichs remained in the United States from October 1920 until May 1923. A large exhibition of Roerich's art, organized partly by U.S. impresario Christian Brinton and partly by the [[Chicago Art Institute]], began in New York in December 1920 and toured the country, to San Francisco and back, during 1921 and early 1922.  Roerich befriended acclaimed soprano [[Mary Garden]] of the [[Chicago Opera]] and received a commission to design a 1922 production of [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[The Snow Maiden]]'' for her. During the exhibition, the Roerichs spent significant amounts of time in Chicago, New Mexico, and California.\n\nPolitically, Roerich was at first anti-Bolshevik. He gave lectures and wrote articles to White Russian populations in which he criticized the Soviet Union. However, his aversion to Communism - \"the impertinent monster that lies to humanity\" - changed in America. Roerich claimed that his spiritual masters, the \"Mahatmas\" in the Himalayas, were communicating telepathically with him, through his wife, Helena, who was a mystic and a clairvoyant. \n\nThese beings from an esoteric Buddhist community in India were said to have told Roerich that Russia was destined for a mission on Earth. This led him to formulate his \"Great Plan\", envisaging the unification of millions of Asian peoples through a religious movement using the Future Buddha, or [[Maitreya]], into a \"Second Union of the East.\" Here, the King of [[Shambhala]] would, following the Maitreya prophecies, make his appearance to fight a great battle against all evil forces on Earth. Roerich understood this as \"perfection towards Common Good\". This new polity was to include southwestern [[Altai Krai|Altai]], [[Tuva]], [[Buryatia]], Outer and Inner Mongolia, [[Xinjiang]] and Tibet, with its capital situated in \"Zvenigorod\", the \"City of Tolling Bells\", which was to be built at the foot of [[Mount Belukha]] in Altai. According to Roerich, the same Mahatmas revealed to him in 1922 that he was an incarnation of the [[Fifth Dalai Lama]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Andreyev |first=Alexandre |date=2003 |title=Soviet Russia and Tibet: The Debacle of Secret Diplomacy, 1918-1930s |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Soviet_Russia_and_Tibet.html?id=MqXnOBX4dREC&redir_esc=yid=MqXnOBX4dREC&printsec=frontcover&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Brill |page=294 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, Roerich, the \"practical idealist\", set out to the Himalayas with his wife and son Yuri. Roerich initially settled in Darjeeling, in the same house where the [[13th Dalai Lama]] had stayed during his exile in India. Roerich spent his time painting the Himalayas with visitors such as [[Frederick Marshman Bailey|F. M. Bailey]], [[Lady Lytton]], and members of the [[1924 British Mount Everest expedition|1924 British Everest Expedition]], as well as [[Sonam Wangfel Laden La]], [[Kusho Doring]], and [[Tsarong|Tsarong Shape]], influential Tibetans. According to British intelligence, lamas from the Moru monastery recognized Roerich as the incarnation of the Fifth Dalai Lama due to a [[nevus|mole]] pattern on his right cheek. It was during his stay in the Himalayas that Roerich learned about the flight of the [[9th Panchen Lama]], which he interpreted as the fulfillment of the Matreiya prophecies and the bringing about of the Age of Shambhala.<ref>{{cite book |last=Andreyev |first=Alexandre |date=2003 |title=Soviet Russia and Tibet: The Debacle of Secret Diplomacy, 1918-1930s |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Soviet_Russia_and_Tibet.html?id=MqXnOBX4dREC&redir_esc=yid=MqXnOBX4dREC&printsec=frontcover&hl=zh-CN#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Brill |page=295 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, the Roerichs returned to the West. On his way to America, Roerich stopped at the Soviet embassy in Berlin, where he told the local [[plenipotentiary]] about a Central Asian expedition he wanted to take. He asked for Soviet protection on his way, and shared his impressions of politics in India and Tibet. Roerich commented on the \"occupation of Tibet by the British\", claiming that they \"infiltrate in small parties... conduct extensive anti-Soviet propaganda\" by talking about \"anti-religious activity of the Bolsheviks\". The plenipotentiary later pointed out to one of Roerich's old university classmates, Chicherin, that he had \"absolutely pro-Soviet leanings, which looked somewhat Buddho-Communistic\", and that his son, who spoke 28 Asian languages, helped him in gaining good favor with the Indians and Tibetans.<ref>AVPRF, op. 04, op. 13, papka 87, d. 50117, 1. 13a. Krestinsky to Checherin, 2 January 1925</ref>\n\nThe Roerichs settled in New York City, which became the base of their many American operations. They founded several institutions during these years: ''Cor Ardens'' (\"Flaming Heart\") and ''Corona Mundi'' (\"Crown of the World\"), both of which were meant to unite artists around the globe in the cause of civic activism; the Master Institute of United Arts, an art school with a versatile curriculum, and the eventual home of the first [[Nicholas Roerich Museum]]; and an American Agni Yoga Society. They also joined various theosophical societies; their activities with these groups dominated their lives.\n\n===Asian Expedition (1925\u20131929)===\n[[File:Family Roerich.JPG|thumb|left|230px|<center>Roerich's family (Kullu valley, India)</center>]]\n\nAfter leaving New York, the Roerichs \u2013 together with their son [[George de Roerich|George]] and six friends \u2013 began the five-year-long 'Roerich Asian Expedition' that, in Roerich's own words: \"started from Sikkim through Punjab, Kashmir, [[Ladakh]], the [[Karakoram Mountains]], [[Khotan]], [[Kashgar]], [[Karasahr|Qara Shar]], [[Urumchi]], [[Irtysh]], the [[Altai Mountains]], the [[Gorno-Altai Autonomous Oblast|Oyrot]] region of Mongolia, the Central [[Gobi]], [[Kansu]], [[Tsaidam]], and [[Tibet]]\" with a detour through Siberia to Moscow in 1926. \n\nRoerichs' Asian expedition attracted attention from the foreign services and intelligence agencies of the USSR, the United States, Great Britain, and Japan. In fact, prior to this expedition, Roerich himself solicited the help of the Soviet government and Bolshevik secret police to assist him in his expedition, promising in return to monitor British activities in the area, but received only a lukewarm response from Michail Abramowitsch Trilisser, chief of the Soviet foreign intelligence at that time. \n\nThe Bolsheviks assisted Roerich with logistics while he was traveling through Siberia and Mongolia. However. they did not commit themselves to his reckless utopian project of the Sacred Union of the East \u2013 a spiritual utopia that boiled down to Roerich's ambitious attempts to stir the Buddhist masses of inner Asia to create a highly spiritual cooperative commonwealth under the patronage of Bolshevik Russia. \n\nThe official mission of his expedition, as Roerich put it, was to act as the embassy of [[Western Buddhism]] to Tibet. To the Western media, it was presented as an artistic and scientific enterprise.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxPIHCsXnuI|title = Andrei Znamenski, \"Nicholas Roerich Shambhala Warrior\"}}.</ref> Between the summer of 1927 and June 1928 the expedition was thought to have been lost, as communication with them had ceased. They had, in fact, been attacked in Tibet.\n\nRoerich wrote that only the \"superiority of our firearms prevented bloodshed... In spite of our having Tibet passports, the expedition was forcibly stopped by Tibetan authorities.\" They were detained by the government for five months, and forced to live in tents in sub-zero conditions and to subsist on meagre rations. Five men of the expedition died during this time. In March 1928 they were allowed to leave Tibet, and trekked south to settle in [[India]], where they founded a research center, the Himalayan Research Institute.\n\nIn 1929 Roerich was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] by the [[University of Paris]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author2= |title=Roerich Nominated for Peace Award |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0911F8385A127A93C1A91788D85F4D8285F9 |quote=|work=[[New York Times]] |date=March 3, 1929 |accessdate=2009-02-03 }}</ref> He received two more nominations in 1932 and 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/nomination.php?string=Nicholas%20Roerich&action=simplesearch&submit.x=0&submit.y=0|title=Nomination Database - Peace|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}</ref> His concern for peace resulted in his creation of the [[Pax Cultura]], the \"[[Red Cross]]\" of art and culture. His work for this cause also resulted in the United States and the twenty other nations of the [[Pan-American Union]] signing the [[Roerich Pact]], an early international instrument protecting cultural property, on April 15, 1935 at the White House.\n\n===Manchurian expedition===\nIn 1934\u20131935, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]], then headed by Roerich admirer [[Henry A. Wallace]], sponsored an expedition by Roerich and USDA scientists H. G. MacMillan and James F. Stephens to [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Manchuria]], and China. The expedition's purpose was to collect seeds of plants which prevented [[soil erosion]].\n\nThe expedition consisted of two parts. In 1934, they explored the [[Greater Khingan]] mountains and Bargan plateau in western Manchuria. In 1935, they explored parts of Inner Mongolia: the [[Gobi Desert]], [[Ordos Desert]], and [[Helan Mountains]]. The expedition found almost 300 species of [[xerophyte]]s, collected herbs, conducted archeological studies, and found antique manuscripts of great scientific importance.\n\n=== Later life and World War II ===\n[[File:Nehru Gandhi Roerich.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Indira Gandhi]], Nicholas Roerich, and [[Mohammad Yunus (diplomat)|Mohammad Yunus]].

The police begins to investigate a series of murders in [[Kochi]] targeting police officers. ACP Anil is his close friend and Anwar gets to tag along with the serial killer investigation. The team finds it very difficult to get any trace of evidence and they enlist Andrew to thwart any cyber leaks from the department. As the killings occur in quick succession, the pressure builds up the urgency to solve the case that is closing in on them with four murders. They finally get to know that it is a published American-[[Malayali]] psychologist, Dr. Benjamin Louis who is behind all these killings. He used two mentally disturbed persons as his accomplices and a thug to facilitate things. Dr. Benjamin killed the police officers because his family was broken by police officers and a priest who molested his sister. He planned to do five murders in order target two of them, to make the randomness not reveal the truth. In the end, Benjamin is captured, and killed in a police shooting at a secluded area.

It is a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter.<ref name=\"flowthepsychologyofoptimalexperience\">Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1990). ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience''. New York: Harper and Row. {{ISBN|0-06-092043-2}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2017}} The idea of flow is identical to the feeling of being ''in the zone'' or ''in the groove''. The flow state is an optimal state of ''[[intrinsic motivation]]'', where the person is fully immersed in what they are doing. This is a feeling everyone has at times, characterized by a feeling of great absorption, engagement, fulfillment, and skill\u2014and during which temporal concerns (time, food, ego-self, etc.) are typically ignored.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Csikszentmihalyi|first1=Mihaly|title=Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience|date=1990|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|page=27}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi described flow as \"being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing [[jazz]]. Your whole being is involved, and you're using your skills to the utmost.\"<ref>[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.09/czik_pr.html Geirland, John (1996). \"Go With The Flow\". ''Wired'' magazine, September, Issue 4.09.]</ref>\n\nCsikszentmih\u00e1lyi characterized nine component states of achieving flow including \"challenge-skill balance, merging of action and awareness, clarity of goals, immediate and unambiguous feedback, concentration on the task at hand, paradox of control, transformation of time, loss of self-consciousness, and [[wikt:autotelic|autotelic]] experience\".<ref name=\"flowatwork\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fullagar | first1 = Clive J. | last2 = Kelloway | first2 = E.

If the task is too easy or too difficult, flow cannot occur.

New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n===Motivation===\nA majority of Csikszentmihalyi's most recent work surrounds the idea of [[motivation]] and the factors that contribute to motivation, challenge, and overall success in an individual. One personality characteristic that Csikszentmihalyi researched in detail was that of [[intrinsic motivation]]. Csikszentmihalyi and his colleagues found that intrinsically motivated people were more likely to be goal-directed and enjoy challenges that would lead to an increase in overall [[happiness]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abuhamdeh|first=Sami|author2=Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly|title=The importance of challenge for the enjoyment of intrinsically motivated, goal-directed activities.|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2012|volume=38|issue=3|pmid=22067510|doi=10.1177/0146167211427147|pages=317\u201330}}</ref>\n\nCsikszentmihalyi identified intrinsic motivation as a powerful trait to possess to optimize and enhance positive experience, feelings, and overall [[well-being]] as a result of challenging experiences. The results indicated a new [[personality]] construct, a term Csikszentmihalyi called ''work orientation'', which is characterized by \"achievement, endurance, cognitive structure, order, play, and low impulsivity\". A high level of work orientation in students is said to be a better predictor of grades and fulfillment of long-term goals than any school or household environmental influence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Maria|author2=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|title=Motivation and academic achievement: The effects of personality traits and the quality of experience|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1991|volume=59|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1991.tb00259.x|pages=539\u2013574}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nCsikszentmihalyi is the father of artist and professor [[Christopher Csikszentmih\u00e1lyi]], and [[University of California, Berkeley]] professor of philosophical and religious traditions of [[China]] and [[East Asia]], [[Mark Csikszentmihalyi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ieas.berkeley.edu/faculty/csikszentmihalyi.html|title=Mark Csikszentmihalyi|website=ieas.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Csikszentmihalyi was awarded the Clifton Strengths Prize<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strengths.org/mihaly.shtml|title=2009 Clifton Strength Prize Laureate|author=Nakamura, Jeanne|publisher=[[Clifton Strengths School]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402213824/http://strengths.org/mihaly.shtml|archivedate=2 April 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref> and received the [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize]] at a ceremony in Budapest in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/4546.asp?item=5242|title=President of Hungary honors SBOS Prof. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi with national science prize|date=3 June 2011|publisher=[[Claremont Graduate University]]|accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref> He was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary|Grand Cross Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary]] in 2014.<ref name=\":2\" /> He is a [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences|Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and a member of both the [[National Academy of Education]] and the [[National Academy of Leisure Sciences]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Publications ==\n* Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1975).

It is a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter.<ref name=\"flowthepsychologyofoptimalexperience\">Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1990). ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience''. New York: Harper and Row. {{ISBN|0-06-092043-2}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2017}} The idea of flow is identical to the feeling of being ''in the zone'' or ''in the groove''. The flow state is an optimal state of ''[[intrinsic motivation]]'', where the person is fully immersed in what they are doing. This is a feeling everyone has at times, characterized by a feeling of great absorption, engagement, fulfillment, and skill\u2014and during which temporal concerns (time, food, ego-self, etc.) are typically ignored.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Csikszentmihalyi|first1=Mihaly|title=Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience|date=1990|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|page=27}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi described flow as \"being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing [[jazz]]. Your whole being is involved, and you're using your skills to the utmost.\"<ref>[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.09/czik_pr.html Geirland, John (1996). \"Go With The Flow\". ''Wired'' magazine, September, Issue 4.09.]</ref>\n\nCsikszentmih\u00e1lyi characterized nine component states of achieving flow including \"challenge-skill balance, merging of action and awareness, clarity of goals, immediate and unambiguous feedback, concentration on the task at hand, paradox of control, transformation of time, loss of self-consciousness, and [[wikt:autotelic|autotelic]] experience\".<ref name=\"flowatwork\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fullagar | first1 = Clive J. | last2 = Kelloway | first2 = E.

If the task is too easy or too difficult, flow cannot occur. Both skill level and challenge level must be matched and high; if skill and challenge are low and matched, then apathy results.<ref name=\"Finding Flow\" />{{page needed|date=November 2017}}<!-- ref name defined in [[Template:Mental state]] -->\n\nOne state that Csikszentmihalyi researched was that of the [[autotelic]] personality.<ref name=\"flowatwork\"/> The autotelic personality is one in which a person performs acts because they are intrinsically rewarding, rather than to achieve external goals.<ref>Car, A. ''Positive psychology. The Science of happiness and human strengths''.

New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n===Motivation===\nA majority of Csikszentmihalyi's most recent work surrounds the idea of [[motivation]] and the factors that contribute to motivation, challenge, and overall success in an individual. One personality characteristic that Csikszentmihalyi researched in detail was that of [[intrinsic motivation]]. Csikszentmihalyi and his colleagues found that intrinsically motivated people were more likely to be goal-directed and enjoy challenges that would lead to an increase in overall [[happiness]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abuhamdeh|first=Sami|author2=Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly|title=The importance of challenge for the enjoyment of intrinsically motivated, goal-directed activities.|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2012|volume=38|issue=3|pmid=22067510|doi=10.1177/0146167211427147|pages=317\u201330}}</ref>\n\nCsikszentmihalyi identified intrinsic motivation as a powerful trait to possess to optimize and enhance positive experience, feelings, and overall [[well-being]] as a result of challenging experiences. The results indicated a new [[personality]] construct, a term Csikszentmihalyi called ''work orientation'', which is characterized by \"achievement, endurance, cognitive structure, order, play, and low impulsivity\". A high level of work orientation in students is said to be a better predictor of grades and fulfillment of long-term goals than any school or household environmental influence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Maria|author2=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|title=Motivation and academic achievement: The effects of personality traits and the quality of experience|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1991|volume=59|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1991.tb00259.x|pages=539\u2013574}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nCsikszentmihalyi is the father of artist and professor [[Christopher Csikszentmih\u00e1lyi]], and [[University of California, Berkeley]] professor of philosophical and religious traditions of [[China]] and [[East Asia]], [[Mark Csikszentmihalyi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ieas.berkeley.edu/faculty/csikszentmihalyi.html|title=Mark Csikszentmihalyi|website=ieas.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Csikszentmihalyi was awarded the Clifton Strengths Prize<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strengths.org/mihaly.shtml|title=2009 Clifton Strength Prize Laureate|author=Nakamura, Jeanne|publisher=[[Clifton Strengths School]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402213824/http://strengths.org/mihaly.shtml|archivedate=2 April 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref> and received the [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize]] at a ceremony in Budapest in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/4546.asp?item=5242|title=President of Hungary honors SBOS Prof. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi with national science prize|date=3 June 2011|publisher=[[Claremont Graduate University]]|accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref> He was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary|Grand Cross Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary]] in 2014.<ref name=\":2\" /> He is a [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences|Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and a member of both the [[National Academy of Education]] and the [[National Academy of Leisure Sciences]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Publications ==\n* Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1975).
