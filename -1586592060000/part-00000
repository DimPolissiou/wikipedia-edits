M. Harcourt''', was an Australian writer.\n\n==Life==\nJohn Harcourt was born on the 2 March 1902, in [[Katanning, Western Australia]]. He had two elder sisters, the younger, Jessica. His father was a surveyor and the child of Methodist missionaries to a local Aboriginal encampment. His mother was bi-polar the gene determined through Jessica's descendants. The family suffered her unpredictable psychotic rages when manic. As a small boy, he was sent by train to the Methodist boarding school, Wesley College, Melbourne, but ran away due to bullying in 1915. He did not want to return home because of his mother.\n\nAt first, he survived as a sundowner, walking and doing odd jobs in return for a meal and a place to sleep the night. He also learned skills of a jackaroo and worked on cattle stations.  He turned his hand to almost any job he could get as he travelled up towards Darwin, including day labouring on building and railway construction sites, teaching Charleston, and racing cars. Eventually, he worked his way along the coast to Broome where he got involved in pearling eventually becoming the captain of a [[pearling lugger]]. After three years he found a particularly large and perfectly shaped pearl, and his share of the \u00a313,000 value was \u00a32,000.\n\nThen aged twenty, sick of physical work and wanting to earn a living using his brain, he flew down to Perth and there educated himself in the State Library with the intention of becoming a writer. There he met and married his first wife, Sylvia, with whom he had a son, Peter. The marriage ended after only four years when his wife fell in love with a doctor. She took Peter, but Harcourt sent money for his education. During that time he reconnected and worked with his father, a surveyor. He began sending articles to newspapers.\n\nEventually, he was offered a job writing for ''Truth'' and so moved to Melbourne. He specialised in articles on business and investment. The newspaper was a Fabian and mildly sensationalist rag. Harcourt became a member of the Australian Communist Party and began working on another book, ''Upsurge'', published in 1934. It the first novel to be banned by the Commonwealth Book Censorship Board, on the grounds that it portrayed a (fictional) communist uprising in a positive light. Most of the books were burned, but Harcourt managed to rescue three original copies. At around this time, his colleague, the journalist and writer, Betty Rowlands, introduced him to Fay, who became his second wife.\n\nBetty also introduced him to Justus Jorgensen and the libertarian crowd of artists around Montsalvat at Eltham, not far to the northeast of Melbourne. There, due to the [[Great Depression in Australia|Great Depression]] and the shortage of affordable housing, Harcourt became interested in building houses in pis\u00e9 de terre. He researched the technique in the architecture library at Melbourne University and began teaching himself by building his own place, called Clay Newnham (after the Harcourt family seat in Oxfordshire, England). He kept writing as a journalist during the time he was learning the rammed earth technique, how to build smoke-free fireplaces and all the technical aspects of traditional vernacular style for the material. 1945 when war broke out, Harcourt, relieved to be too old to fight as a soldier, took a job in intelligence as an editor of letters from soldiers to their families. It involving using a razor to cut out anything the government did not want the populace to know.\n\nIn 1955, he divorced Fay due to an affair with Diana Elizabeth Whitehead. Diana became pregnant so they travelled to England where she could divorce her first husband, and where she gave birth in 1956 to their first daughter, Amanda Sarah Anne. They married in a registry office shortly afterwards and then drove through France to Italy. There they lived for six months in a villa in a small village on the Adriatic Coast called Ronchi.\n\nThey returned Australia in 1957 and rented a bungalow at Bilgola Beach (on the Pittwater Peninsula to the north of Sydney.) Harcourt designed a solar passive house, based mostly on Diana's ideas and her memories of their villa in Italy, and so they named it Ronchi. Built at the top of Beauty Drive at Whale Beach it features Australia's first flat concrete roof using a design of Harcourt's which has never since been replicated. It has the unique feature of dipping by three inches in the centre to capture water as an aid to cooling and insulation. A covering of gravel was used to slow evaporation.\n\nDue to two duodenal ulcers, which were then believed to be due to stress, Diana talked Harcourt into retiring. He had built fourteen houses in the Eltham area and still owned several of them, so he drew an income from rent. Diana had an inheritance which was managed by the Public Trustee, which Harcourt found to be over conservative and not doing well. He convinced Diana to get a personal stockbroker and accountant and used his own knowledge gained during the years of reporting on finance to assist in decisions. The plan worked well financially.\n\nSoon after they moved into the new house in January 1959, Diana gave birth to their second child, Nicholina Sandra Caroline at the Seventh Day Adventist Hospital on the North Shore. It became the beginning of the unhappiness in their marriage because Diana had deliberately conceived for a second time without consulting Harcourt. He never forgave her. They began drinking. The alcoholism slowly became a serious problem for both of them, with Diana hospitalised three times due to coma. \nIn 1968, when Russia invaded Czechoslovakia, he left the Communist party and became anti-communist. Through his connections with Montsalvat he became friend with many members of the Sydney Push and established a dinner club at which they met once a month. He sold one of his houses and bought a yacht; sailing became his main pastime on weekends.\n\nThe marriage stayed together unhappily for fourteen and a half years until he died of heart failure and double pneumonia on 3 September 1971. His death was a deliberate choice. Three months earlier, he had stopped taking the drug that prevented the build-up of fluid in his lungs, knowing what the outcome would be. He talked it over with the family doctor and Diana, to gain their consent that when the time came, there would be no emergency revival. He had a horror of senility and did not want to live long enough to experience frontal-lobe dementia, one of the effects of lack of oxygen supply to the brain caused by heart failure.\n\nA strict atheist who disapproved of all religion, an existentialist, and libertarian, he was buried in the non-denominational section of Mona Vale Cemetery.\n\n<!-- There is a paragraph on his mudbrick houses in an old textbook on mud-brick and rammed earth architecture in Australia, sitting on the shelves of the architecture library at Sydney University - but I although I saw it years ago, I have not just now been able to trace it. -->\nHe was mentioned twice in the Australian editions of ''Who's Who'' in 1954 and 55.

Here, in a building known as the \u201cSecret Chamber\u201d (''MilSil''), he was initiated by Hong Eup-Bi, a woman member of the Olive Tree who was regarded as a \u201cshaman\u201d.<ref>Holland and Holland (2014), 203.</ref> The Victory Altar claims that on 15 October 1980, Hong recognized in Cho \u201cthe Victor Christ\u201d and \u201cGod incarnated\u201d, leading him to leave the Olive Tree and establish his own new religious movement, the Victory Altar (SeungNiJeDan), in [[Bucheon]].<ref>Introvigne (2017).</ref> The movement grew rapidly; on August 12, 1991, the headquarters in Bucheon were completed.<ref>Holland and Holland (2014), 203.</ref> In a few years, the Victory Altar gathered some 400,000 followers, mostly in South Korea, but with branches in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref>Introvigne (2017).</ref>\n\nBy 2017, membership had declined to around 100,000. The decline came after Cho\u2019s arrest in 1994 and death in 2004.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Controversies==\n\nBecause of his criticism of Jesus Christ and his own messianic claims, Cho encountered the hostility of Korean Christian churches, which promoted media campaigns against the Victory Altar and accused its founder of various wrongdoings.<ref>Introvigne (2017).</ref> In 1994, Cho was arrested and spent in jail seven of the last ten years of his life.<ref>Holland and Holland (2014), 203.</ref> He was accused both of fraud and of having instigated the murder of six ex-members turned militant opponents of the Victory Altar. Cho was convicted for fraud, found not guilty in a first case about the murders in 1996, then found guilty in a second trial in 2004, and sentenced to death, but again found not guilty on appeal. South Korea has three degrees of judgement: the prosecutor appealed the decision favorable to Cho before the Supreme Court, but Cho died just before the trial, on June 19, 2004.<ref>Introvigne (2017).</ref> The prosecution of Cho and above all his death, since many followers believed him to be physically immortal, were serious blows for the movement, which started a phase of decline, although by 2017 it still maintained 40 Victory Altars in Korea with some 100,000 followers.<ref>Introvigne (2017).</ref>\n==Beliefs==\nAccording to the Victory Altar, all the great sacred scriptures of humanity, including the [[Bible]], the classics of [[Buddhism]], and the ancient prophetic books of Korea announce the \u201coriginal promise\u201d of God, i.e. that humans may achieve physical immortality. This is the only real immortality, and the notion that a soul separated from the body will live eternally in Heaven is a false interpretation of the holy scriptures.<ref>Han (2016).</ref> It was also part of the message of Jesus Christ, thus evidencing that he was a false prophet, and in fact was \u201cthe only son of Satan.\u201d<ref>Kwon (1992), 96.</ref> Additional evidence that Jesus Christ was not a divine incarnation comes, according to the Victory Altar, from the fact that he was the son of a Roman soldier named [[Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera|Pantera]], who might have raped his mother [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], and that he married [[Mary Magdalene]], widely regarded as a fallen woman.<ref>Kwon (1992), 98\u201399.</ref> The sources for these accusations are the Roman anti-Christian philosopher [[Celsus]] and the book [[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]], which also influenced the phenomenally successful 2003 novel [[The Da Vinci Code]] by [[Dan Brown]].<ref>Kwon (1992), 98\u2013101.</ref>\nJesus Christ is not part of the succession of divine incarnations and prophets proposed by the Victory Altar. This starts with [[Adam and Eve]], who were divine and immortal and formed the original Trinity with God. Not being omnipotent, however, God could not prevent Satan from capturing Adam and Eve and depriving them of their immortality.<ref>Lee (2000), 20.</ref> 6,000 years, and a succession of divine prophets, were needed before God could overcome Satan and offer again physical immortality to humans. A first set of prophets includes [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], and [[Dan (son of Jacob)|Dan]].<ref>Headquarters of SeungNiJeDan (2017), 11.</ref> The latter was the legitimate successor of Jacob (as proved, the Victory Altar maintains, by the Biblical [[Book of Genesis]], 49:16) and eventually his tribe, the Danites, migrated to Korea, whose mythical first king was called [[Dangun]], or King Dan.<ref> Han (2017).</ref> Korea hosted the second set of prophets, including the founder of the Olive Tree, Park Tae-Seon, the woman who initiated Cho, Hong Eup-Bi, and Cho himself, as well as the founders of two other Korean new religions, [[Choe Je-u]] of [[Donghak]] and [[Gang Il-Sun]] of [[Jeungsanism]].<ref>Headquarters of SeungNiJeDan (2017), 12.</ref>\n\nThe crucial role, in the sacred history of humanity as narrated by the Victory Altar, belongs to Cho himself, which through his initiation of 1980 overcame the \u201cblood of Satan,\u201d which is still present in all humans and is identified with the ego, and became \u201cthe Victor Christ,\" i.e. a divine incarnation through which God came to Earth, defeated Satan, and finally restored physical immortality for humans.<ref>Kwon (1992), 120\u2013121.</ref>. In fact, Cho was the first Human after Adam who became physically immortal. Although he had to depose (or, rather, transform) his body because of the malice of his opponents, the movement believes that he is still physically present and guides the religious services of the Victory Altar, where his image is projected through videos.<ref>Introvigne (2017).</ref> Services are held daily, and five yearly feasts are also celebrated: the Victory Day (October 15), Cho\u2019s Birthday, which is called Christmas (August 12), Messiah Day (December 25),Holy Dew Spirit Day (January 1), and Parent Day (May 8).<ref>Headquarters of SeungNiJeDan (2017), 36-37.</ref>\n\nThe \u201cHoly Dew,\u201d also called in the movement \u201cHidden Manna,\u201d is a smoke, fog, or fire that, the movement claims. emanated from Cho\u2019s body and portraits during his lifetime and continues to emanate from his photographs today. The Victory Altar insists that the Holy Dew is real and can be captured by cameras.<ref>Lee (2000), 89\u201397.</ref> It serves both as evidence of Cho\u2019s divinity and as spiritual nourishment for his followers.<ref>Introvigne (2017).</ref> According to the Victory Altar, Cho also proved his divine status by complying with the \u201cfive covenants\u201d he had promised to his followers: the destruction of world [[Communism]]; the stopping of typhoons coming to South Korea; making harvests in Korea abundant; stopping the rainy seasons (June 15-July 15) there; preventing a new Korean war and unifying the two Koreas. The latter covenant, the movement believes, is in the process of being realized, and at any rate Cho has miraculously stopped both the return of Communism to Russia and [[North Korea]]'s aggression plans against South Korea.<ref>Han (2016), 135\u2013141.</ref>\n\nThe main promise of Cho, however, is that at least some humans may recover physical immortality. To this aim, belief in Cho is not sufficient, and the Victory Altar teaches that pretending that mere belief can save is just another of the misconceptions propagated by Jesus Christ.

Pocket Monsters: Sapphire|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are [[role-playing video game]]s developed by [[Game Freak]], published by [[The Pok\u00e9mon Company]] and [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. They are the first installments in the third generation of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series]], also known as the \"advanced generation\". After years of Nintendo being the sole publisher of the franchise in all regions, The Pok\u00e9mon Company co-published the games for the first time since the establishment of the joint-owned company in 1998. They were first released in Japan in late 2002 and internationally in 2003. ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald]]'', an enhanced version, was released two years later in each region. [[Video game remake|Remakes]] of the two games, titled [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'']], were released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] worldwide in November 2014, exactly twelve years to the date of the original ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' release date, with the exception of Europe, where it released a week later.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly unchanged from the previous games; the player controls the main character from an [[overhead perspective]], and the controls are largely the same as those of previous games. As with previous games, the main objectives are to catch all of the Pok\u00e9mon in the games and defeat the [[Elite Four]]; also like their predecessors, the games' main subplot involves the player character defeating a criminal organization that attempts to take over the region. New features, such as double battles, [[Pok\u00e9mon abilities]], and 135 new Pok\u00e9mon were added. Owing to the increased capabilities of the Game Boy Advance, four players may be [[Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable|connected to each other]] at a time instead of the previous limit of two. Additionally, the games can be connected to an [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]] or other third-generation ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games.\n\n''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' received mostly positive reviews, though critics were divided in their assessment of the games, especially on the gameplay and graphics. Most of the complaints focused on gameplay not changing much in relation to previous generations, and connectivity issues versus past generations of the game. With the popularity of ''Pok\u00e9mon'' waning at the time, the games sold less than previous generations; however, they were still critical and commercial successes, with Ruby Version and Sapphire Version being the 2nd and 3rd best selling games of 2003 respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Riley |first1=David M. |title=THE NPD GROUP REPORTS ANNUAL 2003 U.S. VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY DRIVEN BY CONSOLE SOFTWARE SALES |url=https://www.npd.com/press/releases/press_040126a.htm |website=The NPD Group, Inc. |accessdate=24 January 2004}}</ref> With over 16 million copies sold, they are the [[List of best-selling Game Boy Advance video games|best-selling titles for the Game Boy Advance]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon}}\nThe basic mechanics of ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' are largely the same as their predecessors'. As with all ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games for [[handheld console]]s, gameplay is in [[third-person (video games)|third-person]], overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens: a [[overworld|field map]], in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. Players begin the game with one Pok\u00e9mon, and can capture more using [[Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s. They can also use their Pok\u00e9mon to battle other Pok\u00e9mon. When the player [[random encounter|encounters a wild Pok\u00e9mon]] or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a [[turn-based]] battle screen where the Pok\u00e9mon fight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/389/389660p1.html|title=Pokemon: Ruby Version|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]]|first=Craig|last=Harris|date=March 17, 2003|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}</ref> During battle, the player may [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Pok\u00e9mon moves|use a move]], use an item, switch their active Pok\u00e9mon, or flee, although fleeing is not an option in battles against trainers. All Pok\u00e9mon have [[hit points]] (HP); when a Pok\u00e9mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle until it is revived.

During battle with a wild Pok\u00e9mon, the player may use a Pok\u00e9 Ball on them. If successful, the Pok\u00e9mon will be added to the player's active party, or stored if the player already has the maximum six Pok\u00e9mon in their party.<ref>''Pok\u00e9mon Sapphire Version instruction booklet'', p. 37</ref> Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP, status effects such as Paralysis or Sleep, and the strength of the Pok\u00e9 Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Pok\u00e9 Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is.<ref>''Pok\u00e9mon Sapphire Version instruction booklet'', p. 32</ref> Other trainers' Pok\u00e9mon cannot be captured.\n\n===New features===\n{{see also|List of generation III Pok\u00e9mon}}\nThe most prominent change in the battle mechanics is the introduction of double battles, in which the opposing parties each use two Pok\u00e9mon at the same time. Consequently, certain Pok\u00e9mon [[Pok\u00e9mon moves|moves]] can affect multiple combatants at once.<ref>Hollinger, p.3</ref> Multi battles were added alongside double battles. They are identical to double battles, but there are two trainers to a side, each controlling one of the two Pok\u00e9mon sent out. Also new to the games are [[Pok\u00e9mon abilities|innate abilities]] and [[Pok\u00e9mon natures|natures]]; the former is shared by every Pok\u00e9mon of a certain species, while the latter may vary among a particular species. Abilities grant their holders certain powers in battle, such as immunity against certain [[Pok\u00e9mon types|types]] of moves or strengthening a certain type of move. Natures, like innate abilities, affect the strength of Pok\u00e9mon in battle; however, they affect the stats of the Pok\u00e9mon rather than directly affecting the strength of the moves.<ref>Hollinger, p.6</ref> Another stat introduced in ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' is Condition, an important factor in [[Pok\u00e9mon Contests]], mini-games in which participants perform moves before a judge. Both Pok\u00e9mon and their moves have a Condition, which is increased by using Pok\u00e9blocks, which are candies made from berries.<ref>Hollinger, p.76</ref> ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' are the first games in the series to have weather conditions, such as harsh sunlight, rain, hail, and sandstorms, that also affect battles in unique ways.<ref name=\"bingo\">{{cite web | url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/pokemon-omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire-speculation-bingo-130033465.html | title=Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire speculation bingo | publisher=Yahoo News Network | date=May 8, 2014 | accessdate=May 8, 2014 | author=Twang, Kuyani}}</ref> Secret bases were added as a one off feature where players could open up a hole in the world and customize the area with various items picked up in-game.

Even looking at the world in a different perspective sometimes provided inspiration for the creatures. \"First we select an insect and after that we add essential elements to the insects to make it more like Pokemon, such as adding some hard shape to it, to be more like steel,\" Sugimori said, describing the process of creating a Pok\u00e9mon.<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite interview |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211042435/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |title=Nintendo Interviews: Game Freak on Pokemon! |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |first1=Junichi |last1=Masuda |subject-link1=Junichi Masuda |first2=Shigeki |last2=Morimoto |subject-link2=Shigeki Morimoto |first3=Ken |last3=Sugimori |subject-link3=Ken Sugimori |interviewer=Stuart Bishop |date=May 30, 2003 |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |archivedate=February 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs the Game Boy Advance was able to handle enhanced graphics, ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, as opposed to the previous limit of two.

The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nMasuda stated that the basic philosophy of all ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games is communication; in the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' series, this is manifested in trading and battling with other people.

It was released in Japan on September 16, 2004, North America on May 1, 2005, Australia on June 9, 2005, and Europe on October 21, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/data/921905.html|title=Pokemon Emerald Info |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[GameFAQs]]|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the gameplay is as that of ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', ''Emerald'' introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who are locked in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two [[legendary Pok\u00e9mon]] begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pok\u00e9mon [[Rayquaza]] to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', in ''Emerald'', two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair (fixed in games thereafter). After the [[Elite Four]] is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if they are called on their Pok\u00e9Nav. Also, Pok\u00e9mon [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are animated in battle like they were in ''Pok\u00e9mon Crystal''.<ref name=\"ignemerald\"/> Possibly the most significant addition is the [[Battle Frontier]], an expanded version of the [[Battle Tower]] in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''.\n\nAnother change made in ''Emerald'' is the addition of Team Magma's base on the side of Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Seafloor Cavern. Both teams make repeated efforts to alter the landscape. Team Magma attempts to make a volcano erupt, while Team Aqua tries to steal a weather-altering Pok\u00e9mon. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with them when they get to the Battle Frontier.\n\n''Emerald'' has been generally well received.<ref>{{cite web|title=IGN: Reader Reviews For: Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Version|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=September 9, 2007|url=http://rr.gameboy.ign.com/rrobj/pocket/object/692344/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004608/http://rr.gameboy.ign.com/rrobj/pocket/object/692344/|archivedate=July 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Reader Reviews at Game Rankings|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=September 9, 2007|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/comments/921905}}</ref> The game has an aggregate rating of 77% on [[GameRankings]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Reviews at Game Rankings|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=September 9, 2007|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/921905.asp}}</ref> ''GameSpot'' gave it a 7.5 out of 10;<ref>{{cite web|title=Gamespot Summary of Pok\u00e9mon Emerald|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=September 9, 2007|url=http://www.gamespot.com/search.html?type=11&stype=all&tag=search%3Bbutton&om_act=convert&om_clk=search&qs=pokemon+emerald}}</ref> ''IGN'' gave it an \"Impressive\" rating of 8.0 out of 10.<ref name=\"ignemerald\">{{cite web|title=IGN: Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Version|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=September 9, 2007|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/objects/692/692344.html}}</ref> ''Eurogamer'', however, gave ''Emerald'' a score of 6 out of 10.

Pocket Monsters: Sapphire|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are [[role-playing video game]]s developed by [[Game Freak]], published by [[The Pok\u00e9mon Company]] and [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. They are the first installments in the third generation of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series]], also known as the \"advanced generation\". After years of Nintendo being the sole publisher of the franchise in all regions, The Pok\u00e9mon Company co-published the games for the first time since the establishment of the joint-owned company in 1998. They were first released in Japan in late 2002 and internationally in 2003. ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald]]'', an enhanced version, was released two years later in each region. [[Video game remake|Remakes]] of the two games, titled [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'']], were released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] worldwide in November 2014, exactly twelve years to the date of the original ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' release date, with the exception of Europe, where it released a week later.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly unchanged from the previous games; the player controls the main character from an [[overhead perspective]], and the controls are largely the same as those of previous games. As with previous games, the main objectives are to catch all of the Pok\u00e9mon in the games and defeat the [[Elite Four]]; also like their predecessors, the games' main subplot involves the player character defeating a criminal organization that attempts to take over the region. New features, such as double battles, [[Pok\u00e9mon abilities]], and 135 new Pok\u00e9mon were added. Owing to the increased capabilities of the Game Boy Advance, four players may be [[Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable|connected to each other]] at a time instead of the previous limit of two. Additionally, the games can be connected to an [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]] or other third-generation ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games.\n\n''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' received mostly positive reviews, though critics were divided in their assessment of the games, especially on the gameplay and graphics. Most of the complaints focused on gameplay not changing much in relation to previous generations, and connectivity issues versus past generations of the game. With the popularity of ''Pok\u00e9mon'' waning at the time, the games sold less than previous generations; however, they were still critical and commercial successes, with Ruby Version and Sapphire Version being the 2nd and 3rd best selling games of 2003 respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Riley |first1=David M. |title=THE NPD GROUP REPORTS ANNUAL 2003 U.S. VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY DRIVEN BY CONSOLE SOFTWARE SALES |url=https://www.npd.com/press/releases/press_040126a.htm |website=The NPD Group, Inc. |accessdate=24 January 2004}}</ref> With over 16 million copies sold, they are the [[List of best-selling Game Boy Advance video games|best-selling titles for the Game Boy Advance]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon}}\nThe basic mechanics of ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' are largely the same as their predecessors'. As with all ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games for [[handheld console]]s, gameplay is in [[third-person (video games)|third-person]], overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens: a [[overworld|field map]], in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. Players begin the game with one Pok\u00e9mon, and can capture more using [[Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s. They can also use their Pok\u00e9mon to battle other Pok\u00e9mon. When the player [[random encounter|encounters a wild Pok\u00e9mon]] or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a [[turn-based]] battle screen where the Pok\u00e9mon fight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/389/389660p1.html|title=Pokemon: Ruby Version|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]]|first=Craig|last=Harris|date=March 17, 2003|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}</ref> During battle, the player may [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Pok\u00e9mon moves|use a move]], use an item, switch their active Pok\u00e9mon, or flee, although fleeing is not an option in battles against trainers. All Pok\u00e9mon have [[hit points]] (HP); when a Pok\u00e9mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle until it is revived. If the player's Pok\u00e9mon defeats the opposing Pok\u00e9mon (causes it to faint), it receives [[experience points]]. After accumulating enough experience points, it will [[experience point#Level-based progression|level up]]; most Pok\u00e9mon [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] into a new species of Pok\u00e9mon when they reach a certain level.<ref>''Pok\u00e9mon Sapphire Version instruction booklet'', p. 35</ref>\n\nApart from battling, capturing Pok\u00e9mon is the most essential element of ''Pok\u00e9mon'' gameplay. During battle with a wild Pok\u00e9mon, the player may use a Pok\u00e9 Ball on them. If successful, the Pok\u00e9mon will be added to the player's active party, or stored if the player already has the maximum six Pok\u00e9mon in their party.<ref>''Pok\u00e9mon Sapphire Version instruction booklet'', p. 37</ref> Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP, status effects such as Paralysis or Sleep, and the strength of the Pok\u00e9 Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Pok\u00e9 Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is.<ref>''Pok\u00e9mon Sapphire Version instruction booklet'', p. 32</ref> Other trainers' Pok\u00e9mon cannot be captured.\n\n===New features===\n{{see also|List of generation III Pok\u00e9mon}}\nThe most prominent change in the battle mechanics is the introduction of double battles, in which the opposing parties each use two Pok\u00e9mon at the same time. Consequently, certain Pok\u00e9mon [[Pok\u00e9mon moves|moves]] can affect multiple combatants at once.<ref>Hollinger, p.3</ref> Multi battles were added alongside double battles. They are identical to double battles, but there are two trainers to a side, each controlling one of the two Pok\u00e9mon sent out. Also new to the games are [[Pok\u00e9mon abilities|innate abilities]] and [[Pok\u00e9mon natures|natures]]; the former is shared by every Pok\u00e9mon of a certain species, while the latter may vary among a particular species. Abilities grant their holders certain powers in battle, such as immunity against certain [[Pok\u00e9mon types|types]] of moves or strengthening a certain type of move. Natures, like innate abilities, affect the strength of Pok\u00e9mon in battle; however, they affect the stats of the Pok\u00e9mon rather than directly affecting the strength of the moves.<ref>Hollinger, p.6</ref> Another stat introduced in ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' is Condition, an important factor in [[Pok\u00e9mon Contests]], mini-games in which participants perform moves before a judge. Both Pok\u00e9mon and their moves have a Condition, which is increased by using Pok\u00e9blocks, which are candies made from berries.<ref>Hollinger, p.76</ref> ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' are the first games in the series to have weather conditions, such as harsh sunlight, rain, hail, and sandstorms, that also affect battles in unique ways.<ref name=\"bingo\">{{cite web | url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/pokemon-omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire-speculation-bingo-130033465.html | title=Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire speculation bingo | publisher=Yahoo News Network | date=May 8, 2014 | accessdate=May 8, 2014 | author=Twang, Kuyani}}</ref> Secret bases were added as a one off feature where players could open up a hole in the world and customize the area with various items picked up in-game. Players who linked up with others who set up secret bases were able to battle an [[Non-player character|NPC]] version of that trainer within their secret base.\n\nLike [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'', ''Silver'']], and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal|Crystal]]'', ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' keep track of real-life time; this influences events like tides and berry plant growth. However, unlike their predecessors, ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' do not differentiate between day and night. Also, due to the differences in the technical specifications of Game Boy link cables and Game Boy Advance link cables, ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' cannot be linked with Pok\u00e9mon games of previous generations; one cannot battle with or trade to the previous generations.<ref>''Pok\u00e9mon Sapphire Version instruction booklet'', p. 50.</ref>\n\n===Connectivity to other devices===\n''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' have limited [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]] support.

The design of Hoenn was based on the Japanese island and region of [[Kyushu]]; however Hoenn is rotated 90\u00b0 relative to Kyushu, as [[Junichi Masuda]] felt that it would provide a better gameplay balance.<ref name=\"hiddenpower\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=29|title=Hidden Power of Masuda |publisher=Game Freak|date=September 9, 2004|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}</ref> Like Kyushu, Hoenn possesses many smaller islands, and part of the region is dominated by sea routes, several of which contain areas where the player can dive underwater.\n\n===Story===\nLike other ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games, ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''{{'}}s gameplay is [[linear gameplay|linear]]; the main events occur in a fixed order.<ref>Hollinger, p.12</ref> The [[protagonist]] of ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' is a child who has recently moved to a small town called Littleroot Town. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either [[Treecko]], [[Torchic]], or [[Mudkip]] to protect Professor Birch, the regional professor, from an attacking [[Poochyena]]. After defending Birch, the player is taken to his lab and receives the chosen Pok\u00e9mon as their [[starter Pok\u00e9mon]]. After that the player encounters May/Brendan, the child of Professor Birch. The player's rival, who appears as the professor's child, is also a [[Pok\u00e9mon Trainer]] and occasionally battles the player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/17508/page_6.html|title=Walkthrough: Badge #1|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=August 2, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709011448/http://guides.ign.com/guides/17508/page_6.html|archivedate=July 9, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The games' two main goals are defeating the eight Gym Leaders, proving oneself worthy of challenging the Elite Four and Champion to become the new Champion and completing the [[Pok\u00e9dex]] by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 202 Pok\u00e9mon available between ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''.

As with its predecessors, [[Ken Sugimori]] was the art director, although these were the first games in which he did not single-handedly produce all of the art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/data/471243.html|title=Pokemon Ruby Version Info|website=GameFAQs|accessdate=July 18, 2008}}</ref> When asked where his design team came up with the ideas for all of the new Pok\u00e9mon, Sugimori stated that they got their ideas from past experiences in their childhood involving nature, animals, and the media and then base them on insects. Even looking at the world in a different perspective sometimes provided inspiration for the creatures. \"First we select an insect and after that we add essential elements to the insects to make it more like Pokemon, such as adding some hard shape to it, to be more like steel,\" Sugimori said, describing the process of creating a Pok\u00e9mon.<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite interview |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211042435/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |title=Nintendo Interviews: Game Freak on Pokemon! |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |first1=Junichi |last1=Masuda |subject-link1=Junichi Masuda |first2=Shigeki |last2=Morimoto |subject-link2=Shigeki Morimoto |first3=Ken |last3=Sugimori |subject-link3=Ken Sugimori |interviewer=Stuart Bishop |date=May 30, 2003 |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |archivedate=February 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs the Game Boy Advance was able to handle enhanced graphics, ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, as opposed to the previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics engine in order to keep the game simple and not overly confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nMasuda stated that the basic philosophy of all ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games is communication; in the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' series, this is manifested in trading and battling with other people. When asked about the new concept of [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Double battles|double battles]], the developers noted that they tried to focus more on the original one-on-one battles as the main type of competition and only added the double battles as a \"new challenge\".

Pocket Monsters: Emerald|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an enhanced version of ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', developed by Game Freak, published by The Pok\u00e9mon Company and Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It was released in Japan on September 16, 2004, North America on May 1, 2005, Australia on June 9, 2005, and Europe on October 21, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/data/921905.html|title=Pokemon Emerald Info |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[GameFAQs]]|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the gameplay is as that of ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', ''Emerald'' introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who are locked in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two [[legendary Pok\u00e9mon]] begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pok\u00e9mon [[Rayquaza]] to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', in ''Emerald'', two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair (fixed in games thereafter). After the [[Elite Four]] is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if they are called on their Pok\u00e9Nav. Also, Pok\u00e9mon [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are animated in battle like they were in ''Pok\u00e9mon Crystal''.<ref name=\"ignemerald\"/> Possibly the most significant addition is the [[Battle Frontier]], an expanded version of the [[Battle Tower]] in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''.\n\nAnother change made in ''Emerald'' is the addition of Team Magma's base on the side of Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Seafloor Cavern. Both teams make repeated efforts to alter the landscape. Team Magma attempts to make a volcano erupt, while Team Aqua tries to steal a weather-altering Pok\u00e9mon. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier.
