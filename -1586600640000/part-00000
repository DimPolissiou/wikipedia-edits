He played [[college football]] at [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] and the [[College of San Mateo]] as a [[quarterback]]. He was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. Edelman primarily plays on offense and as a punt returner; he has also been pressed into service as a [[cornerback]] at times when the Patriots have been shorthanded on defense.\n\nEdelman is one of the most productive receivers in post-season history, ranking second overall (behind [[Jerry Rice]]) in both post-season receiving yards and post-season receptions.  He has played in four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]], [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] and [[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]). In each of the last three, he led all wide receivers in receiving yards. He was named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] for Super Bowl LIII, in which he had 10 catches for 141 yards receiving, more than half of his team's total receiving yardage. He holds the Super Bowl records for career punt returns (8) and first-half receptions in a single game (7).\n\n==Early years==\nEdelman was born in [[Redwood City, California]], to Angela (n\u00e9e Gole) and Frank Edelman, a mechanic who owns an A-1 Auto Tech.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/12659571 |title=Julian Edelman enjoys his moment |date=February 19, 2015 |website=ESPN.com}}</ref> He has two siblings, Jason and Nicole.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 Julian Edelman profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131230846/http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 |date=January 31, 2012 }}, Patriots.com; accessed November 6, 2015.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=5247 |title=California Birth Index, 1905\u20131995 |publisher=Ancestry |access-date=February 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/16/julian-edelman-took-back-road-nfl/Qbv5QnIQh9BpRn9ZetrSRO/story.html |title=Julian Edelman took the 'back road' to the NFL |website=BostonGlobe.com |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> Originally raised as a [[Christians|Christian]], his ancestry includes [[Greeks|Greek]], [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], Irish, [[Ashkenazi Jewish]], and [[Germans|German]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |title=Edelman MOT? \u00bb Kaplan's Korner on Jews and Sports |date=September 21, 2009 |website=Njjewishnews.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108212449/http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref> His mother was born in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada, to German parents who had lived in [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"relnt1\">Stated in ''Relentless: A Memoir'', Julian Edelman, 2017, Hachette Books</ref>\n\nHe was the quarterback for [[Woodside High School (California)|Woodside High School]] in [[Woodside, California]], and as a senior, he led the Wildcats to a 13\u20130 record in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/woodside-wildcats-(woodside,ca)/football-fall-04/schedule.htm |title=Schedule \u2013 Woodside Wildcats 2004 Football (CA) |website=www.maxpreps.com |access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref> During his high school career, Edelman had 2,237 yards and 29 touchdowns passing, in addition to 964 yards and 13 [[touchdown]]s rushing.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yang |first=Nicole |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/10/24/5-things-we-learned-from-julian-edelmans-new-memoir-relentless |title=5 things we learned from Julian Edelman's new memoir 'Relentless' |date=October 24, 2017 |work=Boston.com |access-date=December 25, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nAfter high school, Edelman spent a year attending the [[College of San Mateo]].

He played [[college football]] at [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] and the [[College of San Mateo]] as a [[quarterback]]. He was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. Edelman primarily plays on offense and as a punt returner; he has also been pressed into service as a [[cornerback]] at times when the Patriots have been shorthanded on defense.\n\nEdelman is one of the most productive receivers in post-season history, ranking second overall (behind [[Jerry Rice]]) in both post-season receiving yards and post-season receptions.  He has played in four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]], [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] and [[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]). In each of the last three, he led all wide receivers in receiving yards. He was named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] for Super Bowl LIII, in which he had 10 catches for 141 yards receiving, more than half of his team's total receiving yardage. He holds the Super Bowl records for career punt returns (8) and first-half receptions in a single game (7).\n\n==Early years==\nEdelman was born in [[Redwood City, California]], to Angela (n\u00e9e Gole) and Frank Edelman, a mechanic who owns an A-1 Auto Tech.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/12659571 |title=Julian Edelman enjoys his moment |date=February 19, 2015 |website=ESPN.com}}</ref> He has two siblings, Jason and Nicole.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 Julian Edelman profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131230846/http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 |date=January 31, 2012 }}, Patriots.com; accessed November 6, 2015.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=5247 |title=California Birth Index, 1905\u20131995 |publisher=Ancestry |access-date=February 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/16/julian-edelman-took-back-road-nfl/Qbv5QnIQh9BpRn9ZetrSRO/story.html |title=Julian Edelman took the 'back road' to the NFL |website=BostonGlobe.com |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> Originally raised as a [[Christians|Christian]], his ancestry includes [[Greeks|Greek]], [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], Irish, [[Ashkenazi Jewish]], and [[Germans|German]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |title=Edelman MOT? \u00bb Kaplan's Korner on Jews and Sports |date=September 21, 2009 |website=Njjewishnews.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108212449/http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref> His mother was born in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada, to German parents who had lived in [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"relnt1\">Stated in ''Relentless: A Memoir'', Julian Edelman, 2017, Hachette Books</ref>\n\nHe was the quarterback for [[Woodside High School (California)|Woodside High School]] in [[Woodside, California]], and as a senior, he led the Wildcats to a 13\u20130 record in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/woodside-wildcats-(woodside,ca)/football-fall-04/schedule.htm |title=Schedule \u2013 Woodside Wildcats 2004 Football (CA) |website=www.maxpreps.com |access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref> During his high school career, Edelman had 2,237 yards and 29 touchdowns passing, in addition to 964 yards and 13 [[touchdown]]s rushing.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yang |first=Nicole |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/10/24/5-things-we-learned-from-julian-edelmans-new-memoir-relentless |title=5 things we learned from Julian Edelman's new memoir 'Relentless' |date=October 24, 2017 |work=Boston.com |access-date=December 25, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nAfter high school, Edelman spent a year attending the [[College of San Mateo]].

It is located conveniently, connecting four international borders i.e. [[China]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Bhutan]]. It also connects the North-East with the Indian mainland and is connected with all other districts of West Bengal. Located at the foothills of [[Eastern Himalaya]], Siliguri is a trading and transportation hub. Over time, Siliguri has grown from a village into a commercially progressive city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siligurismc.in/history-of-siliguri.php|title=History of Siliguri-SMC|accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref> Siliguri has been ruled by a few eminent dynasties like [[Chogyal]]s of the [[Chogyal|Namgyal dynasty]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=two|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607215048/http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=two|archive-date=20 May 2019|title=History of Darjeeling, Sikkim, Nepal|publisher=Official website of Nepal Army}}</ref> and its countless strategic offerings were realised after independence.<ref name=\"Siliguri municipal corporation - A historical profile\">{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|title=History of Siliguri|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Age history===\nAccording to Sailen Debnath, \"Siliguri\" means a stack of pebbles or stones. Till the 19th century this region was called as \"Shilchaguri\" when there was dense Dolka forest covering the area. Because of its appeal as an agricultural village, the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] captured Siliguri making it the southernmost part of their kingdom until the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] interfered. Because of it [[Kirati people|Kirati]] and [[Nepalis]] came to settle in this region.<ref name=\"History of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=http://asiscwb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siliguri-Handbook-1.pdf|website=asiscwb.org|title=Middle age history of Siliguri|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt that time a river ([[Mahananda River|Mahananda]]) port, South of Siliguri in [[Phansidewa]] had an important role in having trade bond with [[Malda City|Malda]], [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]]. This riverine trade line was thus used by the [[Bhutan]]ese and [[Sikkimese people|Sikkimese]] to bring goods into their mainland.\n\n===Modern history===\nSiliguri started as a small area i.e. now Saktigarh, southern part of city, on the bank of [[Mahananda River]]. [[Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1815 signed between Britain-Nepal, changed the prospect of Siliguri. As it became a point of transit with [[Darjeeling]] hills and [[Nepal]] mainland. 1815 onwards, Siliguri started growing rapidly as a small city due to its strategic convenience of trade. In 1865, the British captured Darjeeling & the entire [[Dooars]] region to build tea plantations and export the produce to England. For easy exportation they introduced the [[Siliguri Town railway station]] which stands to this day, and introduced the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway|Toy train]] from the station to Darjeeling in 1880. This helped Siliguri to gain Sub-Divisional town status in 1907.<ref name=\"Historical profile of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|title=Modern history of Siliguri|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Siliguri Corridor]]\" was formed when [[Bengal]] was divided into [[West Bengal]] and [[East Pakistan]] (later Bangladesh) in 1947, with Sikkim later merging with India in 1975.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sikkim Voters OK Merger With India |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19750416&id=vDogAAAAIBAJ&pg=7319,25549 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=16 April 1975|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> At this point many immigrants came to settle here for better facilities which led to an increased population.

The growth rate of Siliguri was 57.8% during 1971- 1981, considering this growth, Siliguri came under Integrated Urban Development Project program in 1981. Siliguri touched 46.83% of population growth rate in 1981\u20131991. A treaty between India and China for trade through [[Nathu La|Nathu La Pass]], has expedited development and prospects of Siliguri as an international transportation and logistics hub. Later in 1994 Siliguri built a Municipal corporation which has been responsible for the civic infrastructure and administration of the city of Siliguri. Siliguri has now achieved the status of becoming the [[List of metropolitan area in West Bengal|2nd]] largest metropolitan city in [[West Bengal]], after [[Kolkata]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliguri.gov.in/|title=Siliguri in recent days|website=www.siliguri.gov.in|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{OSM Location map\n| width=380| height=250| zoom=11\n| coord={{coord|26|44|0|N|88|22|30|E}}| float=left|caption='''Places in the North-eastern portion of Siliguri  subdivision in Darjeeling district'''<br/>CT: census town,  R: rural/ urban centre, MC: municipal corporation, F: facilities<br/>Abbreviations used in names \u2013 TG for Tea Garden, Jn RS for Junction Railway Station<br/>New Jalpaiguri Junction railway station is in Jalpaiguri district<br/>Owing to space constraints in the small map, the actual locations in a larger map may vary slightly\n|mark-coord1={{coord|26|41|30|N|88|22|25|E}}| label-pos1=right|label1= Bara Mohansingh| numbered1=CT| mark-title1= [[Bara Mohansingh]] (CT)|label-color1= #800000 |label-size1=11| mark-size1=12|shape1=l-circle|shape-color1= #A40000|shape-outline1=white|label-offset-x1=2\n|mark-coord2={{coord|26|42|20|N|88|19|30|E}}| label-pos2=right|label2=Bairatisal | numbered2=CT| mark-title2= [[Bairatisal]] (CT)\n|mark-coord3={{coord|26|42|51|N|88|22|20|E}}| label-pos3=right|label3= Jitu | numbered3=CT| mark-title3= [[Jitu, Siliguri]] (CT)\n|mark-coord4={{coord|26|45|30|N|88|25|6|E}}| label-pos4=left|label4= Kalkut | numbered4=CT| mark-title4= [[Kalkut, Siliguri]] (CT)\n|mark-coord5={{coord|26|42|10|N|88|24|30|E}}| label-pos5=right|label5= Mathapari | numbered5=CT| mark-title5= [[Mathapari]] (CT)\n|mark-coord6={{coord|26|44|10|N|88|21|0|E}}| label-pos6=left|label6= Tari | numbered6=CT| mark-title6= [[Tari, Siliguri]] (CT)\n|mark-coord7={{coord|26|44|0|N|88|24|0|E}}| label-pos7=right |label7=Siliguri| numbered7=MC| mark-title7= [[Siliguri]] (M)| shape-color7=black| label-size7=13|label-color7=black <!-- make the subject of the article stand out with black colors -->\n|mark-coord8={{coord|26|43|30|N|88|23|18|E}}| label-pos8=left|label8= Matigarahat| numbered8=R| mark-title8= [[Matigarahat]] (R)| shape-color8=#C42222\n|mark-coord9={{coord|26|47|0|N|88|23|7|E}}| label-pos9=left|label9= Mohorgon TG| numbered9=R| mark-title9= [[Mohorgon Tea Garden]] (R)| shape-color9=#C42222\n|mark-coord10={{coord|26|42|50|N|88|21|14|E}} | label-pos10=left|label10= University of North Bengal| numbered10=F| mark-title10= [[University of North Bengal]] (F) |shape-color10=#967117\n|mark-coord11={{coord|26|41|0|N|88|22|50|E}} | label-pos11=right|label11= North Bengal Medical College| numbered11=F| mark-title11= [[North Bengal Medical College]] (F) |shape-color11=#967117\n|mark-coord12={{coord|26|40|25|N|88|26|38|E}} | label-pos12=left|label12= New Jalpaiguri Jn RS| numbered12=F| mark-title12= [[New Jalpaiguri Junction railway station]] (F) |shape-color12=#967117\n|mark-coord13={{coord|26|45|10|N|88|19|10|E}}|label13= Balason River| label-color13 = #77A1CB| label-angle13=45| label-pos13=top| label-size13=10| mark-size13=0| mark-title13=none\n|mark-coord14={{coord|26|47|0|N|88|24|40|E}}|label14= Mahananda |labela14 = River| label-color14 = #77A1CB| label-angle14=40| label-pos14=top| label-size14=10| mark-size14=0| mark-title14=none}}\n\n===Location===\nSiliguri located at the foothills of the eastern Himalayas at a location of {{coord|26.71|N|88.43|E|}}.

It also connects the North-East with the Indian mainland and is connected with all other districts of West Bengal. Located at the foothills of [[Eastern Himalaya]], Siliguri is a trading and transportation hub.

Till the 19th century this region was called as \"Shilchaguri\" when there was dense Dolka forest covering the area. Because of its appeal as an agricultural village, the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] captured Siliguri making it the southernmost part of their kingdom until the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] interfered. Because of it [[Kirati people|Kirati]] and [[Nepalis]] came to settle in this region.<ref name=\"History of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=http://asiscwb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siliguri-Handbook-1.pdf|website=asiscwb.org|title=Middle age history of Siliguri|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt that time a river ([[Mahananda River|Mahananda]]) port, South of Siliguri in [[Phansidewa]] had an important role in having trade bond with [[Malda City|Malda]], [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]]. This riverine trade line was thus used by the [[Bhutan]]ese and [[Sikkimese people|Sikkimese]] to bring goods into their mainland.\n\n===Modern history===\nSiliguri started as a small area i.e. now Saktigarh, southern part of city, on the bank of [[Mahananda River]]. [[Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1815 signed between Britain-Nepal, changed the prospect of Siliguri. As it became a point of transit with [[Darjeeling]] hills and [[Nepal]] mainland. 1815 onwards, Siliguri started growing rapidly as a small city due to its strategic convenience of trade. In 1865, the British captured Darjeeling & the entire [[Dooars]] region to build tea plantations and export the produce to England. For easy exportation they introduced the [[Siliguri Town railway station]] which stands to this day, and introduced the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway|Toy train]] from the station to Darjeeling in 1880. This helped Siliguri to gain Sub-Divisional town status in 1907.<ref name=\"Historical profile of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|title=Modern history of Siliguri|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Siliguri Corridor]]\" was formed when [[Bengal]] was divided into [[West Bengal]] and [[East Pakistan]] (later Bangladesh) in 1947, with Sikkim later merging with India in 1975.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sikkim Voters OK Merger With India |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19750416&id=vDogAAAAIBAJ&pg=7319,25549 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=16 April 1975|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> At this point many immigrants came to settle here for better facilities which led to an increased population.

The growth rate of Siliguri was 57.8% during 1971- 1981, considering this growth, Siliguri came under Integrated Urban Development Project program in 1981. Siliguri touched 46.83% of population growth rate in 1981\u20131991. A treaty between India and China for trade through [[Nathu La|Nathu La Pass]], has expedited development and prospects of Siliguri as an international transportation and logistics hub. Later in 1994 Siliguri built a Municipal corporation which has been responsible for the civic infrastructure and administration of the city of Siliguri.

Community gardens can function as gathering places for neighbors, promote healthier eating, and showcase art to raise ecological awareness (see [[Karl Linn]]). Other gardens resemble European \"[[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]]\" gardens, with plots where individuals and families can grow vegetables and flowers; including a number which began as \"[[victory garden]]s\" during [[World War II]].\n\nSome community gardens are devoted entirely to creating ecological [[Urban open space|green space]] or habitat, growing flowers, educational purposes, or providing access to gardening to those who otherwise could not have a garden, such as the elderly, recent immigrants, urban dwellers, or the [[Homelessness in the United States|homeless]]. Some gardens are worked as community farms with no individual plots at all, similar to [[urban farms]].\n\nCommunity gardens can vary in shape, size, and function, but the goal of bridging the gap between people and nature is central to their creation. These gardens weaken the divide between nature and culture, city and country, and producer and consumer.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Sustainable Food Systems|last=Biel|first=Robert|publisher=UCL Press|isbn=|location=|pages=90\u2013107|chapter=Built systems, biomimicry and urban food-growing}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Certom\u00e0|first=Chiara|date=2015|title=Critical Urban Gardening|url=|journal=RCC Perspectives, Think Global, Eat Local: Exploring Foodways|volume=No.1|pages=13\u201318}}</ref>\n\nThe largest community garden in the nation is reported to be Shiloh Field Community Garden in [[Denton, TX]], measuring at 14.5 acres of land.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wylie|first1=Melissa|title=Largest community garden in U.S. feeds the hungry in Denton|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140404-largest-community-garden-in-u.s.-feeds-needy-in-denton.ece|accessdate=2 August 2015|work=The Dallas Morning News|publisher=James M.

This holds true whether they are sponsored by public agencies, city departments, large non-profits, or (most commonly) a coalition of different entities and groups.\n\nWhether the garden is run as a co-op by the gardeners themselves (common in [[New York City]], [[Boston]] and other East Coast cities) or managed by a public or non-profit agency, plot holders typically are asked to pay a modest fee each year and to abide by a set of rules. Many gardens encourage activities such as work days, fundraisers, and social gatherings. Community garden organizers typically say that \"growing community\" is as important as growing vegetables; or, as the [[American Community Gardening Association]] (ACGA) puts it: \"In community gardening, 'community' comes first.\"\n\nCommunity gardening in the United States overlaps to some extent with the related but distinct movement to encourage local food production, local farmers' markets and [[community supported agriculture]] farms (CSAs). Leases and rules prevent some, though not all, community gardeners from selling their produce commercially, although their gardens may donate fresh fruits and vegetables to local food pantries, cooperatives, and homeless members of their community.\n\nHowever, community gardens offer ideal sites for local farmers markets, and gardeners often seek farmers to provide space-intensive crops such as corn or potatoes. They also can hire farmers to provide services such as plowing and providing mulch and manure. In turn, small farmers can reach a wider audience and consumer base by drawing on community gardeners and their contacts. Although the two approaches are distinct, both can be effective ways to produce local food in urban areas, safeguard green space, and contribute to food security. Community gardens also increase environmental aesthetics, promote neighborhood attachment and social involvement.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite journal | pmid = 21680931 | doi=10.2105/AJPH.2010.300111 | volume=101 | title=The influence of social involvement, neighborhood aesthetics, and community garden participation on fruit and vegetable consumption | pmc=3134498 | year=2011 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1466\u201373 | last1 = Litt | first1 = JS | last2 = Soobader | first2 = MJ | last3 = Turbin | first3 = MS | last4 = Hale | first4 = JW | last5 = Buchenau | first5 = M | last6 = Marshall | first6 = JA}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal | pmid = 20184990 | doi=10.1016/j.jada.2009.11.023 | volume=110 | title=Review of the nutritional implications of farmers' markets and community gardens: a call for evaluation and research efforts | date=March 2010 | journal=J Am Diet Assoc | pages=399\u2013408 | last1 = McCormack | first1 = LA | last2 = Laska | first2 = MN | last3 = Larson | first3 = NI | last4 = Story | first4 = M}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19167954 | doi=10.1016/j.jada.2008.10.051 | volume=109 | title=Impact of garden-based youth nutrition intervention programs: a review | date=February 2009 | journal=J Am Diet Assoc | pages=273\u201380 | last1 = Robinson-O'Brien | first1 = R | last2 = Story | first2 = M | last3 = Heim | first3 = S}}</ref>\n\nIn an interesting variant on the practice of reclaiming bombed-out areas for community gardens (also practiced during WWII in the ghettos of Eastern Europe), in American inner-cities, community groups have reclaimed abandoned or vacant lots for garden plots.

Darlyn Rundberg Del Boca, a University of Washington student, saw an opportunity to promote children's gardening with a focus on growing for the local Neighbors in Need [[food bank]] program, and with the help of a Seattle Councilmember obtained permission to use part of the Picardo family's truck garden in northeast Seattle with the City of Seattle renting the land for the cost of its real estate taxes. The first garden consisted of a large central garden plot planted by children from the nearby elementary school and their parents; families who volunteered to help were offered smaller individual plots around the perimeter of the central plot. The City subsequently purchased the Picardo farm, and the program of renting individual garden plots arising from the first efforts was named 'P-Patch' in honor of the Picardo family's contribution. The P-Patch program continued to grow and currently consists of 1900 plots in 68 locations with a total of {{convert|23|acre|m2}} of land, with additions planned each year, and the tradition of growing for local food banks resulted in 12.3 tons of food donated in 2008.<ref name=HessSeattle>{{cite web|last=Hess|first=David J.|title=Case Studies of Community Gardens: Seattle's P Patches|url=http://www.davidjhess.org/SeattleCG.pdf|work=www.davidjhess.org|accessdate=22 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013001300/http://www.davidjhess.org/SeattleCG.pdf|archive-date=2009-10-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n;Olympia, WA\n\nIn 2010 the city of Olympia adopted a plan to create up to six community gardens.

Community gardens can function as gathering places for neighbors, promote healthier eating, and showcase art to raise ecological awareness (see [[Karl Linn]]). Other gardens resemble European \"[[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]]\" gardens, with plots where individuals and families can grow vegetables and flowers; including a number which began as \"[[victory garden]]s\" during [[World War II]].\n\nSome community gardens are devoted entirely to creating ecological [[Urban open space|green space]] or habitat, growing flowers, educational purposes, or providing access to gardening to those who otherwise could not have a garden, such as the elderly, recent immigrants, urban dwellers, or the [[Homelessness in the United States|homeless]]. Some gardens are worked as community farms with no individual plots at all, similar to [[urban farms]].\n\nCommunity gardens can vary in shape, size, and function, but the goal of bridging the gap between people and nature is central to their creation. These gardens weaken the divide between nature and culture, city and country, and producer and consumer.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Sustainable Food Systems|last=Biel|first=Robert|publisher=UCL Press|isbn=|location=|pages=90\u2013107|chapter=Built systems, biomimicry and urban food-growing}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Certom\u00e0|first=Chiara|date=2015|title=Critical Urban Gardening|url=|journal=RCC Perspectives, Think Global, Eat Local: Exploring Foodways|volume=No.1|pages=13\u201318}}</ref>\n\nThe largest community garden in the nation is reported to be Shiloh Field Community Garden in [[Denton, TX]], measuring at 14.5 acres of land.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wylie|first1=Melissa|title=Largest community garden in U.S. feeds the hungry in Denton|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140404-largest-community-garden-in-u.s.-feeds-needy-in-denton.ece|accessdate=2 August 2015|work=The Dallas Morning News|publisher=James M.

This holds true whether they are sponsored by public agencies, city departments, large non-profits, or (most commonly) a coalition of different entities and groups.\n\nWhether the garden is run as a co-op by the gardeners themselves (common in [[New York City]], [[Boston]] and other East Coast cities) or managed by a public or non-profit agency, plot holders typically are asked to pay a modest fee each year and to abide by a set of rules. Many gardens encourage activities such as work days, fundraisers, and social gatherings. Community garden organizers typically say that \"growing community\" is as important as growing vegetables; or, as the [[American Community Gardening Association]] (ACGA) puts it: \"In community gardening, 'community' comes first.\" \n\nCommunity gardening in the United States overlaps to some extent with the related but distinct movement to encourage local food production, local farmers' markets and [[community supported agriculture]] farms (CSAs). Leases and rules prevent some, though not all, community gardeners from selling their produce commercially, although their gardens may donate fresh fruits and vegetables to local food pantries, cooperatives, and homeless members of their community.\n\nHowever, community gardens offer ideal sites for local farmers markets, and gardeners often seek farmers to provide space-intensive crops such as corn or potatoes. They also can hire farmers to provide services such as plowing and providing mulch and manure. In turn, small farmers can reach a wider audience and consumer base by drawing on community gardeners and their contacts. Although the two approaches are distinct, both can be effective ways to produce local food in urban areas, safeguard green space, and contribute to food security. Community gardens also increase environmental aesthetics, promote neighborhood attachment and social involvement.<ref name=autogenerated2>Litt et al 2011.

[[First Nations]] peoples also gardened with a community approach (''Buffalo Bird Woman's Garden''{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} paints a picture of gardens among the [[Hidatsa]]), likely for generations before the arrival of waves of immigrants.\n\nIn the 1890s, Detroit became the first city to use vacant lots for a municipally sponsored urban gardening program. This program, known as \u201cPingree\u2019s Potato Patches\u201d after [[Hazen S. Pingree|Mayor Hazen Pingree]], was in response to the 1893 economic recession which left the city's industrial laborers unemployed.

Focusing on creating equitable and respectful spaces where farming knowledge can be shared is crucial to creating a just food system for all community members. Communities hold specific knowledge and expertise about their local environment, and therefore, community members have the power to play a central role in the creation of their local food system.<ref name=\":3\" /> Partnerships between academic researchers, farmers/practitioners, advocates, and community members will filter knowledge of healthy foods and farming techniques throughout the community as a whole.

Garden members within their respective gardens democratically organize themselves to set bylaws that are consistent with City policy. These gardeners often self-impose garden dues as a membership requirement to cover common expenses.

The result is called ''[[Digital data|digital]] [[group representation|representation]]'' or, more specifically, a ''[[digital image]]'', for the object, and ''digital form'', for the signal. In modern practice, the digitized data is in the form of [[binary number]]s, which facilitate computer processing and other operations, but, strictly speaking, digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format; the [[decimal]] or any other [[number system]] that can be used instead.\n\nDigitization is of crucial importance to data processing, storage and transmission, because it \"allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled\".<ref>McQuail, D (2000) McQuail's Mass Communication Theory (4th edition), Sage, London, pp. 16\u201334</ref> Though analog data is typically more stable, digital data can more easily be shared and accessed and can, in theory, be propagated indefinitely, without generation loss, provided it is [[digital preservation|migrated to new, stable formats as needed]]. This is why it is a favored way of preserving information for many organisations around the world.\n\n== Process ==\n\nThe term digitization is often used when diverse forms of information, such as an object, text, sound, image or voice, are converted into a single [[binary code]]. The core of the process is the compromise between the capturing device and the player device so that the rendered result represents the original source with the most possible fidelity, and the advantage of digitization is the speed and accuracy in which this form of information can be transmitted with no degradation compared with analog information.\n\nDigital information exists as one of two digits, either 0 or 1. These are known as [[bit]]s (a contraction of ''binary digits'') and the sequences of 0s and 1s that constitute information are called [[byte]]s.<ref>Flew, Terry. 2008. New Media An Introduction. South Melbourne. 3rd Edition. South Melbourne: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nAnalog signals are [[continuum (theory)|continuously]] variable, both in the number of possible values of the signal ''at'' a given [[time]], as well as in the number of points in the signal ''in'' a given period of time. However, digital signals are [[discrete signal|discrete]] in both of those respects \u2013 generally a finite sequence of integers \u2013 therefore a digitization can, in practical terms, only ever be an [[approximation]] of the signal it represents.\n\nDigitization occurs in two parts:\n;Discretization: The reading of an analog signal ''A'', and, at regular time intervals ([[sampling frequency|frequency]]), [[sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] the value of the signal at the point. Each such reading is called a ''sample'' and may be considered to have infinite precision at this stage;\n;Quantization: Samples are rounded to a fixed set of numbers (such as integers), a process known as [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]].\nIn general, these can occur at the same time, though they are conceptually distinct.\n\nA series of digital integers can be transformed into an analog output that approximates the original analog signal. Such a transformation is called a [[DA conversion]]. The [[sampling rate]] and the number of bits used to represent the integers combine to determine how close such an approximation to the analog signal a digitization will be.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Digitizing Estonian popular science magazine Horisont.jpg|thumb|Digitization of the first number of Estonian popular science magazine Horisont published in January 1967.]]\nThe term is used to describe, for example, the [[image scanner|scanning]] of analog sources (such as printed [[photo]]s or taped [[video]]s) into computers for editing, 3D scanning that creates [[3D modeling]] of an object's surface, and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] (where sampling rate is often measured in [[kilohertz]]) and [[Graphics pipeline#Modeling transformation|texture map]] transformations. In this last case, as in normal photos, the sampling rate refers to the [[Image resolution|resolution]] of the image, often measured in [[pixel]]s per inch.\n\nDigitizing is the primary way of storing images in a form suitable for [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] and [[computer]] processing, whether scanned from two-dimensional analog originals or captured using an [[image sensor]]-equipped device such as a [[digital camera]], [[tomography|tomographical]] instrument such as a [[CAT scan]]ner, or acquiring precise dimensions from a real-world object, such as a [[motor vehicle|car]], using a [[3D scanner|3D scanning]] device.<ref>[http://www.digimation.com/home/?Content=digitalcarshome.html Digimation for 3D Models, 3D Software and Creative Services<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDigitizing is central to making digital representations of geographical features, using raster or vector images, in a [[geographic information system]], i.e., the creation of [[electronic map]]s, either from various geographical and satellite imaging (raster) or by digitizing traditional paper [[map]]s or [[Chart|graphs]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitizer.sourceforge.net|title=Open source Engauge Digitizer for digitizing graphs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitizeit.de|title=DigitizeIt graph digitizing software}}</ref> (vector).\n\n\"Digitization\" is also used to describe the process of populating [[database]]s with files or data.  While this usage is technically inaccurate, it originates with the previously proper use of the term to describe that part of the process involving digitization of analog sources, such as printed pictures and brochures, before uploading to target databases. One of the leading indian IT firm is [[Routeget]].\n\nDigitizing may also used in the field of apparel, where an image may be recreated with the help of [[Machine embroidery#Computerized machine embroidery|embroidery digitizing]] software tools and saved as [[Machine embroidery#Design files|embroidery machine]] code. This machine code is fed into an embroidery machine and applied to the fabric. The most supported format is DST file.

The conversion process of analog to digital consists of two processes: sampling and quantizing.\n\nDigitization of personal multimedia, such as [[home movies]], [[Photographic slide|slides]], and [[photographs]] is a popular method of preserving and sharing older repositories. Slides and photographs may be scanned using an [[image scanner]], but videos are more difficult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/112029/goodbye_vhs_hello_dvd.html|title=Good-Bye, VHS; Hello, DVD|author=Paul Heltzel}}</ref> Slides can be digitized with different film scanner by [[Nikon]] such as the Nikon Coolscan 5000ED.\n\nAnother examples of digitization is [[VisualAudio]] process of the Swiss ''Fonoteca Nazionale'' in [[Lugano]], that extract and reconstruct the sound from a high-resolution picture of a record.\n\n==Analog texts to digital==\n{{main|Book digitization}}\n\nAt most 1 in 20 texts have been digitized as of 2006.<ref>Kelly, Kevin (May&nbsp;14, 2006). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/magazine/14publishing.html Scan This Book!]\".

In many cases, [[archives]] have replaced [[microfilm]]ing with digitization as a means of preserving and providing access to unique documents.\n\n==Implications==\nThis shift to digitization in the contemporary media world has created implications for traditional mass media products. However, these \"limitations are still very unclear\".<ref name=\"McQuail-p28\">McQuail, Denis (2000). ''McQuail's Mass Communication Theory''.  4th ed. Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage. p. 28.</ref> The more technology advances, the more converged the realm of mass media will become with less need for traditional communication technologies. For example, the Internet has transformed many communication norms, creating more efficiency for not only individuals, but also for businesses.

Vol. 5, No. 2 (2005): 213\u201337.</ref>  Since the mid-1800s, books were printed on [[pulp (paper)|wood-pulp paper]], which turns acidic as it decays. Deterioration may advance to a point where a book is completely unusable. In theory, if these widely circulated titles are not treated with de-acidification processes, the materials upon those acid pages will be lost. As digital technology evolves, it is increasingly preferred as a method of preserving these materials, mainly because it can provide easier access points and significantly reduce the need for physical storage space.\n\nCambridge University Library is working on the [[Cambridge Digital Library]], which will initially contain digitised versions of many of its most important works relating to science and religion. These include examples such as Isaac Newton's personally annotated first edition of his [[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-ADV-B-00039-00001/|publisher=Cambridge University Digital Library|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref> as well as college notebooks<ref>{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Trinity College Notebook|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03996/|publisher=Cambridge University Digital Library|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=College Notebook|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-04000/|publisher=Cambridge University Digital Library|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>  and other papers,<ref>{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Newton Papers|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/newton|publisher=Cambridge University Digital Library|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref> and some Islamic manuscripts such as a [[Quran]]<ref>{{cite web|title=al-Qur\u02bc\u0101n|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-NN-00003-00075/|publisher=Cambridge University Digital Library|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref> from Tipu Sahib's library.\n\nGoogle, Inc. has taken steps towards attempting to digitize every title with \"Google Book Search\".<ref>[[Google Book Search]]</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/|title=Google Books}}</ref>  While some academic libraries have been contracted by the service, issues of copyright law violations threaten to derail the project.<ref>Baksik, C.  \"Fair Use or Exploitation?

To digitize something is to convert something from an analog into a digital format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthroarchivist.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/why-digitization-is-not-digital-preservation/|title=why digitization is not digital preservation|date=7 October 2011|publisher=}}</ref>  An example would be scanning a photograph and having a digital copy on a computer.  This is essentially the first step in digital preservation.  To digitally preserve something is to maintain it over a long period of time.<ref>{{Cite book | last  = Ross| first = Seamus| title     = Changing Trains at Wigan: Digital Preservation and the Future of Scholarship| publisher = British Library (National Preservation Office)| place     = London| edition = 1| year    = 2000|url = http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stratpolprog/collectioncare/publications/reports/wigan_digital_preservation.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2011/07/digitization-is-different-than-digital-preservation-help-prevent-digital-orphans/|title=Digitization is Different than Digital Preservation: Help Prevent Digital Orphans!|work=loc.gov}}</ref>\n\nDigital preservation is more complicated because technology changes so quickly that a format that was used to save something years ago may become obsolete, like a 5 1/4\" floppy drive.  Computers are no longer made with them, and obtaining the hardware to convert a file from an obsolete format to a newer one can be expensive.  As a result, the upgrading process must take place every 2 to 5 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prairienet.org/op/digarch/digitization-vs-preservation/|title=Digitization vs. Preservation|work=prairienet.org}}</ref>  or as newer technology becomes affordable, but before older technology becomes unobtainable.   The Library of Congress provides numerous resources and tips for individuals looking to practice digitization and digital preservation for their personal collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/|title=Digital Preservation|work=digitalpreservation.gov}}</ref>\n\nDigital preservation can also apply to born-digital material.  An example of something that is born-digital is a Microsoft Word document saved as a .docx file or a post to a social media site.  In contrast, digitization only applies exclusively to analog materials.  Born-digital materials present a unique challenge to digital preservation not only due to technological obsolescence but also because of the inherently unstable nature of digital storage and maintenance.  Most websites last between 2.5 and 5 years, depending on the purpose for which they were designed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/website-lifespan-and-you/|title=Website Lifespan and You|work=Orbit Media Studios}}</ref>\n\nMany libraries, archives, and museums, as well as other institutions struggle with catching up and staying current in regards to both digitization and digital preservation.  Digitization is a time-consuming process, particularly depending on the condition of the holdings prior to being digitized.  Some materials are so fragile that undergoing the process of digitization could damage them irreparably; light from a scanner can damage old photographs and documents.  Despite potential damage, one reason for digitizing some materials is because they are so heavily used that digitization will help to preserve the original copy long past what its life would have been as a physical holding.\n\nDigitization can also be quite expensive.  Institutions want the best image quality in digital copies so that when they are converted from one format to another over time only a high-quality copy is maintained.  Smaller institutions may not be able to afford such equipment.   Manpower at many facilities also limits how much material can be digitized.  Archivists and librarians must have an idea of what their patrons wish to see most and try to prioritize and meet those needs digitally.\n\nLabour resources and funding also limit digital preservation in many institutions.  The cost of upgrading hardware or software every few years can be prohibitively expensive.  Training is another issue, since many librarians and archivists do not have a computer science background.  Intellectual control of digital holdings presents yet another issue which sometimes occurs when the physical holdings have not yet been entirely processed.  One suggested timeframe for completely transcribing digital holdings was every ten to twenty years,  making the process an ongoing and time-consuming one.\n\n==Digital reformatting==\n'''Digital reformatting''' is the process of converting analogue materials into a digital format as a surrogate of the original. The digital surrogates perform a preservation function by reducing or eliminating the use of the original. Digital reformatting is guided by established best practices to ensure that materials are being converted at the highest quality.\n\n===Digital reformatting at the Library of Congress===\nThe [[Library of Congress]] has been actively reformatting materials for its [[American Memory]] project and developed best standards and practices pertaining to book handling during the digitization process, scanning resolutions, and preferred file formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/about/techStandards.pdf|title=Library of Congress. (2007). Technical Standards for Digital Conversion of Text and Graphic Materials|publisher=}}</ref> Some of these standards are:\n\n*The use of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16067-1 and ISO 16067-2 standards for [[Image resolution|resolution]] requirements.\n*Recommended 400 [[pixels per inch|ppi]] resolution for [[Optical Character Recognition|OCR]]'ed printed text.\n*The use of [[24-bit color]] when color is an important attribute of a document.\n*The use of the scanning device's maximum resolution for digitally reproducing photographs\n*[[TIFF]] as the standard file format.\n*Attachment of descriptive, structural, and technical [[metadata]] to all digitized documents.\n\nA list of archival standards for digital preservation can be found on the [[Association of Research Libraries|ARL]] website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/digi_preserv.pdf|title=Search Publications \u2013 Association of Research Libraries\u00ae \u2013 ARL\u00ae|website=www.arl.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Library of Congress has constituted a Preservation Digital Reformatting Program.<ref>Library of Congress, (2006).

Some formats are susceptible to more severe, or quicker, degradation than others. For instance, lacquer discs suffer from [[delamination]]. Analog tape may deteriorate due to [[Sticky-shed syndrome|sticky shed syndrome]]. \n[[File:Analog tape playback.jpg|thumb|1/4\" analog tape being played back on a Studer A810 tape machine for digitization at Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.|alt=]]\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/pub164.pdf|title=ARSC Guide to Audio Preservation|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n\nArchival workflow and file standardization have been developed to minimize loss of information from the original carrier to the resulting digital file as digitization is under way. For most at-risk formats (magnetic tape, grooved cylinders, etc), a similar workflow can be observed. Examination of the source carrier will help determine what, if any, steps need to be taken to repair material prior to transfer. Similar inspection must be undertaken for the playback machines. If satisfactory conditions are met for both carrier and playback machine, transfer can take place, moderated by an [[analog-to-digital converter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/technical-bulletins/digitization-audio-tapes.html#a2|title=The Digitization of Audio Tapes \u2013 Technical Bulletin 30|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-14|website=aem|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref> The digital signal is then represented visually for the transfer engineer by a [[digital audio workstation]], like Audacity, WaveLab, or ProTools. Reference access copies can be made at smaller sample rates. For archival purposes, it is standard to transfer at a sample rate of 96 kHz and a bit depth of 24 bits per channel.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Lean philosophy==\nThe broad use of internet and the increasing popularity of [[Lean manufacturing|lean philosophy]] has also increased the use and meaning of \"digitizing\" to describe improvements in the efficiency of organizational processes. Lean philosophy refers to the approach which considers any use of time and resources, which does not lead directly to creating a product, as waste and therefore a target for elimination. \nThis will often involve some kind of Lean process in order to simplify process activities, with the aim of implementing new \"lean and mean\" processes by digitizing data and activities. Digitization can help to eliminate time waste by introducing wider access to data, or by implementation of enterprise resource planning systems.\n\n==Fiction==\nWorks of science-fiction often include the term '''digitize''' as the act of transforming people into [[digital signals]] and sending them into [[digital technology]]. When that happens, the people disappear from the [[Reality|real world]] and appear in a [[virtual world]] (as featured in the [[cult film]] ''[[Tron]]'', the [[animated series]] ''[[Code: Lyoko]]'', or the late 1980s live-action series ''[[Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future]]'').

The result is called ''[[Digital data|digital]] [[group representation|representation]]'' or, more specifically, a ''[[digital image]]'', for the object, and ''digital form'', for the signal. In modern practice, the digitized data is in the form of [[binary number]]s, which facilitate computer processing and other operations, but, strictly speaking, digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format; the [[decimal]] or any other [[number system]] that can be used instead.\n\nDigitization is of crucial importance to data processing, storage and transmission, because it \"allows information of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled\".<ref>McQuail, D (2000) McQuail's Mass Communication Theory (4th edition), Sage, London, pp. 16\u201334</ref> Though analog data is typically more stable, digital data can more easily be shared and accessed and can, in theory, be propagated indefinitely, without generation loss, provided it is [[digital preservation|migrated to new, stable formats as needed]]. This is why it is a favored way of preserving information for many organisations around the world.\n\n== Process ==\n\nThe term digitization is often used when diverse forms of information, such as an object, text, sound, image or voice, are converted into a single [[binary code]]. The core of the process is the compromise between the capturing device and the player device so that the rendered result represents the original source with the most possible fidelity, and the advantage of digitization is the speed and accuracy in which this form of information can be transmitted with no degradation compared with analog information.\n\nDigital information exists as one of two digits, either 0 or 1. These are known as [[bit]]s (a contraction of ''binary digits'') and the sequences of 0s and 1s that constitute information are called [[byte]]s.<ref>Flew, Terry. 2008. New Media An Introduction. South Melbourne. 3rd Edition. South Melbourne: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nAnalog signals are [[continuum (theory)|continuously]] variable, both in the number of possible values of the signal ''at'' a given [[time]], as well as in the number of points in the signal ''in'' a given period of time. However, digital signals are [[discrete signal|discrete]] in both of those respects \u2013 generally a finite sequence of integers \u2013 therefore a digitization can, in practical terms, only ever be an [[approximation]] of the signal it represents.\n\nDigitization occurs in two parts:\n;Discretization: The reading of an analog signal ''A'', and, at regular time intervals ([[sampling frequency|frequency]]), [[sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] the value of the signal at the point. Each such reading is called a ''sample'' and may be considered to have infinite precision at this stage;\n;Quantization: Samples are rounded to a fixed set of numbers (such as integers), a process known as [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]].\nIn general, these can occur at the same time, though they are conceptually distinct.\n\nA series of digital integers can be transformed into an analog output that approximates the original analog signal. Such a transformation is called a [[DA conversion]]. The [[sampling rate]] and the number of bits used to represent the integers combine to determine how close such an approximation to the analog signal a digitization will be.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Digitizing Estonian popular science magazine Horisont.jpg|thumb|Digitization of the first number of Estonian popular science magazine Horisont published in January 1967.]]\nThe term is used to describe, for example, the [[image scanner|scanning]] of analog sources (such as printed [[photo]]s or taped [[video]]s) into computers for editing, 3D scanning that creates [[3D modeling]] of an object's surface, and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] (where sampling rate is often measured in [[kilohertz]]) and [[Graphics pipeline#Modeling transformation|texture map]] transformations. In this last case, as in normal photos, the sampling rate refers to the [[Image resolution|resolution]] of the image, often measured in [[pixel]]s per inch.\n\nDigitizing is the primary way of storing images in a form suitable for [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] and [[computer]] processing, whether scanned from two-dimensional analog originals or captured using an [[image sensor]]-equipped device such as a [[digital camera]], [[tomography|tomographical]] instrument such as a [[CAT scan]]ner, or acquiring precise dimensions from a real-world object, such as a [[motor vehicle|car]], using a [[3D scanner|3D scanning]] device.<ref>[http://www.digimation.com/home/?Content=digitalcarshome.html Digimation for 3D Models, 3D Software and Creative Services<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDigitizing is central to making digital representations of geographical features, using raster or vector images, in a [[geographic information system]], i.e., the creation of [[electronic map]]s, either from various geographical and satellite imaging (raster) or by digitizing traditional paper [[map]]s or [[Chart|graphs]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitizer.sourceforge.net|title=Open source Engauge Digitizer for digitizing graphs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitizeit.de|title=DigitizeIt graph digitizing software}}</ref> (vector).\n\n\"Digitization\" is also used to describe the process of populating [[database]]s with files or data.  While this usage is technically inaccurate, it originates with the previously proper use of the term to describe that part of the process involving digitization of analog sources, such as printed pictures and brochures, before uploading to target databases.\n\nDigitizing may also used in the field of apparel, where an image may be recreated with the help of [[Machine embroidery#Computerized machine embroidery|embroidery digitizing]] software tools and saved as [[Machine embroidery#Design files|embroidery machine]] code.

Vol. 5, No. 2 (2005): 213\u201337.</ref>  Since the mid-1800s, books were printed on [[pulp (paper)|wood-pulp paper]], which turns acidic as it decays. Deterioration may advance to a point where a book is completely unusable. In theory, if these widely circulated titles are not treated with de-acidification processes, the materials upon those acid pages will be lost. As digital technology evolves, it is increasingly preferred as a method of preserving these materials, mainly because it can provide easier access points and significantly reduce the need for physical storage space.\n\nCambridge University Library is working on the [[Cambridge Digital Library]], which will initially contain digitised versions of many of its most important works relating to science and religion.

To digitize something is to convert something from an analog into a digital format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthroarchivist.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/why-digitization-is-not-digital-preservation/|title=why digitization is not digital preservation|date=7 October 2011|publisher=}}</ref>  An example would be scanning a photograph and having a digital copy on a computer.  This is essentially the first step in digital preservation.  To digitally preserve something is to maintain it over a long period of time.<ref>{{Cite book | last  = Ross| first = Seamus| title     = Changing Trains at Wigan: Digital Preservation and the Future of Scholarship| publisher = British Library (National Preservation Office)| place     = London| edition = 1| year    = 2000|url = http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stratpolprog/collectioncare/publications/reports/wigan_digital_preservation.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2011/07/digitization-is-different-than-digital-preservation-help-prevent-digital-orphans/|title=Digitization is Different than Digital Preservation: Help Prevent Digital Orphans!|work=loc.gov}}</ref>\n\nDigital preservation is more complicated because technology changes so quickly that a format that was used to save something years ago may become obsolete, like a 5 1/4\" floppy drive.  Computers are no longer made with them, and obtaining the hardware to convert a file from an obsolete format to a newer one can be expensive.  As a result, the upgrading process must take place every 2 to 5 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prairienet.org/op/digarch/digitization-vs-preservation/|title=Digitization vs. Preservation|work=prairienet.org}}</ref>  or as newer technology becomes affordable, but before older technology becomes unobtainable.   The Library of Congress provides numerous resources and tips for individuals looking to practice digitization and digital preservation for their personal collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/|title=Digital Preservation|work=digitalpreservation.gov}}</ref>\n\nDigital preservation can also apply to born-digital material.  An example of something that is born-digital is a Microsoft Word document saved as a .docx file or a post to a social media site.  In contrast, digitization only applies exclusively to analog materials.  Born-digital materials present a unique challenge to digital preservation not only due to technological obsolescence but also because of the inherently unstable nature of digital storage and maintenance.  Most websites last between 2.5 and 5 years, depending on the purpose for which they were designed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/website-lifespan-and-you/|title=Website Lifespan and You|work=Orbit Media Studios}}</ref>\n\nMany libraries, archives, and museums, as well as other institutions struggle with catching up and staying current in regards to both digitization and digital preservation.  Digitization is a time-consuming process, particularly depending on the condition of the holdings prior to being digitized.  Some materials are so fragile that undergoing the process of digitization could damage them irreparably; light from a scanner can damage old photographs and documents.  Despite potential damage, one reason for digitizing some materials is because they are so heavily used that digitization will help to preserve the original copy long past what its life would have been as a physical holding.\n\nDigitization can also be quite expensive.  Institutions want the best image quality in digital copies so that when they are converted from one format to another over time only a high-quality copy is maintained.  Smaller institutions may not be able to afford such equipment.   Manpower at many facilities also limits how much material can be digitized.  Archivists and librarians must have an idea of what their patrons wish to see most and try to prioritize and meet those needs digitally.\n\nLabour resources and funding also limit digital preservation in many institutions.  The cost of upgrading hardware or software every few years can be prohibitively expensive.  Training is another issue, since many librarians and archivists do not have a computer science background.  Intellectual control of digital holdings presents yet another issue which sometimes occurs when the physical holdings have not yet been entirely processed.  One suggested timeframe for completely transcribing digital holdings was every ten to twenty years,  making the process an ongoing and time-consuming one.\n\n==Digital reformatting==\n'''Digital reformatting''' is the process of converting analogue materials into a digital format as a surrogate of the original. The digital surrogates perform a preservation function by reducing or eliminating the use of the original. Digital reformatting is guided by established best practices to ensure that materials are being converted at the highest quality.\n\n===Digital reformatting at the Library of Congress===\nThe [[Library of Congress]] has been actively reformatting materials for its [[American Memory]] project and developed best standards and practices pertaining to book handling during the digitization process, scanning resolutions, and preferred file formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/about/techStandards.pdf|title=Library of Congress.

For most at-risk formats (magnetic tape, grooved cylinders, etc), a similar workflow can be observed. Examination of the source carrier will help determine what, if any, steps need to be taken to repair material prior to transfer. Similar inspection must be undertaken for the playback machines. If satisfactory conditions are met for both carrier and playback machine, transfer can take place, moderated by an [[analog-to-digital converter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/technical-bulletins/digitization-audio-tapes.html#a2|title=The Digitization of Audio Tapes \u2013 Technical Bulletin 30|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-14|website=aem|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref> The digital signal is then represented visually for the transfer engineer by a [[digital audio workstation]], like Audacity, WaveLab, or ProTools.

Lean philosophy refers to the approach which considers any use of time and resources, which does not lead directly to creating a product, as waste and therefore a target for elimination. \nThis will often involve some kind of Lean process in order to simplify process activities, with the aim of implementing new \"lean and mean\" processes by digitizing data and activities. Digitization can help to eliminate time waste by introducing wider access to data, or by implementation of enterprise resource planning systems.\n\n==Fiction==\nWorks of science-fiction often include the term '''digitize''' as the act of transforming people into [[digital signals]] and sending them into [[digital technology]]. When that happens, the people disappear from the [[Reality|real world]] and appear in a [[virtual world]] (as featured in the [[cult film]] ''[[Tron]]'', the [[animated series]] ''[[Code: Lyoko]]'', or the late 1980s live-action series ''[[Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future]]''). In the [[video game]] ''[[Beyond Good & Evil]]'', the [[protagonist| protagonist's]] [[holographic]] friend digitizes the player's inventory [[Item (Game)|items]]. One [[Super Friends]] cartoon episode showed [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Jayna]] freeing the world's men (including the male super heroes) onto computer tape by the female villainess Medula.<ref>The Mind Maidens.
