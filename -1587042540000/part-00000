Established by Act of Parliament in 1842, the City of Sydney is the oldest, and the oldest-surviving, local government authority in New South Wales, and the second-oldest in Australia, with only the [[City of Adelaide]] being older by two years.\n\nGiven its prominent position, historically, geographically, economically and socially, the City of Sydney has long been a source of political interest and intrigue. As a result of this, the boundaries, constitution and legal basis of the council has changed many times throughout its history, often to suit the governing party of the State of New South Wales. The City of Sydney is currently governed under the [https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1988/48 City of Sydney Act, 1988], which defines and limits the powers, election method, constitution and boundaries of the council area. On 6 February 2004, the former local government area of the [[City of South Sydney]], which itself had been created in 1989 from areas formerly part of the City of Sydney (including [[Alexandria, New South Wales|Alexandria]], [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]], [[Erskineville]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] and [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]]), was formally merged into the City of Sydney and the current city boundaries date from this merger.\n\nThe leader of the City of Sydney is known as the [[Lord Mayor of Sydney]], currently held since 27 March 2004 by [[Clover Moore]], who also served concurrently as the state Member of Parliament for [[Electoral district of Sydney|Sydney]] and [[Electoral district of Bligh|Bligh]] from 1988 to 2012.\n\n==Suburbs and localities in the local government area==\nSuburbs within or partially within the City of Sydney are:\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Alexandria, New South Wales|Alexandria]]\n* [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]] (shared with [[Inner West Council]])\n* [[Barangaroo, New South Wales|Barangaroo]]\n* [[Beaconsfield, New South Wales|Beaconsfield]]\n* [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] (shared with [[Inner West Council]])\n* [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]] (shared with [[City of Randwick]])\n* [[Chippendale, New South Wales|Chippendale]]\n* [[Darlinghurst]]\n* [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]]\n* [[Dawes Point]]\n* [[Elizabeth Bay, New South Wales|Elizabeth Bay]]\n* [[Erskineville]]\n* [[Eveleigh]]\n* [[Forest Lodge, New South Wales|Forest Lodge]]\n* [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]\n* [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]]\n* [[Millers Point]]\n* [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]]\n* [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] (shared with [[Inner West Council]])\n* [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] (shared with [[Municipality of Woollahra]])\n* [[Potts Point]]\n* [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]]\n* [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]]\n* [[Rosebery, New South Wales|Rosebery]] (shared with [[Bayside Council]])\n* [[Rushcutters Bay]]\n* [[St Peters, New South Wales|St Peters]] (shared with [[Inner West Council]])\n* [[Surry Hills]]\n* [[Sydney central business district|Sydney CBD]]\n* [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]]\n* [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]\n* [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]]\n* [[Woolloomooloo]]\n* [[Zetland, New South Wales|Zetland]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\nLocalities in the City of Sydney are:\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Broadway, New South Wales|Broadway]]\n* [[Central, New South Wales|Central]]\n* [[Central Park, Sydney|Central Park]]\n* [[Chinatown, Sydney|Chinatown]]\n* [[Circular Quay]]\n* [[Darling Harbour]]\n* [[The Domain, Sydney|The Domain]]\n* [[East Sydney, New South Wales|East Sydney]]\n* [[Garden Island, New South Wales|Garden Island]]\n* [[Goat Island (Port Jackson)|Goat Island]]\n* [[Green Square, New South Wales|Green Square]]\n* [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]\n* [[Macdonaldtown]]\n* [[Railway Square]]\n* [[Strawberry Hills]]\n* [[St James, New South Wales|St James]]\n* [[Wynyard, Sydney|Wynyard]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Coat of arms of Sydney|City of Sydney flag}}[[Image:Lower George Street Sydney 1828.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Lower [[George Street, Sydney]] in about 1828]]\n[[File:City of Sydney Flag.svg|left|thumb|The [[City of Sydney flag]], designed in 1908]]\n[[Image:Sydney COA.gif|thumb|The 1996 redesign of the [[Coat of arms of Sydney|City of Sydney coat of arms]]]]\n[[File:City Council Chambers, Sydney.jpg|thumb|right|City Council chambers, Sydney, 1840s]]\nThe name ''Sydney'' comes from \"[[Sydney Cove]]\" which is where the English Governor (later Admiral) [[Arthur Phillip]] established the first settlement, after arriving with the [[First Fleet]].  On 26 January 1788, he named it after [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney]], who was the [[home secretary]] at the time, and the man responsible for the plan for the convict colony in Australia.\n\nThe \"City of Sydney\" was established on 20 July 1842<ref name=scc>{{cite web|title=History of Sydney City Council |publisher=City of Sydney |url=http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/AboutSydney/documents/history/hs_chos_history_of_council_1001.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=9 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203034320/http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/aboutsydney/documents/history/hs_chos_history_of_council_1001.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> by the Corporation Act which encompasses present-day [[Woolloomooloo]], [[Surry Hills]], [[Chippendale, New South Wales|Chippendale]] and [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]], an area of 11.65&nbsp;km\u00b2. There were six wards established by boundary posts. These wards were: Gipps, Brisbane, Macquarie, Bourke, Cook and Phillip. A boundary post still exists in front of Sydney Square.\n\nThe boundaries of the City of Sydney have changed fairly regularly since 1900. The bankrupt [[Municipality of Camperdown]] was merged with the city in 1909. As a result of the [[Local Government (Areas) Act 1948]], the municipalities of [[Municipality of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Municipality of Darlington|Darlington]], [[Municipality of Erskineville|Erskineville]], [[Municipality of Newtown|Newtown]], [[Municipality of Redfern|Redfern]], [[Municipality of The Glebe|The Glebe]], [[Municipality of Waterloo|Waterloo]], and [[Municipality of Paddington|Paddington]] were added to the City. In 1968 the boundaries were changed and many of these suburbs moved to be part of a new municipality of South Sydney. South Sydney was brought back into the city in 1982, but became separate again under the City of Sydney Act of 1988 and then became smaller than its original size at 6.19&nbsp;km\u00b2. It grew again in February 2004 with the merger of the two council areas, and now has a population of approximately 170,000 people.\n\nThese changes in boundaries have often resulted in control of the council by the governing party in the [[Parliament of New South Wales]] at the time; the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]] often sought to have traditional working-class suburbs like Redfern, Erskineville, Alexandria and Waterloo included in the council area, and the [[Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division)|Liberal Party]] and its predecessors often desired a smaller council area focused on inner-Sydney or a limited/broader voting franchise. A 1987 re-organisation initiated by a Labor state government and completed in 1989 under a Liberal Coalition government saw the City of Sydney split again, with southern suburbs forming the [[City of South Sydney]], a moved that advantaged the government of the day, as the southern suburbs now in South Sydney Council had traditionally voted Labor.<ref name=\"green\">{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Antony|title=NSW Parliament looks to stack Sydney City Council - again!|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-05/nsw-parliament-looks-to-stack-sydney-city-council---again/9388484|accessdate=23 May 2018|agency=Antony Green's Election Blog - ABC Elections|date=5 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dias|first1=Avani|title=Cabinet papers reveal 1987 decision to sack Sydney council just as Clover Moore set to run for mayor|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-07/sydney-council-sacked-in-1987-hampered-clover-moore/8882436|accessdate=23 May 2018|agency=ABC News|date=7 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the Labor state Government undid this change, again merging the councils of the City of Sydney and the South Sydney Council. Critics claimed that this was performed with the intention of creating a \"super-council\" which would be under the control of Labor, which also controlled the NSW Government. Subsequent to this merger, an election took place on 27 March 2004 which resulted in the independent candidate [[Clover Moore]] defeating the high-profile Labor candidate, former federal minister [[Michael Lee (Australian politician)|Michael Lee]] and winning the position of [[List of Mayors and Lord Mayors of Sydney|Lord Mayor]].<ref name=\"green\"/>\n\n===Boundary changes===\n<gallery>\nFile:COS pre 1909.png|Boundaries pre\u20131909\nFile:City of Sydney 1909-1949.png|Boundaries 1909\u20131948\nFile:City of Sydney 1949-1968.png|Boundaries 1949\u20131968\nFile:City of Sydney 1968-1982.png|Boundaries 1968\u20131982\nFile:City of Sydney 1982-1988.png|Boundaries 1982\u20131988\nFile:City of Sydney 1989-2003.png|Boundaries 1989\u20132003\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\nAt the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 Census]], there were {{formatnum:208374}} people in the Sydney local government area, of these 51.8% were male and 48.2% were female.

Sydney''' is the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] covering the [[Sydney central business district]] and surrounding inner city suburbs of the greater metropolitan area of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Established by Act of Parliament in 1842, the City of Sydney is the oldest, and the oldest-surviving, local government authority in New South Wales, and the second-oldest in Australia, with only the [[City of Adelaide]] being older by two years.\n\nGiven its prominent position, historically, geographically, economically and socially, the City of Sydney has long been a source of political interest and intrigue. As a result of this, the boundaries, constitution and legal basis of the council has changed many times throughout its history, often to suit the governing party of the State of New South Wales. The City of Sydney is currently governed under the [https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1988/48 City of Sydney Act, 1988], which defines and limits the powers, election method, constitution and boundaries of the council area. On 6 February 2004, the former local government area of the [[City of South Sydney]], which itself had been created in 1989 from areas formerly part of the City of Sydney (including [[Alexandria, New South Wales|Alexandria]], [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]], [[Erskineville]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] and [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]]), was formally merged into the City of Sydney and the current city boundaries date from this merger.\n\nThe leader of the City of Sydney is known as the [[Lord Mayor of Sydney]], currently held since 27 March 2004 by [[Clover Moore]], who also served concurrently as the state Member of Parliament for [[Electoral district of Sydney|Sydney]] and [[Electoral district of Bligh|Bligh]] from 1988 to 2012.\n\n==Suburbs and localities in the local government area==\nSuburbs within or partially within the City of Sydney are:\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Alexandria, New South Wales|Alexandria]]\n* [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]] (shared with [[Inner West Council]])\n* [[Barangaroo, New South Wales|Barangaroo]]\n* [[Beaconsfield, New South Wales|Beaconsfield]]\n* [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] (shared with [[Inner West Council]])\n* [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]] (shared with [[City of Randwick]])\n* [[Chippendale, New South Wales|Chippendale]]\n* [[Darlinghurst]]\n* [[Darlington, New South Wales|Darlington]]\n* [[Dawes Point]]\n* [[Elizabeth Bay, New South Wales|Elizabeth Bay]]\n* [[Erskineville]]\n* [[Eveleigh]]\n* [[Forest Lodge, New South Wales|Forest Lodge]]\n* [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]\n* [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]]\n* [[Millers Point]]\n* [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]]\n* [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] (shared with [[Inner West Council]])\n* [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] (shared with [[Municipality of Woollahra]])\n* [[Potts Point]]\n* [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]]\n* [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]]\n* [[Rosebery, New South Wales|Rosebery]] (shared with [[Bayside Council]])\n* [[Rushcutters Bay]]\n* [[St Peters, New South Wales|St Peters]] (shared with [[Inner West Council]])\n* [[Surry Hills]]\n* [[Sydney central business district|Sydney CBD]]\n* [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]]\n* [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]\n* [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]]\n* [[Woolloomooloo]]\n* [[Zetland, New South Wales|Zetland]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\nLocalities in the City of Sydney are:\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Broadway, New South Wales|Broadway]]\n* [[Central, New South Wales|Central]]\n* [[Central Park, Sydney|Central Park]]\n* [[Chinatown, Sydney|Chinatown]]\n* [[Circular Quay]]\n* [[Darling Harbour]]\n* [[The Domain, Sydney|The Domain]]\n* [[East Sydney, New South Wales|East Sydney]]\n* [[Garden Island, New South Wales|Garden Island]]\n* [[Goat Island (Port Jackson)|Goat Island]]\n* [[Green Square, New South Wales|Green Square]]\n* [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]\n* [[Macdonaldtown]]\n* [[Railway Square]]\n* [[Strawberry Hills]]\n* [[St James, New South Wales|St James]]\n* [[Wynyard, Sydney|Wynyard]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Coat of arms of Sydney|City of Sydney flag}}[[Image:Lower George Street Sydney 1828.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Lower [[George Street, Sydney]] in about 1828]]\n[[File:City of Sydney Flag.svg|left|thumb|The [[City of Sydney flag]], designed in 1908]]\n[[Image:Sydney COA.gif|thumb|The 1996 redesign of the [[Coat of arms of Sydney|City of Sydney coat of arms]]]]\n[[File:City Council Chambers, Sydney.jpg|thumb|right|City Council chambers, Sydney, 1840s]]\nThe name ''Sydney'' comes from \"[[Sydney Cove]]\" which is where the English Governor (later Admiral) [[Arthur Phillip]] established the first settlement, after arriving with the [[First Fleet]].

There were six wards established by boundary posts. These wards were: Gipps, Brisbane, Macquarie, Bourke, Cook and Phillip. A boundary post still exists in front of Sydney Square.\n\nThe boundaries of the City of Sydney have changed fairly regularly since 1900. The bankrupt [[Municipality of Camperdown]] was merged with the city in 1909. As a result of the [[Local Government (Areas) Act 1948]], the municipalities of [[Municipality of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Municipality of Darlington|Darlington]], [[Municipality of Erskineville|Erskineville]], [[Municipality of Newtown|Newtown]], [[Municipality of Redfern|Redfern]], [[Municipality of The Glebe|The Glebe]], [[Municipality of Waterloo|Waterloo]], and [[Municipality of Paddington|Paddington]] were added to the City. In 1968 the boundaries were changed and many of these suburbs moved to be part of a new municipality of South Sydney. South Sydney was brought back into the city in 1982, but became separate again under the City of Sydney Act of 1988 and then became smaller than its original size at 6.19&nbsp;km\u00b2. It grew again in February 2004 with the merger of the two council areas, and now has a population of approximately 170,000 people.\n\nThese changes in boundaries have often resulted in control of the council by the governing party in the [[Parliament of New South Wales]] at the time; the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]] often sought to have traditional working-class suburbs like Redfern, Erskineville, Alexandria and Waterloo included in the council area, and the [[Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division)|Liberal Party]] and its predecessors often desired a smaller council area focused on inner-Sydney or a limited/broader voting franchise. A 1987 re-organisation initiated by a Labor state government and completed in 1989 under a Liberal Coalition government saw the City of Sydney split again, with southern suburbs forming the [[City of South Sydney]], a moved that advantaged the government of the day, as the southern suburbs now in South Sydney Council had traditionally voted Labor.<ref name=\"green\">{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Antony|title=NSW Parliament looks to stack Sydney City Council - again!|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-05/nsw-parliament-looks-to-stack-sydney-city-council---again/9388484|accessdate=23 May 2018|agency=Antony Green's Election Blog - ABC Elections|date=5 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dias|first1=Avani|title=Cabinet papers reveal 1987 decision to sack Sydney council just as Clover Moore set to run for mayor|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-07/sydney-council-sacked-in-1987-hampered-clover-moore/8882436|accessdate=23 May 2018|agency=ABC News|date=7 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the Labor state Government undid this change, again merging the councils of the City of Sydney and the South Sydney Council. Critics claimed that this was performed with the intention of creating a \"super-council\" which would be under the control of Labor, which also controlled the NSW Government. Subsequent to this merger, an election took place on 27 March 2004 which resulted in the independent candidate [[Clover Moore]] defeating the high-profile Labor candidate, former federal minister [[Michael Lee (Australian politician)|Michael Lee]] and winning the position of [[List of Mayors and Lord Mayors of Sydney|Lord Mayor]].<ref name=\"green\"/>\n\n===Boundary changes===\n<gallery>\nFile:COS pre 1909.png|Boundaries pre\u20131909\nFile:City of Sydney 1909-1949.png|Boundaries 1909\u20131948\nFile:City of Sydney 1949-1968.png|Boundaries 1949\u20131968\nFile:City of Sydney 1968-1982.png|Boundaries 1968\u20131982\nFile:City of Sydney 1982-1988.png|Boundaries 1982\u20131988\nFile:City of Sydney 1989-2003.png|Boundaries 1989\u20132003\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\nAt the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 Census]], there were {{formatnum:208374}} people in the Sydney local government area, of these 51.8% were male and 48.2% were female.

In reality the billionaire [[Barclay brothers]], owners of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper amongst other holdings, live in a castle on the island; David Barclay sued the playwright in France for defamation and invasion of privacy, although the Barclays were not named in the play.

Tillette de Clermont-Tonnerre acknowledged that the play was partly inspired by the lives of the brothers, but defended his right to freedom of expression and said the play had been commissioned to explore the issue of the continued existence of mediaeval Norman law in the Channel Islands, while ruminating on the nature and future of capitalism.
