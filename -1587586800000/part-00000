In addition, colonists imported numerous [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] people as slaves in the 18th century.

The alluvial region includes low swamp lands, coastal marshlands and beaches, and [[barrier islands]] that cover about {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2}}. This area lies principally along the Gulf of Mexico and the [[Mississippi River]], which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about {{convert|600|mi|-1|abbr=on}} and empties into the Gulf of Mexico; the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]; the [[Ouachita River]] and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called [[bayous]]).\n\nThe breadth of the alluvial region along the Mississippi is from 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100&nbsp;km), and along the other rivers, the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15&nbsp;km) across. The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as a [[levee]]), from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile (3&nbsp;m/km). The alluvial lands along other streams present similar features.\n\nThe higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than {{convert|25000|sqmi|km2}}. They consist of prairie and woodlands. The elevations above sea level range from 10 feet (3&nbsp;m) at the coast and swamp lands to 50 and 60 feet (15\u201318&nbsp;m) at the prairie and alluvial lands. In the uplands and hills, the elevations rise to [[Driskill Mountain]], the highest point in the state only 535 feet (163&nbsp;m) above sea level. From 1932 to 2010 the state lost 1,800 square miles due to rises in sea level and [[erosion]]. The [[Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority]] (CPRA) spends around $1&nbsp;billion per year to help shore up and protect Louisiana [[shore]]line and land in both federal and state funding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|title=Louisiana fights the sea, and loses|website=The Economist|access-date=August 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828163535/https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|archive-date=August 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBesides the waterways already named, there are the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]], forming the western boundary; and the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl]], the eastern boundary; the [[Calcasieu River|Calcasieu]], the [[Mermentau River|Mermentau]], the [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion]], [[Bayou Teche]], the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]], the [[Boeuf River|Boeuf]], [[Bayou Lafourche]], the Courtableau River, Bayou D'Arbonne, the Macon River, the [[Tensas River|Tensas]], [[Amite River]], the [[Tchefuncte River|Tchefuncte]], the [[Tickfaw River|Tickfaw]], the [[Natalbany River]], and a number of other smaller streams, constituting a natural system of navigable waterways, aggregating over {{convert|4000|mi|km}} long.\n\nThe state also has political jurisdiction over the approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}}-wide portion of [[subsea]] land of the [[Outer continental shelf|inner continental shelf]] in the Gulf of Mexico.

Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a landmass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear.<ref>Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J.

The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which at its farthest point is no more than {{convert|200|mi|-1|abbr=on}} away.\n\nRain is frequent throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state's [[wet season]]. There is a dip in precipitation in October. In summer, thunderstorms build during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief, tropical downpours. In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense.\n\nSummers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June through September averaging 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) or more, and overnight lows averaging above 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (22&nbsp;\u00b0C). At times, temperatures in the 90s F, combined with [[dew points]] in the upper 70s F, create sensible temperatures over {{convert|120|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and movies.\n\nTemperatures are generally warm in the winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of south Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico averaging 66&nbsp;\u00b0F (19&nbsp;\u00b0C). The northern part of the state is mildly cool in the winter, with highs averaging 59&nbsp;\u00b0F (15&nbsp;\u00b0C). The overnight lows in the winter average well above freezing throughout the state, with 46&nbsp;\u00b0F (8&nbsp;\u00b0C) the average near the Gulf and an average low of 37&nbsp;\u00b0F (3&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the winter in the northern part of the state.\n\nOn occasion, cold fronts from low-pressure centers to the north, reach Louisiana in winter. Low temperatures near 20&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22128&nbsp;\u00b0C) occur on occasion in the northern part of the state but rarely do so in the southern part of the state. [[Snow in Louisiana|Snow]] is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although residents in the northern parts of the state might receive a dusting of snow a few times each decade. Louisiana's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|114|F|C}} in [[Plain Dealing, Louisiana|Plain Dealing]] on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is {{convert|-16|F|C}} at [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] on February 13, 1899.\n\nLouisiana is often affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s and is very vulnerable to strikes by major [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricanes]], particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area. The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can result in water damage across a wide area from major hurricanes. The area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer.<ref name=\"Annual average number of tornadoes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |title=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year, more than any other state except Florida. Louisiana averages 27 [[tornado]]es annually. The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado strike, with the extreme southern portion of the state slightly less so than the rest of the state.

The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in [[Texas]] via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were worked by imported African slaves. Over time, planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town. This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places, although the commodity crop in the south was primarily sugar cane.\n[[File:Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|thumb|French Acadians, who came to be known as [[Cajuns]], settled the swamps of southern Louisiana, especially in the [[Atchafalaya Basin]].]]\n\nLouisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the [[Illinois Country]], around present-day [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The latter was settled by French colonists from Illinois.\n\nInitially, [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and then [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] served as the capital of La Louisiane. Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, and wanting to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civilian and military authority south of the Great Lakes. From then until the United States acquired the territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of the Mississippi.\n\nIn the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River, in a region referred to as the [[German Coast]].\n\nFrance ceded most of its territory to the east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in 1763, in the aftermath of [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War]] (generally referred to in North America as the [[French and Indian War]]). The rest of Louisiana, including the area around New Orleans and the parishes around [[Lake Pontchartrain]], had become a colony of Spain by the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] (1762). The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.\n\nIn 1765, during Spanish rule, several thousand French-speaking refugees from the region of [[Acadia]] (now [[Nova Scotia]], New Brunswick, and [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada) made their way to Louisiana after having been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from their homelands by the British during the French and Indian War. They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called [[Acadiana]]. The Spanish, eager to gain more Catholic settlers, welcomed the [[Acadian]] refugees, the ancestors of Louisiana's [[Cajun]]s.\n\nSpanish Canary Islanders, called [[Isle\u00f1os]], emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783.\n\nIn 1800, France's [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], an arrangement kept secret for two years.\n\n===Expansion of slavery===\n\n{{main|History of slavery in Louisiana}}\n\n[[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]] brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies. In 1709, French financier [[Antoine Crozat]] obtained a monopoly of commerce in [[La Louisiane]], which extended from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to what is now [[Illinois]]. \"That concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from Africa every year,\" the British historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] wrote.<ref>''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'' by Hugh Thomas. 1997: Simon and Schuster. p. 242-43</ref> Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh there was high mortality among both the colonists and the slaves, resulting in continuing demand and importation of slaves.\n\nStarting in 1719, traders began to import slaves in higher numbers; two French ships, the ''Du Maine'' and the ''Aurore'', arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves coming from Africa. Previous slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies. By the end of 1721, New Orleans counted 1,256 inhabitants, of whom about half were slaves.\n\nIn 1724, the French government issued a law called the [[Code Noir]] (\"Black Code\" in English) which \"regulate[d] the interaction of whites [blancs] and blacks [noirs] in its colony of Louisiana<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|title=Code Noir of Louisiana\u2014Know Louisiana|publisher=|access-date=April 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518041714/http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|archive-date=May 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> (which was much larger than the current state of Louisiana). The law consisted of 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, outlawed \"interracial\" marriages (those between people of different skin color, the varying shades of which were also defined by law), restricted [[manumission]], outlined legal punishment of slaves for various offenses, and defined some obligations of owners to their slaves. The main intent of the French government was to assert control over the slave system of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on slaveowners there. In practice, the Code Noir was exceedingly difficult to enforce from afar. Some priests continued to perform interracial marriage ceremonies, for example, and some slaveholders continued to manumit slaves without permission while others punished slaves brutally.\n\nArticle II of the Code Noir of 1724 required owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion, Roman Catholicism. Sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves. On days off, slaves were expected to feed and take care of themselves. During the 1740s economic crisis in the colony, owners had trouble feeding their slaves and themselves. Giving them time off also effectively gave more power to slaves, who started cultivating their own gardens and crafting items for sale as their own property. They began to participate in the economic development of the colony while at the same time increasing independence and self-subsistence.\n\nArticle VI of the Code Noir forbade mixed marriages, forbade but did little to protect slave women from rape by their owners, overseers or other slaves. On balance, the Code benefitted the owners but had more protections and flexibility than did the institution of slavery in the southern [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\nThe Louisiana Black Code of 1806 made the cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers were seldom prosecuted for such acts.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The law of slavery\u2014Master\u2013slave legal relationships |url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007003400/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |archivedate=October 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nFugitive slaves, called maroons, could easily hide in the backcountry of the bayous and survive in small settlements. The word \"maroon\" comes from the Spanish \"cimarron\", meaning \"fugitive cattle\".\n\nIn the late 18th century, the last Spanish governor of the Louisiana territory wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Truly, it is impossible for lower Louisiana to get along without slaves and with the use of slaves, the colony had been making great strides toward prosperity and wealth.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhen the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased Louisiana]] in 1803, it was soon accepted that enslaved Africans could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighboring [[Mississippi]], though it violated U.S. law to do so.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\">Hugh Thomas, ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'', Simon and Schuster, 1997, p. 548.</ref> Despite demands by United States Rep. [[James Hillhouse]] and by the pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]] to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory,<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\" /> slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest-cost labor.\n\nAt the start of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Louisiana's first United States governor, said African slave labor was needed because white laborers \"cannot be had in this unhealthy climate\".<ref>Thomas (1997), ''The Slave Trade'', p. 549.</ref> Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the African slave trade, which the U.S. and Great Britain adopted in 1808. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade\u2014the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.\n\nBy 1840, New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state.

After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis.\n\nAs the [[Deep South]] was developed for cotton and sugar in the first half of the nineteenth century, demand for slaves increased. This resulted in a massive forced migration (through the slave trade) of more than one million African Americans from the [[Upper South]] to the Deep South. Many traders brought slaves to New Orleans for domestic sale, and by 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the country, was the third-largest city, and was one of the wealthiest cities.\n[[File:Free Woman of Color with daughter NOLA Collage.jpg|thumb|[[Free people of color|Free woman of color]] with [[mixed-race]] daughter; late 18th-century collage painting, New Orleans]]\n\n===Haitian migration and influence===\n\nSpanish occupation of Louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800. Beginning in the 1790s, waves of immigration took place from [[Saint-Domingue]], following a [[Haitian Revolution|slave rebellion]] that started in 1791. Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana from the island, including ethnic Europeans, [[free people of color]], and African slaves, some of the latter brought in by each free group. They greatly increased the French-speaking population in New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and the slaves reinforced African culture in the city. The process of gaining independence in Saint-Domingue was complex, but uprisings continued. In 1803, France pulled out its surviving troops from the island, having suffered the loss of two-thirds sent to the island two years before, mostly to [[yellow fever]]. In 1804, [[Haiti]], the second republic in the western hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, achieved by slave leaders.<ref>\"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ht0017) The Slave Rebellion of 1791] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205164427/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+ht0017%29 |date=February 5, 2016 }}\".

As American settlers pushed west, they found that the [[Appalachian Mountains]] provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward. The easiest way to ship produce was to use a [[flatboat]] to float it down the [[Ohio river|Ohio]] and Mississippi Rivers to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be put on ocean-going vessels. The problem with this route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].\n\nNapoleon's ambitions in Louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the [[Caribbean]] [[sugar trade]]. By the terms of the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain returned ownership of the islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadaloupe]] to the French. Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands, and as a buffer to U.S. settlement. In October 1801 he sent a large military force to take back Saint-Domingue, then under control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.\nWhen the army led by Napoleon's brother-in-law Leclerc was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana.\n[[File:Louisiane 1800.png|thumb|Map of Louisiana in 1800]]\n\n[[Thomas Jefferson]], third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish French colonies in America. With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U.S. commerce at any time. Jefferson authorized [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], U.S. Minister to France, to negotiate for the purchase of the City of New Orleans, portions of the east bank of the Mississippi, and free navigation of the river for U.S. commerce. Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2&nbsp;million.\n\nAn official transfer of Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's deal with the Spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier. On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, Acting Intendant of Louisiana, made public the intention of Spain to revoke the right of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the United States. The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation. Commerce in the west was virtually blockaded. Historians believe the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses by the Americans, particularly smuggling, and not by French intrigues as was believed at the time. President Jefferson ignored public pressure for war with France, and appointed [[James Monroe]] a special envoy to Napoleon, to assist in obtaining New Orleans for the United States. Jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to $10&nbsp;million.\n\nHowever, on April 11, 1803, French Foreign Minister [[Talleyrand]] surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the '''entirety''' of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered). Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area), and that approval from President Jefferson might take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately. By April 30, they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of {{convert|828000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} for 60 million [[French franc|Francs]] (approximately $15&nbsp;million).\n\nPart of this sum, $3.5&nbsp;million, was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States.<ref>Peter Kastor, ''The Nation's Crucible: The Louisiana Purchase and the Creation of America'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 40</ref> The payment was made in United States [[Government bond|bonds]], which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of [[Hope & Co.|Hope and Company]], and the [[Barings Bank|British banking house of Baring]], at a discount of 87\u00bd per each $100 unit. As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana. English banker [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Alexander Baring]] conferred with Marbois in Paris, shuttled to the United States to pick up the bonds, took them to Britain, and returned to France with the money\u2014which Napoleon used to wage war against Baring's own country.\n[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Louisiana Purchase, 1803.jpg|thumb|Louisiana Purchase, 1803]]\n\nWhen news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised. He had authorized the expenditure of $10&nbsp;million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15&nbsp;million on a land package which would double the size of the country. Jefferson's political opponents in the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AsY9Vh9X8ZYC&dq=%22louisiana+purchase%22+federalist+desert+jefferson&q=worthless+desert |title=The American pageant: a history of the republic\u2014Thomas A.

What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist objections, the U.S. Senate ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803.\n\nBy statute enacted on October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by France and provide for initial governance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=282|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220085715/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=282|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803. Since the Louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the French raised theirs. The following day, [[General James Wilkinson]] accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States. A similar ceremony was held in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on March 9, 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag. The following day, [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] [[Amos Stoddard]] of the First U.S. Artillery marched his troops into town and had the American flag run up the fort's flagpole. The Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the United States government, represented by [[Meriwether Lewis]].\n\nThe Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory. It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific.\n\nShortly after the United States took possession, the area was divided into two territories along the [[33rd parallel north]] on March 26, 1804, thereby organizing the [[Territory of Orleans]] to the south and the [[District of Louisiana]] (subsequently formed as the [[Louisiana Territory]]) to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=320|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=rs6.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220091706/http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=320|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Statehood (1812)===\n\n{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|Seminole Wars|Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty}}\n\nLouisiana became the eighteenth U.S. state on April 30, 1812; the Territory of Orleans became the State of Louisiana and the Louisiana Territory was simultaneously renamed the [[Missouri Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=738|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105021747/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=738|archive-date=January 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> An area known as the [[Florida Parishes]] was soon annexed into the state of Louisiana on April 14, 1812.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=745|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202191512/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=745|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a distinct two-party system, with Democrats competing first against ''Whigs'', then ''Know Nothings'', and finally only other [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref>John M.

Initially state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who passed Black Codes to regulate [[freedmen]] and generally refused to give the vote. They refused to extend voting rights to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans.) Following the [[Memphis riots of 1866]] and the [[New Orleans riot]] the same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen. Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana. It was grouped with [[Texas]] in what was administered as the [[Fifth Military District]].\n\nAfrican Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both [[freedmen]] and [[free people of color|people of color]] who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market. White [[insurgents]] mobilized to enforce [[white supremacy]], first in [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapters.\n\nBy 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the [[White League]], which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence. Following Mississippi's example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] people of color, by raising barriers to voter registration, such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency requirements and [[literacy tests]]. The effect was immediate and long lasting. In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided.<ref>{{Cite journal|ssrn=224731 |title=Richard H.

It caused widespread damage due to breaching of levees and large-scale flooding of more than 80% of the city. Officials had issued warnings to evacuate the city and nearby areas, but tens of thousands of people, mostly African Americans, stayed behind, many of them stranded.

Yet, Louisiana is still unusual or exceptional in its extent of aboriginal Catholic settlement and influence. Among states in the [[Deep South]] (discounting [[Florida Panhandle|Florida's Panhandle]] and much of Texas) the historic role of Catholicism in Louisiana is unparalleled and unique. Among the states of the Union, Louisiana's unique use of the term ''parish'' (French ''la parouche'' or \"la paroisse\") for ''county'' is rooted in the pre-statehood role of Catholic church parishes in the administration of government.</ref>\n\n[[Jewish]] communities are established in the state's larger cities, notably New Orleans and Baton Rouge.<ref>Isaacs, Ronald H.

Petroleum and gas deposits are found in abundance both onshore and offshore in State-owned waters. In addition, vast petroleum and natural gas reserves are found offshore from Louisiana in the federally administered [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS) in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], the Gulf of Mexico OCS is the largest U.S. petroleum-producing region. Excluding the Gulf of Mexico OCS, Louisiana ranks fourth in petroleum production and is home to about two percent of the total U.S. petroleum reserves.\n\nLouisiana's natural gas reserves account for about five percent of the U.S. total. The recent discovery of the [[Haynesville Shale]] formation in parts of or all of Caddo, Bossier, Bienville, Sabine, De Soto, Red River, and Natchitoches parishes have made it the world's fourth largest gas field with some wells initially producing over 25 million cubic feet of gas daily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Louisiana |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206050811/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |archive-date=February 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLouisiana was the first site of [[Oil well|petroleum drilling]] over water in the world, on [[Caddo Lake]] in the northwest corner of the state. The petroleum and gas industry, as well as its subsidiary industries such as transport and [[Oil refinery|refining]], have dominated Louisiana's economy since the 1940s. Beginning in 1950, Louisiana was sued several times by the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Interior Department]], in efforts by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to strip Louisiana of its submerged land property rights. These control vast stores of reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas.\n\nWhen petroleum and gas [[1973 oil crisis|boomed]] in the 1970s, so did Louisiana's economy. The Louisiana economy as well as its politics of the last half-century cannot be understood without thoroughly accounting for the influence of the petroleum and gas industries. Since the 1980s, these industries' headquarters have consolidated in [[Houston]], but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude-oil-and-gas industry remained in Louisiana {{as of|lc=y|2010}}.\n\n==Law and government==\n\n{{Politics of Louisiana}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[Law of the United Kingdom]]-->\n:{{Further|List of Louisiana Governors|Louisiana law|Louisiana Constitution}}\n[[File:Louisiana State Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] in Baton Rouge, the [[Heights of state capitols|tallest state capitol building]] in the United States]]\n[[File:LAGovMansion.JPG|right|thumb|The Louisiana Governor's Mansion]]\n\nIn 1849, the state moved the capital from New Orleans to [[Baton Rouge]]. [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana|Donaldsonville]], [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]], and [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] have briefly served as the seat of Louisiana state government. The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] and the [[Louisiana Governor's Mansion]] are both located in Baton Rouge. The [[Louisiana Supreme Court]], however, did not move to Baton Rouge but remains headquartered in New Orleans.\n\nLouisiana and California (whose supreme court is seated in San Francisco) are the only two states whose high courts are not headquartered in the state capital.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe current Louisiana governor is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Bel Edwards]]. The current [[United States Senate|United States senators]] are Republicans [[John Neely Kennedy]] and [[Bill Cassidy]]. Louisiana has six [[congressional district]]s and is represented in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] by five Republicans and one Democrat. Louisiana had eight votes in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] for the [[2012 United States presidential election in Louisiana|2012 election]]. It lost one House seat due to stagnant population growth in the 2010 Census.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n\nLouisiana is divided into 64 [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]] (the equivalent of [[County (United States)|counties]] in most other states).<ref name=\"nativeamericans\">{{Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|name=Native Americans}}</ref>\n* [[List of parishes in Louisiana]]\n* [[Louisiana census statistical areas]]\n\nMost parishes have an elected government known as the Police Jury, dating from the colonial days. It is the legislative and executive government of the parish, and is elected by the voters. Its members are called Jurors, and together they elect a president as their chairman.\n\nA more limited number of parishes operate under [[home rule]] charters, electing various forms of government. This include mayor\u2013council, council\u2013manager (in which the council hires a professional operating manager for the parish), and others.\n\n===Civil law===\n\nThe Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance. One is the use of the term \"[[parish (Louisiana)|parish]]\" (from the French: ''paroisse'') in place of \"[[County (United States)|county]]\" for administrative subdivision. Another is the legal system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] based on French, German, and Spanish [[legal code]]s and ultimately [[Roman law]], as opposed to English [[common law]].\n\nLouisiana's civil law system is what the majority of nations in the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive from the [[British Empire]]. However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the [[Napoleonic Code]]. Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased]] and annexed Louisiana in 1803.\n\nWhile the Louisiana Civil Code of 1808 has been continuously revised and updated since its enactment, it is still considered the controlling authority in the state. Differences are found between Louisianan civil law and the common law found in the other U.S. states. While some of these differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition,<ref name=\"kinsellalaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |title=A Civil Law to Common Law Dictionary |accessdate=December 7, 2010 |last=Kinsella |first=Norman |year=1997 |website=KinsellaLaw.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105448/http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |archivedate=December 25, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana private law.

The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during these decades, but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until after the [[civil rights movement]] of the mid-20th century, gaining enforcement of their constitutional rights through passage by Congress of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].\n\nSince the 1960s, when civil rights legislation was passed under President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party. In the same years, many white social conservatives have moved to support Republican Party candidates in national, gubernatorial and statewide elections. In 2004, [[David Vitter]] was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. senator. The previous Republican senator, [[John S. Harris]], who took office in 1868 during Reconstruction, was chosen by the state legislature under the rules of the 19th century.\n\nLouisiana is unique among U.S. states in using a system for its state and local elections similar to that of modern France. All candidates, regardless of party affiliation, run in a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] (or \"jungle primary\") on Election Day. If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later. This run-off method does not take into account party identification; therefore, it is not uncommon for a Democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican.\n\nCongressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system. All other states (except [[Washington Initiative 872 (2004)|Washington]], [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|California]], and [[Maine]]) use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a [[plurality voting system]] or [[Two-round system|runoff voting]], to elect senators, representatives, and statewide officials. Between 2008 and 2010, federal [[United States Congress|congressional]] elections were run under a closed primary system\u2014limited to registered party members. However, upon the passage of House Bill 292, Louisiana again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections.\n\nLouisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, five of which are currently held by Republicans and one by a Democrat. The state lost a House seat at the end of the [[112th Congress]] due to stagnant population growth as recorded by the [[2010 United States Census]]. Louisiana is not classified as a \"[[swing state]]\" for future presidential elections, as since the late 20th century, it has regularly supported Republican candidates. The state's two U.S. senators are [[Bill Cassidy]] (R) [[John Neely Kennedy]] (R).\n\n===Law enforcement===\n\n{{See also|List of law enforcement agencies in Louisiana}}\n\nLouisiana's statewide police force is the [[Louisiana State Police]]. It began in 1922 with the creation of the Highway Commission. In 1927, a second branch, the Bureau of Criminal Investigations, was formed. In 1932, the State Highway Patrol was authorized to carry weapons.\n\nOn July 28, 1936, the two branches were consolidated to form the Louisiana Department of State Police; its motto was \"courtesy, loyalty, service\". In 1942, this office was abolished and became a division of the Department of Public Safety, called the Louisiana State Police. In 1988, the Criminal Investigation Bureau was reorganized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lsp.org/about_hist.html |title=Louisiana State Police\u2014About Us\u2014LSP History |publisher=Lsp.org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504001036/http://www.lsp.org/about_hist.html |archive-date=May 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Its troopers have statewide jurisdiction with power to enforce all laws of the state, including city and parish ordinances. Each year, they patrol over 12 million miles (20&nbsp;million km) of roadway and arrest about 10,000 impaired drivers. The State Police are primarily a traffic enforcement agency, with other sections that delve into trucking safety, narcotics enforcement, and gaming oversight.\n\nThe elected sheriff in each parish is the chief law enforcement officer in the parish. They are the keepers of the local parish prisons, which house felony and misdemeanor prisoners. They are the primary criminal patrol and first responder agency in all matters criminal and civil. They are also the official tax collectors in each parish. The sheriffs are responsible for general law enforcement in their respective parishes. Orleans Parish is an exception, as the general law enforcement duties fall to the New Orleans Police Department. Before 2010, Orleans parish was the only parish to have two sheriff's offices. Orleans Parish divided sheriffs' duties between criminal and civil, with a different elected sheriff overseeing each aspect. In 2006, a bill was passed which eventually consolidated the two sheriff's departments into one parish sheriff responsible for both civil and criminal matters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2015, Louisiana had a higher murder rate (10.3 per 100,000) than any other state in the country for the 27th straight year.

Conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases. Both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates. The settlers kept importing slaves, which resulted in a high proportion of native Africans from West Africa, who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings. As described by historian [[Gwendolyn Midlo Hall]], they developed a marked Afro-Creole culture in the colonial era.<ref>Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century'' (1992)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|title=Afro-Louisiana History and Genealogy|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430233835/http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|archive-date=April 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a major influx of white and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the [[Haitian Revolution]], many of whom brought their slaves with them. This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in [[Saint-Domingue]] were from Africa than in the United States. They strongly influenced the African-American culture of the city in terms of dance, music and religious practices.\n\n===Louisiana Creole culture===\n\n[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] culture is an amalgamation of French, African, Spanish (and other European), and Native American cultures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |title=French Creole Heritage |publisher=Laheritage.org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830084559/http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |archivedate=August 30, 2014 }}</ref> Creole comes from the Portuguese word ''crioulo''; originally it referred to a colonist of European (specifically French) descent who was born in the New World, in comparison to immigrants from France.<ref>Delehanty, Randolph. ''New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence, Chronicle Books'', 1995, pg. 14</ref> The oldest Louisiana manuscript to use the word \"Creole\", from 1782, applied it to a slave born in the French colony.<ref>Kein, Sybil. ''Creole: The History and Legacy of Louisiana's Free People of Color'', Louisiana State University Press, 2009, p. 73.</ref> But originally it referred more generally to the French colonists born in Louisiana.\n\nOver time, there developed in the French colony a relatively large group of [[Creoles of Color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who were primarily descended from African slave women and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans.) Often the French would free their concubines and [[mixed-race]] children, and pass on social capital to them. They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army for a career. They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children. The free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education; they generally spoke French and were Roman Catholic. Many became artisans and property owners. Over time, the term \"Creole\" became associated with this class of [[Creoles of Color]], many of whom achieved freedom long before the Civil War.\n\nWealthy French Creoles generally maintained town houses in [[New Orleans]] as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the Mississippi River. New Orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region; they could find work there and created their own culture, marrying among themselves for decades.\n\n===Acadian culture===\n\nThe ancestors of [[Cajun]]s immigrated mostly from west central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], known originally as [[Acadia]]. After the British defeated France in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain. The British forcibly separated families and evicted them from Acadia because they refused to vow loyalty to the new British regime. The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France. Some escaped the British remained in [[French Canada]].\n\nOthers scattered, to France, Canada, Mexico, or the Falkland Islands. Many Acadian refugees settled in south Louisiana in the region around [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and the LaFourche Bayou country. They developed a distinct rural culture there, different from the French Creole colonists of New Orleans. Intermarrying with others in the area, they developed what was called Cajun music, cuisine and culture. Until the 1970s, the term \"Cajun\" was considered somewhat derogatory.\n\n===Isle\u00f1o culture===\n\n{{Main|Isle\u00f1o (Louisiana)}}\n[[File:El_Museo_de_los_Isle\u00f1os.jpg|alt=|thumb|El Museo de los Isle\u00f1os (Isle\u00f1o Museum) in [[Saint Bernard, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]]]\n\nA third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isle\u00f1os. Its members are descendants of colonists from the [[Canary Islands]] who settled in [[Spanish Louisiana]] between 1778 and 1783 and intermarried with other communities such as [[French people|Frenchman]], [[Acadians]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], [[Spaniards]], and other groups, mainly through the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nIn Louisiana, the Isle\u00f1os originally settled in four communities which included Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo. Of those settlements, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most successful as the other two were plagued with both disease and flooding. The large migration of [[Acadian]] refugees to [[Bayou Lafourche]] led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo ([[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language into the 21st century. This being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely halted in St. Bernard with those having competency in Spanish being octogenarians.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite book|title=The Language of the Isle\u00f1os: Vestigial Spanish in Louisiana|last1=Lipski|first1=John|date=July 1, 1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115347|location=|pages=i, 4}}</ref>\n\nThrough the centuries, the various Isle\u00f1o communities of Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canary Islander heritage while also adopting and building upon the customs and traditions of the communities that surround them. Today two heritage associates exist for the communities: Los Isle\u00f1os Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard as well as the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana. The [[Isle\u00f1os Fiesta|Fiesta de los Isle\u00f1os]] is celebrated annually in St. Bernard Parish which features heritage performances from local groups and the Canary Islands.\n\n===Languages===\n\n[[File:Native Languages of Louisiana.svg|thumbnail|The languages of historic Native American tribes that occupied what is now Louisiana include: Tunica, Caddo, Natchez, Choctaw, Atakapa, Chitimacha and Houma.]]\n\nAccording to a 2010 study by the Modern Language Association, among persons five years old and older,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data|title=United States|publisher=[[Modern Language Association]]|accessdate=September 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201170638/http://www.mla.org/map_data|archive-date=December 1, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak only English at home, 3.45% speak French (standard French, French Creole, or Cajun French), 3.30% speak Spanish, and 0.59% speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].\n\nHistorically, Native American peoples in the area at the time of European encounter were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: [[Caddo language|Caddo]], [[Tunica language|Tunica]], [[Natchez language|Natchez]], [[Houma language|Houma]], [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]], [[Atakapa language|Atakapa]], and [[Chitimacha language|Chitimacha]]. Of these, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have living native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages. Other Native American peoples migrated into the region, escaping from European pressure from the east. Among these were [[Alabama language|Alabama]], Biloxi, Koasati, and Ofo peoples.\n\nStarting in the 1700s, French colonists began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans. They established French culture and language institutions. They imported thousands of slaves from tribes of West Africa, who spoke several different languages. In the creolization process, the slaves developed a Louisiana Creole dialect incorporating both French and African forms, which colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery. In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, particularly, who spoke Louisiana Creole French.\n\nDuring the 19th century after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States, English gradually gained prominence for business and government due to the shift in population with settlement by numerous Americans who were English speakers. Many ethnic French families continued to use French in private. Slaves and some free people of color also spoke Louisiana Creole French. The [[Constitution of Louisiana#Louisiana Constitution of 1812|State Constitution of 1812]] gave English official status in legal proceedings, but use of French remained widespread. Subsequent state constitutions reflect the diminishing importance of French. The 1868 constitution, passed during the [[Reconstruction era]] before Louisiana was re-admitted to the Union, banned laws requiring the publication of legal proceedings in languages other than English. Subsequently, the legal status of French recovered somewhat, but it never regained its pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] prominence.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |title=The French Language in Louisiana Law and Legal Education: A Requiem |first=Roger K |last=Ward |journal=Louisiana Law Review |volume=57 |issue=4 |date=Summer 1997 |access-date=October 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621233419/http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |archive-date=June 21, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSeveral unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana. Dialects of the French language are: [[Colonial French]] and Houma French. [[Louisiana Creole French]] is the term for one of the Creole languages. Two unique dialects developed of the English language: [[Cajun English|Louisiana English]], a French-influenced variety of English in which dropping of postvocalic /r/ is common ; and what is informally known as [[Yat (New Orleans)|Yat]], which resembles the [[New York City English|New York City dialect]] sometimes with southern influences, particularly that of historical [[Brooklyn]]. Both accents were influenced by large communities of immigrant Irish and Italians, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish.\n[[File:Signalisation routi\u00e8re bilingue \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e de la Louisiane.jpg|thumb|Louisiana's bilingual state welcome sign, recognizing its French heritage]]\n\n[[Colonial French]] was the dominant language of white settlers in [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] during the French colonial period; it was spoken primarily by the French Creoles (native-born). In addition to this dialect, the mixed-race people and slaves developed [[Louisiana Creole French|Louisiana Creole]], with a base in West African languages. The limited years of Spanish rule at the end of the 18th century did not result in widespread adoption of the Spanish language. French and Louisiana Creole are still used in modern-day Louisiana, often in family gatherings. English and its associated dialects became predominant after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, after which the area became dominated by numerous English speakers. In some regions, English was influenced by French, as seen with Louisiana English. [[Colonial French]], although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, has persisted alongside English.\n\nRenewed interest in the French language in Louisiana has led to the establishment of Canadian-modeled [[French immersion]] schools, as well as bilingual signage in the historic French neighborhoods of New Orleans and [[Lafayette (Louisiana)|Lafayette]]. In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the state has maintained the [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]] (CODOFIL), which promotes use of the French language in the state's tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations. Through that office's efforts, in 2018 the state became the first in the nation to join the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] as an observer.<ref name=\"OIFlouisiane\">{{cite magazine|magazine=France-Am\u00e9rique|location=New York|language=French|url=https://france-amerique.com/fr/la-francophonie-decision-confirms-the-rebirth-of-french-in-louisiana/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524100821/https://france-amerique.com/fr/la-francophonie-decision-confirms-the-rebirth-of-french-in-louisiana/|archive-date=May 24, 2019|date=October 18, 2018|last=Thiery|first=Cl\u00e9ment|title=La d\u00e9cision de l'OIF confirme la renaissance du fran\u00e7ais en Louisiane}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n\n{{Main|Literature of Louisiana}}\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Main|Music of Louisiana}}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|United States}}\n* [[Louisiana (New France)]]\n* [[Index of Louisiana-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Louisiana]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* ''The Sugar Masters: Planters and Slaves in Louisiana's Cane World, 1820\u20131860'' by Richard Follett, Louisiana State University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-8071-3247-0}}\n* ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'' by Hugh Thomas. 1997: Simon and Schuster. p.&nbsp;548.\n* ''[[Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World]]'' by [[David Brion Davis]] 2006: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533944-4}}\n* [[Yiannopoulos, A.N.]], ''The Civil Codes of Louisiana'' (reprinted from Civil Law System: Louisiana and Comparative law, A Coursebook: Texts, Cases and Materials, 3d Edition; similar to version in preface to Louisiana Civil Code, ed. by Yiannopoulos)\n* Rodolfo Batiza, \"The Louisiana Civil Code of 1808: Its Actual Sources and Present Relevance\", 46 ''TUL.

The alluvial region includes low swamp lands, coastal marshlands and beaches, and [[barrier islands]] that cover about {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2}}. This area lies principally along the Gulf of Mexico and the [[Mississippi River]], which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about {{convert|600|mi|-1|abbr=on}} and empties into the Gulf of Mexico; the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]; the [[Ouachita River]] and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called [[bayous]]).\n\nThe breadth of the alluvial region along the Mississippi is from 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100&nbsp;km), and along the other rivers, the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15&nbsp;km) across. The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as a [[levee]]), from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile (3&nbsp;m/km). The alluvial lands along other streams present similar features.\n\nThe higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than {{convert|25000|sqmi|km2}}. They consist of prairie and woodlands. The elevations above sea level range from 10 feet (3&nbsp;m) at the coast and swamp lands to 50 and 60 feet (15\u201318&nbsp;m) at the prairie and alluvial lands. In the uplands and hills, the elevations rise to [[Driskill Mountain]], the highest point in the state only 535 feet (163&nbsp;m) above sea level. From 1932 to 2010 the state lost 1,800 square miles due to rises in sea level and [[erosion]]. The [[Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority]] (CPRA) spends around $1&nbsp;billion per year to help shore up and protect Louisiana [[shore]]line and land in both federal and state funding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|title=Louisiana fights the sea, and loses|website=The Economist|access-date=August 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828163535/https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|archive-date=August 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBesides the waterways already named, there are the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]], forming the western boundary; and the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl]], the eastern boundary; the [[Calcasieu River|Calcasieu]], the [[Mermentau River|Mermentau]], the [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion]], [[Bayou Teche]], the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]], the [[Boeuf River|Boeuf]], [[Bayou Lafourche]], the Courtableau River, Bayou D'Arbonne, the Macon River, the [[Tensas River|Tensas]], [[Amite River]], the [[Tchefuncte River|Tchefuncte]], the [[Tickfaw River|Tickfaw]], the [[Natalbany River]], and a number of other smaller streams, constituting a natural system of navigable waterways, aggregating over {{convert|4000|mi|km}} long.\n\nThe state also has political jurisdiction over the approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}}-wide portion of [[subsea]] land of the [[Outer continental shelf|inner continental shelf]] in the Gulf of Mexico.

Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a landmass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear.<ref>Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J.

The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which at its farthest point is no more than {{convert|200|mi|-1|abbr=on}} away.\n\nRain is frequent throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state's [[wet season]]. There is a dip in precipitation in October. In summer, thunderstorms build during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief, tropical downpours. In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense.\n\nSummers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June through September averaging 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) or more, and overnight lows averaging above 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (22&nbsp;\u00b0C). At times, temperatures in the 90s F, combined with [[dew points]] in the upper 70s F, create sensible temperatures over {{convert|120|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and movies.\n\nTemperatures are generally warm in the winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of south Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico averaging 66&nbsp;\u00b0F (19&nbsp;\u00b0C). The northern part of the state is mildly cool in the winter, with highs averaging 59&nbsp;\u00b0F (15&nbsp;\u00b0C). The overnight lows in the winter average well above freezing throughout the state, with 46&nbsp;\u00b0F (8&nbsp;\u00b0C) the average near the Gulf and an average low of 37&nbsp;\u00b0F (3&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the winter in the northern part of the state.\n\nOn occasion, cold fronts from low-pressure centers to the north, reach Louisiana in winter. Low temperatures near 20&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22128&nbsp;\u00b0C) occur on occasion in the northern part of the state but rarely do so in the southern part of the state. [[Snow in Louisiana|Snow]] is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although residents in the northern parts of the state might receive a dusting of snow a few times each decade. Louisiana's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|114|F|C}} in [[Plain Dealing, Louisiana|Plain Dealing]] on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is {{convert|-16|F|C}} at [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] on February 13, 1899.\n\nLouisiana is often affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s and is very vulnerable to strikes by major [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricanes]], particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area. The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can result in water damage across a wide area from major hurricanes. The area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer.<ref name=\"Annual average number of tornadoes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |title=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year, more than any other state except Florida. Louisiana averages 27 [[tornado]]es annually. The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado strike, with the extreme southern portion of the state slightly less so than the rest of the state.

The first permanent settlement, Fort Maurepas (at what is now [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], near [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]]), was founded in 1699 by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], a French military officer from Canada.

The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in [[Texas]] via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were worked by imported African slaves. Over time, planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town. This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places, although the commodity crop in the south was primarily sugar cane.\n[[File:Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|thumb|French Acadians, who came to be known as [[Cajuns]], settled the swamps of southern Louisiana, especially in the [[Atchafalaya Basin]].]]\n\nLouisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the [[Illinois Country]], around present-day [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The latter was settled by French colonists from Illinois.\n\nInitially, [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and then [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] served as the capital of La Louisiane. Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, and wanting to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civilian and military authority south of the Great Lakes. From then until the United States acquired the territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of the Mississippi.\n\nIn the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River, in a region referred to as the [[German Coast]].\n\nFrance ceded most of its territory to the east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in 1763, in the aftermath of [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War]] (generally referred to in North America as the [[French and Indian War]]). The rest of Louisiana, including the area around New Orleans and the parishes around [[Lake Pontchartrain]], had become a colony of Spain by the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] (1762). The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.\n\nIn 1765, during Spanish rule, several thousand French-speaking refugees from the region of [[Acadia]] (now [[Nova Scotia]], New Brunswick, and [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada) made their way to Louisiana after having been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from their homelands by the British during the French and Indian War. They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called [[Acadiana]]. The Spanish, eager to gain more Catholic settlers, welcomed the [[Acadian]] refugees, the ancestors of Louisiana's [[Cajun]]s.\n\nSpanish Canary Islanders, called [[Isle\u00f1os]], emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783.\n\nIn 1800, France's [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], an arrangement kept secret for two years.\n\n===Expansion of slavery===\n\n{{main|History of slavery in Louisiana}}\n\n[[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]] brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies. In 1709, French financier [[Antoine Crozat]] obtained a monopoly of commerce in [[La Louisiane]], which extended from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to what is now [[Illinois]]. \"That concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from Africa every year,\" the British historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] wrote.<ref>''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'' by Hugh Thomas. 1997: Simon and Schuster. p. 242-43</ref> Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh there was high mortality among both the colonists and the slaves, resulting in continuing demand and importation of slaves.\n\nStarting in 1719, traders began to import slaves in higher numbers; two French ships, the ''Du Maine'' and the ''Aurore'', arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves coming from Africa. Previous slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies. By the end of 1721, New Orleans counted 1,256 inhabitants, of whom about half were slaves.\n\nIn 1724, the French government issued a law called the [[Code Noir]] (\"Black Code\" in English) which \"regulate[d] the interaction of whites [blancs] and blacks [noirs] in its colony of Louisiana<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|title=Code Noir of Louisiana\u2014Know Louisiana|publisher=|access-date=April 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518041714/http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|archive-date=May 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> (which was much larger than the current state of Louisiana). The law consisted of 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, outlawed \"interracial\" marriages (those between people of different skin color, the varying shades of which were also defined by law), restricted [[manumission]], outlined legal punishment of slaves for various offenses, and defined some obligations of owners to their slaves. The main intent of the French government was to assert control over the slave system of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on slaveowners there. In practice, the Code Noir was exceedingly difficult to enforce from afar. Some priests continued to perform interracial marriage ceremonies, for example, and some slaveholders continued to manumit slaves without permission while others punished slaves brutally.\n\nArticle II of the Code Noir of 1724 required owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion, Roman Catholicism. Sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves. On days off, slaves were expected to feed and take care of themselves. During the 1740s economic crisis in the colony, owners had trouble feeding their slaves and themselves. Giving them time off also effectively gave more power to slaves, who started cultivating their own gardens and crafting items for sale as their own property. They began to participate in the economic development of the colony while at the same time increasing independence and self-subsistence.\n\nArticle VI of the Code Noir forbade mixed marriages, forbade but did little to protect slave women from rape by their owners, overseers or other slaves. On balance, the Code benefitted the owners but had more protections and flexibility than did the institution of slavery in the southern [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\nThe Louisiana Black Code of 1806 made the cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers were seldom prosecuted for such acts.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The law of slavery\u2014Master\u2013slave legal relationships |url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007003400/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |archivedate=October 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nFugitive slaves, called maroons, could easily hide in the backcountry of the bayous and survive in small settlements. The word \"maroon\" comes from the Spanish \"cimarron\", meaning \"fugitive cattle\".\n\nIn the late 18th century, the last Spanish governor of the Louisiana territory wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Truly, it is impossible for lower Louisiana to get along without slaves and with the use of slaves, the colony had been making great strides toward prosperity and wealth.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhen the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased Louisiana]] in 1803, it was soon accepted that enslaved Africans could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighboring [[Mississippi]], though it violated U.S. law to do so.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\">Hugh Thomas, ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'', Simon and Schuster, 1997, p. 548.</ref> Despite demands by United States Rep. [[James Hillhouse]] and by the pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]] to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory,<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\" /> slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest-cost labor.\n\nAt the start of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Louisiana's first United States governor, said African slave labor was needed because white laborers \"cannot be had in this unhealthy climate\".<ref>Thomas (1997), ''The Slave Trade'', p. 549.</ref> Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the African slave trade, which the U.S. and Great Britain adopted in 1808. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade\u2014the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.\n\nBy 1840, New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state. New Orleans had become one of the wealthiest cities, and the third largest city, in the nation.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, p.2</ref> The ban on the African slave trade and importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market.

Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the [[coastwise slave trade]]. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis.\n\nAs the [[Deep South]] was developed for cotton and sugar in the first half of the nineteenth century, demand for slaves increased. This resulted in a massive forced migration (through the slave trade) of more than one million African Americans from the [[Upper South]] to the Deep South. Many traders brought slaves to New Orleans for domestic sale, and by 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the country, was the third-largest city, and was one of the wealthiest cities.\n[[File:Free Woman of Color with daughter NOLA Collage.jpg|thumb|[[Free people of color|Free woman of color]] with [[mixed-race]] daughter; late 18th-century collage painting, New Orleans]]\n\n===Haitian migration and influence===\n\nSpanish occupation of Louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800. Beginning in the 1790s, waves of immigration took place from [[Saint-Domingue]], following a [[Haitian Revolution|slave rebellion]] that started in 1791. Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana from the island, including ethnic Europeans, [[free people of color]], and African slaves, some of the latter brought in by each free group. They greatly increased the French-speaking population in New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and the slaves reinforced African culture in the city.

As American settlers pushed west, they found that the [[Appalachian Mountains]] provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward. The easiest way to ship produce was to use a [[flatboat]] to float it down the [[Ohio river|Ohio]] and Mississippi Rivers to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be put on ocean-going vessels. The problem with this route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].\n\nNapoleon's ambitions in Louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the [[Caribbean]] [[sugar trade]]. By the terms of the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain returned ownership of the islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadaloupe]] to the French. Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands, and as a buffer to U.S. settlement. In October 1801 he sent a large military force to take back Saint-Domingue, then under control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.\nWhen the army led by Napoleon's brother-in-law Leclerc was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana.\n[[File:Louisiane 1800.png|thumb|Map of Louisiana in 1800]]\n\n[[Thomas Jefferson]], third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish French colonies in America. With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U.S. commerce at any time. Jefferson authorized [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], U.S. Minister to France, to negotiate for the purchase of the City of New Orleans, portions of the east bank of the Mississippi, and free navigation of the river for U.S. commerce. Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2&nbsp;million.\n\nAn official transfer of Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's deal with the Spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier. On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, Acting Intendant of Louisiana, made public the intention of Spain to revoke the right of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the United States. The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation. Commerce in the west was virtually blockaded. Historians believe the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses by the Americans, particularly smuggling, and not by French intrigues as was believed at the time. President Jefferson ignored public pressure for war with France, and appointed [[James Monroe]] a special envoy to Napoleon, to assist in obtaining New Orleans for the United States. Jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to $10&nbsp;million.\n\nHowever, on April 11, 1803, French Foreign Minister [[Talleyrand]] surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the '''entirety''' of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered). Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area), and that approval from President Jefferson might take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately. By April 30, they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of {{convert|828000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} for 60 million [[French franc|Francs]] (approximately $15&nbsp;million).\n\nPart of this sum, $3.5&nbsp;million, was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States.<ref>Peter Kastor, ''The Nation's Crucible: The Louisiana Purchase and the Creation of America'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 40</ref> The payment was made in United States [[Government bond|bonds]], which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of [[Hope & Co.|Hope and Company]], and the [[Barings Bank|British banking house of Baring]], at a discount of 87\u00bd per each $100 unit. As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana. English banker [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Alexander Baring]] conferred with Marbois in Paris, shuttled to the United States to pick up the bonds, took them to Britain, and returned to France with the money\u2014which Napoleon used to wage war against Baring's own country.\n[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Louisiana Purchase, 1803.jpg|thumb|Louisiana Purchase, 1803]]\n\nWhen news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised. He had authorized the expenditure of $10&nbsp;million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15&nbsp;million on a land package which would double the size of the country. Jefferson's political opponents in the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AsY9Vh9X8ZYC&dq=%22louisiana+purchase%22+federalist+desert+jefferson&q=worthless+desert |title=The American pageant: a history of the republic\u2014Thomas A.

What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist objections, the U.S. Senate ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803.\n\nBy statute enacted on October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by France and provide for initial governance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=282|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220085715/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=282|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803. Since the Louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the French raised theirs. The following day, [[General James Wilkinson]] accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States. A similar ceremony was held in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on March 9, 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag. The following day, [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] [[Amos Stoddard]] of the First U.S. Artillery marched his troops into town and had the American flag run up the fort's flagpole. The Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the United States government, represented by [[Meriwether Lewis]].\n\nThe Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory. It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific.\n\nShortly after the United States took possession, the area was divided into two territories along the [[33rd parallel north]] on March 26, 1804, thereby organizing the [[Territory of Orleans]] to the south and the [[District of Louisiana]] (subsequently formed as the [[Louisiana Territory]]) to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=320|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=rs6.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220091706/http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=320|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Statehood (1812)===\n\n{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|Seminole Wars|Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty}}\n\nLouisiana became the eighteenth U.S. state on April 30, 1812; the Territory of Orleans became the State of Louisiana and the Louisiana Territory was simultaneously renamed the [[Missouri Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=738|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105021747/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=738|archive-date=January 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> An area known as the [[Florida Parishes]] was soon annexed into the state of Louisiana on April 14, 1812.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=745|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202191512/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=745|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a distinct two-party system, with Democrats competing first against ''Whigs'', then ''Know Nothings'', and finally only other [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref>John M.

Initially state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who passed Black Codes to regulate [[freedmen]] and generally refused to give the vote. They refused to extend voting rights to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans.) Following the [[Memphis riots of 1866]] and the [[New Orleans riot]] the same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen. Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana. It was grouped with [[Texas]] in what was administered as the [[Fifth Military District]].\n\nAfrican Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both [[freedmen]] and [[free people of color|people of color]] who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market. White [[insurgents]] mobilized to enforce [[white supremacy]], first in [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapters.\n\nBy 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the [[White League]], which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence. Following Mississippi's example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] people of color, by raising barriers to voter registration, such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency requirements and [[literacy tests]]. The effect was immediate and long lasting. In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided.<ref>{{Cite journal|ssrn=224731 |title=Richard H.

Because of French and Spanish heritage, and their descendants the Creoles, and later Irish, Italian, Portuguese and German immigrants, southern Louisiana and the greater New Orleans area are predominantly Catholic.<ref>For Louisiana's position in a larger religious context, see [[Bible Belt]].</ref>\n\nSince Creoles were the first settlers, planters and leaders of the territory, they have traditionally been well represented in politics. For instance, most of the early governors were Creole Catholics.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Louisiana}}</ref> Because Catholics still constitute a significant fraction of Louisiana's population, they have continued to be influential in state politics. {{As of|2008}} both Senators and the governor were Catholic. The high proportion and influence of the Catholic population makes Louisiana distinct among Southern states.<ref>Other Southern states have longstanding indigenous Catholic populations, and Florida's largely Catholic population of Cuban emigres has been influential since the 1960s. Yet, Louisiana is still unusual or exceptional in its extent of aboriginal Catholic settlement and influence. Among states in the [[Deep South]] (discounting [[Florida Panhandle|Florida's Panhandle]] and much of Texas) the historic role of Catholicism in Louisiana is unparalleled and unique. Among the states of the Union, Louisiana's unique use of the term ''parish'' (French ''la parouche'' or \"la paroisse\") for ''county'' is rooted in the pre-statehood role of Catholic church parishes in the administration of government.</ref>\n\n[[Jewish]] communities are established in the state's larger cities, notably New Orleans and Baton Rouge.<ref>Isaacs, Ronald H.

Neighboring states and the amount of federal spending received per dollar of federal tax collected were: Texas ($0.94), Arkansas ($1.41), and Mississippi ($2.02).

Petroleum and gas deposits are found in abundance both onshore and offshore in State-owned waters. In addition, vast petroleum and natural gas reserves are found offshore from Louisiana in the federally administered [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS) in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], the Gulf of Mexico OCS is the largest U.S. petroleum-producing region. Excluding the Gulf of Mexico OCS, Louisiana ranks fourth in petroleum production and is home to about two percent of the total U.S. petroleum reserves.\n\nLouisiana's natural gas reserves account for about five percent of the U.S. total. The recent discovery of the [[Haynesville Shale]] formation in parts of or all of Caddo, Bossier, Bienville, Sabine, De Soto, Red River, and Natchitoches parishes have made it the world's fourth largest gas field with some wells initially producing over 25 million cubic feet of gas daily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Louisiana |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206050811/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |archive-date=February 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLouisiana was the first site of [[Oil well|petroleum drilling]] over water in the world, on [[Caddo Lake]] in the northwest corner of the state. The petroleum and gas industry, as well as its subsidiary industries such as transport and [[Oil refinery|refining]], have dominated Louisiana's economy since the 1940s. Beginning in 1950, Louisiana was sued several times by the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Interior Department]], in efforts by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to strip Louisiana of its submerged land property rights. These control vast stores of reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas.\n\nWhen petroleum and gas [[1973 oil crisis|boomed]] in the 1970s, so did Louisiana's economy. The Louisiana economy as well as its politics of the last half-century cannot be understood without thoroughly accounting for the influence of the petroleum and gas industries. Since the 1980s, these industries' headquarters have consolidated in [[Houston]], but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude-oil-and-gas industry remained in Louisiana {{as of|lc=y|2010}}.\n\n==Law and government==\n\n{{Politics of Louisiana}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[Law of the United Kingdom]]-->\n:{{Further|List of Louisiana Governors|Louisiana law|Louisiana Constitution}}\n[[File:Louisiana State Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] in Baton Rouge, the [[Heights of state capitols|tallest state capitol building]] in the United States]]\n[[File:LAGovMansion.JPG|right|thumb|The Louisiana Governor's Mansion]]\n\nIn 1849, the state moved the capital from New Orleans to [[Baton Rouge]]. [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana|Donaldsonville]], [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]], and [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] have briefly served as the seat of Louisiana state government. The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] and the [[Louisiana Governor's Mansion]] are both located in Baton Rouge. The [[Louisiana Supreme Court]], however, did not move to Baton Rouge but remains headquartered in New Orleans.\n\nLouisiana and California (whose supreme court is seated in San Francisco) are the only two states whose high courts are not headquartered in the state capital.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe current Louisiana governor is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Bel Edwards]]. The current [[United States Senate|United States senators]] are Republicans [[John Neely Kennedy]] and [[Bill Cassidy]]. Louisiana has six [[congressional district]]s and is represented in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] by five Republicans and one Democrat. Louisiana had eight votes in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] for the [[2012 United States presidential election in Louisiana|2012 election]]. It lost one House seat due to stagnant population growth in the 2010 Census.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n\nLouisiana is divided into 64 [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]] (the equivalent of [[County (United States)|counties]] in most other states).<ref name=\"nativeamericans\">{{Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|name=Native Americans}}</ref>\n* [[List of parishes in Louisiana]]\n* [[Louisiana census statistical areas]]\n\nMost parishes have an elected government known as the Police Jury, dating from the colonial days. It is the legislative and executive government of the parish, and is elected by the voters. Its members are called Jurors, and together they elect a president as their chairman.\n\nA more limited number of parishes operate under [[home rule]] charters, electing various forms of government. This include mayor\u2013council, council\u2013manager (in which the council hires a professional operating manager for the parish), and others.\n\n===Civil law===\n\nThe Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance. One is the use of the term \"[[parish (Louisiana)|parish]]\" (from the French: ''paroisse'') in place of \"[[County (United States)|county]]\" for administrative subdivision. Another is the legal system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] based on French, German, and Spanish [[legal code]]s and ultimately [[Roman law]], as opposed to English [[common law]].\n\nLouisiana's civil law system is what the majority of nations in the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive from the [[British Empire]]. However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the [[Napoleonic Code]]. Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased]] and annexed Louisiana in 1803.\n\nWhile the Louisiana Civil Code of 1808 has been continuously revised and updated since its enactment, it is still considered the controlling authority in the state. Differences are found between Louisianan civil law and the common law found in the other U.S. states. While some of these differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition,<ref name=\"kinsellalaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |title=A Civil Law to Common Law Dictionary |accessdate=December 7, 2010 |last=Kinsella |first=Norman |year=1997 |website=KinsellaLaw.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105448/http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |archivedate=December 25, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana private law. Thus property, contractual, business entities structure, much of civil procedure, and family law, as well as some aspects of criminal law, are still based mostly on traditional Roman legal thinking.\n\n===Marriage===\n\nIn 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or a [[covenant marriage]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marriage.about.com/cs/covenantmarriage/a/covenant.htm |title=Covenant Marriage\u2014Pros and Cons |publisher=Marriage.about.com |date=January 1, 2012 |accessdate=February 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307225008/http://marriage.about.com/cs/covenantmarriage/a/covenant.htm |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In a covenant marriage, the couple waives their right to a \"no-fault\" divorce after six months of separation, which is available in a traditional marriage.

The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during these decades, but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until after the [[civil rights movement]] of the mid-20th century, gaining enforcement of their constitutional rights through passage by Congress of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].\n\nSince the 1960s, when civil rights legislation was passed under President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party. In the same years, many white social conservatives have moved to support Republican Party candidates in national, gubernatorial and statewide elections. In 2004, [[David Vitter]] was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. senator. The previous Republican senator, [[John S. Harris]], who took office in 1868 during Reconstruction, was chosen by the state legislature under the rules of the 19th century.\n\nLouisiana is unique among U.S. states in using a system for its state and local elections similar to that of modern France. All candidates, regardless of party affiliation, run in a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] (or \"jungle primary\") on Election Day. If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later. This run-off method does not take into account party identification; therefore, it is not uncommon for a Democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican.\n\nCongressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system. All other states (except [[Washington Initiative 872 (2004)|Washington]], [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|California]], and [[Maine]]) use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a [[plurality voting system]] or [[Two-round system|runoff voting]], to elect senators, representatives, and statewide officials. Between 2008 and 2010, federal [[United States Congress|congressional]] elections were run under a closed primary system\u2014limited to registered party members. However, upon the passage of House Bill 292, Louisiana again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections.\n\nLouisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, five of which are currently held by Republicans and one by a Democrat. The state lost a House seat at the end of the [[112th Congress]] due to stagnant population growth as recorded by the [[2010 United States Census]]. Louisiana is not classified as a \"[[swing state]]\" for future presidential elections, as since the late 20th century, it has regularly supported Republican candidates. The state's two U.S. senators are [[Bill Cassidy]] (R) [[John Neely Kennedy]] (R).\n\n===Law enforcement===\n\n{{See also|List of law enforcement agencies in Louisiana}}\n\nLouisiana's statewide police force is the [[Louisiana State Police]]. It began in 1922 with the creation of the Highway Commission. In 1927, a second branch, the Bureau of Criminal Investigations, was formed. In 1932, the State Highway Patrol was authorized to carry weapons.\n\nOn July 28, 1936, the two branches were consolidated to form the Louisiana Department of State Police; its motto was \"courtesy, loyalty, service\". In 1942, this office was abolished and became a division of the Department of Public Safety, called the Louisiana State Police. In 1988, the Criminal Investigation Bureau was reorganized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lsp.org/about_hist.html |title=Louisiana State Police\u2014About Us\u2014LSP History |publisher=Lsp.org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504001036/http://www.lsp.org/about_hist.html |archive-date=May 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Its troopers have statewide jurisdiction with power to enforce all laws of the state, including city and parish ordinances. Each year, they patrol over 12 million miles (20&nbsp;million km) of roadway and arrest about 10,000 impaired drivers. The State Police are primarily a traffic enforcement agency, with other sections that delve into trucking safety, narcotics enforcement, and gaming oversight.\n\nThe elected sheriff in each parish is the chief law enforcement officer in the parish. They are the keepers of the local parish prisons, which house felony and misdemeanor prisoners. They are the primary criminal patrol and first responder agency in all matters criminal and civil. They are also the official tax collectors in each parish. The sheriffs are responsible for general law enforcement in their respective parishes. Orleans Parish is an exception, as the general law enforcement duties fall to the New Orleans Police Department. Before 2010, Orleans parish was the only parish to have two sheriff's offices. Orleans Parish divided sheriffs' duties between criminal and civil, with a different elected sheriff overseeing each aspect. In 2006, a bill was passed which eventually consolidated the two sheriff's departments into one parish sheriff responsible for both civil and criminal matters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2015, Louisiana had a higher murder rate (10.3 per 100,000) than any other state in the country for the 27th straight year.

Conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases. Both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates. The settlers kept importing slaves, which resulted in a high proportion of native Africans from West Africa, who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings. As described by historian [[Gwendolyn Midlo Hall]], they developed a marked Afro-Creole culture in the colonial era.<ref>Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century'' (1992)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|title=Afro-Louisiana History and Genealogy|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430233835/http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|archive-date=April 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a major influx of white and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the [[Haitian Revolution]], many of whom brought their slaves with them. This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in [[Saint-Domingue]] were from Africa than in the United States. They strongly influenced the African-American culture of the city in terms of dance, music and religious practices.\n\n===Louisiana Creole culture===\n\n[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] culture is an amalgamation of French, African, Spanish (and other European), and Native American cultures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |title=French Creole Heritage |publisher=Laheritage.org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830084559/http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |archivedate=August 30, 2014 }}</ref> Creole comes from the Portuguese word ''crioulo''; originally it referred to a colonist of European (specifically French) descent who was born in the New World, in comparison to immigrants from France.<ref>Delehanty, Randolph. ''New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence, Chronicle Books'', 1995, pg. 14</ref> The oldest Louisiana manuscript to use the word \"Creole\", from 1782, applied it to a slave born in the French colony.<ref>Kein, Sybil. ''Creole: The History and Legacy of Louisiana's Free People of Color'', Louisiana State University Press, 2009, p. 73.</ref> But originally it referred more generally to the French colonists born in Louisiana.\n\nOver time, there developed in the French colony a relatively large group of [[Creoles of Color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who were primarily descended from African slave women and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans.) Often the French would free their concubines and [[mixed-race]] children, and pass on social capital to them. They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army for a career. They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children. The free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education; they generally spoke French and were Roman Catholic. Many became artisans and property owners. Over time, the term \"Creole\" became associated with this class of [[Creoles of Color]], many of whom achieved freedom long before the Civil War.\n\nWealthy French Creoles generally maintained town houses in [[New Orleans]] as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the Mississippi River. New Orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region; they could find work there and created their own culture, marrying among themselves for decades.\n\n===Acadian culture===\n\nThe ancestors of [[Cajun]]s immigrated mostly from west central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], known originally as [[Acadia]]. After the British defeated France in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain. The British forcibly separated families and evicted them from Acadia because they refused to vow loyalty to the new British regime. The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France. Some escaped the British remained in [[French Canada]].\n\nOthers scattered, to France, Canada, Mexico, or the Falkland Islands. Many Acadian refugees settled in south Louisiana in the region around [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and the LaFourche Bayou country. They developed a distinct rural culture there, different from the French Creole colonists of New Orleans. Intermarrying with others in the area, they developed what was called Cajun music, cuisine and culture. Until the 1970s, the term \"Cajun\" was considered somewhat derogatory.\n\n===Isle\u00f1o culture===\n\n{{Main|Isle\u00f1o (Louisiana)}}\n[[File:El_Museo_de_los_Isle\u00f1os.jpg|alt=|thumb|El Museo de los Isle\u00f1os (Isle\u00f1o Museum) in [[Saint Bernard, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]]]\n\nA third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isle\u00f1os. Its members are descendants of colonists from the [[Canary Islands]] who settled in [[Spanish Louisiana]] between 1778 and 1783 and intermarried with other communities such as [[French people|Frenchman]], [[Acadians]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], [[Spaniards]], and other groups, mainly through the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nIn Louisiana, the Isle\u00f1os originally settled in four communities which included Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo. Of those settlements, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most successful as the other two were plagued with both disease and flooding. The large migration of [[Acadian]] refugees to [[Bayou Lafourche]] led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo ([[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language into the 21st century. This being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely halted in St. Bernard with those having competency in Spanish being octogenarians.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite book|title=The Language of the Isle\u00f1os: Vestigial Spanish in Louisiana|last1=Lipski|first1=John|date=July 1, 1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115347|location=|pages=i, 4}}</ref>\n\nThrough the centuries, the various Isle\u00f1o communities of Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canary Islander heritage while also adopting and building upon the customs and traditions of the communities that surround them. Today two heritage associates exist for the communities: Los Isle\u00f1os Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard as well as the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana. The [[Isle\u00f1os Fiesta|Fiesta de los Isle\u00f1os]] is celebrated annually in St. Bernard Parish which features heritage performances from local groups and the Canary Islands.\n\n===Languages===\n\n[[File:Native Languages of Louisiana.svg|thumbnail|The languages of historic Native American tribes that occupied what is now Louisiana include: Tunica, Caddo, Natchez, Choctaw, Atakapa, Chitimacha and Houma.]]\n\nAccording to a 2010 study by the Modern Language Association, among persons five years old and older,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data|title=United States|publisher=[[Modern Language Association]]|accessdate=September 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201170638/http://www.mla.org/map_data|archive-date=December 1, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak only English at home, 3.45% speak French (standard French, French Creole, or Cajun French), 3.30% speak Spanish, and 0.59% speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].\n\nHistorically, Native American peoples in the area at the time of European encounter were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: [[Caddo language|Caddo]], [[Tunica language|Tunica]], [[Natchez language|Natchez]], [[Houma language|Houma]], [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]], [[Atakapa language|Atakapa]], and [[Chitimacha language|Chitimacha]]. Of these, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have living native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages. Other Native American peoples migrated into the region, escaping from European pressure from the east. Among these were [[Alabama language|Alabama]], Biloxi, Koasati, and Ofo peoples.\n\nStarting in the 1700s, French colonists began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans. They established French culture and language institutions. They imported thousands of slaves from tribes of West Africa, who spoke several different languages. In the creolization process, the slaves developed a Louisiana Creole dialect incorporating both French and African forms, which colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery. In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, particularly, who spoke Louisiana Creole French.\n\nDuring the 19th century after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States, English gradually gained prominence for business and government due to the shift in population with settlement by numerous Americans who were English speakers. Many ethnic French families continued to use French in private. Slaves and some free people of color also spoke Louisiana Creole French. The [[Constitution of Louisiana#Louisiana Constitution of 1812|State Constitution of 1812]] gave English official status in legal proceedings, but use of French remained widespread. Subsequent state constitutions reflect the diminishing importance of French. The 1868 constitution, passed during the [[Reconstruction era]] before Louisiana was re-admitted to the Union, banned laws requiring the publication of legal proceedings in languages other than English. Subsequently, the legal status of French recovered somewhat, but it never regained its pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] prominence.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |title=The French Language in Louisiana Law and Legal Education: A Requiem |first=Roger K |last=Ward |journal=Louisiana Law Review |volume=57 |issue=4 |date=Summer 1997 |access-date=October 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621233419/http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |archive-date=June 21, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSeveral unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana. Dialects of the French language are: [[Colonial French]] and Houma French. [[Louisiana Creole French]] is the term for one of the Creole languages. Two unique dialects developed of the English language: [[Cajun English|Louisiana English]], a French-influenced variety of English in which dropping of postvocalic /r/ is common ; and what is informally known as [[Yat (New Orleans)|Yat]], which resembles the [[New York City English|New York City dialect]] sometimes with southern influences, particularly that of historical [[Brooklyn]]. Both accents were influenced by large communities of immigrant Irish and Italians, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish.\n[[File:Signalisation routi\u00e8re bilingue \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e de la Louisiane.jpg|thumb|Louisiana's bilingual state welcome sign, recognizing its French heritage]]\n\n[[Colonial French]] was the dominant language of white settlers in [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] during the French colonial period; it was spoken primarily by the French Creoles (native-born). In addition to this dialect, the mixed-race people and slaves developed [[Louisiana Creole French|Louisiana Creole]], with a base in West African languages. The limited years of Spanish rule at the end of the 18th century did not result in widespread adoption of the Spanish language. French and Louisiana Creole are still used in modern-day Louisiana, often in family gatherings. English and its associated dialects became predominant after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, after which the area became dominated by numerous English speakers. In some regions, English was influenced by French, as seen with Louisiana English. [[Colonial French]], although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, has persisted alongside English.\n\nRenewed interest in the French language in Louisiana has led to the establishment of Canadian-modeled [[French immersion]] schools, as well as bilingual signage in the historic French neighborhoods of New Orleans and [[Lafayette (Louisiana)|Lafayette]]. In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the state has maintained the [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]] (CODOFIL), which promotes use of the French language in the state's tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations.

On 5 January 1869 the club was founded during a general meeting at Robertson's Temperance Hotel on Portland Street.<ref>{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn= 1-874427-75-5}}</ref> Originally they played a game more similar to [[Rugby football|rugby]] and these origins are reflected to this day by the name of the club's home ground&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rugby Park]]. The difficulty in organising fixtures under this code and the growing influence of [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] soon persuaded them to adopt the association code instead. At this time, the club played games in a number locations including Holm Quarry, the Grange on Irvine Road and a location close to the current Rugby Park.\n\nFollowing the formation of Scotland's earliest football clubs in the 1860s, football experienced a rapid growth but there was no formal structure, and matches were often arranged in a haphazard and irregular fashion.\n\n[[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], a Glasgow club founded in 1867, took the lead, and following an advertisement in a Glasgow newspaper in 1873, representatives from seven clubs \u2013 Queen's Park, Clydesdale, Vale of Leven, Dumbreck, Third Lanark, Eastern and Granville \u2013 attended a meeting on 13 March 1873. Furthermore, Kilmarnock sent a letter stating their willingness to form the [[Scottish Football Association]].\n\nThat day, these eight clubs formed the Scottish Football Association, and resolved that: The clubs here represented form themselves into an association for the promotion of football according to the rules of The Football Association and that the clubs connected with this association subscribe for a challenge cup to be played for annually, the committee to propose the laws of the competition.\n\nKilmarnock also competed in the inaugural [[Scottish Cup]] tournament in 1873\u201374. Their 2\u20130 defeat against [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] in the First Round on 18 October 1873 is thought to have been the first match ever played in the competition.\n\nKilmarnock joined the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] in [[1895\u201396 in Scottish football|1895]] and after winning consecutive Second Division titles were elected to the top flight for the first time in [[1899\u20131900 in Scottish football|1899]]. In 1920 Kilmarnock won the Scottish Cup for the first time beating [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]] at Hampden. This was followed soon by their second success in 1929 where they beat massive favourites [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 2\u20130 at the national stadium in front of a crowd of 114,708 people.<ref name=\"Ross 1994\">{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn=1-874427-75-5}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century===\nIn [[1964\u201365 Scottish Division One|1964\u201365]] [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] fought out a championship title race with [[Willie Waddell]]'s Kilmarnock. In the era of two points for a win Hearts were three points clear with two games remaining. Hearts drew with [[Dundee United]] meaning the last game of the season with the two title challengers playing each other at Tynecastle would be a league decider. Kilmarnock needed to win by a two-goal margin to take the title. Hearts entered the game as favourites with both a statistical and home advantage. They also had a solid pedigree of trophy winning under Tommy Walker. Waddell's Kilmarnock in contrast had been nearly men. Four times in the previous five seasons they had finished league runners-up including Hearts\u2019 triumph in 1960. Killie had also lost three domestic cup finals during the same period including the 1962 League Cup Final defeat to Hearts. Hearts had won five of the six senior cup finals they played in under Walker. Even the final they had lost was in a replay after drawing the first game. Hearts' [[Roald Jensen]] hit the post after six minutes. Kilmarnock then scored twice through [[Davie Sneddon]] and Brian McIlroy after 27 and 29 minutes. [[Alan Gordon (Scottish footballer)|Alan Gordon]] had an excellent chance to clinch the title for Hearts in second half injury time but was denied by a [[Bobby Ferguson (footballer, born 1945)|Bobby Ferguson]] diving save pushing the ball past the post.

On 11 January 2010, Jim Jefferies left the club by \"mutual consent\" and [[Jimmy Calderwood]] was appointed manager.

Kilmarnock began the game with a two-point advantage over their rivals and a goalless draw on the day was good enough to secure top-flight football for another year.

In an unexpected move, Kilmarnock appointed former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] coach [[Steve Clarke]] two weeks later.

The season's results also set a new record points total for the club and their highest placed finish in the league since 1966. The following day, Clarke was signed by the [[Scottish FA]] to become the head coach of the [[Scotland National Football Team|Scotland National Team]].\n\n==Colours and badge==\n\n[[File:Kilmarnock_FC_150th_Anniversary_Logo.svg|thumb|left|The 150th Anniversary Badge from 2018\u20132019]]\n\nThe earliest known Kilmarnock kit from 1879 consisted of an all blue jersey with white trousers. The shirt bore a crest which was described as \"a hand, index and second fingers upright, thumb outstretched, other fingers enclosed over a palm\" (an adoption of the historic [[Clan Boyd]] chief's heraldic crest). The hand rested on a bar over a ball marked KFC. Between 1887-1890 Kilmarnock wore black and white striped tops. Thereafter, the club has predominantly played in blue and white striped or hooped shirts with either blue or white shorts. The club have also occasionally played in plain blue and plain white tops; this was suggested by Ross Quigley whom at the time was one of the first directors of the club, although the kit was later changed to the hooped style in 1920. The club's away colours have varied greatly over time. Yellow is generally regarded as the club's main third colour; but white, red and purple away kits have also appeared in recent years.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, the club manufactured their kits under their own sportswear brand, 1869. Following this, Italian company Erre\u00e1 was the manufacturer. The current shirt sponsors are the locally based QTS Group with American company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] manufacturing the kit, which can only be bought from their own store at [[Rugby Park]].\n\nThe club badge is a modernised version of previous club badges. It features a ball bearing a hand in a blessing position, flanked by two red squirrels. The club's Latin motto, 'confidemus' ('we trust'), is written above the badge (similar to the [[Clan Boyd]] heraldic motto, 'confido' ('I trust')). The club adopted the badge in 1993 after [[Lord Lyon King of Arms|The Lord Lyon]] decreed that the previous badge, based heavily upon the town crest, was in breach of ancient Scottish [[heraldry|heraldic]] rules.\n\nIn October 2018 the club unveiled a special badge for the club's 150th anniversary.\n\n<center>\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la =\n| pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n| pattern_ra =\n| leftarm    = 000066\n| body       = 000066\n| rightarm   = 000066\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Dark blue jersey, white shorts, dark blue socks\n| title      = Kilmarnocks's first known kit from 1879.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so = _2_stripes_white\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1920 & 1929\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_b  = _whitestripes\n| pattern_ra = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 0000ff\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = League winning kit from 1965.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = 0000FF\n| socks      = 0000FF\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Home kit from 1977 to 1989\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_b  = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_ra = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_sh = _fortaleza09a\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = FFFFFF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = FFFFFF\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, white socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1997\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_b  = _bluesides_horizontal_line\n| pattern_ra = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_sh = _bluesides_bottom_line\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = ffff66\n| body       = ffff66\n| rightarm   = ffff66\n| shorts     = ffff66\n| socks      = ffff66\n| alt        = Yellow jersey, yellow shorts, yellow socks.\n| title      = Scottish League Cup winning away kit from 2012\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n</center>\n\n==Stadium==\n{{see|Rugby Park}}\n[[File:Rugby Park.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Rugby Park]] stadium, situated on Rugby Road, home of Kilmarnock FC]]\nKilmarnock first played football matches at the present [[Rugby Park]] site in 1899. Despite this, the venue is actually Kilmarnock\u2019s fourth home ground. The Grange, Holm Quarry and Ward's Park all hosted matches before the club moved to Rugby Park in 1877. This was not the present stadium, but one situated close by near South Hamilton Street. This ground was shared by cricket and rugby teams&nbsp;\u2013 sports which Kilmarnock had played previously&nbsp;\u2013 and the connection with rugby gave the ground its name. This name was taken with the club when they moved to their present stadium.\n\nDuring 1994\u201395 season the stadium capacity was significantly reduced as three new stands were constructed; the Moffat Stand, the Chadwick Stand and the East Stand. Their completion brought the capacity of the stadium to {{SPFL-stadiums|kilmarnock}}.<ref name=\"capacity\">{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/kilmarnock/ |title=Kilmarnock Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref> The stadium opened on 6 August 1995, in a friendly match against English champions [[Blackburn Rovers]].

The pitch is capable of hosting [[rugby football|rugby]] matches as well as football. A new artificial hybrid surface was installed during the 2019 close season. \n\nIn February 2019 Kilmarnock received approval to install a new safe-standing section in areas of the East and Moffat stands.

On 5 January 1869 the club was founded during a general meeting at Robertson's Temperance Hotel on Portland Street.<ref>{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn= 1-874427-75-5}}</ref> Originally they played a game more similar to [[Rugby football|rugby]] and these origins are reflected to this day by the name of the club's home ground&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rugby Park]]. The difficulty in organising fixtures under this code and the growing influence of [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] soon persuaded them to adopt the association code instead. At this time, the club played games in a number locations including Holm Quarry, the Grange on Irvine Road and a location close to the current Rugby Park.\n\nFollowing the formation of Scotland's earliest football clubs in the 1860s, football experienced a rapid growth but there was no formal structure, and matches were often arranged in a haphazard and irregular fashion.\n\n[[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], a Glasgow club founded in 1867, took the lead, and following an advertisement in a Glasgow newspaper in 1873, representatives from seven clubs \u2013 Queen's Park, Clydesdale, Vale of Leven, Dumbreck, Third Lanark, Eastern and Granville \u2013 attended a meeting on 13 March 1873. Furthermore, Kilmarnock sent a letter stating their willingness to form the [[Scottish Football Association]].\n\nThat day, these eight clubs formed the Scottish Football Association, and resolved that: The clubs here represented form themselves into an association for the promotion of football according to the rules of The Football Association and that the clubs connected with this association subscribe for a challenge cup to be played for annually, the committee to propose the laws of the competition.\n\nKilmarnock also competed in the inaugural [[Scottish Cup]] tournament in 1873\u201374. Their 2\u20130 defeat against [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] in the First Round on 18 October 1873 is thought to have been the first match ever played in the competition.\n\nKilmarnock joined the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] in [[1895\u201396 in Scottish football|1895]] and after winning consecutive Second Division titles were elected to the top flight for the first time in [[1899\u20131900 in Scottish football|1899]]. In 1920 Kilmarnock won the Scottish Cup for the first time beating [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]] at Hampden. This was followed soon by their second success in 1929 where they beat massive favourites [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 2\u20130 at the national stadium in front of a crowd of 114,708 people.<ref name=\"Ross 1994\">{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn=1-874427-75-5}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century===\nIn [[1964\u201365 Scottish Division One|1964\u201365]] [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] fought out a championship title race with [[Willie Waddell]]'s Kilmarnock. In the era of two points for a win Hearts were three points clear with two games remaining. Hearts drew with [[Dundee United]] meaning the last game of the season with the two title challengers playing each other at Tynecastle would be a league decider. Kilmarnock needed to win by a two-goal margin to take the title. Hearts entered the game as favourites with both a statistical and home advantage. They also had a solid pedigree of trophy winning under Tommy Walker. Waddell's Kilmarnock in contrast had been nearly men. Four times in the previous five seasons they had finished league runners-up including Hearts\u2019 triumph in 1960. Killie had also lost three domestic cup finals during the same period including the 1962 League Cup Final defeat to Hearts. Hearts had won five of the six senior cup finals they played in under Walker. Even the final they had lost was in a replay after drawing the first game. Hearts' [[Roald Jensen]] hit the post after six minutes. Kilmarnock then scored twice through [[Davie Sneddon]] and Brian McIlroy after 27 and 29 minutes. [[Alan Gordon (Scottish footballer)|Alan Gordon]] had an excellent chance to clinch the title for Hearts in second half injury time but was denied by a [[Bobby Ferguson (footballer, born 1945)|Bobby Ferguson]] diving save pushing the ball past the post.

On 11 January 2010, Jim Jefferies left the club by \"mutual consent\" and [[Jimmy Calderwood]] was appointed manager. Kilmarnock then achieved a first win in nine years against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. Continued poor form, however, meant a final day showdown at Rugby Park with Falkirk for SPL survival. Kilmarnock began the game with a two-point advantage over their rivals and a goalless draw on the day was good enough to secure top-flight football for another year. They ended the season with just 33 points, their worst points finish in the SPL.\n\nAfter Calderwood left the team at the end the season, [[Mixu Paatelainen]] was appointed manager for the next two years with an option for a third.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/k/kilmarnock/8754914.stm|title=Football \u2013 Mixu Paatelainen is named as the new Kilmarnock manager|publisher=BBC|date=23 June 2010}}</ref> Despite being the favourites for relegation that season, Kilmarnock finished the season in fifth position.

McCulloch was sacked in September 2017 with the club rooted to the bottom of the table. In an unexpected move, Kilmarnock appointed former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] coach [[Steve Clarke]] two weeks later. It was Clarke\u2019s first involvement with the Scottish game in 30 years.

Kilmarnock won the match 2\u20131 and the result secured a third place finish in the league, which guaranteed Kilmarnock European football for the first time since 2001. The season's results also set a new record points total for the club and their highest placed finish in the league since 1966. The following day, Clarke was signed by the [[Scottish FA]] to become the head coach of the [[Scotland National Football Team|Scotland National Team]].\n\n==Colours and badge==\n\n[[File:Kilmarnock_FC_150th_Anniversary_Logo.svg|thumb|left|The 150th Anniversary Badge from 2018\u20132019]]\n\nThe earliest known Kilmarnock kit from 1879 consisted of an all blue jersey with white trousers. The shirt bore a crest which was described as \"a hand, index and second fingers upright, thumb outstretched, other fingers enclosed over a palm\" (an adoption of the historic [[Clan Boyd]] chief's heraldic crest). The hand rested on a bar over a ball marked KFC. Between 1887-1890 Kilmarnock wore black and white striped tops. Thereafter, the club has predominantly played in blue and white striped or hooped shirts with either blue or white shorts. The club have also occasionally played in plain blue and plain white tops; this was suggested by Ross Quigley whom at the time was one of the first directors of the club, although the kit was later changed to the hooped style in 1920. The club's away colours have varied greatly over time. Yellow is generally regarded as the club's main third colour; but white, red and purple away kits have also appeared in recent years.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, the club manufactured their kits under their own sportswear brand, 1869. Following this, Italian company Erre\u00e1 was the manufacturer. The current shirt sponsors are the locally based QTS Group with American company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] manufacturing the kit, which can only be bought from their own store at [[Rugby Park]].\n\nThe club badge is a modernised version of previous club badges. It features a ball bearing a hand in a blessing position, flanked by two red squirrels. The club's Latin motto, 'confidemus' ('we trust'), is written above the badge (similar to the [[Clan Boyd]] heraldic motto, 'confido' ('I trust')). The club adopted the badge in 1993 after [[Lord Lyon King of Arms|The Lord Lyon]] decreed that the previous badge, based heavily upon the town crest, was in breach of ancient Scottish [[heraldry|heraldic]] rules.\n\nIn October 2018 the club unveiled a special badge for the club's 150th anniversary.\n\n<center>\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la =\n| pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n| pattern_ra =\n| leftarm    = 000066\n| body       = 000066\n| rightarm   = 000066\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Dark blue jersey, white shorts, dark blue socks\n| title      = Kilmarnocks's first known kit from 1879.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so = _2_stripes_white\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1920 & 1929\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_b  = _whitestripes\n| pattern_ra = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 0000ff\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = League winning kit from 1965.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = 0000FF\n| socks      = 0000FF\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Home kit from 1977 to 1989\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_b  = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_ra = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_sh = _fortaleza09a\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = FFFFFF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = FFFFFF\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, white socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1997\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_b  = _bluesides_horizontal_line\n| pattern_ra = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_sh = _bluesides_bottom_line\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = ffff66\n| body       = ffff66\n| rightarm   = ffff66\n| shorts     = ffff66\n| socks      = ffff66\n| alt        = Yellow jersey, yellow shorts, yellow socks.\n| title      = Scottish League Cup winning away kit from 2012\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n</center>\n\n==Stadium==\n{{see|Rugby Park}}\n[[File:Rugby Park.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Rugby Park]] stadium, situated on Rugby Road, home of Kilmarnock FC]]\nKilmarnock first played football matches at the present [[Rugby Park]] site in 1899. Despite this, the venue is actually Kilmarnock\u2019s fourth home ground. The Grange, Holm Quarry and Ward's Park all hosted matches before the club moved to Rugby Park in 1877. This was not the present stadium, but one situated close by near South Hamilton Street. This ground was shared by cricket and rugby teams&nbsp;\u2013 sports which Kilmarnock had played previously&nbsp;\u2013 and the connection with rugby gave the ground its name. This name was taken with the club when they moved to their present stadium.\n\nDuring 1994\u201395 season the stadium capacity was significantly reduced as three new stands were constructed; the Moffat Stand, the Chadwick Stand and the East Stand. Their completion brought the capacity of the stadium to {{SPFL-stadiums|kilmarnock}}.<ref name=\"capacity\">{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/kilmarnock/ |title=Kilmarnock Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref> The stadium opened on 6 August 1995, in a friendly match against English champions [[Blackburn Rovers]].

The pitch is capable of hosting [[rugby football|rugby]] matches as well as football. A new artificial hybrid surface was installed during the 2019 close season. \n\nIn February 2019 Kilmarnock received approval to install a new safe-standing section in areas of the East and Moffat stands.

His mother Indera was a housewife, and his father Andrew Sivam was a store supervisor. His ancestors hailed from [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]] and also [[Coimbatore]], [[Madurai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. He is the eldest of two siblings in a family consisting a sister (Patricia Sivagamy).\n\nSHESHA had his primary education at the '''Sekolah Kebangsaan Tunku Abdul Malik''' in [[Kulim]], [[Kedah]], [[Malaysia]]. As a child he had a great interest in badminton and chess. After his primary, SHESHA was enrolled at the '''Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Kulim''' . Upon completion of his school education, SHESHA performed several jobs like telemarketer, waiting staff, bartender and disc jockey while pursuing his studies in engineering in Penang. Quitting his studies in Penang, SHESHA left to Kuala Lumpur to pursue his music career. Performing several jobs like manual labour and customer service representative. Later on decided to take up sound & music course in [[Limkokwing University of Creative Technology]]. His relative and friends motivated him to join the university and supported him during this phase. SHESHA graduated with a full scholarship aid given by Tan Sri Dato\u2019 Sri Paduka Dr Limkokwing.\n\n==Career==\n===2005\u20132008===\nSHESHA under the moniker Fadeproof together with his comrades, Avathara and MC Hesh formed a band called '''Pistah Few''', influenced by the Malaysian Hip hop Group, [[Poetic Ammo]]. For two years, they ventured out as a band and serenaded local events like prom nights and cultural shows. This provided them with the opportunity to further sharpen their showmanship, emceeing skills and songwriting. Their first break rose when [[Gang Starz]], a reality television show of [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]] Malaysia held its audition at Sheraton Hotel, Penang in 2007. Pistah Few was judged by Cat Farish; actor, singer and record producer and also Juliza Adzlizan; actor, singer and vocal teacher.

On that date this municipality merged with the neighbouring one of [[Margraten]], resulting in nowadays [[Eijsden-Margraten]] municipality, in which Eijsden (with about 7.000 inhabitants) again is the biggest place.\n\nThis village is one of the most southerly places in the Netherlands, for in its south it is extending up to the most southerly part of the border between the Netherlands and [[Belgium]].\n\nThe [[Meuse (river)|Meuse river]], coming from [[France]] and Belgium, here enters its third and final flowing country, the Netherlands. From here on its name in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is ''Maas''. Running northward to Eijsden's west it locally forms the westerly frontier of the last mentioned country with Belgium. Its Belgian border across the Meuse is [[Lanaye]], a village of [[Li\u00e8ge (province)|Li\u00e8ge province]] in [[Wallonia]], whereas its border to the south is the [[Voerstreek]] exclave of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg province]] in [[Flanders]].\n\nA smaller stream, the [[Voer]], coming from Belgium, drains into the Meuse river in this place.\n\n==History==\nEijsden is one of the older places in the country. Its name is supposed to be derived of the Germanic word for aspen forest. Excavations have revealed a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement. In the Middle Ages, this settlement developed to a village. After the (feudal) Middle Ages, in the seventeenth century Eijsden gained in economic strength because of its position near the Dutch-Belgian frontier on the Meuse river. Its function as a trading and shipping centre attracted settlement of well-to-do merchants from [[Holland]]. This period of prosperity ended in the Napoleonic era when, for a time, the area ceased to be a frontier.\n\n===Former municipality===\nThe former Eijsden municipality was composed of several population centres, of which the one named Eijsden was the largest, with 7000 inhabitants.\nThe other population centres (now all part of \"Eijsden-Margraten\") were:\n*[[Breust]]\n*[[Hoog- en Laag Caestert]]\n*[[Gronsveld]]\n*[[Mariadorp]]\n*[[Mesch]]\n*[[Oost-Maarland]]\n*[[Rijckholt]]\n*{{ill|Withuis|nl}}\n\n==Constituting quarters==\nNowadays the administrative population centre of Eijsden in the municipality of Eijsden-Margraten is formed by several neighbourhoods of which most are more or less separately situated and have their own history:\n\n*[[Breust]], the most northern part of the place, is a former municipality of its own, now forming one quarter with Eijsden itself and including several newbuilt neighbourhoods.\n* Eijsden itself.\n* Mariadorp, situated to the east of Eijsden itself.\n* Laag-Caestert, together with Hoog-Caestert and Withuis forming the southern part of the place.\n* Hoog-Caestert, situated to the east of Laag-Caestert.\n* Withuis, situated to the east of Hoog-Caestert. In fact this is only the northerly part of the relevant township; the other part is situated across the frontier in [[Belgium]].\n\n==Economy==\nApart from trading and shipping, the Eijsden economy traditionally has had an agricultural character, with a focus on fruit growing. At one time, in Eijsden  the Netherlands' largest local fruit tree area was situated.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, many orchards were replaced by housing, dairy farming and industry.\n\nIn 1870, a  [[Zinc oxide|zinc white]] factory brought industrial activity to the municipality, along with jobs and air pollution. The number of jobs originally was about 700; by now some 300 are left.\n\nAs a result of the relatively vast housing projects in the northern part, Eijsden nowadays is largely residential.\n\n==Sights==\n[[File:GemeentehuisEijsden.JPG|thumb|180px|upright|Former monastery at Breust Eijsden]]\n*The seventeenth century Renaissance style castle of Eijsden (according to the relevant Unesco-list) is one of the top hundred buildings in the country.\n* A stylish former monastery, nowadays housing Museum het Ursulinenconvent - [[International Museum for Family History]].\n* The historical \"Vroenhof\" central square.\n* Four monumental water mills on the Voer river.\n* Two centuries old church buildings.\n\n==Music==\nIn the municipality of Eijsden two military bands are based ('the blue' and 'the red'), of which the first mentioned at contests competes in the second highest international division and the last mentioned to the highest.\n\nIn 2013, like in 2009, the last mentioned (the \"Koninklijke Harmonie Sainte C\u00e9cile)\" was the winner in the World Concert Division of the fouryearly World Music Contest, a competition for professional, amateur and military bands, held in [[Kerkrade]].\n\nThe first mentioned, (the \"Koninklijke Oude Harmonie Sainte C\u00e9cile)\" ended second in the First  Concert Division <ref>[http://www.wmc.nl/nl/uitslagen.aspx Results WMC 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805221141/http://wmc.nl/nl/uitslagen.aspx |date=2013-08-05 }}</ref>\n\n==Famous natives of Eijsden==\n*[[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]]- Anatomist/Anthropologist\n*[[Jo Maas]], former cyclist, stage winner and seventh in end-classification of 1978 [[Tour de France]].\n*[[Jacques Vriends]] Dutch writer of children books\n\n== Gallery ==\n{|\n| [[File:Eijsden-Grenspaal 47 (NL).JPG|thumb|230px|upright|[[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] river enters the [[Netherlands]] at Eijsden]]\n| [[File:Eijsden-011.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Eijsden's 17th-century castle at Laag-Caestert]]\n| [[File:Eijsden-Diepstraat.JPG|thumb|230px|upright|View of a historical street, the Diepstraat, that (downwards) leads to the river bank]].\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.eijsden.nl}}\n*[http://www.picturesfrom.nl/index.php?keyword=Vul+uw+zoekterm+in&plaats=1242 Historical pictures of Eijsden on old postcards]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Belgium\u2013Netherlands border crossings]]\n[[Category:Former municipalities of Limburg (Netherlands)]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Limburg (Netherlands)]]\n[[Category:Eijsden-Margraten]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name = Eijsden\n | native_name             = ''\u00c8\u00e8sjde''\n | image_skyline         = Overzicht Vroenhof 6 met omgeving - Eijsden - 20347886 - RCE.jpg\n | imagesize            = 250px\n | image_caption        = Buildings at the \"Vroenhof\" central square\n | image_flag           = Flag of Eijsden.png\n | flag_size            = 120x100px\n | image_shield         = Eijsden wapen.svg\n | shield_size          = 120x100px\n|image_map = LocatieEijsden.png\n|mapsize = 250px\n|coordinates = {{coord|50|46|40|N|5|42|30|E|region:NL|display=inline,title}}\n|subdivision_type = Country\n|subdivision_name = [[Netherlands]]\n|subdivision_type1 = Province\n|subdivision_name1 = [[Limburg (Netherlands)]]\n|subdivision_type2 = Municipality\n|subdivision_name2 = [[Eijsden-Margraten]]\n|area_footnotes = (2006)\n|area_total_km2 = 20.76\n|area_land_km2 = 19.75\n|area_water_km2 = 1.01\n|population_as_of = 1 January 2007\n|population_note = Source: [[Statistics Netherlands|CBS]], [http://statline.cbs.nl/ Statline].\n|settlement_type = Village and former municipality\n|population_total = 7000\n|population_density_km2 = 589\n|timezone = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n|utc_offset = +1\n|timezone_DST = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n|utc_offset_DST = +2\n}}\n\n*''Eijsden should not be confused with the village of [[Eisden]] in the Belgian province of Limburg.''\n\n'''Eijsden''' ({{Pronunciation|130 Eijsden.ogg}}) ({{lang-li|\u00c8\u00e8sjde}}) is a place situated in the very south of the [[Europe]]an country the [[Netherlands]].\nThere it is located in the southeastern part of the [[province]] of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]].\n\nUntil January 1, 2011 Eijsden was the main village in a municipality with the same name.

They also won a bronze medal in the team event at the [[Figure skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]].\n\nDavis and White teamed up in 1997 and they are currently the longest lasting dance team in the United States.

At the [[2006 NHK Trophy]], they became the first ice dancing team to earn level fours on all their elements.<ref name=milestone/>\n\nIn 2014, Davis won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 18)|eighteenth season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' with partner [[Maksim Chmerkovskiy]].\n\n==Personal life==\nMeryl Davis was born in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]] and raised in [[West Bloomfield Township, Michigan]], the daughter of Cheryl and Paul D.

They also won a bronze medal in the team event at the [[Figure skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]].\n\nDavis and White teamed up in 1997 and they are currently the longest lasting dance team in the United States. They are the first American ice dancers to win the World title, as well as the first Americans to win the Olympic title. At the [[2006 NHK Trophy]], they became the first ice dancing team to earn level fours on all their elements.<ref name=milestone/>\n\nIn 2014, Davis won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 18)|eighteenth season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' with partner [[Maksim Chmerkovskiy]].\n\n==Personal life==\nMeryl Davis was born in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]] and raised in [[West Bloomfield Township, Michigan]], the daughter of Cheryl and Paul D.

We've grown together and know each other so well.\"<ref name=dglasier/>\n\nIn their first season together, Davis/White won the silver medal at the [http://www.figure-skating-corner.com/archiv/1997-98/junoly98.shtml Junior Olympics] in the Juvenile division. In 1999\u201300, they won gold at the Junior Olympics on the intermediate level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usfsa.org/content/events/199899/juniorolympics.htm|title=Intermediate Dance|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> In the 2000\u201301 season, they qualified for the [[2001 United States Figure Skating Championships|2001 U.S. Championships]], placing 6th as Novices. In 2001\u201302, they won the silver medal as novices and then moved up to the junior level.  In the 2002\u201303 season, they did not win a medal at either of their two [[ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix]] assignments and placed 7th at the [[2003 United States Figure Skating Championships|2003 U.S. Championships]] in their junior debut.\n\n===Junior career===\nIn the 2003\u20132004 season, Davis/White won their sectional championship and then won the junior silver medal at [[2004 United States Figure Skating Championships|Nationals]]. This earned them a trip to the [[2004 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2004 Junior Worlds]], where they placed 13th.\n\nIn the 2004\u20132005 season, Davis/White won two bronze medals on the [[ISU Junior Grand Prix]] series. However, White broke his ankle before Sectionals and so Davis/White were unable to qualify for the [[2005 United States Figure Skating Championships|2005 U.S. Championships]]. Their season ended there.\n\nIn the 2005\u20132006 season, Davis/White medaled at both their [[ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix]] events and placed second at the [[2005\u20132006 ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix Final]]. They won the junior national title at the [[2006 United States Figure Skating Championships|2006 U.S. Championships]] and then won the bronze medal at the [[2006 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2006 Junior Worlds]]. Following that season, Davis aged out of Juniors. They lost some training time after White broke his ankle at a hockey tournament in 2006.<ref name=nyt120309/>\n\n===Senior career===\n\n====2006\u20132007 season====\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, Davis/White made their debut both nationally and internationally as seniors. They placed 4th at both their [[2006-2007 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|2006\u201307 ISU Grand Prix]] assignments. At the [[2006 NHK Trophy]], they became the first team to earn all level fours on their elements. At the [[2007 United States Figure Skating Championships|2007 U.S. Championships]], they won the bronze medal at the senior level, qualifying them for the [[2007 World Figure Skating Championships|2007 World Championships]]. They are the first team since [[Tanith Belbin]] / [[Benjamin Agosto]] to go directly from winning the Junior national title to making the World team.\n\nDavis/White also qualified for the [[2007 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents Championships]], which took place before Worlds, and placed fourth. At the [[2007 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]], Davis/White placed 7th, the highest debut placement for American ice dancers at Worlds since 1980.<ref name=07worldsdebut/>\n\n====2007\u20132008 season====\nDavis/White placed 4th at the [[2007 Skate America]] and then went on to win their first Grand Prix medal at the [[2007 Troph\u00e9e Eric Bompard]].\n\nThey completely revamped their [[Eleanor Rigby]] Eleanor's Dream free dance before the [[2008 United States Figure Skating Championships|2008 U.S. Championships]] due to its poor reception. They won the silver medal at the competition, one spot up from the previous season. They also won silver at [[2008 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2008 Four Continents]] and were sixth at the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships|2008 World Championships]].\n\n====2008\u20132009 season====\nIn the 2008\u20132009 season, Davis/White won their first Grand Prix assignment, the [[2008 Skate Canada]]. In their second assignment, the [[2008 Cup of Russia]], they placed third in the compulsory dance but were eighth in the original dance after White fell twice and stumbled on twizzles.<ref name=order/> They recovered in the free dance, placing second in the segment and moving up to win the bronze medal, which together with the gold from Skate Canada was enough to qualify them for their first Grand Prix Final. At the [[2008\u20132009 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2008\u20132009 Grand Prix Final]], they won the bronze medal.\n\nDavis/White won gold at the [[2009 United States Figure Skating Championships|2009 National Championships]], after reigning champions Belbin/Agosto withdrew due to injury. They won by a 20-point margin over silver medalists [[Emily Samuelson]] / [[Evan Bates]]. In February 2009, they won the ice dance title at the [[2009 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents Championships]], placing second in both the compulsory and original dance behind training mates [[Tessa Virtue]] / [[Scott Moir]] but winning the free dance.<ref name=\"lat090206\"/> At the [[2009 World Figure Skating Championships|2009 World Championships]] they placed 4th. Though they placed third in both the original and free dance portions, they lost too much ground in the compulsory to overcome training mates Virtue and Moir for the bronze. Only .04 points separated 3rd from 4th.\n\n====2009\u20132010 season====\nDavis/White competed at the [[2009 Nebelhorn Trophy]], finishing first in all the segments of the competition.
