It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

The Kingston campus of [[St. Lawrence College, Ontario|St. Lawrence College]] was established in 1969, and the college has 6,700 full-time students. The Royal Military College of Canada was founded in 1876, and has about 1,000 students. Kingston is a regional health care centre, anchored by Kingston General Hospital and the medical school at Queen's. The city's economy is also dominated by post-secondary education, military institutions, and prison installations.\n\nMunicipal governance had been a topic of discussion since the mid-1970s due to financial imbalance between the city and the surrounding [[Township (Canada)|townships]], which now had large residential areas and a population approaching that of the city proper. On January 1, 1998, the City was amalgamated with Kingston Township and [[Pittsburgh, Kingston|Pittsburgh Township]] to form the new City of Kingston.

As a result of the report of the ''Commission of Inquiry into Certain Events at the Prison for Women in Kingston'', the facility was closed in 2000. Queen's University purchased the property with the intention of renovating it to house the Queen's Archives, but the interior of the building was awarded a heritage designation; therefore, Queen's lost the ability to renovate the interior and is considering its options.\n\nIn September 2013, after almost 180 years of housing prisoners, Kingston Penitentiary closed. The maximum security prison was named a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in February 1990 due to its history and reputation. In its early years, the prison had a vital role in constructing the city. The prison brought prosperity to Kingston, and along with eight other prisons being built in the area, helped create an impressive local economy.<ref>Steve Cameron, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/kingston-penitentiary-closes-its-doors-as-canadas-most-famous-prison/article14598900/?page=all \"Kingston Penitentiary: Canada's most famous prison closes its doors\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071218/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/kingston-penitentiary-closes-its-doors-as-canadas-most-famous-prison/article14598900/?page=all |date=March 4, 2016 }}, ''The Globe and Mail'', September 29, 2013</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\nKingston is within the [[Mixedwood Plains Ecozone (Canada)|Mixedwood Plains Ecozone]], and is dominated in the Kingston area by a mixture of [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] tree species and abundant water resources.<ref>[http://ecozones.ca/english/zone/MixedwoodPlains/land.html Ecological Framework of Canada \u2013 Mixedwood Plains Ecozone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315210334/http://ecozones.ca/english/zone/MixedwoodPlains/land.html |date=March 15, 2016 }}.

To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]], is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ \u201cAbout the Hall\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053203/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref> The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role in the history of hockey in Canada.

It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

From this base, de La Salle explored west and south as far as the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name=\"kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca\"/> The fort was rebuilt several times and experienced periods of abandonment.

Support for this is found in a journal entry of a British Army officer in Kingston in 1843. He wrote ''\"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.\"''<ref name=\"queens\">{{cite web|title=Hockey night in Kingston |url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol133/issue11/features/lead1 |accessdate=June 21, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Kingston is also home to the oldest continuing hockey rivalry in the world by virtue of a game played in 1886 on the frozen Kingston harbour between Queen's University and the Royal Military College of Canada. To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]], is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ \u201cAbout the Hall\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053203/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref> The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role in the history of hockey in Canada. These include: the original square hockey puck from the first Queens University vs. the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) game in 1886, hockey's oldest sweater worn by a Queen's student in 1894, and Canada's first Olympic gold medal from 1924, among others.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/exhibits/top-10-artifacts.html \u201cThe Top 10 Artifacts in the Museum\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053201/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/exhibits/top-10-artifacts.html |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref>\n\nNew to the city is Leon's Centre, in the downtown core.

The [[Kingston Yacht Club]] in downtown Kingston has a learn to sail program for both children and adults.\n\n===Diving===\nKingston is known for fresh-water [[wreck diving]]. [[List of shipwrecks of Canada#Ontario|Kingston's shipwrecks]] are well preserved by its cool fresh water, and the recent [[zebra mussel]] invasion has caused a dramatic improvement in water clarity that has enhanced the quality of diving in the area.\n\n===Lawn bowling===\nThe Kingston Lawn Bowling Club has been at its location on Napier Street since 1932, although the sport's beginnings in Kingston have been traced back to 1914.<ref>[https://kingstonlawnbowlingclub.weebly.com/about-us.html Kingston Lawn Bowling Club \u2013 About Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514141551/http://kingstonlawnbowlingclub.weebly.com/about-us.html |date=May 14, 2016 }} Retrieved November 22, 2018</ref> While the club offers a variety of recreational opportunities, a number of its members have gone on to compete successfully at the provincial level and beyond.

The first winner of the [[Canadian Amateur Championship]] that same year was Kingstonian Thomas Harley, a Scottish immigrant carpenter. Richard H. (Dick) Green, who immigrated to the area from England in the late 1920s, was the longtime club professional for nearly 40 years at [[Cataraqui Golf and Country Club]] (founded in 1917 and redesigned by [[Stanley Thompson]] in 1930). Green also helped design several courses in eastern Ontario, including Smiths Falls (1949), Glen Lawrence (1955), Rideau Lakes (1961), Amherstview (1971), Garrison (1971), Evergreen (1972), Belle Park Fairways (1975), Rivendell (1979), and Colonnade (1984). [[Matt McQuillan]], a professional player on the [[PGA Tour]] for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, was born and raised in Kingston, and developed his game at the [[Garrison Golf and Curling Club]]. McQuillan won the 2005 Telus [[Edmonton]] Open on the [[Canadian Professional Golf Tour]].\n\n===Curling===\nThree curling clubs are in the Kingston area: the Cataraqui Golf & Country Club, Garrison Golf & Curling Club, and the [[Royal Kingston Curling Club]].<ref>[http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston CurlingRink.ca \u2013 Kingston Curling Clubs and Rinks \u2013 Kingston, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174549/http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston |date=July 6, 2011 }} Retrieved March 2, 2011</ref> The Royal Kingston Curling Club (RKCC) was founded in 1820, and was granted Royal patronage in 1993.

KPRFC is a non-profit organization answering directly to the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union (EORU), the [[Ontario Rugby Union]] (ORU), and [[Rugby Canada]] (RC). The Kingston Panthers R.F.C, recently celebrated their fortieth anniversary with an EORU championship in the Division 1 championship game at [[Twin Elm Rugby Park]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]].\n\n===Football===\nThe earliest known incarnation of an organized football team in Kingston is the [[Kingston Granites]] which played in the predecessor league to the [[Canadian Football League]], the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]], (ORFU). The team played for four seasons between 1898 and 1901 winning 1 ORFU title in 1899 defeating the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 8\u20130. Kingston also hosted the [[10th Grey Cup]] on December 2, 1922. The Limestone Grenadiers now represent Kingston and the surrounding area in the OVFL. The Club franchise catchment area draws players from Frontenac, Hastings, Lanark, Leeds, Lennox and Prince Edward counties. League play runs from late May through August. The Junior and Varsity teams' main schedule pits the Grenadiers against eastern Ontario opponents and cross-over games with western Ontario teams leading to a provincial title championship game.\nMany notable football people, CFL, NFL players, coaches and personalities have been associated with Kingston including:\n\n===Volleyball===\n\nThe Kingston Volleyball Club (KVC) was founded in 2015.

Since the Australian Open shifted to [[hardcourt]] in 1988, Wimbledon is the only major still played on [[grass court|grass]], which is widely considered as the classic tennis court.\n\nThe tournament traditionally took place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. However, recent changes to the tennis calendar have seen the event moved back by a week to begin in early July.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon Championships moved back a week from 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/18913701|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Enhanced UK grass court season announced for 2017|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2016-04-07/enhanced_uk_grass_court_season_announced_for_2017.html|publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=7 April 2016}}</ref> Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place.\n\nWimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors and royal patronage.

A roof was operational over No1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating and a table.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Spencer gore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Spencer Gore (sportsman)|Spencer Gore]], the winner of the [[1877 Wimbledon Championship|inaugural Wimbledon Championship]]]]\n\n=== Beginning ===\nThe [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as \"The All England Croquet Club\". Its first ground was at Nursery Road off Worple Road, Wimbledon.<ref>[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/4462679.Anyone_for_a_game_of_sphairistik___/ \"Anyone for a game of sphairistik\u00e9?\"] 41, ''[[The Northern Echo]]'', 27 June 2009, accessed 8 July 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1876, [[Tennis|lawn tennis]], a game devised by Major [[Walter Clopton Wingfield]] a year or so earlier as an outdoor version of [[real tennis]] and originally given the name ''Sphairistik\u00e8'', was added to the activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], was drawn up for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net.\n\nThe inaugural [[1877 Wimbledon Championship]] started on 9 July 1877 and the Gentlemen's Singles was the only event held. It was won by [[Spencer Gore (sportsman)|Spencer Gore]], an old Harrovian [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]] player, from a field of 22. About 200 spectators paid one shilling each to watch the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/1877.html|title=1877 Wimbledon Championships|accessdate=5 October 2010|publisher=Wimbledon.org|first=Ron|last=Atkin|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221222928/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/1877.html|archivedate=21 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe lawns at the ground were arranged so that the principal court was in the middle with the others arranged around it, hence the title \"[[Centre Court]]\".{{efn|A Centre Court did not yet exist during the first four years of the championship.<ref name=little>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Alan|title=Wimbledon Compendium 2011|year=2011|publisher=All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club|location=London|isbn=978-1-899039-36-4|pages=9, 102|author=|edition=21st}}</ref>|name=centrecourt}} The name was retained when the Club moved in 1922 to the present site in Church Road, although no longer a true description of its location.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Malin Lundin|title=Throwback Thursday: The New Wimbledon|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2015-03-12/20150312_throwback_thursday_twins_in_tennis.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=12 March 2015}}</ref> However, in 1980 four new courts were brought into commission on the north side of the ground, which meant the Centre Court was once more correctly described.

First prize, awarded to [[Maud Watson]], was a silver flower-basket worth 20 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]].]]\n\nBy 1882, activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word \"croquet\" was dropped from the title. However, for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899.\n\nIn 1884, the club added [[List of Wimbledon ladies' singles champions|Ladies' Singles]] and [[List of Wimbledon gentlemen's doubles champions|Gentlemen's Doubles]] competitions. [[List of Wimbledon ladies' doubles champions|Ladies' Doubles]] and [[List of Wimbledon mixed doubles champions|Mixed Doubles]] events were added in 1913. Until 1922, the reigning champion had to play only in the final, against whomever had won through to challenge him/her. As with the other three ''Major or Grand Slam'' events, Wimbledon was contested by top-ranked amateur players; professional players were prohibited from participating. This changed with the advent of the [[History of tennis|open era]] in 1968. No British man won the singles event at Wimbledon between [[Fred Perry]] in 1936 and [[Andy Murray]] in 2013, while no British woman has won since [[Virginia Wade]] in 1977, although [[Annabel Croft]] and [[Laura Robson]] won the Girls' Championship in [[1984 Wimbledon Championships|1984]] and [[2008 Wimbledon Championships|2008]] respectively. The Championship was first televised in 1937.\n\nThough properly called \"The Championships, Wimbledon\", depending on sources the event is also known as \"The All England Lawn Tennis Championships\", \"The Wimbledon Championships\" or simply \"Wimbledon\". From 1912 to 1924, the tournament was recognized by the [[International Lawn Tennis Federation]] as the \"World Grass Court Championships\".\n\n=== 21st century ===\nWimbledon is considered the world's premier tennis tournament and the priority of the Club is to maintain its leadership. To that end a long-term plan was unveiled in 1993, intended to improve the quality of the event for spectators, players, officials and neighbours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Long Term Plan|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/about/long-term-plan|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315213309/http://www.wimbledon.com/about/long-term-plan|archivedate=15 March 2012}}</ref> Stage one (1994\u20131997) of the plan was completed for the 1997 championships and involved building the new No. 1 Court in Aorangi Park, a broadcast centre, two extra grass courts and a tunnel under the hill linking Church Road and Somerset Road. Stage two (1997\u20132009) involved the removal of the old No. 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats. Stage three (2000\u20132011) has been completed with the construction of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601051854/http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history|date=1 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nA new retractable roof was built in time for the 2009 championships, marking the first time that rain did not stop play for a lengthy time on [[Centre Court]]. The Club tested the new roof at an event called ''A Centre Court Celebration'' on Sunday, 17 May 2009, which featured exhibition matches involving [[Andre Agassi]], [[Steffi Graf]], [[Kim Clijsters]] and [[Tim Henman]]. The first Championship match to take place under the roof was the completion of the fourth round women's singles match between [[Dinara Safina]] and [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]].  The first match to be played in its entirety under the new roof took place between [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] on 29 June 2009. Murray was also involved in the match completed latest in the day at Wimbledon, which ended at 11:02{{nbsp}}pm in a victory over [[Marcos Baghdatis]] at Centre Court in the third round of the 2012 Championships. The 2012 Men's Singles Final on 8 July 2012, between [[Roger Federer]] and Murray, was the first singles final to be partially played under the roof, which was activated during the third set.{{efn|name=monday_final|To date only four finals were played on a Monday due to rain: [[1919 Wimbledon Championships|1919]], [[1922 Wimbledon Championships|1922]], [[1988 Wimbledon Championships|1988]] and [[2001 Wimbledon Championships|2001]].}}\n\nA new 4000-seat [[No. 2 Court]] was built on the site of the old No. 13 Court in time for the 2009 Championships.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2009-06-11/200906111244725616916.html New Court No. 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620004403/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2009-06-11/200906111244725616916.html |date=20 June 2009 }}</ref>  A new 2000-seat [[No. 3 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 3 Court]] was built on the site of the old No. 2 and No. 3 Courts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.wimbledon.org/2010/03/26/the-new-court-3 |title=The New Court 3 |publisher=Blog.wimbledon.org |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803031905/http://blog.wimbledon.org/2010/03/26/the-new-court-3/ |archivedate=3 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nOn 1 August 2011, the All England Club transferred all of its assets relating to The Championships to a separate though wholly owned subsidiary, The All England Lawn Tennis Club (Championships) Limited, also known as AELTC.

On the first of these four occasions, Wimbledon staged a \"People's Sunday\", with unreserved seating and readily available, inexpensive tickets, allowing those with more limited means to sit on the show courts.\n\nThe second Monday at Wimbledon is often called \"Manic Monday\", because it is the busiest day with the last-16 matches for both men's and women's singles, where fans have a pick of watching on a single day, any of the best 32 players left; which is also unique in a Grand Slam singles competition.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-2017-manic-monday-what-is-it-court-times-roger-federer-andy-murray-rafael-nadal-novak-a7833151.html |title=Wimbledon 2017: What is Manic Monday |date=12 July 2017|work=The Independent }}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, the championships have begun one week later than in previous years, extending the gap between the tournament and the [[French Open]] from two to three weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon Championships moved back a week from 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/18913701|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 September 2012|date=19 July 2012}}</ref> Additionally the [[Stuttgart Open]] men's tournament converted to a grass surface and was rescheduled from July to June, extending the grass court season.\n\n== Players and seeding ==\nBoth the men's and ladies' singles consist of 128 players.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ: Facts and Figures|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574376496.html|publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=27 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419022018/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574376496.html|archivedate=19 April 2015}}</ref> Players and doubles pairs are admitted to the main events on the basis of their international rankings, with 104 direct entries into the men's and 108 into the ladies' competitions. Both tournaments have 8 [[Wild card (sports)#Professional tennis|wild card]] entrants, with the remainder in each made up of qualifiers. Since the 2001 tournament, 32 players have been given [[Seed (sports)|seedings]] in the Gentlemen's and Ladies' singles, 16 teams in the doubles events. The system of seeding was introduced during the [[1924 Wimbledon Championships]]. This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw. This system was replaced for the [[1927 Wimbledon Championships]] and from then on players were seeded on merit. The first players to be seeded as no. 1 were [[Ren\u00e9 Lacoste]] and [[Helen Wills]].<ref name=compendium2013>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Alan|title=2013 Wimbledon Compendium|edition=23rd|date=2013|publisher=The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|location=London|pages=163, 164, 200|isbn=978-1-899039-40-1}}</ref>\n\nThe Committee of Management decide which players receive wildcards. Usually, wild cards are players who have performed well during previous tournaments or would stimulate public interest in Wimbledon by participating. The only wild card to win the Gentlemen's Singles Championship was [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]] in 2001. Players and pairs who neither have high enough rankings nor receive wild cards may participate in a qualifying tournament held one week before Wimbledon at the [[Bank of England]] Sports Ground in [[Roehampton]]. The singles qualifying competitions are three-round events. From 2019 singles qualification will increase to 128 players and no doubles qualification will occur.<ref name=\":0\" /> Previously the same-sex doubles competitions lasted for only two rounds. There is no qualifying tournament for Mixed Doubles. The furthest that any qualifier has progressed in a Singles tournament is the semi-final round: [[John McEnroe]] in 1977 (Gentlemen's Singles), [[Vladimir Voltchkov]] in 2000 (Gentlemen's Singles), and [[Alexandra Stevenson]] in 1999 (Ladies' Singles).\n\nPlayers are admitted to the junior tournaments upon the recommendations of their national tennis associations, on their [[International Tennis Federation]] world rankings and, in the case of the singles events, on the basis of a qualifying competition. The Committee of Management determines which players may enter the four invitational events.\n\nThe Committee seeds the top players and pairs on the basis of their rankings, but it can change the seedings based on a player's previous grass court performance. Since 2002 a seeding committee has not been required for the Gentlemen's Singles following an agreement with the ATP. While the seeds are still the top 32 players according to rankings, the seeding order is determined using the formula: ATP Entry System Position points + 100% points earned for all grass court tournaments in the past 12 months + 75% points earned for the best grass court tournament in the 12 months before that.<ref name=seedingexplained>{{cite news |last=Tebbutt |first=Tom |date=16 June 2010 |title=Explaining Wimbledon's seeding method |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/explaining-wimbledons-seeding-method/article4322158/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |access-date=17 June 2016 }}</ref> A majority of the entrants are unseeded. Only two unseeded players have won the Gentlemen's Singles: [[Boris Becker]] in 1985 and [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]] in 2001. In 1985 there were only 16 seeds and Becker was ranked 20th; Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 was ranked 125th when he won as a Wild Card entrant, although he had previously been a finalist three times, and been ranked no. 2 in the world; his low ranking was due to having been hampered by a persistent shoulder injury for three years, which had only just cleared up. In 1996, the title was won by [[Richard Krajicek]], who was originally unseeded (ranked 17th, and only 16 players were seeded) but was promoted to a seeded position (still with the number 17) when Thomas Muster withdrew before the tournament. No unseeded player has captured the Ladies' Singles title; the lowest seeded female champion was [[Venus Williams]], who won in 2007 as the 23rd seed; Williams was returning from an injury that had prevented her playing in previous tournaments, giving her a lower ranking than she would normally have had. Unseeded pairs have won the doubles titles on numerous occasions; the 2005 Gentlemen's Doubles champions were not only unseeded, but also (for the first time ever) qualifiers.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:cmglee London Wimbledon Championships venue aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the grounds]]\n{{Main|All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club}}\n\nSince 2002, the courts used for Wimbledon have been sown with 100% [[ryegrass|perennial ryegrass]]. Prior to 2002 a combination of 70% ryegrass and 30% [[Creeping Red Fescue]] was used. The change was made to improve durability and strengthen the sward to better withstand the increasing wear of the modern game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon \u2013 Grass Courts|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/news/media-centre/grass-courts|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon grass |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336575251545.html |publisher=Wimbledon Championship |accessdate=7 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507105351/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336575251545.html |archivedate= 7 May 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe main show courts, [[Centre Court]] and [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 1 Court]], are normally used for only two weeks a year, during the Championships, but play can extend into a third week in exceptional circumstances. The remaining 17 courts are regularly used for other events hosted by the Club. The show courts were in action for the second time in three months in 2012 as Wimbledon hosted the tennis events of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]]. One of the show courts is also used for home ties of the GB teams in the [[Davis Cup]] on occasions.\n\nWimbledon is the only Grand Slam event played on grass courts. At one time, all the Majors, except the French Open, were played on grass. The [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] abandoned grass in 1975 for [[green clay]] and the Australian Open did so in 1988 for [[hard court]]s; the US Open eventually would adopt hard courts as well.\n\nThe principal court, [[Centre Court]], was opened in 1922 when the Club moved from Worple Road to Church Road. The Church Road venue was larger and was needed to meet the ever-growing public demand.\n[[File:Wimbledon order of play.jpg|thumb|left|The order of play for all courts is displayed on boards around the grounds.]]\n\nDue to the possibility of rain during Wimbledon, a retractable roof was installed prior to the 2009 Championship. It is designed to close/open in about 20 minutes and will be closed primarily to protect play from inclement (and, if necessary, extremely hot) weather during The Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336573017483.html |title=Wimbledon \u2013 Centre Court roof |publisher=[[AELTC]] |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> Whilst the roof is being opened or closed, play is suspended. The first time the roof was closed during a Wimbledon Championship match was on Monday 29 June 2009, involving [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]] and [[Dinara Safina]]. The first full match played and completed under the roof featured [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stan Wawrinka]], played on the same date.\n\nThe court has a capacity of 15,000. At its south end is the Royal Box, from which members of the Royal Family and other dignitaries watch matches. Centre Court usually hosts the finals and semifinals of the main events, as well as many matches in the earlier rounds involving top-seeded players or local favourites.\n\nThe second most important court is [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 1 Court]]. The court was constructed in 1997 to replace the old No.1 Court, which was adjacent to Centre Court.  The old No.1 Court was demolished because its capacity for spectators was too low. The court was said to have had a unique, more intimate atmosphere and was a favourite of many players. Construction of a new retractable roof on the No.1 Court began after the 2017 Championships and was completed in time for the 2019 championships. The capacity of the stadium also rose by 900 to 12,345.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timnewcomb/2019/06/11/wimbledons-new-no1-court-roof-marks-2019-stadium-changes/#44f3501c667f|title=New No. 1 Court Roof Among Stadium Changes For Wimbledon 2019|work=Forbes|date=11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince 2009, a new [[No. 2 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 2 Court]] has been used at Wimbledon with a capacity for 4,000 people.

The old No.2 Court was known as the \"Graveyard of Champions\" because many highly seeded players were eliminated there during early rounds over the years, including [[Ilie N\u0103stase]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Boris Becker]], [[Andre Agassi]], [[Pete Sampras]], [[Martina Hingis]], [[Venus Williams]], [[Serena Williams]] and [[Maria Sharapova]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wimbledontennis.wordpress.com/2009/05/26/how-the-graveyard-of-champions-got-its-name/ |title=How the 'Graveyard of champions' got its name |publisher=Blog.wimbledon.org |accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> The court has a capacity of 2,192 + 770 standing.

Their principal responsibility is to ensure that the courts are quickly covered when it begins to rain, so that play can resume as quickly as possible once the referees decide to uncover the courts. The court attendants are mainly university students working to make summer money. Centre Court is covered by full-time groundstaff, however.\n\nAt the northern end of the grounds is a giant television screen on which important matches are broadcast. Fans watch from an area of grass officially known as the [[Aorangi Terrace]]. When British players do well at Wimbledon, the hill attracts fans for them, and is often renamed after them by the press: [[Greg Rusedski]]'s followers convened at \"Rusedski Ridge\", and [[Tim Henman]] has had the hill nicknamed [[Henman Hill]]. As both of them have now retired and [[Andy Murray]] is the number 1 British player, the hill is occasionally referred to as \"Murray Mound\" or \"[[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]]\", as a reference to his Scottish heritage and the Scottish rugby ground of the same name, but this has largely failed to catch on \u2013 the area is still usually referred to as Henman Hill.

Writer [[Peter York]] sees the event as representing a particular white and affluent type of Britishness, describing the area of Wimbledon as \"a southern, well off, late-Victorian suburb with a particular social character\".

Traditionally, [[Wandsworth School|Wandsworth Boys School]] in Sutherland Grove, Southfields and Mayfield Girls School on [[West Hill, Wandsworth|West Hill]] in Wandsworth, both now defunct, were the schools of choice for selection of BBGs. This was possibly owing to their proximity to the club. Since 2008 they have been drawn from schools in the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], and [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], as well as from [[Surrey]].<ref name=BBG>{{cite web|title=Ball Boys and Ball Girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/ball_boys_and_ball_girls.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref> BBGs have an average age of 15, being drawn from the school years [[Year Nine|nine]] and [[Year Ten|ten]].<ref name=\"Official Site\">[http://www.aeltc.com/CMS/BBG/background.aspx Official Site] Ballboys and Ballgirls Background Information</ref> They serve for one, or if re-selected, for up to five tournaments, up to year thirteen.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html Official Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507113749/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html |date=7 May 2013 }} About the Ball Boys and Girls</ref>\n\nStarting in 2005, BBGs work in teams of six, two at the net, four at the corners, and teams rotate one hour on court, one hour off, (two hours depending on the court) for the day's play.<ref name=\"Official Site\" /> Teams are not told which court they will be working on the day, to ensure the same standards across all courts. With the expansion of the number of courts, and lengthening the tennis day, as of 2008, the number of BBGs required is around 250. From the second Wednesday, BBGs are told to leave the Championships, leaving around 80 on the final Sunday. Each BBG receives a certificate, a can of used balls, a group photograph and a programme when leaving. BBG service is paid, with a total of \u00a3120-\u00a3180 being paid to each ball boy\nor girl after the 13-day period depending on the number of days served. Every BBG keeps all of their kit, typically consisting of three or four shirts, two or three shorts or [[skorts]], track suit bottoms and top, twelve pairs of socks, three pairs of wristbands, a hat, water bottle holder, bag and trainers. Along with this it is seen as a privilege, and a valuable addition to a school leaver's [[curriculum vitae]], showing discipline. BBG places are split 50:50 between boys and girls, with girls having been used since 1977, appearing on centre court since 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Wimbledon \u2013 Behind the scenes \u2013 Ball boys and ball girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/behind_the_scenes/201205091336567795051.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nProspective BBGs are first nominated by their school [[headteacher]], to be considered for selection. To be selected, a candidate must pass written tests on the rules of tennis, and pass fitness, mobility and other suitability tests, against initial preliminary instruction material. Successful candidates then commence a training phase, starting in February, in which the final BBGs are chosen through continual assessment. As of 2008, this training intake was 600. The training includes weekly sessions of physical, procedural and theoretical instruction, to ensure that the BBGs are fast, alert, self-confident and adaptable to situations. As of 2011, early training occurs at the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis Club Covered Courts, to the side of the Grounds, and then moves to outside courts (8, 9, 10) the week before the Championships for a feel of the grass court.\n\n=== Colours and uniforms ===\n[[File:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|[[S\u00e9bastien Grosjean]] takes a shot on Court 18 during the [[2004 Wimbledon Championships|2004 Championships]].]]\nDark green and purple are the traditional Wimbledon colours.

Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire, linesmen, ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships; however, beginning with the 2006 Championships, officials, ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue- and cream-coloured uniforms from American designer [[Ralph Lauren]].

The junior competitions are referred to as the \"Boys'\" and \"Girls'\" competitions.\n\nPrior to 2009, female players were referred to by the title \"Miss\" or \"Mrs.\" on scoreboards. As dictated by strict rule of etiquette, married female players are referred to by their husbands' names: for example, [[Chris Evert]] appeared on scoreboards as \"Mrs. J. M. Lloyd\" during her marriage to [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], since [[Coverture#Outside the legal realm|\"Mrs. X\" essentially designates the wife of X]].

Four hours live coverage of the [[1967 Wimbledon Championships|1967 Championships]] was shown on BBC Two, which was the first television channel in Europe to regularly broadcast in colour. Footage of that historic match no longer survives, however, the Gentlemen's Final of that year is still held in the BBC archives because it was the first Gentlemen's Final transmitted in colour.

[[NBC]] began a 43-year run of covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen's Singles Final. In 1979, the network began carrying the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles Finals live. For the next few decades, Americans made a tradition of [[NBC]]'s \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_5|title=NBC Sports establishes \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\"|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> specials at weekends. Live coverage started early in the morning (the US being a minimum of 5 hours behind the UK) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from [[Bud Collins]], whose tennis acumen and famous patterned trousers were well known to tennis fans in the US. Collins was sacked by [[NBC]] in 2007, but was promptly hired by [[ESPN]], the cable home for The Championships in the States. For many years NBC's primary Wimbledon host was veteran broadcaster [[Dick Enberg]].\n\nFrom 1975 to 1999, premium channel [[HBO]] carried weekday coverage of Wimbledon.

Presently, most weekend matches are broadcast through [[Canal 5 (Televisa Network)|Canal 5]] with the weekday matches broadcast on the [[Televisa Deportes Network]].  As Mexico is six hours behind the U.K., some Canal 5 affiliates air the weekend matches as the first program of the day after [[sign-on]].  Although Mexico had begun broadcasting in colour in 1962, Wimbledon continued to air in black and white in Mexico until colour television came to the United Kingdom in 1967.\n\nIn most of the remainder of Latin America, Wimbledon airs on [[ESPN Latin America|ESPN]], as do the other Grand Slam tournaments. In Brazil, [[SporTV]] has exclusive rights to the broadcast.\n\n==== Other countries ====\nIn several European countries, Wimbledon is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]], [[Eurosport 2]] and the Eurosport Player. Although there are some exceptions, as in Denmark, where the Danish [[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]] holds the right to show matches until 2022. In the [[Netherlands]] Center Court is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]] and all other courts are shown live on the Eurosport Player. But Court One is covered live on [[Ziggo Sport]]/[[Ziggo Sport Select]].\n\nIn [[Australia]], the free-to-air [[Nine Network]] covered Wimbledon for almost 40 years but decided to drop their broadcast following the 2010 tournament, citing declining ratings and desire to use money saved to bid on other sports coverage. In April 2011, it was announced that the [[Seven Network]], the host broadcaster of the Australian Open, along with its sister channel [[7Two]] would broadcast the event from 2011. Pay television network [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports Australia]] also covers the event. In [[India]] and its Subcontinental region, it is broadcast on [[Star Sports]].\n\nCoverage is free-to-air in [[New Zealand]] through [[TVNZ One]], beginning each night at 11 pm (midday in London).  In 2017 their new channel, [[TVNZ Duke]] (also free-to-air), carried an alternative to the main feed, including (for example) matches on outside courts involving New Zealand players.\n\n[[Fox Sports Asia]] holds broadcasting rights across Southeast Asia.\n\nMost matches are also available for viewing through internet betting websites and other live streaming services, as television cameras are set up to provide continuous coverage on nearly all the courts.\n\n== Trophies and prize money ==\n\n=== Trophies ===\n[[File:Wimbledon trophies.jpg|thumb|The Ladies' (top) and Gentlemen's singles trophies]]\nThe Gentlemen's Singles champion is presented with a silver gilt cup 18.5{{nbsp}}inches (about 47{{nbsp}}cm) in height and 7.5{{nbsp}}inches (about 19{{nbsp}}cm) in diameter.

The Gentlemen's Doubles silver challenge cup was originally from the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club and donated to the All England Club in 1884. The Ladies' Doubles Trophy, a silver cup and cover known as The Duchess of Kent Challenge Cup, was presented to the All England Club in 1949 by The Duchess of Kent.

a retractable roof over [[Centre Court]].\n\nWimbledon is one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis tournaments, the others being the [[Australian Open]], the [[French Open]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. Since the Australian Open shifted to [[hardcourt]] in 1988, Wimbledon is the only major still played on [[grass court|grass]], which is widely considered as the classic tennis court.\n\nThe tournament traditionally took place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. However, recent changes to the tennis calendar have seen the event moved back by a week to begin in early July.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon Championships moved back a week from 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/18913701|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Enhanced UK grass court season announced for 2017|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2016-04-07/enhanced_uk_grass_court_season_announced_for_2017.html|publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=7 April 2016}}</ref> Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place.\n\nWimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors and royal patronage. [[Strawberry#Culinary|Strawberries and cream]] are traditionally consumed at the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wimbledon's strawberries and cream has Tudor roots|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/surrey/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8756000/8756132.stm|agency=BBC|date=9 June 2015}}</ref> In 2017, fans consumed 34,000{{nbsp}}kg (33 tons) of English strawberries and 10,000 litres (2,200 gallons) of cream.

A roof was operational over No1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating and a table.\n\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Spencer gore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Spencer Gore (sportsman)|Spencer Gore]], the winner of the [[1877 Wimbledon Championship|inaugural Wimbledon Championship]]]]\n\n=== Beginning ===\nThe [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as \"The All England Croquet Club\". Its first ground was at Nursery Road off Worple Road, Wimbledon.<ref>[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/4462679.Anyone_for_a_game_of_sphairistik___/ \"Anyone for a game of sphairistik\u00e9?\"] 41, ''[[The Northern Echo]]'', 27 June 2009, accessed 8 July 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1876, [[Tennis|lawn tennis]], a game devised by Major [[Walter Clopton Wingfield]] a year or so earlier as an outdoor version of [[real tennis]] and originally given the name ''Sphairistik\u00e8'', was added to the activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], was drawn up for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net.\n\nThe inaugural [[1877 Wimbledon Championship]] started on 9 July 1877 and the Gentlemen's Singles was the only event held. It was won by [[Spencer Gore (sportsman)|Spencer Gore]], an old Harrovian [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]] player, from a field of 22. About 200 spectators paid one shilling each to watch the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/1877.html|title=1877 Wimbledon Championships|accessdate=5 October 2010|publisher=Wimbledon.org|first=Ron|last=Atkin|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221222928/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/1877.html|archivedate=21 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe lawns at the ground were arranged so that the principal court was in the middle with the others arranged around it, hence the title \"[[Centre Court]]\".{{efn|A Centre Court did not yet exist during the first four years of the championship.<ref name=little>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Alan|title=Wimbledon Compendium 2011|year=2011|publisher=All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club|location=London|isbn=978-1-899039-36-4|pages=9, 102|author=|edition=21st}}</ref>|name=centrecourt}} The name was retained when the Club moved in 1922 to the present site in Church Road, although no longer a true description of its location.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Malin Lundin|title=Throwback Thursday: The New Wimbledon|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2015-03-12/20150312_throwback_thursday_twins_in_tennis.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=12 March 2015}}</ref> However, in 1980 four new courts were brought into commission on the north side of the ground, which meant the Centre Court was once more correctly described.

First prize, awarded to [[Maud Watson]], was a silver flower-basket worth 20 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]].]]\n\nBy 1882, activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word \"croquet\" was dropped from the title. However, for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899.\n\nIn 1884, the club added [[List of Wimbledon ladies' singles champions|Ladies' Singles]] and [[List of Wimbledon gentlemen's doubles champions|Gentlemen's Doubles]] competitions. [[List of Wimbledon ladies' doubles champions|Ladies' Doubles]] and [[List of Wimbledon mixed doubles champions|Mixed Doubles]] events were added in 1913. Until 1922, the reigning champion had to play only in the final, against whomever had won through to challenge him/her. As with the other three ''Major or Grand Slam'' events, Wimbledon was contested by top-ranked amateur players; professional players were prohibited from participating. This changed with the advent of the [[History of tennis|open era]] in 1968. No British man won the singles event at Wimbledon between [[Fred Perry]] in 1936 and [[Andy Murray]] in 2013, while no British woman has won since [[Virginia Wade]] in 1977, although [[Annabel Croft]] and [[Laura Robson]] won the Girls' Championship in [[1984 Wimbledon Championships|1984]] and [[2008 Wimbledon Championships|2008]] respectively. The Championship was first televised in 1937.\n\nThough properly called \"The Championships, Wimbledon\", depending on sources the event is also known as \"The All England Lawn Tennis Championships\", \"The Wimbledon Championships\" or simply \"Wimbledon\". From 1912 to 1924, the tournament was recognized by the [[International Lawn Tennis Federation]] as the \"World Grass Court Championships\".\n\n=== 21st century ===\nWimbledon is considered the world's premier tennis tournament and the priority of the Club is to maintain its leadership. To that end a long-term plan was unveiled in 1993, intended to improve the quality of the event for spectators, players, officials and neighbours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Long Term Plan|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/about/long-term-plan|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315213309/http://www.wimbledon.com/about/long-term-plan|archivedate=15 March 2012}}</ref> Stage one (1994\u20131997) of the plan was completed for the 1997 championships and involved building the new No. 1 Court in Aorangi Park, a broadcast centre, two extra grass courts and a tunnel under the hill linking Church Road and Somerset Road. Stage two (1997\u20132009) involved the removal of the old No. 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats. Stage three (2000\u20132011) has been completed with the construction of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601051854/http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/championships-history|date=1 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nA new retractable roof was built in time for the 2009 championships, marking the first time that rain did not stop play for a lengthy time on [[Centre Court]]. The Club tested the new roof at an event called ''A Centre Court Celebration'' on Sunday, 17 May 2009, which featured exhibition matches involving [[Andre Agassi]], [[Steffi Graf]], [[Kim Clijsters]] and [[Tim Henman]]. The first Championship match to take place under the roof was the completion of the fourth round women's singles match between [[Dinara Safina]] and [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]].  The first match to be played in its entirety under the new roof took place between [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] on 29 June 2009. Murray was also involved in the match completed latest in the day at Wimbledon, which ended at 11:02{{nbsp}}pm in a victory over [[Marcos Baghdatis]] at Centre Court in the third round of the 2012 Championships.

This led to many winners retaining their titles in successive years, as they were able to rest while their opponent competed from the start of the competition. Since 1922, the prior year's champions were required to play all the rounds, like other tournament competitors.\n\n== Schedule ==\nEach year the tournament begins on the last Monday in June or first Monday in July, two weeks after the [[Queen's Club Championships]], which is one of the men's major warm-up tournaments, together with the [[Gerry Weber Open]], which is held in [[Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia|Halle, Germany]], during the same week. Other grass-court tournaments before Wimbledon are [[Eastbourne International|Eastbourne]], England, and [[Rosmalen Grass Court Championships|Rosmalen]] in the Netherlands, both combining mixed events. The other women's warm-up tournament for Wimbledon is [[Birmingham Classic (tennis)|Birmingham]], also in England. The  men's event which is outside Europe before Wimbledon is the Antalya open in Turkey. The only grass-court tournament scheduled after the Championships is the [[Hall of Fame Tennis Championships]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], USA, which takes place the week after Wimbledon.\n\nWimbledon is scheduled for 14 days, beginning on a Monday and ending on a Sunday.

However, rain has forced play on the Middle Sunday four times, in 1991, 1997, 2004 and 2016. On the first of these four occasions, Wimbledon staged a \"People's Sunday\", with unreserved seating and readily available, inexpensive tickets, allowing those with more limited means to sit on the show courts.\n\nThe second Monday at Wimbledon is often called \"Manic Monday\", because it is the busiest day with the last-16 matches for both men's and women's singles, where fans have a pick of watching on a single day, any of the best 32 players left; which is also unique in a Grand Slam singles competition.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-2017-manic-monday-what-is-it-court-times-roger-federer-andy-murray-rafael-nadal-novak-a7833151.html |title=Wimbledon 2017: What is Manic Monday |date=12 July 2017|work=The Independent }}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, the championships have begun one week later than in previous years, extending the gap between the tournament and the [[French Open]] from two to three weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon Championships moved back a week from 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/18913701|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 September 2012|date=19 July 2012}}</ref> Additionally the [[Stuttgart Open]] men's tournament converted to a grass surface and was rescheduled from July to June, extending the grass court season.\n\n== Players and seeding ==\nBoth the men's and ladies' singles consist of 128 players.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ: Facts and Figures|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574376496.html|publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=27 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419022018/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336574376496.html|archivedate=19 April 2015}}</ref> Players and doubles pairs are admitted to the main events on the basis of their international rankings, with 104 direct entries into the men's and 108 into the ladies' competitions.

Since the 2001 tournament, 32 players have been given [[Seed (sports)|seedings]] in the Gentlemen's and Ladies' singles, 16 teams in the doubles events. The system of seeding was introduced during the [[1924 Wimbledon Championships]]. This was a simplified version allowing countries to nominate four players who were placed in different quarters of the draw. This system was replaced for the [[1927 Wimbledon Championships]] and from then on players were seeded on merit. The first players to be seeded as no. 1 were [[Ren\u00e9 Lacoste]] and [[Helen Wills]].<ref name=compendium2013>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Alan|title=2013 Wimbledon Compendium|edition=23rd|date=2013|publisher=The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|location=London|pages=163, 164, 200|isbn=978-1-899039-40-1}}</ref>\n\nThe Committee of Management decide which players receive wildcards. Usually, wild cards are players who have performed well during previous tournaments or would stimulate public interest in Wimbledon by participating. The only wild card to win the Gentlemen's Singles Championship was [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]] in 2001. Players and pairs who neither have high enough rankings nor receive wild cards may participate in a qualifying tournament held one week before Wimbledon at the [[Bank of England]] Sports Ground in [[Roehampton]]. The singles qualifying competitions are three-round events. From 2019 singles qualification will increase to 128 players and no doubles qualification will occur.<ref name=\":0\" /> Previously the same-sex doubles competitions lasted for only two rounds. There is no qualifying tournament for Mixed Doubles. The furthest that any qualifier has progressed in a Singles tournament is the semi-final round: [[John McEnroe]] in 1977 (Gentlemen's Singles), [[Vladimir Voltchkov]] in 2000 (Gentlemen's Singles), and [[Alexandra Stevenson]] in 1999 (Ladies' Singles).\n\nPlayers are admitted to the junior tournaments upon the recommendations of their national tennis associations, on their [[International Tennis Federation]] world rankings and, in the case of the singles events, on the basis of a qualifying competition. The Committee of Management determines which players may enter the four invitational events.\n\nThe Committee seeds the top players and pairs on the basis of their rankings, but it can change the seedings based on a player's previous grass court performance. Since 2002 a seeding committee has not been required for the Gentlemen's Singles following an agreement with the ATP. While the seeds are still the top 32 players according to rankings, the seeding order is determined using the formula: ATP Entry System Position points + 100% points earned for all grass court tournaments in the past 12 months + 75% points earned for the best grass court tournament in the 12 months before that.<ref name=seedingexplained>{{cite news |last=Tebbutt |first=Tom |date=16 June 2010 |title=Explaining Wimbledon's seeding method |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/explaining-wimbledons-seeding-method/article4322158/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |access-date=17 June 2016 }}</ref> A majority of the entrants are unseeded. Only two unseeded players have won the Gentlemen's Singles: [[Boris Becker]] in 1985 and [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]] in 2001. In 1985 there were only 16 seeds and Becker was ranked 20th; Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 was ranked 125th when he won as a Wild Card entrant, although he had previously been a finalist three times, and been ranked no. 2 in the world; his low ranking was due to having been hampered by a persistent shoulder injury for three years, which had only just cleared up. In 1996, the title was won by [[Richard Krajicek]], who was originally unseeded (ranked 17th, and only 16 players were seeded) but was promoted to a seeded position (still with the number 17) when Thomas Muster withdrew before the tournament. No unseeded player has captured the Ladies' Singles title; the lowest seeded female champion was [[Venus Williams]], who won in 2007 as the 23rd seed; Williams was returning from an injury that had prevented her playing in previous tournaments, giving her a lower ranking than she would normally have had. Unseeded pairs have won the doubles titles on numerous occasions; the 2005 Gentlemen's Doubles champions were not only unseeded, but also (for the first time ever) qualifiers.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:cmglee London Wimbledon Championships venue aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the grounds]]\n{{Main|All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club}}\n\nSince 2002, the courts used for Wimbledon have been sown with 100% [[ryegrass|perennial ryegrass]]. Prior to 2002 a combination of 70% ryegrass and 30% [[Creeping Red Fescue]] was used. The change was made to improve durability and strengthen the sward to better withstand the increasing wear of the modern game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon \u2013 Grass Courts|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/news/media-centre/grass-courts|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon grass |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336575251545.html |publisher=Wimbledon Championship |accessdate=7 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507105351/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336575251545.html |archivedate= 7 May 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe main show courts, [[Centre Court]] and [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 1 Court]], are normally used for only two weeks a year, during the Championships, but play can extend into a third week in exceptional circumstances. The remaining 17 courts are regularly used for other events hosted by the Club. The show courts were in action for the second time in three months in 2012 as Wimbledon hosted the tennis events of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]]. One of the show courts is also used for home ties of the GB teams in the [[Davis Cup]] on occasions.\n\nWimbledon is the only Grand Slam event played on grass courts. At one time, all the Majors, except the French Open, were played on grass. The [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] abandoned grass in 1975 for [[green clay]] and the Australian Open did so in 1988 for [[hard court]]s; the US Open eventually would adopt hard courts as well.\n\nThe principal court, [[Centre Court]], was opened in 1922 when the Club moved from Worple Road to Church Road. The Church Road venue was larger and was needed to meet the ever-growing public demand.\n[[File:Wimbledon order of play.jpg|thumb|left|The order of play for all courts is displayed on boards around the grounds.]]\n\nDue to the possibility of rain during Wimbledon, a retractable roof was installed prior to the 2009 Championship. It is designed to close/open in about 20 minutes and will be closed primarily to protect play from inclement (and, if necessary, extremely hot) weather during The Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336573017483.html |title=Wimbledon \u2013 Centre Court roof |publisher=[[AELTC]] |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> Whilst the roof is being opened or closed, play is suspended. The first time the roof was closed during a Wimbledon Championship match was on Monday 29 June 2009, involving [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]] and [[Dinara Safina]]. The first full match played and completed under the roof featured [[Andy Murray]] and [[Stan Wawrinka]], played on the same date.\n\nThe court has a capacity of 15,000. At its south end is the Royal Box, from which members of the Royal Family and other dignitaries watch matches. Centre Court usually hosts the finals and semifinals of the main events, as well as many matches in the earlier rounds involving top-seeded players or local favourites.\n\nThe second most important court is [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 1 Court]]. The court was constructed in 1997 to replace the old No.1 Court, which was adjacent to Centre Court.  The old No.1 Court was demolished because its capacity for spectators was too low. The court was said to have had a unique, more intimate atmosphere and was a favourite of many players. Construction of a new retractable roof on the No.1 Court began after the 2017 Championships and was completed in time for the 2019 championships. The capacity of the stadium also rose by 900 to 12,345.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timnewcomb/2019/06/11/wimbledons-new-no1-court-roof-marks-2019-stadium-changes/#44f3501c667f|title=New No. 1 Court Roof Among Stadium Changes For Wimbledon 2019|work=Forbes|date=11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince 2009, a new [[No. 2 Court (Wimbledon)|No. 2 Court]] has been used at Wimbledon with a capacity for 4,000 people.

Their principal responsibility is to ensure that the courts are quickly covered when it begins to rain, so that play can resume as quickly as possible once the referees decide to uncover the courts. The court attendants are mainly university students working to make summer money. Centre Court is covered by full-time groundstaff, however.\n\nAt the northern end of the grounds is a giant television screen on which important matches are broadcast. Fans watch from an area of grass officially known as the [[Aorangi Terrace]]. When British players do well at Wimbledon, the hill attracts fans for them, and is often renamed after them by the press: [[Greg Rusedski]]'s followers convened at \"Rusedski Ridge\", and [[Tim Henman]] has had the hill nicknamed [[Henman Hill]]. As both of them have now retired and [[Andy Murray]] is the number 1 British player, the hill is occasionally referred to as \"Murray Mound\" or \"[[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]]\", as a reference to his Scottish heritage and the Scottish rugby ground of the same name, but this has largely failed to catch on \u2013 the area is still usually referred to as Henman Hill.

This was possibly owing to their proximity to the club. Since 2008 they have been drawn from schools in the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], and [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], as well as from [[Surrey]].<ref name=BBG>{{cite web|title=Ball Boys and Ball Girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/ball_boys_and_ball_girls.html|website=www.wimbledon.com|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref> BBGs have an average age of 15, being drawn from the school years [[Year Nine|nine]] and [[Year Ten|ten]].<ref name=\"Official Site\">[http://www.aeltc.com/CMS/BBG/background.aspx Official Site] Ballboys and Ballgirls Background Information</ref> They serve for one, or if re-selected, for up to five tournaments, up to year thirteen.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html Official Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507113749/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/about_aeltc/201205091336572473808.html |date=7 May 2013 }} About the Ball Boys and Girls</ref>\n\nStarting in 2005, BBGs work in teams of six, two at the net, four at the corners, and teams rotate one hour on court, one hour off, (two hours depending on the court) for the day's play.<ref name=\"Official Site\" /> Teams are not told which court they will be working on the day, to ensure the same standards across all courts. With the expansion of the number of courts, and lengthening the tennis day, as of 2008, the number of BBGs required is around 250. From the second Wednesday, BBGs are told to leave the Championships, leaving around 80 on the final Sunday. Each BBG receives a certificate, a can of used balls, a group photograph and a programme when leaving. BBG service is paid, with a total of \u00a3120-\u00a3180 being paid to each ball boy\nor girl after the 13-day period depending on the number of days served. Every BBG keeps all of their kit, typically consisting of three or four shirts, two or three shorts or [[skorts]], track suit bottoms and top, twelve pairs of socks, three pairs of wristbands, a hat, water bottle holder, bag and trainers. Along with this it is seen as a privilege, and a valuable addition to a school leaver's [[curriculum vitae]], showing discipline. BBG places are split 50:50 between boys and girls, with girls having been used since 1977, appearing on centre court since 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Wimbledon \u2013 Behind the scenes \u2013 Ball boys and ball girls|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/behind_the_scenes/201205091336567795051.html|publisher=[[AELTC]]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nProspective BBGs are first nominated by their school [[headteacher]], to be considered for selection. To be selected, a candidate must pass written tests on the rules of tennis, and pass fitness, mobility and other suitability tests, against initial preliminary instruction material. Successful candidates then commence a training phase, starting in February, in which the final BBGs are chosen through continual assessment. As of 2008, this training intake was 600. The training includes weekly sessions of physical, procedural and theoretical instruction, to ensure that the BBGs are fast, alert, self-confident and adaptable to situations. As of 2011, early training occurs at the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis Club Covered Courts, to the side of the Grounds, and then moves to outside courts (8, 9, 10) the week before the Championships for a feel of the grass court.\n\n=== Colours and uniforms ===\n[[File:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|[[S\u00e9bastien Grosjean]] takes a shot on Court 18 during the [[2004 Wimbledon Championships|2004 Championships]].]]\nDark green and purple are the traditional Wimbledon colours.

Controversy followed [[Martina Navratilova]]'s wearing branding for \"Kim\" cigarettes in 1982. Green clothing was worn by the chair umpire, linesmen, ball boys and ball girls until the 2005 Championships; however, beginning with the 2006 Championships, officials, ball boys and ball girls were dressed in new navy blue- and cream-coloured uniforms from American designer [[Ralph Lauren]]. This marked the first time in the history of the Championships that an outside company was used to design Wimbledon clothing.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== Referring to players ===\nBy tradition, the \"Men's\" and \"Women's\" competitions are referred to as \"Gentlemen's\" and \"Ladies'\" competitions at Wimbledon. The junior competitions are referred to as the \"Boys'\" and \"Girls'\" competitions.\n\nPrior to 2009, female players were referred to by the title \"Miss\" or \"Mrs.\" on scoreboards. As dictated by strict rule of etiquette, married female players are referred to by their husbands' names: for example, [[Chris Evert]] appeared on scoreboards as \"Mrs. J. M. Lloyd\" during her marriage to [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], since [[Coverture#Outside the legal realm|\"Mrs. X\" essentially designates the wife of X]].

The chair umpire will say \"Mr. <surname> is challenging the call...\" and \"Mr. <surname> has X challenges remaining.\" Up until 2018, the chair umpire says \"Miss\"/\"Mrs.\" <surname> when announcing the score of the Ladies' matches.

In 1946 the AELTC offered employment to wartime servicemen returning to civilian life during their demobilisation leave. Initially, this scheme extended only to the Royal Navy, followed by the Army in 1947 and the Royal Air Force in 1949.

The All-England Club allows overnight queuing and provides toilet and water facilities for campers. Early in the morning when the line moves towards the Grounds, stewards walk along the line and hand out wristbands that are colour-coded to the specific court. The wrist band (and payment) is exchanged at the ticket office for the ticket when the grounds open. General admission to the grounds gives access to the outer courts and is possible without queuing overnight.

[[NBC]] began a 43-year run of covering Wimbledon in 1969, with same-day taped (and often edited) coverage of the Gentlemen's Singles Final. In 1979, the network began carrying the Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles Finals live. For the next few decades, Americans made a tradition of [[NBC]]'s \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_5|title=NBC Sports establishes \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\"|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> specials at weekends. Live coverage started early in the morning (the US being a minimum of 5 hours behind the UK) and continued well into the afternoon, interspersed with commentary and interviews from [[Bud Collins]], whose tennis acumen and famous patterned trousers were well known to tennis fans in the US. Collins was sacked by [[NBC]] in 2007, but was promptly hired by [[ESPN]], the cable home for The Championships in the States. For many years NBC's primary Wimbledon host was veteran broadcaster [[Dick Enberg]].\n\nFrom 1975 to 1999, premium channel [[HBO]] carried weekday coverage of Wimbledon. Hosts included [[Jim Lampley]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]] and [[Barry MacKay]] among others.<ref>HBO Guides, program schedules, 1975 to 1999</ref> [[ESPN]] took over as the cable-television partner in 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=ESPN, Wimbledon come to terms |url=https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2003/04/14/ESPN-Wimbledon-come-to-terms/27281050341777/ |work=UPI |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe AELTC grew frustrated with NBC's policy of waiting to begin its quarterfinal and semifinal coverage until after the conclusion of ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' at 10 a.m. local, as well as broadcasting live only to the [[Eastern Time Zone]] and using [[broadcast delay|tape-delay]] in all others. NBC also held over high-profile matches for delayed broadcast in its window, regardless of any ongoing matches. In one notorious incident in [[2009 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|2009]], ESPN2's coverage of the [[Tommy Haas]]-[[Novak Djokovic]] quarterfinal was forced off the air nationwide when it ran past 10 a.m. Eastern, after which NBC showed the conclusion of the match on tape only after presenting the previous [[Ivo Karlovi\u0107]]-[[Roger Federer]] quarterfinal in full.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sandomir |first1=Richard |title=Why Wimbledon Switched to ESPN From NBC |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/sports/tennis/why-wimbledon-switched-to-espn-from-nbc.html |work=The New York Times |date=5 July 2011}}</ref> Beginning with the 2012 tournament, coverage moved to ESPN and [[ESPN2]], marking the second major tennis championship (after the Australian Open) where live coverage is exclusively on pay television.

Presently, most weekend matches are broadcast through [[Canal 5 (Televisa Network)|Canal 5]] with the weekday matches broadcast on the [[Televisa Deportes Network]].  As Mexico is six hours behind the U.K., some Canal 5 affiliates air the weekend matches as the first program of the day after [[sign-on]].  Although Mexico had begun broadcasting in colour in 1962, Wimbledon continued to air in black and white in Mexico until colour television came to the United Kingdom in 1967.\n\nIn most of the remainder of Latin America, Wimbledon airs on [[ESPN Latin America|ESPN]], as do the other Grand Slam tournaments. In Brazil, [[SporTV]] has exclusive rights to the broadcast.\n\n==== Other countries ====\nIn several European countries, Wimbledon is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]], [[Eurosport 2]] and the Eurosport Player. Although there are some exceptions, as in Denmark, where the Danish [[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]] holds the right to show matches until 2022. In the [[Netherlands]] Center Court is shown live on [[Eurosport 1]] and all other courts are shown live on the Eurosport Player. But Court One is covered live on [[Ziggo Sport]]/[[Ziggo Sport Select]].\n\nIn [[Australia]], the free-to-air [[Nine Network]] covered Wimbledon for almost 40 years but decided to drop their broadcast following the 2010 tournament, citing declining ratings and desire to use money saved to bid on other sports coverage. In April 2011, it was announced that the [[Seven Network]], the host broadcaster of the Australian Open, along with its sister channel [[7Two]] would broadcast the event from 2011. Pay television network [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports Australia]] also covers the event. In [[India]] and its Subcontinental region, it is broadcast on [[Star Sports]].\n\nCoverage is free-to-air in [[New Zealand]] through [[TVNZ One]], beginning each night at 11 pm (midday in London).  In 2017 their new channel, [[TVNZ Duke]] (also free-to-air), carried an alternative to the main feed, including (for example) matches on outside courts involving New Zealand players.\n\n[[Fox Sports Asia]] holds broadcasting rights across Southeast Asia.\n\nMost matches are also available for viewing through internet betting websites and other live streaming services, as television cameras are set up to provide continuous coverage on nearly all the courts.\n\n== Trophies and prize money ==\n\n=== Trophies ===\n[[File:Wimbledon trophies.jpg|thumb|The Ladies' (top) and Gentlemen's singles trophies]]\nThe Gentlemen's Singles champion is presented with a silver gilt cup 18.5{{nbsp}}inches (about 47{{nbsp}}cm) in height and 7.5{{nbsp}}inches (about 19{{nbsp}}cm) in diameter.

The salver, which is 18.75{{nbsp}}inches (about 48{{nbsp}}cm) in diameter, is decorated with figures from mythology.  The actual dish remains the property of the All England Club in their museum, so the champion receives a miniature replica bearing the names of all past Champions. From 1949 to 2006 the replica was 8 inches in diameter, and since 2007 it has been a three-quarter size replica with a diameter of 13.5 inches.<ref name=\"wimbledon_trophies\" />\n\nThe winner of the Gentlemen's Doubles, Ladies' Doubles, and Mixed Doubles events receive silver cups. A trophy is awarded to each player in the Doubles pair, unlike the other [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments where the winning Doubles duo shares a single trophy. The Gentlemen's Doubles silver challenge cup was originally from the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club and donated to the All England Club in 1884. The Ladies' Doubles Trophy, a silver cup and cover known as The Duchess of Kent Challenge Cup, was presented to the All England Club in 1949 by The Duchess of Kent. The Mixed Doubles Trophy is a silver challenge cup and cover presented to the All England Club by the family of two-time Wimbledon doubles winner S.H.

It is a remake of his own [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film ''[[Arjun Reddy]]'' (2017). Jointly produced by Cine1 Studios and [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], the film stars [[Shahid Kapoor]] and [[Kiara Advani]]. Kapoor plays Kabir Singh, a surgeon who spirals into self-destruction when his girlfriend, Preeti leaves him.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in October 2018 and ended in March 2019. The film was theatrically released in India on 21 June 2019 and received mixed reviews, with criticism directed at it for glamorising [[misogyny]] and [[toxic masculinity]], though Kapoor's performance was praised. It grossed over {{INR}}379 crore, becoming the second [[List of Bollywood films of 2019#Box office collection|highest grossing Bollywood]] film of 2019.<ref name=\"bwww\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nKabir Rajdheer Singh is a house surgeon at Delhi Institute of Medical Sciences. Despite being a brilliant student, he has severe [[anger management]] problems that earn the wrath of the college dean. Kabir's aggressive nature also earns him a reputation among his juniors as a [[Workplace bullying in academia|college bully]]. After having a brawl with Amit, one of the team members from another college alongside his friend Kamal against other members of the opposing team who ridiculed them during an inter-college [[Association football|football]] match, the dean asks Kabir to either apologise or leave the college. Kabir initially chooses to leave but stays back after meeting and falling in love with first-year student Preeti Sikka.\n\nKabir and his friend Shiva enter a third-year classroom and announce that Kabir is in love with Preeti, asserting that she is exclusive to him. Initially afraid, Preeti starts adjusting herself to Kabir's overbearing attitude. She eventually reciprocates his feelings, and they develop an intimate relationship. Kabir graduates with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] degree and leaves for [[Mussoorie]] to pursue a postgraduate degree in [[Orthopedic surgery]]. Over the course of three years, Kabir and Preeti's relationship becomes stronger. Months later, Kabir visits Preeti's house, where her father, Harpal, sees them kissing and throws Kabir out.\n\nHarpal opposes Preeti and Kabir's relationship since he dislikes Kabir's personality. Kabir demands that Preeti must decide within six hours; otherwise, he will end their relationship. By the time she manages to visit Kabir's house, he is drunk, injects [[morphine]] into himself, and becomes unconscious for two days, missing his elder brother Karan's wedding in the process. Preeti is then forcibly married to another man named Jatinder from her caste. Kabir learns about the marriage from Shiva and goes to her house in protest. He is assaulted and gets arrested for making a scene. Kabir's father, Rajdheer, ostracises him from the family home for damaging his reputation.\n\nWith Shiva's help, Kabir finds a rented apartment and joins a private hospital as a surgeon. To cope with his emotions, he starts taking drugs, attempts [[One-night stand|one-night stands]], buys a pet dog and names it after Preeti, and drinks alcohol; all of which are unsuccessful. Within months, he becomes a successful surgeon and a [[high-functioning alcoholic]] feared by the hospital's staff members, one reason being his high surgery count. Kabir's self-destructive behaviour and refusal to move on worries Shiva and Kamal. He persuades one of his patients, Jia Sharma, a leading film star, to have a no-strings relationship with him, which he ends when she falls in love with him. Karan arrives at Kabir's flat and unsuccessfully persuades him to return home.\n\nOn a day off, Kabir unwillingly agrees to perform a life-saving surgical operation. During the surgery, he collapses with [[dehydration]]. The hospital staff examine his blood samples, which show traces of alcohol and [[cocaine]]. The hospital chief files a case against Kabir, who accepts the truth on the grounds of violating his professional ethics during an in-house court hearing, despite Shiva and Karan making arrangements to bail him out. Kabir's medical licence is cancelled for five years, and he is evicted from the flat. The next morning, Shiva manages to reach Kabir to convey his grandmother Sadhna Kaur's death; he meets with his father, and they reconcile. Kabir quits his self-destructive habits soon after.\n\nWhile leaving for a vacation, Kabir meets a pregnant Preeti sitting in a park. She initially refuses to listen or talk to Kabir, but Shiva tells her why Kabir could not accept her earlier. Convinced, Preeti reveals that she left Jatinder three days after their marriage and continued to work in a clinic. She tells Kabir that he is the child's father, and they reunite. The pair marries, and Harpal apologises for misunderstanding their love for each other. The film ends off with the couple on the beach with their baby, after having their wedding photos taken along with Kabir's family.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani.jpg|thumb|upright=1|alt=Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani are posing for the camera|[[Shahid Kapoor]] and [[Kiara Advani]] at a promotional event for the film]]\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Shahid Kapoor]] as Dr Kabir Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Kiara Advani]] as Dr Preeti Kabir Singh / Preeti Sikka<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Soham Majumdar as Dr Shiva<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" />\n* [[Arjan Bajwa]] as Karan Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Nikita Dutta]] as Jia Sharma<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-nikita-dutta-her-experience-working-shahid-kapoor-kabir-singh-portraying-jia-sharma-456650 |title=Exclusive: Nikita Dutta on her experience of working with Shahid Kapoor in Kabir Singh & portraying Jia Sharma |last=Darade |first=Pooja |date=19 June 2019 |website=Pinkvilla |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190619084220/https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-nikita-dutta-her-experience-working-shahid-kapoor-kabir-singh-portraying-jia-sharma-456650 |archive-date=19 June 2019 |access-date=19 June 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Kamini Kaushal]] as Sadhna Kaur \"Dadi\"<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" />\n* [[Suresh Oberoi]] as Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Vijay K.

When it did not work out, he approached [[Shahid Kapoor]]. However, producers Murad Khetani and Ashwin Varde of Cine1 Studios, who acquired the remake rights for Hindi, wanted [[Arjun Kapoor]] to play the male lead. Disappointed, Vanga said, \"I've come to know that the remake rights of ''Arjun Reddy'' have been sold and it would star Arjun Kapoor. I am caught in a dilemma, as I've already locked Shahid for the role. It's a very embarrassing situation for me. I don't know how I'll face Shahid.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/250118/wont-redirect-arjun-reddy-with-arjun-kapoor.html |title=Wanted Ranveer, approached Shahid, unsure about directing Arjun: Arjun Reddy director |last=Jha |first=Subhash K. |date=25 January 2018 |work=[[Deccan Chronicle]] |access-date=30 October 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513154033/https://deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/250118/wont-redirect-arjun-reddy-with-arjun-kapoor.html |archive-date=13 May 2018 |author-link=Subhash K.

[[Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran]] was selected as the cinematographer, and Aarif Sheikh as editor.<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" /> Vanga was confident that the remake would be even more hard hitting than the original: \"When I made ''Arjun Reddy'', I wasn't sure where to draw the line in terms of representation of certain things. I don't think I'd have to restrict myself when it comes to the Hindi version. I believe I'll have more freedom in Bollywood.\"<ref name=\"ShahidConfirmed\" /> The film's title ''Kabir Singh'' was announced on 25 October 2018.<ref name=\"TitleRevealed\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nLike the Telugu original, ''Kabir Singh'' too begins with a voiceover from the hero's paternal grandmother, but this time she is reciting a Kabir Doha. There are also geographical changes; the remake is set primarily in Delhi and Mumbai. Instead of caste conflict as in ''Arjun Reddy'', the heroine's father takes offence to Kabir's smoking and not being a [[turban]]-wearing [[Sikhs|Sikh]]. For the remake, Vanga said he deployed less English than the original. \"I've also tried to retain the colloquial quality in the Hindi dialogue.\" About the name Kabir Singh, he said, \"There's a lot of melancholy in the name Kabir and a poetic side too.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/leisure/story/20190617-crazy-in-love-1543900-2019-06-07 |title=Crazy in love |last=Singh |first=Suhani |date=7 June 2019 |website=[[India Today]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607162330/https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/leisure/story/20190617-crazy-in-love-1543900-2019-06-07 |archive-date=7 June 2019 |access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref> Vanga explained his reasons for choosing this as the film's title: \"When we started work on the Hindi script, it was a very exciting journey.

It is a remake of his own [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film ''[[Arjun Reddy]]'' (2017). Jointly produced by Cine1 Studios and [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], the film stars [[Shahid Kapoor]] and [[Kiara Advani]]. Kapoor plays Kabir Singh, a surgeon who spirals into self-destruction when his girlfriend, Preeti leaves him.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in October 2018 and ended in March 2019. The film was theatrically released in India on 21 June 2019 and received mixed reviews, with criticism directed at it for glamorising [[misogyny]] and [[toxic masculinity]], though Kapoor's performance was praised. It grossed over {{INR}}379 crore, becoming the second [[List of Bollywood films of 2019#Box office collection|highest grossing Bollywood]] film of 2019.<ref name=\"bwww\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nKabir Rajdheer Singh is a house surgeon at Delhi Institute of Medical Sciences. Despite being a brilliant student, he has severe [[anger management]] problems that earn the wrath of the college dean. Kabir's aggressive nature also earns him a reputation among his juniors as a [[Workplace bullying in academia|college bully]]. After having a brawl with Amit, one of the team members from another college alongside his friend Kamal against other members of the opposing team who ridiculed them during an inter-college [[Association football|football]] match, the dean asks Kabir to either apologise or leave the college. Kabir initially chooses to leave but stays back after meeting and falling in love with first-year student Preeti Sikka.\n\nKabir and his friend Shiva enter a third-year classroom and announce that Kabir is in love with Preeti, asserting that she is exclusive to him. Initially afraid, Preeti starts adjusting herself to Kabir's overbearing attitude. She eventually reciprocates his feelings, and they develop an intimate relationship. Kabir graduates with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] degree and leaves for [[Mussoorie]] to pursue a postgraduate degree in [[Orthopedic surgery]]. Over the course of three years, Kabir and Preeti's relationship becomes stronger. Months later, Kabir visits Preeti's house, where her father, Harpal, sees them kissing and throws Kabir out.\n\nHarpal opposes Preeti and Kabir's relationship since he dislikes Kabir's personality. Kabir demands that Preeti must decide within six hours; otherwise, he will end their relationship. By the time she manages to visit Kabir's house, he is drunk, injects [[morphine]] into himself, and becomes unconscious for two days, missing his elder brother Karan's wedding in the process. Preeti is then forcibly married to another man named Jatinder from her caste. Kabir learns about the marriage from Shiva and goes to her house in protest. He is assaulted and gets arrested for making a scene. Kabir's father, Rajdheer, ostracises him from the family home for damaging his reputation.\n\nWith Shiva's help, Kabir finds a rented apartment and joins a private hospital as a surgeon. To cope with his emotions, he starts taking drugs, attempts [[One-night stand|one-night stands]], buys a pet dog and names it after Preeti, and drinks alcohol; all of which are unsuccessful. Within months, he becomes a successful surgeon and a [[high-functioning alcoholic]] feared by the hospital's staff members, one reason being his high surgery count. Kabir's self-destructive behaviour and refusal to move on worries Shiva and Kamal. He persuades one of his patients, Jia Sharma, a leading film star, to have a no-strings relationship with him, which he ends when she falls in love with him. Karan arrives at Kabir's flat and unsuccessfully persuades him to return home.\n\nOn a day off, Kabir unwillingly agrees to perform a life-saving surgical operation. During the surgery, he collapses with [[dehydration]]. The hospital staff examine his blood samples, which show traces of alcohol and [[cocaine]]. The hospital chief files a case against Kabir, who accepts the truth on the grounds of violating his professional ethics during an in-house court hearing, despite Shiva and Karan making arrangements to bail him out. Kabir's medical licence is cancelled for five years, and he is evicted from the flat. The next morning, Shiva manages to reach Kabir to convey his grandmother Sadhna Kaur's death; he meets with his father, and they reconcile. Kabir quits his self-destructive habits soon after.\n\nWhile leaving for a vacation, Kabir meets a pregnant Preeti sitting in a park. She initially refuses to listen or talk to Kabir, but Shiva tells her why Kabir could not accept her earlier. Convinced, Preeti reveals that she left Jatinder three days after their marriage and continued to work in a clinic. She tells Kabir that he is the child's father, and they reunite. The pair marries, and Harpal apologises for misunderstanding their love for each other. The film ends off with the couple on the beach with their baby, after having their wedding photos taken along with Kabir's family.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani.jpg|thumb|upright=1|alt=Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani are posing for the camera|[[Shahid Kapoor]] and [[Kiara Advani]] at a promotional event for the film]]\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Shahid Kapoor]] as Dr Kabir Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Kiara Advani]] as Dr Preeti Kabir Singh / Preeti Sikka<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Soham Majumdar as Dr Shiva<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" />\n* [[Arjan Bajwa]] as Karan Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Nikita Dutta]] as Jia Sharma<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-nikita-dutta-her-experience-working-shahid-kapoor-kabir-singh-portraying-jia-sharma-456650 |title=Exclusive: Nikita Dutta on her experience of working with Shahid Kapoor in Kabir Singh & portraying Jia Sharma |last=Darade |first=Pooja |date=19 June 2019 |website=Pinkvilla |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190619084220/https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-nikita-dutta-her-experience-working-shahid-kapoor-kabir-singh-portraying-jia-sharma-456650 |archive-date=19 June 2019 |access-date=19 June 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Kamini Kaushal]] as Sadhna Kaur \"Dadi\"<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" />\n* [[Suresh Oberoi]] as Rajdheer Singh\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Vijay K.

When it did not work out, he approached [[Shahid Kapoor]]. However, producers Murad Khetani and Ashwin Varde of Cine1 Studios, who acquired the remake rights for Hindi, wanted [[Arjun Kapoor]] to play the male lead. Disappointed, Vanga said, \"I've come to know that the remake rights of ''Arjun Reddy'' have been sold and it would star Arjun Kapoor. I am caught in a dilemma, as I've already locked Shahid for the role. It's a very embarrassing situation for me. I don't know how I'll face Shahid.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/250118/wont-redirect-arjun-reddy-with-arjun-kapoor.html |title=Wanted Ranveer, approached Shahid, unsure about directing Arjun: Arjun Reddy director |last=Jha |first=Subhash K. |date=25 January 2018 |work=[[Deccan Chronicle]] |access-date=30 October 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513154033/https://deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/250118/wont-redirect-arjun-reddy-with-arjun-kapoor.html |archive-date=13 May 2018 |author-link=Subhash K.

[[Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran]] was selected as the cinematographer, and Aarif Sheikh as editor.<ref name=\"bollywoodhungama\" /> Vanga was confident that the remake would be even more hard hitting than the original: \"When I made ''Arjun Reddy'', I wasn't sure where to draw the line in terms of representation of certain things. I don't think I'd have to restrict myself when it comes to the Hindi version. I believe I'll have more freedom in Bollywood.\"<ref name=\"ShahidConfirmed\" /> The film's title ''Kabir Singh'' was announced on 25 October 2018.<ref name=\"TitleRevealed\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nLike the Telugu original, ''Kabir Singh'' too begins with a voiceover from the hero's paternal grandmother, but this time she is reciting a Kabir Doha. There are also geographical changes; the remake is set primarily in Delhi and Mumbai. Instead of caste conflict as in ''Arjun Reddy'', the heroine's father takes offence to Kabir's smoking and not being a [[turban]]-wearing [[Sikhs|Sikh]]. For the remake, Vanga said he deployed less English than the original. \"I've also tried to retain the colloquial quality in the Hindi dialogue.\" About the name Kabir Singh, he said, \"There's a lot of melancholy in the name Kabir and a poetic side too.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/leisure/story/20190617-crazy-in-love-1543900-2019-06-07 |title=Crazy in love |last=Singh |first=Suhani |date=7 June 2019 |website=[[India Today]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607162330/https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/leisure/story/20190617-crazy-in-love-1543900-2019-06-07 |archive-date=7 June 2019 |access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref> Vanga explained his reasons for choosing this as the film's title: \"When we started work on the Hindi script, it was a very exciting journey.

During the 1970s he created the foundation of the LaRouche Movement and became more engaged in conspiratorial beliefs and violent and/or illegal activities. In 1986, his movement reached its height in electoral success when Larouchite candidates won several Democratic primaries for state offices in Illinois. (The defeated mainstream Democratic candidates ran in the general election as members of the [[Illinois Solidarity Party]]; the Larouchite Democrats all finished a distant third.) Later in the 1980s, criminal investigations led to convictions of several LaRouche movement members, including LaRouche himself. He was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, but only served five years.\n\nLaRouche was a perennial candidate for [[President of the United States]]. He ran in every election from 1976 to 2004 as a candidate of third parties established by members of his movement. He also tried to gain the Democratic presidential nomination. In 1996, he got 5% of the total nationwide vote in Democratic primaries. In 2000, he received enough primary votes to qualify for delegates in some states, but ultimately was refused those delegates at the convention.\n\n==Early life==\nLaRouche was born in Rochester, New Hampshire, the oldest of three children of Jessie Lenore ({{nee}} Weir) and Lyndon H.

According to Christopher Toumey, his subsequent campaign followed a familiar LaRouche pattern: challenging the scientific competence of government experts, and arguing that LaRouche had special scientific insights, and his own scientific associates were more competent than government scientists. LaRouche's view of AIDS agreed with orthodox medicine in that [[HIV]] caused AIDS, but differed from it in arguing that HIV spread like the cold virus or malaria, by way of casual contact and insect bites\u2014which, if true, would make HIV-positive people extremely dangerous. He advocated testing anyone working in schools, restaurants, or healthcare, and quarantining those who tested positive. Some of LaRouche's views on AIDS were developed by [[John R. Seale|John Seale]], a British [[venereologist|venereological physician]] who proposed that AIDS was created in a Soviet laboratory. Seale's highly speculative writings were published in three prestigious medical journals, lending these ideas some appearance of being hard science.<ref name=\"Toumey-1996-pp.87-92\"/>\n\nLaRouche and his associates devised a \"Biological Strategic Defense Initiative\" that would cost $100 billion per annum, which they said would have to be directed by LaRouche.

Johnson characterizes LaRouche's views as follows: the Platonists include figures such as [[Beethoven]], [[Mozart]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. LaRouche believed that many of the world's ills result from the dominance of Aristotelianism as embraced by the [[Empiricism#British empiricism|empirical philosophers]] (such as Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), leading to a culture that favors the empirical over the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], embraces [[moral relativism]], and seeks to keep the general population uninformed. Industry, technology, and classical music should be used to enlighten the world, LaRouche argued, whereas the Aristotelians use psychotherapy, drugs, rock music, jazz, environmentalism, and quantum theory to bring about a new Dark Age in which the world will be ruled by the oligarchs. Left and right are false distinctions for LaRouche; what matters is the Platonic versus Aristotelian outlook, a position that has led him to form relationships with groups as disparate as farmers, nuclear engineers, [[African American Muslims|Black Muslims]], [[Teamsters]], and pro-life advocates.\n\nIn ''Architects of Fear'' (1983), Johnson compares LaRouche's view to an [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Illuminati|Illuminati conspiracy theory]]; Johnson writes that after he wrote about LaRouche in ''[[The Minneapolis Star]]'', LaRouche's followers denounced him as part of a conspiracy of elitists that began in [[ancient Egypt]].<ref name=\"Johnson-1983-pp187ff\"/><ref name=Johnson2>{{harvnb|Copulus|1984}}, p. 2.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1983|pp=14}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|George|Wilcox|1992|pp=314ff.}}</ref><ref>For LaRouche on his philosophy, see LaRouche, Lyndon.

During the 1970s he created the foundation of the LaRouche Movement and became more engaged in conspiratorial beliefs and violent and/or illegal activities. In 1986, his movement reached its height in electoral success when Larouchite candidates won several Democratic primaries for state offices in Illinois. (The defeated mainstream Democratic candidates ran in the general election as members of the [[Illinois Solidarity Party]]; the Larouchite Democrats all finished a distant third.) Later in the 1980s, criminal investigations led to convictions of several LaRouche movement members, including LaRouche himself. He was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, but only served five years.\n\nLaRouche was a perennial candidate for [[President of the United States]]. He ran in every election from 1976 to 2004 as a candidate of third parties established by members of his movement. He also tried to gain the Democratic presidential nomination. In 1996, he got 5% of the total nationwide vote in Democratic primaries. In 2000, he received enough primary votes to qualify for delegates in some states, but ultimately was refused those delegates at the convention.\n\n==Early life==\nLaRouche was born in Rochester, New Hampshire, the oldest of three children of Jessie Lenore ({{nee}} Weir) and Lyndon H.

Party officials would decide who each member should live with, and if someone left the movement, his remaining partner was expected to live separately from him.

According to Christopher Toumey, his subsequent campaign followed a familiar LaRouche pattern: challenging the scientific competence of government experts, and arguing that LaRouche had special scientific insights, and his own scientific associates were more competent than government scientists. LaRouche's view of AIDS agreed with orthodox medicine in that [[HIV]] caused AIDS, but differed from it in arguing that HIV spread like the cold virus or malaria, by way of casual contact and insect bites\u2014which, if true, would make HIV-positive people extremely dangerous. He advocated testing anyone working in schools, restaurants, or healthcare, and quarantining those who tested positive. Some of LaRouche's views on AIDS were developed by [[John R. Seale|John Seale]], a British [[venereologist|venereological physician]] who proposed that AIDS was created in a Soviet laboratory.

Johnson characterizes LaRouche's views as follows: the Platonists include figures such as [[Beethoven]], [[Mozart]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. LaRouche believed that many of the world's ills result from the dominance of Aristotelianism as embraced by the [[Empiricism#British empiricism|empirical philosophers]] (such as Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), leading to a culture that favors the empirical over the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], embraces [[moral relativism]], and seeks to keep the general population uninformed. Industry, technology, and classical music should be used to enlighten the world, LaRouche argued, whereas the Aristotelians use psychotherapy, drugs, rock music, jazz, environmentalism, and quantum theory to bring about a new Dark Age in which the world will be ruled by the oligarchs. Left and right are false distinctions for LaRouche; what matters is the Platonic versus Aristotelian outlook, a position that has led him to form relationships with groups as disparate as farmers, nuclear engineers, [[African American Muslims|Black Muslims]], [[Teamsters]], and pro-life advocates.\n\nIn ''Architects of Fear'' (1983), Johnson compares LaRouche's view to an [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Illuminati|Illuminati conspiracy theory]]; Johnson writes that after he wrote about LaRouche in ''[[The Minneapolis Star]]'', LaRouche's followers denounced him as part of a conspiracy of elitists that began in [[ancient Egypt]].<ref name=\"Johnson-1983-pp187ff\"/><ref name=Johnson2>{{harvnb|Copulus|1984}}, p. 2.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1983|pp=14}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|George|Wilcox|1992|pp=314ff.}}</ref><ref>For LaRouche on his philosophy, see LaRouche, Lyndon.
