However, in 2010, Omegle introduced a video mode to complement the text chat mode, which pairs together strangers who are using webcams and microphones. The [[video chat]] also has a built in text window.\n\nIn 2011, the beta version of a new feature, \"Spy Mode\", was introduced. In Spy (Question) Mode, users have two options: to be the \"spy\" and ask a question of two strangers, or to discuss a question with another stranger. As the spy, the user inputs any question for the two strangers to answer or discuss and is able to view the discussion as a third party, albeit without being able to contribute further to the conversation. The spy can quit at any time without ending the chat for the two other strangers. If a user chooses to discuss a question instead, as in normal text mode, the user is paired with another stranger and can discuss the question the spy has asked up until the point the other stranger decides to disconnect and/or move on to another question.\n\nIn 2012, Omegle added a special new feature to the text and video modes, the option to input \"interest\" tags. Adding interests lets users be paired with a stranger who has something in common with the user. A user can input as many interests as he or she would like, and if no available match is found, the user is paired with a completely random stranger instead.\n\nIn 2013, an unmonitored version of the video chat mode was opened, leaving the original content moderator-regulated video section open to anyone aged thirteen and up as long as the content of his or her video stream is clean. Initially, questionable adult content in the video section of Omegle was filtered using [[image recognition]] algorithms only. The newer unmonitored video section allows consenting adults over the age of eighteen the freedom to view, and share with one another, uncensored explicit video streams.\n\nIn 2014, Omegle began experimenting with a \"[[Dormitory|Dorm]] Chat\" mode, which requires users to provide an [[email address]] ending in \"[[.edu]]\" to verify that they are associated with a [[college]] or [[university]].

However, in 2010, Omegle introduced a video mode to complement the text chat mode, which pairs together strangers who are using webcams and microphones. The [[video chat]] also has a built in text window.\n\nIn 2011, the beta version of a new feature, \"Spy Mode\", was introduced. In Spy (Question) Mode, users have two options: to be the \"spy\" and ask a question of two strangers, or to discuss a question with another stranger. As the spy, the user inputs any question for the two strangers to answer or discuss and is able to view the discussion as a third party, albeit without being able to contribute further to the conversation. The spy can quit at any time without ending the chat for the two other strangers. If a user chooses to discuss a question instead, as in normal text mode, the user is paired with another stranger and can discuss the question the spy has asked up until the point the other stranger decides to disconnect and/or move on to another question.\n\nIn 2012, Omegle added a special new feature to the text and video modes, the option to input \"interest\" tags. Adding interests lets users be paired with a stranger who has something in common with the user. A user can input as many interests as he or she would like, and if no available match is found, the user is paired with a completely random stranger instead.\n\nIn 2013, an unmonitored version of the video chat mode was opened, leaving the original content moderator-regulated video section open to anyone aged thirteen and up as long as the content of his or her video stream is clean. Initially, questionable adult content in the video section of Omegle was filtered using [[image recognition]] algorithms only. The newer unmonitored video section allows consenting adults over the age of eighteen the freedom to view, and share with one another, uncensored explicit video streams.\n\nIn 2014, Omegle began experimenting with a \"[[Dormitory|Dorm]] Chat\" mode, which requires users to provide an [[email address]] ending in \"[[.edu]]\" to verify that they are associated with a [[college]] or [[university]]. Dorm Chat allows users to chat with their classmates and colleagues on Omegle.\n\nIn 2015, Omegle began implementing [[ReCAPTCHA|ReCaptcha]] security measures to help reduce the amount of [[Internet bot|bots]] on the site. This has, however, been met with complaints that bots remain and legitimate use is excessively interrupted.\n\nDuring late 2019 and early 2020, Omegle began throwing jabs at the [[Communist Party of China]], and expressing support for the [[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests|Liberation of Hong Kong]] during the 2019/20 protests, with an image on the front page saying \"[[Xi Jinping]] ([[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]) sure looks like [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://z6mag.com/2019/10/10/omegle-throws-jabs-at-china-xi-pooh/|title=Omegle throws jabs at China: 'Xi = Pooh!'|last=Restar|first=Al|date=2019-10-10|website=Z6 Mag|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://funnyjunk.com/Omegle+is+supporting+hong+kong/giadMtv/|title=Omegle Is Supporting Hong Kong|website=funnyjunk.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nPrior to early 2013, the site did not [[Censorship|censor]] contributions through a [[profanity filter]], and users have reported encountering [[nudity]] or [[sexual content]] on camera.<ref name=\"bbctech\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8539701.stm|title=Chatroulette and Omegle: chat rooms with a twist| publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> After January 2013, Omegle implemented a \"monitored\" video chat, to monitor misbehavior and protect people under the age of 18 from potentially harmful content, including nudity or sexual content.

He took diligent care to write case studies of his interactions with his patients and their ailments as well as his prescribed medicines.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292}}</ref> Doctors such as Maoxian treated men as well as women, however Cheng described each case study with reference to contemporary social structures.\n\nIn encounters between sick women and their male doctors, women were often shy about their issues and frequently made the doctor's work more difficult by concealing the extent all symptoms. Even if they did confess all their symptoms, doctors, such as Cheng, would consider the majority of the illness to be linked to some problem concerning the woman's reproductive system or cycle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Congzhou|first1=Cheng}}</ref> One of the stories Cheng discussed in his case studies was that of Fan Jisuo's teenage daughter, who could not be diagnosed because she was unwilling to speak on her symptoms. In this particular case, the illness involved discharge from her intimate areas. Cheng insisted on asking more about her illness and the patient's modesty became a frustrating obstacle.\n\nWhen a woman fell ill, an appropriate adult man was to call the doctor and remain present during the examination, for the woman could not be left alone with the doctor. However, this was not always the case. In particular cases, when a woman dealt with complications of pregnancy or birth, older women became involved and assumed the role of the formal authority. Men in these situations would not have much power to interfere.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHowever, when a doctor's visit was absolutely necessary, a breaking of norms was sometimes necessary. To properly examine the patient, doctors were faced with the task of going beyond the norm of female modesty. As Cheng describes, there were four standard methods of diagnosis\u2014looking, asking, listening and smelling and touching (for pulse-taking). To maintain some form of modesty, women would often stay hidden behind curtains and screens. The doctor was allowed to touch enough of her body to complete his examination, often just the pulse taking. This would lead to situations where the symptoms and the doctor's diagnosis did not agree and the doctor would have to ask to see more of the patient.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History: 960\u20131665|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292|page=248}}</ref>\n\n=== Yin Yang and Gender ===\nGender was presumed to influence the movement of energy and a well-trained physician would be expected to read the pulse and should have been able to identify two dozen or more energy flows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Canon of the Pulse (Maijing)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Yin and yang concepts were applied to the feminine and masculine aspects of all bodies at large, implying that in nature the differences between men and women begin at the level of this energy flow.

Second, women were often silent about their issues with doctors and male figures due to the societal expectation of female modesty and the presence of a male figure in the room.<ref name=\":03\" /> Third, the presence of male authority in the sick room and the patriarchal dominated society also caused doctors to reference their women and children patients \"the anonymous category of family members (''Jia Ren'') or household (''Ju Jia'')\"<ref name=\":03\" /> in their journals.

The term [[Caesarean section]] derives from an ancient Roman, or Caesarean (from Caesar) law that demanded that when a pregnant woman died, her body could not be buried until the unborn child had been removed. Ancient Roman doctors were forbidden from performing this procedure on living women, however.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/antiqua/gynecology/ |title = Ancient Gynecology}}</ref>\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine's attempts to grapple with pregnancy are documented from at least the seventeenth century. According to Charlotte Furth, \"a pregnancy (in the seventeenth century) as a known bodily experience emerged [...] out of the liminality of menstrual irregularity, as uneasy digestion, and a sense of fullness\".<ref name=\":03\" /> These symptoms were common among other illness as well, so the diagnosis of pregnancy often came later in the term. The ''Canon of the Pulse'' or the use of pulse in diagnosis stated that pregnancy was \"a condition marked by symptoms of disorder in one whose pulse is normal\" or \"where the pulse and symptoms do not agree\".<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Diagnosis for Pulse-Taking and Pulse Subtlety|date=March 2019|pages=69\u201377|publisher=WORLD SCIENTIFIC|isbn=9789813273573|doi=10.1142/9789813273580_0017|title=The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine \u2013 Essential Questions}}</ref> Just as in the normal diagnosis process, women were often silent about suspected pregnancy, this led to many men in the households not knowing their wife or daughter was pregnant until complications arrived.\n\nComplications through the misdiagnosis and silence of pregnancies often involved medically induced abortions, according to Furth's book, Dr.Cheng (her case study) \"was unapologetic about endangering a fetus when pregnancy risked a mother's well being\".<ref name=\":03\" /> The method of abortion was used through the ingestion of certain herbs and medicinal foods.

According to Charlotte Furth and her book, ''A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China\u2019s Medical History'', yin and yang showed the embodiment of nature within human bodies, and with it the natural phenomena that we understand as gendered differences.<ref name=\":13\" /> Yin and yang ruled the body, the body being a microcosm of the universe and the earth. In addition, gender in the body was understood as homologous, the two genders operating in synchronization.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nOperating within yin and yang, bodily functions could be categorized through systems. In many drawings and diagrams, the twelve channels and their visceral systems were organized by yin and yang, and that organization was identical in female and male bodies. This points to the understanding in traditional Chinese medicine that female and male bodies were no different on the plane of yin and yang. Their gendered differences were not acknowledged in diagrams of the human body. Medical journals were filled with illustrations of male bodies or androgynous bodies, those that did not display gendered characteristics.<ref>Wu, Yi-Li, and {{lang|zh|\u5433\u4e00\u7acb}}. \"The Gendered Medical Iconography of the Golden Mirror, Yuzuan Yizong Jinjian {{lang|zh|\u5fa1\u7e82\u91ab\u5b97\u91d1\u9451}}, 1742.\" In ''Imagining Chinese Medicine'', edited by Lo Vivienne, {{lang|zh|\u7f85\u7dad\u524d}}, Barrett Penelope, Dear David, Di Lu, {{lang|zh|\u8606\u7b1b}}, Reynolds Lois, Yang Dolly, and {{lang|zh|\u694a\u5fb7\u79c0}}, 111\u201332.

As in other cultures, fertility and menstruation dominate female health in Chinese medicine. However, it was not physical, anatomical structures that differentiated women from men, but physiological and pathological processes of the body.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is an important distinction, because it refers back to the traditional Chinese understanding of Yin and Yang and gender differences. Bodies looked the same, and were governed by the same forces, but their processes looked different in men and women.\n\nFor example, understanding the womb and its fundamental difference from male bodies was irrelevant. Traditional Chinese medicine did not recognize the womb as the place of reproduction. For the Chinese, the abdominal cavity presented pathologies that were similar in both men and women, which included tumors, growths, hernias, and swellings of the genitals. The \"master system\" as Charlotte Furth identifies, is the Kidney visceral system, which governed reproductive functions in Traditional Chinese medicine.<ref name=\":13\" /> Therefore, it was not the anatomical structures in women that allowed for pregnancy, but the difference in female processes that allowed for the affliction of pregnancy to occur.\n\nSocial and cultural beliefs were often barriers to learning more about female health, with women themselves often being the most formidable barrier. Women were often uncomfortable talking about their illnesses, especially in front of the male chaperones that attended medical examinations.<ref name=\":13\" /> Women would choose to omit certain symptoms as a means of upholding their chastity and honor. One such examples is the case in which a teenage girl was unable to be diagnosed because she failed to mention her symptom of vaginal discharge.<ref name=\":13\" /> Silence was their way of maintaining control in these situations, but it often came at the expense of their health and the advancement of female health and medicine. This silence and control was most obviously seen when the health problem was related to the core of Ming ''fuke'', or the sexual body.<ref name=\":13\" /> It was often in these diagnostic settings that women would choose silence. In addition, there would be conflict between patient and doctor on the probability of her diagnosis. For example, a woman who thought herself to be past the point of child-bearing age, might not believe a doctor who diagnoses her as pregnant.<ref name=\":13\" /> This only resulted in more conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, female health and medicine was a topic that was not well understood by traditional Chinese medicine. Although ''yin'' and ''yang'' were central to understanding female bodies, it was often only through the lens of male bodies. Women were seen as variations of male bodies, with similar structures but different processes. This was also compounded by the autonomy of women who chose to stay silent during diagnostics, and thus complicate the issue of female health and medicine.\n\n==== Infertility ====\nInfertility was also not very well understood in traditional Chinese medicine, however it posed serious social and cultural repercussions.\n\nOne of the most cited scholar that mentions female health is 7th-century scholar Sun Simiao. He is often quoted to the likes of \"those who have prescriptions for women's distinctiveness take their differences of pregnancy, childbirth and [internal] bursting injuries as their basis.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Even in contemporary ''fu ke'' does Sun's observations about female reproductive functions, it stills remains an important function of women's health. The propensity to place more emphasis on reproductive functions, rather than the entire health of the woman, seems to suggest that the main function of ''fu ke'' is to produce children.\n\nOnce again, the Kidney visceral system governs the \"source ''Qi,''\" which governs the reproductive systems in both sexes. This source ''Qi'' was thought to \"be slowly depleted through sexual activity, menstruation and childbirth.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> It was also understood that the depletion of source Qi could result from the movement of an external pathology that moved through the outer visceral systems before causing more permanent damage to the home of source Qi, the Kidney system. In addition, the view that only very serious ailments ended in the damage of this system means that those who had trouble with their reproductive systems or fertility were seriously ill.\n\nAccording to traditional Chinese medical texts, infertility can be summarized into different syndrome types. These were spleen and kidney depletion (yang depletion), liver and kidney depletion (yin depletion), blood depletion, phlegm damp, liver oppression, and damp heat. This is important because, while most other issues were complex in Chinese medical physiology, women's fertility issues were simple. Most syndrome types revolved around menstruation, or lack thereof. The patient was entrusted with recording not only the frequency, but also the \"volume, color, consistency, and odor of menstrual flow.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> This placed responsibility of symptom recording on the patient, and was compounded by the earlier discussed issue of female chastity and honor. This meant that diagnosing female infertility was difficult, because the only symptoms that were recorded and monitored by the physician was the pulse and color of the tongue.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of infertility shows how social and cultural barriers affected the practice of traditional Chinese medicine.\n\n== Concept of disease ==\nIn general, disease is perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of yin, yang, qi, xu\u0115, z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, meridians etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Therapy is based on which \"pattern of disharmony\" can be identified.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> Thus, \"pattern discrimination\" is the most important step in TCM diagnosis.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> It is also known to be the most difficult aspect of practicing TCM.<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>\n\nTo determine which pattern is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice.<ref>\"Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine\", Giovanni Maciocia, Eastland Press; Revised edition (June 1995)</ref><ref name=Maciocia>{{Cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Maciocia|title=The Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=1989}}</ref> For example, depending on tongue and pulse conditions, a TCM practitioner might diagnose bleeding from the mouth and nose as: \"Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung, injuring the blood vessels and giving rise to reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose.\"<ref name=Deadman>Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji.

for example: qi vacuity and qi stagnation in the case of qi;<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> blood vacuity, blood stasis, and blood heat in the case of xu\u0115;<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Spleen qi vacuity, Spleen yang vacuity, Spleen qi vacuity with down-bearing qi, Spleen qi vacuity with lack of blood containment, cold-damp invasion of the Spleen, damp-heat invasion of Spleen and Stomach in case of the Spleen z\u00e0ng;<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/> wind/cold/damp invasion in the case of the meridians.<ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/>\n\nTCM gives detailed prescriptions of these patterns regarding their typical symptoms, mostly including characteristic tongue and/or pulse findings.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> For example:\n* \"Upflaming Liver fire\" ({{zh|c=\u809d\u706b\u4e0a\u708e|labels=no|p=g\u0101nhu\u01d2 sh\u00e0ng y\u00e1n}}): Headache, red face, reddened eyes, dry mouth, nosebleeds, constipation, dry or hard stools, profuse menstruation, sudden [[tinnitus]] or deafness, vomiting of sour or bitter fluids, expectoration of blood, [[irascibility]], impatience; red tongue with dry yellow fur; slippery and string-like pulse.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n\n====Eight principles of diagnosis====\nThe process of determining which actual pattern is on hand is called {{lang|zh|\u8fa9\u8bc1}} ({{zh|labels=no|p=bi\u00e0n zh\u00e8ng}}, usually translated as \"pattern diagnosis\",<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/> \"pattern identification\"<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> or \"pattern discrimination\"<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>). Generally, the first and most important step in pattern diagnosis is an evaluation of the present signs and symptoms on the basis of the \"Eight Principles\" ({{zh|c=\u516b\u7eb2 |labels=no|p=b\u0101 g\u0101ng}}).<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\nThese eight principles refer to four pairs of fundamental qualities of a disease: exterior/interior, heat/cold, vacuity/repletion, and yin/yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Out of these, heat/cold and vacuity/repletion have the biggest clinical importance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> The yin/yang quality, on the other side, has the smallest importance and is somewhat seen aside from the other three pairs, since it merely presents a general and vague conclusion regarding what other qualities are found.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In detail, the Eight Principles refer to the following:\n* ''Yin and yang'' are universal aspects all things can be classified under, this includes diseases in general as well as the Eight Principles' first three couples.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> For example, cold is identified to be a yin aspect, while heat is attributed to yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Since descriptions of patterns in terms of yin and yang lack complexity and clinical practicality, though, patterns are usually not labelled this way anymore.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Exceptions are vacuity-cold and repletion-heat patterns, who are sometimes referred to as \"yin patterns\" and \"yang patterns\" respectively.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Exterior'' ({{zh|c=\u8868|labels=no|p=bi\u01ceo}}) refers to a disease manifesting in the superficial layers of the body \u2013 skin, hair, flesh, and meridians.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> It is characterized by aversion to cold and/or wind, headache, muscle ache, mild fever, a \"floating\" pulse, and a normal tongue appearance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Interior'' ({{zh|c=\u91cc|labels=no|p=l\u01d0}}) refers to disease manifestation in the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, or (in a wider sense) to any disease that can not be counted as exterior.<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> There are no generalized characteristic symptoms of interior patterns, since they'll be determined by the affected z\u00e0ng or f\u01d4 entity.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Cold'' ({{zh|c=\u5bd2|labels=no|p=h\u00e1n}}) is generally characterized by aversion to cold, absence of thirst, and a white tongue fur.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> More detailed characterization depends on whether cold is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Heat'' ({{zh|c=\u70ed|labels=no|p=r\u00e8}}) is characterized by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Deficiency'' ({{zh|c=\u865a|labels=no|p=x\u016b}}), can be further differentiated into deficiency of [[#Qi|qi]], xu\u011b, [[#Yin and yang|yin and yang]], with all their respective characteristic symptoms.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Yin deficiency can also cause \"empty-heat\".<ref name=\"Kaptchuck 2000\"/>\n* ''Excess'' ({{zh|c=\u5b9e|labels=no|p=sh\u00ed}}) generally refers to any disease that can't be identified as a deficient pattern, and usually indicates the presence of one of the Six Excesses,<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> or a pattern of stagnation (of qi, xu\u011b, etc.).<ref>Tierra & Tierra 1998, p. 108</ref> In a concurrent exterior pattern, excess is characterized by the absence of sweating.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n\nAfter the fundamental nature of a disease in terms of the Eight Principles is determined, the investigation focuses on more specific aspects.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> By evaluating the present signs and symptoms against the background of typical disharmony patterns of the various entities, evidence is collected whether or how specific entities are affected.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> This evaluation can be done\n# in respect of the meridians ({{zh|c=\u7ecf\u7edc\u8fa9\u8bc1|labels=no|p=j\u012bnglu\u00f2 bi\u00e0n zh\u00e8ng}})<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>\n# in respect of qi ({{zh|c=\u6c14\u8840\u8fa9\u8bc1, |labels=no|p=q\u00ec xu\u00e8

Details of the tongue, including shape, size, color, texture, cracks, teethmarks, as well as tongue coating are all considered as part of [[tongue diagnosis]]. Various regions of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the z\u00e0ng-f\u016d organs. For example, redness on the tip of the tongue might indicate heat in the Heart, while redness on the sides of the tongue might indicate a heat in the Liver.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maciocia |first1=Giovanni |title=Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine |date=2001}}</ref>\n\nPulse palpation involves measuring the pulse both at a superficial and at a deep level at three different locations on the [[radial artery]] (''Cun, Guan, Chi'', located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain z\u00e0ng-f\u016d. The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength and volume, and described with qualities like \"floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick\"; each of these qualities indicate certain [[#Patterns|disease patterns]].

During the Cultural Revolution, the Ministry of Health directed health care throughout China and established primary care units. Chinese physicians who are trained in Western medicine also learn traditional medicine, while traditional healers receive training in modern methods, dynamically integrate modern medical concepts and methods, and revitalize some of the appropriate aspects of traditional medicine.

The medical staff combined the values of traditional China with modern methods to provide health and medical care to poor farmers in remote rural areas.

Chinese doctor Cheng Maoxian, born in 1581, lived and practiced medicine in Yangzhou in the 1610s and 1620s. He took diligent care to write case studies of his interactions with his patients and their ailments as well as his prescribed medicines.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292}}</ref> Doctors such as Maoxian treated men as well as women, however Cheng described each case study with reference to contemporary social structures.\n\nIn encounters between sick women and their male doctors, women were often shy about their issues and frequently made the doctor's work more difficult by concealing the extent all symptoms. Even if they did confess all their symptoms, doctors, such as Cheng, would consider the majority of the illness to be linked to some problem concerning the woman's reproductive system or cycle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Congzhou|first1=Cheng}}</ref> One of the stories Cheng discussed in his case studies was that of Fan Jisuo's teenage daughter, who could not be diagnosed because she was unwilling to speak on her symptoms. In this particular case, the illness involved discharge from her intimate areas. Cheng insisted on asking more about her illness and the patient's modesty became a frustrating obstacle.\n\nWhen a woman fell ill, an appropriate adult man was to call the doctor and remain present during the examination, for the woman could not be left alone with the doctor. However, this was not always the case. In particular cases, when a woman dealt with complications of pregnancy or birth, older women became involved and assumed the role of the formal authority. Men in these situations would not have much power to interfere.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nHowever, when a doctor's visit was absolutely necessary, a breaking of norms was sometimes necessary. To properly examine the patient, doctors were faced with the task of going beyond the norm of female modesty. As Cheng describes, there were four standard methods of diagnosis\u2014looking, asking, listening and smelling and touching (for pulse-taking). To maintain some form of modesty, women would often stay hidden behind curtains and screens. The doctor was allowed to touch enough of her body to complete his examination, often just the pulse taking. This would lead to situations where the symptoms and the doctor's diagnosis did not agree and the doctor would have to ask to see more of the patient.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History: 960\u20131665|last1=Furth|first1=Charlotte|date=March 1999|isbn=9780520208292|page=248}}</ref>\n\n=== Yin Yang and Gender ===\nGender was presumed to influence the movement of energy and a well-trained physician would be expected to read the pulse and should have been able to identify two dozen or more energy flows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Canon of the Pulse (Maijing)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Yin and yang concepts were applied to the feminine and masculine aspects of all bodies at large, implying that in nature the differences between men and women begin at the level of this energy flow.

Second, women were often silent about their issues with doctors and male figures due to the societal expectation of female modesty and the presence of a male figure in the room.<ref name=\":03\" /> Third, the presence of male authority in the sick room and the patriarchal dominated society also caused doctors to reference their women and children patients \"the anonymous category of family members (''Jia Ren'') or household (''Ju Jia'')\"<ref name=\":03\" /> in their journals.

The term [[Caesarean section]] derives from an ancient Roman, or Caesarean (from Caesar) law that demanded that when a pregnant woman died, her body could not be buried until the unborn child had been removed. Ancient Roman doctors were forbidden from performing this procedure on living women, however.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/antiqua/gynecology/ |title = Ancient Gynecology}}</ref>\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine's attempts to grapple with pregnancy are documented from at least the seventeenth century. According to Charlotte Furth, \"a pregnancy (in the seventeenth century) as a known bodily experience emerged [...] out of the liminality of menstrual irregularity, as uneasy digestion, and a sense of fullness\".<ref name=\":03\" /> These symptoms were common among other illness as well, so the diagnosis of pregnancy often came later in the term.

According to Charlotte Furth and her book, ''A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China\u2019s Medical History'', yin and yang showed the embodiment of nature within human bodies, and with it the natural phenomena that we understand as gendered differences.<ref name=\":13\" /> Yin and yang ruled the body, the body being a microcosm of the universe and the earth. In addition, gender in the body was understood as homologous, the two genders operating in synchronization.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nOperating within yin and yang, bodily functions could be categorized through systems. In many drawings and diagrams, the twelve channels and their visceral systems were organized by yin and yang, and that organization was identical in female and male bodies. This points to the understanding in traditional Chinese medicine that female and male bodies were no different on the plane of yin and yang. Their gendered differences were not acknowledged in diagrams of the human body. Medical journals were filled with illustrations of male bodies or androgynous bodies, those that did not display gendered characteristics.<ref>Wu, Yi-Li, and {{lang|zh|\u5433\u4e00\u7acb}}. \"The Gendered Medical Iconography of the Golden Mirror, Yuzuan Yizong Jinjian {{lang|zh|\u5fa1\u7e82\u91ab\u5b97\u91d1\u9451}}, 1742.\" In ''Imagining Chinese Medicine'', edited by Lo Vivienne, {{lang|zh|\u7f85\u7dad\u524d}}, Barrett Penelope, Dear David, Di Lu, {{lang|zh|\u8606\u7b1b}}, Reynolds Lois, Yang Dolly, and {{lang|zh|\u694a\u5fb7\u79c0}}, 111\u201332.

As in other cultures, fertility and menstruation dominate female health in Chinese medicine. However, it was not physical, anatomical structures that differentiated women from men, but physiological and pathological processes of the body.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is an important distinction, because it refers back to the traditional Chinese understanding of Yin and Yang and gender differences. Bodies looked the same, and were governed by the same forces, but their processes looked different in men and women.\n\nFor example, understanding the womb and its fundamental difference from male bodies was irrelevant. Traditional Chinese medicine did not recognize the womb as the place of reproduction. For the Chinese, the abdominal cavity presented pathologies that were similar in both men and women, which included tumors, growths, hernias, and swellings of the genitals. The \"master system\" as Charlotte Furth identifies, is the Kidney visceral system, which governed reproductive functions in Traditional Chinese medicine.<ref name=\":13\" /> Therefore, it was not the anatomical structures in women that allowed for pregnancy, but the difference in female processes that allowed for the affliction of pregnancy to occur.\n\nSocial and cultural beliefs were often barriers to learning more about female health, with women themselves often being the most formidable barrier. Women were often uncomfortable talking about their illnesses, especially in front of the male chaperones that attended medical examinations.<ref name=\":13\" /> Women would choose to omit certain symptoms as a means of upholding their chastity and honor. One such examples is the case in which a teenage girl was unable to be diagnosed because she failed to mention her symptom of vaginal discharge.<ref name=\":13\" /> Silence was their way of maintaining control in these situations, but it often came at the expense of their health and the advancement of female health and medicine. This silence and control was most obviously seen when the health problem was related to the core of Ming ''fuke'', or the sexual body.<ref name=\":13\" /> It was often in these diagnostic settings that women would choose silence. In addition, there would be conflict between patient and doctor on the probability of her diagnosis. For example, a woman who thought herself to be past the point of child-bearing age, might not believe a doctor who diagnoses her as pregnant.<ref name=\":13\" /> This only resulted in more conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, female health and medicine was a topic that was not well understood by traditional Chinese medicine. Although ''yin'' and ''yang'' were central to understanding female bodies, it was often only through the lens of male bodies. Women were seen as variations of male bodies, with similar structures but different processes. This was also compounded by the autonomy of women who chose to stay silent during diagnostics, and thus complicate the issue of female health and medicine.\n\n==== Infertility ====\nInfertility was also not very well understood in traditional Chinese medicine, however it posed serious social and cultural repercussions.\n\nOne of the most cited scholar that mentions female health is 7th-century scholar Sun Simiao. He is often quoted to the likes of \"those who have prescriptions for women's distinctiveness take their differences of pregnancy, childbirth and [internal] bursting injuries as their basis.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Even in contemporary ''fu ke'' does Sun's observations about female reproductive functions, it stills remains an important function of women's health. The propensity to place more emphasis on reproductive functions, rather than the entire health of the woman, seems to suggest that the main function of ''fu ke'' is to produce children.\n\nOnce again, the Kidney visceral system governs the \"source ''Qi,''\" which governs the reproductive systems in both sexes. This source ''Qi'' was thought to \"be slowly depleted through sexual activity, menstruation and childbirth.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> It was also understood that the depletion of source Qi could result from the movement of an external pathology that moved through the outer visceral systems before causing more permanent damage to the home of source Qi, the Kidney system. In addition, the view that only very serious ailments ended in the damage of this system means that those who had trouble with their reproductive systems or fertility were seriously ill.\n\nAccording to traditional Chinese medical texts, infertility can be summarized into different syndrome types. These were spleen and kidney depletion (yang depletion), liver and kidney depletion (yin depletion), blood depletion, phlegm damp, liver oppression, and damp heat. This is important because, while most other issues were complex in Chinese medical physiology, women's fertility issues were simple. Most syndrome types revolved around menstruation, or lack thereof. The patient was entrusted with recording not only the frequency, but also the \"volume, color, consistency, and odor of menstrual flow.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> This placed responsibility of symptom recording on the patient, and was compounded by the earlier discussed issue of female chastity and honor. This meant that diagnosing female infertility was difficult, because the only symptoms that were recorded and monitored by the physician was the pulse and color of the tongue.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of infertility shows how social and cultural barriers affected the practice of traditional Chinese medicine.\n\n== Concept of disease ==\nIn general, disease is perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of yin, yang, qi, xu\u0115, z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, meridians etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Therapy is based on which \"pattern of disharmony\" can be identified.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> Thus, \"pattern discrimination\" is the most important step in TCM diagnosis.<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> It is also known to be the most difficult aspect of practicing TCM.<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>\n\nTo determine which pattern is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice.<ref>\"Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine\", Giovanni Maciocia, Eastland Press; Revised edition (June 1995)</ref><ref name=Maciocia>{{Cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Maciocia|title=The Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=1989}}</ref> For example, depending on tongue and pulse conditions, a TCM practitioner might diagnose bleeding from the mouth and nose as: \"Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung, injuring the blood vessels and giving rise to reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose.\"<ref name=Deadman>Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji.

for example: qi vacuity and qi stagnation in the case of qi;<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> blood vacuity, blood stasis, and blood heat in the case of xu\u0115;<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Spleen qi vacuity, Spleen yang vacuity, Spleen qi vacuity with down-bearing qi, Spleen qi vacuity with lack of blood containment, cold-damp invasion of the Spleen, damp-heat invasion of Spleen and Stomach in case of the Spleen z\u00e0ng;<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/> wind/cold/damp invasion in the case of the meridians.<ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/>\n\nTCM gives detailed prescriptions of these patterns regarding their typical symptoms, mostly including characteristic tongue and/or pulse findings.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/><ref name=\"Flaws 1996\"/> For example:\n* \"Upflaming Liver fire\" ({{zh|c=\u809d\u706b\u4e0a\u708e|labels=no|p=g\u0101nhu\u01d2 sh\u00e0ng y\u00e1n}}): Headache, red face, reddened eyes, dry mouth, nosebleeds, constipation, dry or hard stools, profuse menstruation, sudden [[tinnitus]] or deafness, vomiting of sour or bitter fluids, expectoration of blood, [[irascibility]], impatience; red tongue with dry yellow fur; slippery and string-like pulse.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n\n====Eight principles of diagnosis====\nThe process of determining which actual pattern is on hand is called {{lang|zh|\u8fa9\u8bc1}} ({{zh|labels=no|p=bi\u00e0n zh\u00e8ng}}, usually translated as \"pattern diagnosis\",<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/> \"pattern identification\"<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> or \"pattern discrimination\"<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>). Generally, the first and most important step in pattern diagnosis is an evaluation of the present signs and symptoms on the basis of the \"Eight Principles\" ({{zh|c=\u516b\u7eb2 |labels=no|p=b\u0101 g\u0101ng}}).<ref name=\"Ergil 2009\"/><ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\nThese eight principles refer to four pairs of fundamental qualities of a disease: exterior/interior, heat/cold, vacuity/repletion, and yin/yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Out of these, heat/cold and vacuity/repletion have the biggest clinical importance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> The yin/yang quality, on the other side, has the smallest importance and is somewhat seen aside from the other three pairs, since it merely presents a general and vague conclusion regarding what other qualities are found.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In detail, the Eight Principles refer to the following:\n* ''Yin and yang'' are universal aspects all things can be classified under, this includes diseases in general as well as the Eight Principles' first three couples.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> For example, cold is identified to be a yin aspect, while heat is attributed to yang.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Since descriptions of patterns in terms of yin and yang lack complexity and clinical practicality, though, patterns are usually not labelled this way anymore.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Exceptions are vacuity-cold and repletion-heat patterns, who are sometimes referred to as \"yin patterns\" and \"yang patterns\" respectively.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Exterior'' ({{zh|c=\u8868|labels=no|p=bi\u01ceo}}) refers to a disease manifesting in the superficial layers of the body \u2013 skin, hair, flesh, and meridians.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> It is characterized by aversion to cold and/or wind, headache, muscle ache, mild fever, a \"floating\" pulse, and a normal tongue appearance.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Interior'' ({{zh|c=\u91cc|labels=no|p=l\u01d0}}) refers to disease manifestation in the z\u00e0ng-f\u01d4, or (in a wider sense) to any disease that can not be counted as exterior.<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> There are no generalized characteristic symptoms of interior patterns, since they'll be determined by the affected z\u00e0ng or f\u01d4 entity.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Cold'' ({{zh|c=\u5bd2|labels=no|p=h\u00e1n}}) is generally characterized by aversion to cold, absence of thirst, and a white tongue fur.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> More detailed characterization depends on whether cold is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Heat'' ({{zh|c=\u70ed|labels=no|p=r\u00e8}}) is characterized by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n* ''Deficiency'' ({{zh|c=\u865a|labels=no|p=x\u016b}}), can be further differentiated into deficiency of [[#Qi|qi]], xu\u011b, [[#Yin and yang|yin and yang]], with all their respective characteristic symptoms.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> Yin deficiency can also cause \"empty-heat\".<ref name=\"Kaptchuck 2000\"/>\n* ''Excess'' ({{zh|c=\u5b9e|labels=no|p=sh\u00ed}}) generally refers to any disease that can't be identified as a deficient pattern, and usually indicates the presence of one of the Six Excesses,<ref name=\"Deng 1999\"/> or a pattern of stagnation (of qi, xu\u011b, etc.).<ref>Tierra & Tierra 1998, p. 108</ref> In a concurrent exterior pattern, excess is characterized by the absence of sweating.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/>\n\nAfter the fundamental nature of a disease in terms of the Eight Principles is determined, the investigation focuses on more specific aspects.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> By evaluating the present signs and symptoms against the background of typical disharmony patterns of the various entities, evidence is collected whether or how specific entities are affected.<ref name=\"Wiseman 1996\"/> This evaluation can be done\n# in respect of the meridians ({{zh|c=\u7ecf\u7edc\u8fa9\u8bc1|labels=no|p=j\u012bnglu\u00f2 bi\u00e0n zh\u00e8ng}})<ref name=\"Flaws 1990\"/>\n# in respect of qi ({{zh|c=\u6c14\u8840\u8fa9\u8bc1, |labels=no|p=q\u00ec xu\u00e8

Details of the tongue, including shape, size, color, texture, cracks, teethmarks, as well as tongue coating are all considered as part of [[tongue diagnosis]]. Various regions of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the z\u00e0ng-f\u016d organs. For example, redness on the tip of the tongue might indicate heat in the Heart, while redness on the sides of the tongue might indicate a heat in the Liver.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maciocia |first1=Giovanni |title=Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine |date=2001}}</ref>\n\nPulse palpation involves measuring the pulse both at a superficial and at a deep level at three different locations on the [[radial artery]] (''Cun, Guan, Chi'', located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain z\u00e0ng-f\u016d.

His best-known song is probably \"Kauppaopiston naiset\" (Business College Women) from 1977.\n\nKari Peitsamo started his career with the EP ''Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli'', which was created with the assistance of Juuso Nordlund and Kaj Martin, the backing group of [[Juice Leskinen]], on the studio time left over from Leskinen. Kari Peitsamo's debut album ''Jatsin syvin olemus'' (1977) was still performed as a trio but the following albums would be solos where Peitsamo performed his songs accompanied only by an acoustic guitar. Later on, Peitsamo's acoustic guitar was switched to an electric one, and he was joined by the band Ankkuli, with its other members Harri Siirtola (bass) and Yrj\u00f6 Majamaa (drums).\n\nAfter this Peitsamo, who had recorded for [[Love Records]], moved to [[Poko Records]], and changed his band to Kari Peitsamo Revival, which was influenced by [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] and [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] (Peitsamo also translated songs by both bands into Finnish). After the Revival period, Peitsamo played rock with his new band Kari Peitsamon Skootteri between 1985\u20131994. Another ensemble of his, Kari Peitsamo & Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t, also released one album in 1998, called ''Bubblegum Warriors In Faded Jeans''.\n\nKari Peitsamo is known for his vast productivity; for example, as many as six albums of his came out during the years 1993 and 1994. However, during the later years Peitsamo's musical activities have receded, and he has worked, among other things, as a grave digger and as a candidate for the [[Communist Party of Finland (1997)|Communist Party of Finland]] in the [[2003 Finnish parliamentary election|2003]], [[2007 Finnish parliamentary election|2007]] and [[2011 Finnish parliamentary election|2011]] parliamentary elections, as well as the municipal elections and elections for the European parliament in [[2004 European Parliament election in Finland|2004]] and [[2009 European Parliament election in Finland|2009]].\n\nMany of Peitsamo's most famous songs are short rock songs with somewhat peculiar lyrics. His debut album contains a song called \"Uskon Beatleksiin\" (I Believe in [[the Beatles]]) in which the singer is rejected by his girlfriend but he is not desperate because he believes that some day The Beatles will descend from the heaven and bring peace to the world. The title track of the debut album is about jazz music and it declares that the deepest nature of jazz is unknown. In addition to his typical absurdism and oddities, Peitsamo has also written political songs.\n\nIn 2013 Peitsamo started studying [[theology]] in the [[University of Helsinki]].\n\n== Discography ==\n===Studio albums===\n* [[Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli]]: ''[[Jatsin syvin olemus]]'' (1977)\n* Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli: ''[[Vedest\u00e4 nousee kasvi]]'' (1978)\n* Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli: ''[[Kari Kolmas]]'' (1978)\n* Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli: ''[[Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli (album)|Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[P\u00f6lypilleri]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Levylaulaja]]'' (1980)\n* Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli: ''[[Greatest Hits (Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli)|Greatest Hits]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Gulliverin retket (album)|Gulliverin retket]]'' (1981)\n* Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli: ''[[Vallankumous (album)|Vallankumous]]'' (1981)\n* [[Kari Peitsamo Revival]]: ''[[Jokivarren jyt\u00e4orkesteri]]'' (1982)\n* Kari Peitsamo Revival: ''[[Pieni suuri show]]'' (1983)\n* Kari Peitsamo Revival: ''[[Rokkiletti]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[\u00c4l\u00e4 koskaan laula kantria]]'' (1985)\n* [[Kari Peitsamon Skootteri]]: ''[[Kari Peitsamon Skootteri (album)|Kari Peitsamon Skootteri]]'' (1985)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Amat\u00f6\u00f6rirakastaja]]'' (1986)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[The 10th Anniversary Album]]'' (1987)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Vedest\u00e4 nousee hai]]'' (1988)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[H\u00e4meen nopein]]'' (1988)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Rankat ankat (album)|Rankat ankat]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[Kadonnutta aikaa etsim\u00e4ss\u00e4 (album)|Kadonnutta aikaa etsim\u00e4ss\u00e4]]'' (1989)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Hellsinkin']]'' (1990)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Groovers' Paradise]]'' (1990)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Plays Wigwam]]'' (1991)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Sergeant Rocker Rides Again]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[The Fool (Kari Peitsamo album)|The Fool]]'' (1992)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Natural Boogie (Kari Peitsamon album)|Natural Boogie]]'' (1993)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Vi skall spela rock]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[I'm Down (Kari Peitsamo album)|I'm Down]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[How I Won the War (Kari Peitsamo album)|How I Won the War]]'' (1994)\n* Kari Peitsamo & [[Aku Ankkuli]]: ''[[Dr. Rockfinger & Outlaws Boys]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[Before They Make Me Run (Kari Peitsamo album)|Before They Make Me Run]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Good Vibrations \u2013 the 20th Anniversary Album]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Peace, Love & Understanding \u2013 the Xmas Album]]'' (1997)\n* [[Kari Peitsamo & Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t]]: ''[[Bubblegum Warriors in Faded Jeans]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Hoodoo (Kari Peitsamon album)|Hoodoo]]'' (1998)\n* Kari Peitsamo & Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t: ''[[Brono Starr's Rock'n'roll Roadside Attraction]]'' (1999)\n* [[Retkibanaani]] feat.

Later on, Peitsamo's acoustic guitar was switched to an electric one, and he was joined by the band Ankkuli, with its other members Harri Siirtola (bass) and Yrj\u00f6 Majamaa (drums).\n\nAfter this Peitsamo, who had recorded for [[Love Records]], moved to [[Poko Records]], and changed his band to Kari Peitsamo Revival, which was influenced by [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] and [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] (Peitsamo also translated songs by both bands into Finnish). After the Revival period, Peitsamo played rock with his new band Kari Peitsamon Skootteri between 1985-1994. Another ensemble of his, Kari Peitsamo & Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t, also released one album in 1998, called ''Bubblegum Warriors In Faded Jeans''.\n\nKari Peitsamo is known for his vast productivity; for example, as many as six albums of his came out during the years 1993 and 1994. However, during the later years Peitsamo's musical activities have receded, and he has worked, among other things, as a grave digger and as a candidate for the [[Communist Party of Finland (1997)|Communist Party of Finland]] in the [[2003 Finnish parliamentary election|2003]], [[2007 Finnish parliamentary election|2007]] and [[2011 Finnish parliamentary election|2011]] parliamentary elections, as well as the municipal elections and elections for the European parliament in [[2004 European Parliament election in Finland|2004]] and [[2009 European Parliament election in Finland|2009]].\n\nMany of Peitsamo's most famous songs are short rock songs with somewhat peculiar lyrics. His debut album contains a song called \"Uskon Beatleksiin\" (I Believe in [[the Beatles]]) in which the singer is rejected by his girlfriend but he is not desperate because he believes that some day The Beatles will descend from the heaven and bring peace to the world. The title track of the debut album is about jazz music and it declares that the deepest nature of jazz is unknown. In addition to his typical absurdism and oddities, Peitsamo has also written political songs.\n\nIn 2013 Peitsamo started studying [[theology]] in the [[University of Helsinki]].\n\n== Discography ==\n===Studio albums===\n* [[Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli]]: ''[[Jatsin syvin olemus]]'' (1977)\n* Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli: ''[[Vedest\u00e4 nousee kasvi]]'' (1978)\n* Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli: ''[[Kari Kolmas]]'' (1978)\n* Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli: ''[[Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli (album)|Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[P\u00f6lypilleri]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Levylaulaja]]'' (1980)\n* Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli: ''[[Greatest Hits (Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli)|Greatest Hits]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Gulliverin retket (album)|Gulliverin retket]]'' (1981)\n* Kari Peitsamo ja Ankkuli: ''[[Vallankumous (album)|Vallankumous]]'' (1981)\n* [[Kari Peitsamo Revival]]: ''[[Jokivarren jyt\u00e4orkesteri]]'' (1982)\n* Kari Peitsamo Revival: ''[[Pieni suuri show]]'' (1983)\n* Kari Peitsamo Revival: ''[[Rokkiletti]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[\u00c4l\u00e4 koskaan laula kantria]]'' (1985)\n* [[Kari Peitsamon Skootteri]]: ''[[Kari Peitsamon Skootteri (album)|Kari Peitsamon Skootteri]]'' (1985)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Amat\u00f6\u00f6rirakastaja]]'' (1986)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[The 10th Anniversary Album]]'' (1987)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Vedest\u00e4 nousee hai]]'' (1988)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[H\u00e4meen nopein]]'' (1988)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Rankat ankat (album)|Rankat ankat]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[Kadonnutta aikaa etsim\u00e4ss\u00e4 (album)|Kadonnutta aikaa etsim\u00e4ss\u00e4]]'' (1989)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Hellsinkin']]'' (1990)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Groovers' Paradise]]'' (1990)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Plays Wigwam]]'' (1991)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Sergeant Rocker Rides Again]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[The Fool (Kari Peitsamo album)|The Fool]]'' (1992)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Natural Boogie (Kari Peitsamon album)|Natural Boogie]]'' (1993)\n* Kari Peitsamon Skootteri: ''[[Vi skall spela rock]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[I'm Down (Kari Peitsamo album)|I'm Down]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[How I Won the War (Kari Peitsamo album)|How I Won the War]]'' (1994)\n* Kari Peitsamo & [[Aku Ankkuli]]: ''[[Dr. Rockfinger & Outlaws Boys]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[Before They Make Me Run (Kari Peitsamo album)|Before They Make Me Run]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Good Vibrations \u2013 the 20th Anniversary Album]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Peace, Love & Understanding \u2013 the Xmas Album]]'' (1997)\n* [[Kari Peitsamo & Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t]]: ''[[Bubblegum Warriors in Faded Jeans]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Hoodoo (Kari Peitsamon album)|Hoodoo]]'' (1998)\n* Kari Peitsamo & Hirtt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00f6m\u00e4t: ''[[Brono Starr's Rock'n'roll Roadside Attraction]]'' (1999)\n* [[Retkibanaani]] feat.

Auxins play a cardinal role in coordination of many growth and behavioral processes in plant life cycles and are essential for plant body development. The Dutch biologist [[Frits Warmolt Went]] first described auxins and their role in plant growth in the 1920s.<ref>\n[https://archive.is/20010724034517/http://bob.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/fwent.html Frits Warmolt Went]\n</ref>\n[[Kenneth V. Thimann]] (1904-1997) became the first to isolate one of these [[phytohormones]] and to determine its chemical structure as [[indole-3-acetic acid]] (IAA). Went and Thimann co-authored a book on plant hormones, ''Phytohormones'', in 1937.\n\n==Overview==\nAuxins were the first of the major [[plant hormone]]s to be discovered. They derive their name from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word \u03b1\u03c5\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''auxein'' \u2013 \"to grow/increase\"). The concentration in each position is crucial developmental information, so it is subject to tight regulation through both metabolism and transport. The result is the auxin creates \"patterns\" of auxin concentration maxima and minima in the plant body, which in turn guide further development of respective cells, and ultimately of the plant as a whole.\n\nThe (dynamic and environment responsive) [[Pattern formation#Biology|pattern]] of auxin distribution within the plant is a key factor for plant growth, its reaction to its environment, and specifically for development of plant organs<ref name=\"shaping\"/><ref name=\"Benkova 2003\"/> (such as [[leaf|leaves]] or [[flower]]s). It is achieved through very complex and well-coordinated [[active transport|active]] transport of auxin molecules from cell to cell throughout the plant body \u2014 by the so-called [[polar auxin transport]].<ref name=\"shaping\"/> Thus, a plant can (as a whole) react to external conditions and adjust to them, without requiring a [[nervous system]]. Auxins typically act in concert with, or in opposition to, other plant hormones. For example, the ratio of auxin to [[cytokinin]] in certain plant tissues determines initiation of root versus shoot buds.\n\nOn the molecular level, all auxins are compounds with an aromatic ring and a [[carboxylic acid]] group.<ref name=\"Taiz\"/> The most important member of the auxin family is [[indole-3-acetic acid]] (IAA),<ref name=Simon>{{cite journal |last1=Simon |first1= L. |first2= J. |last2= Bousquet |first3= R.C. |last3= L\u00e9vesque |first4= M. |last4=Lalonde |date=1993 |title=Origin and diversification of endomycorrhizal fungi and coincidence with vascular land plants |journal=Nature |volume=363 |issue= 6424 |pages= 67\u201369 |bibcode=1993Natur.363...67S |doi=10.1038/363067a0 }}</ref> which generates the majority of auxin effects in intact plants, and is the most potent native auxin. And as native auxin, its stability is controlled in many ways in plants, from synthesis, through possible [[Conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugation]] to degradation of its molecules, always according to the requirements of the situation.\n\n* Five naturally occurring (endogenous) auxins in plants include indole-3-acetic acid, [[4-Chloroindole-3-acetic acid|4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid]], [[phenylacetic acid]], [[indole-3-butyric acid]], and [[indole-3-propionic acid]].<ref name=\"simon\">{{cite journal| title=Why plants need more than one type of auxin |author1=Simon, S |author2=Petr\u00e1\u0161ek, P | journal=Plant Science | year=2011 | volume=180 | issue=3 | pages=454\u2013460 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.12.007 | pmid=21421392|url=https://zenodo.org/record/894396 }}<!--https://zenodo.org/record/894396--></ref><ref name=\"Auxin 2011 review\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ludwig-M\u00fcller J | title = Auxin conjugates: their role for plant development and in the evolution of land plants | journal = J.

Alongside endogenous auxins, scientists and manufacturers have developed many synthetic compounds with auxinic activity.\n* Synthetic auxin analogs include [[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|1-naphthaleneacetic acid]], [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D),<ref name=\"simon\"/> and many others.\n\nSome synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-D and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T), are used also as [[herbicide]]s. Broad-leaf plants ([[dicots]]), such as [[dandelion]]s, are much more susceptible to auxins than narrow-leaf plants ([[monocots]]) such as [[grass]]es and [[cereals|cereal]] crops, so these synthetic auxins are valuable as synthetic herbicides. <!---''See also chapter [[Auxin#Auxinic herbicides|Auxinic herbicides]]''.--->\n\n==Discovery of auxin==\n\n===Charles Darwin===\nIn 1881, [[Charles Darwin]] and his son [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] performed experiments on [[coleoptiles]], the sheaths enclosing young leaves in germinating grass seedlings. The experiment exposed the coleoptile to light from a unidirectional source, and observed that they bend towards the light.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid=23152332 |year=2013 |last1=Hohm|first1=T |last2=Preuten |first2=T|last3=Fankhauser |first3=C |title=Phototropism: Translating light into directional growth |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=47\u201359 |doi=10.3732/ajb.1200299 |journal=American Journal of Botany|url=https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_BFBF5EAD16F0.P001/REF.pdf }}</ref> By covering various parts of the coleoptiles with a light-impermeable opaque cap, the Darwins discovered that light is detected by the coleoptile tip, but that bending occurs in the [[hypocotyl]]. However the seedlings showed no signs of development towards light if the tip was covered with an opaque cap, or if the tip was removed. The Darwins concluded that the tip of the coleoptile was responsible for sensing light, and proposed that a messenger is transmitted in a downward direction from the tip of the coleoptile, causing it to bend.<ref name=\"Whippo\">{{cite journal |pmid=16670442 |year=2006 |last1=Whippo |first1=CW |last2=Hangarter |first2=RP |title=Phototropism: Bending towards enlightenment |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=1110\u20139 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.039669 |pmc=1456868 |journal=The Plant Cell}}</ref>\n\n===Peter Boysen-Jensen===\nIn 1913, Danish scientist Peter Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that the signal was not transfixed but mobile. He separated the tip from the remainder of the coleoptile by a cube of gelatine which prevented cellular contact but allowed chemicals to pass through. The seedlings responded normally bending towards the light. However, when the tip was separated by an impermeable substance, there was no curvature of the stem.<ref name=\"bare_url\">Mendipweb [http://www.plant-hormones.info/auxins.htm Nature of auxin]</ref>\n\n===Frits Went===\n{{main|Frits Warmolt Went}}\n\nIn 1928, the Dutch botanist [[Frits Warmolt Went]] showed that a chemical messenger diffuses from coleoptile tips. Went's experiment identified how a growth promoting chemical causes a coleoptile to grow towards the light. Went cut the tips of the coleoptiles and placed them in the dark, putting a few tips on agar blocks that he predicted would absorb the growth-promoting chemical. On control coleoptiles, he placed a block that lacked the chemical. On others, he placed blocks containing the chemical, either centered on top of the coleoptile to distribute the chemical evenly or offset to increase the concentration on one side.<ref name=\"Whippo\" />\n\nWhen the growth-promoting chemical was distributed evenly the coleoptile grew straight. If the chemical was distributed unevenly, the coleoptile curved away from the side with the cube, as if growing towards the light, even though it was grown in the dark. Went later proposed that the messenger substance is a growth-promoting hormone, which he named auxin, that becomes asymmetrically distributed in the bending region. Went concluded that auxin is at a higher concentration on the shaded side, promoting cell elongation, which results in coleoptiles bending towards the light.<ref name=\"bare_url\" />\n\n==Hormonal activity==\nAuxins help \ndevelopment at all levels in plants, from the [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] level, through organs, and ultimately to the whole plant.\n\n=== Molecular mechanisms ===\nWhen a plant cell comes into contact with auxin, it causes dramatic changes in [[gene expression]], with many genes up- or down-regulated. The precise mechanisms by which this occurs are still an area of active research, but there is now a general consensus on at least two auxin signalling pathways.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Leyser|first=Ottoline|date=2018-01-01|title=Auxin Signaling|journal=Plant Physiology|language=en|volume=176|issue=1|pages=465\u2013479|doi=10.1104/pp.17.00765|issn=0032-0889|pmid=28818861|pmc=5761761}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Enders|first=Tara A.|last2=Strader|first2=Lucia C.|date=February 2015|title=Auxin Activity: Past, present, and Future|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=102|issue=2|pages=180\u2013196|doi=10.3732/ajb.1400285|issn=0002-9122|pmc=4854432|pmid=25667071}}</ref>\n\n====Perception ====\nThe most well-characterized auxin receptors are the TIR1/ AFB family of [[F-box protein]]s. F-box proteins target other proteins for degradation via the [[Ubiquitin|ubiquitin degradation pathway]]. When TIR1/ AFB proteins bind to auxin, the auxin acts as a 'molecular glue' that allows these proteins to then bind to their targets (see below).\n\nAnother auxin-binding protein, ABP1 is now often regarded as an auxin receptor (at the [[apoplast]]), but it is generally considered to have a much more minor role than the TIR1/AFB signaling pathway, and much less is known about ABP1 signaling.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Aux/IAA and ARF signalling modules ====\n[[File: Auxin signal cascade.jpg|thumb|''' The auxin signal cascade:''' In the absence of auxin, Aux/IAA bind to and suppress the transcriptional activity of ARFs. When auxin is present it forms a 'molecular glue' between TIR1 and Aux/IAAs, which leads to the degradation of these repressors. ARFs are then free to bind to DNA and to cause changes in transcription.]]\nAuxin response factors (ARFs) are a large group of [[transcription factor]]s that act in auxin signaling. In the absence of auxin, ARFs bind to a class of repressors known as Aux/IAAs. Aux/IAA suppress the ability of ARFs to enhance gene transcription. Additionally, the binding of Aux/IAA to ARFs brings Aux/IAA into contact with the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] of auxin-regulated genes. When at these promoters, Aux/IAA repress the expression of these genes through recruiting other factors to make modifications to the [[DNA]] structure.\n\nThe binding of auxin to TIR1/AFBs allows them to bind to Aux/IAAs. When bound by TIR1/AFBs, Aux/IAAs are marked for degradation. The degradation of Aux/IAA frees ARF proteins, which are then able to activate or repress genes at whose promoters they are bound.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe large number of Aux/IAA and ARF binding pairs possible, and their different distributions between cell types and across developmental age are thought to account for the astonishingly diverse responses that auxin produces.\n\nIn June 2018 it was demonstrated that plant tissues can respond to auxin in a TIR1-dependent manner extremely quickly (probably too quickly to be explained by changes in gene expression). This has led some scientists to suggest that there is an as yet unidentified TIR1-dependent auxin-signalling pathway that differs from the well-known transcriptional response.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fendrych|first=Maty\u00e1\u0161|last2=Akhmanova|first2=Maria|last3=Merrin|first3=Jack|last4=Glanc|first4=Matou\u0161|last5=Hagihara|first5=Shinya|last6=Takahashi|first6=Koji|last7=Uchida|first7=Naoyuki|last8=Torii|first8=Keiko U.|last9=Friml|first9=Ji\u0159\u00ed|date=2018-06-25|title=Rapid and reversible root growth inhibition by TIR1 auxin signalling|journal=Nature Plants|volume=4|issue=7|pages=453\u2013459|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41477-018-0190-1|pmid=29942048|pmc=6104345|issn=2055-0278}}</ref>\n\n=== On a cellular level ===\nOn the cellular level, auxin is essential for [[cell growth]], affecting both [[cell division]] and cellular expansion. Auxin concentration level, together with other local factors, contributes to [[cell differentiation]] and specification of the cell fate.\n\nDepending on the specific tissue, auxin may promote axial elongation (as in shoots), lateral expansion (as in root swelling), or isodiametric expansion (as in fruit growth). In some cases (coleoptile growth), auxin-promoted cellular expansion occurs in the absence of cell division. In other cases, auxin-promoted cell division and cell expansion may be closely sequenced within the same tissue (root initiation, fruit growth). In a living plant, auxins and other plant hormones nearly always appear to interact to determine patterns of plant development.\n\n===Organ patterns===\nGrowth and division of plant cells together result in the growth of [[Biological tissue|tissue]], and specific tissue growth contributes to the development of plant [[organ (anatomy)#Plant organs|organ]]s.\n\nGrowth of cells contributes to the plant's size, unevenly localized growth produces bending, turning and directionalization of organs- for example, stems turning toward light sources ([[phototropism]]), roots growing in response to gravity ([[gravitropism]]), and other [[tropism]]s originated because cells on one side grow faster than the cells on the other side of the organ. So, precise control of auxin distribution between different cells has paramount importance to the resulting form of plant growth and organization.\n\n====Auxin transport and the uneven distribution of auxin====\n{{further|polar auxin transport}}\n\nTo cause growth in the required domains, auxins must of necessity be active preferentially in them. Local auxin maxima can be formed by active biosynthesis in certain cells of tissues, for example via tryptophan-dependent pathways,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mashiguchi|first=Kiyoshi|date=2011|title=The main auxin biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis|journal=PNAS|doi=10.1073/pnas.1108434108|pmid=22025724|volume=108|issue=45|pmc=3215075|pages=18512\u20137|bibcode=2011PNAS..10818512M}}</ref> but auxins are not synthesized in all cells (even if cells retain the potential ability to do so, only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated in them). For that purpose, auxins have to be not only translocated toward those sites where they are needed but also they must have an established mechanism to detect those sites. Translocation is driven throughout the plant body, primarily from [[meristem|peaks of shoots]] to peaks of roots (from up to down).\n\nFor long distances, relocation occurs via the stream of fluid in [[phloem]] vessels, but, for short-distance transport, a unique system of coordinated polar transport directly from cell to cell is exploited. This short-distance, active transport exhibits some [[morphogen]]etic properties.\n\nThis process, [[polar auxin transport]], is directional, very strictly regulated, and based in uneven distribution of auxin efflux carriers on the plasma membrane, which send auxins in the proper direction.

Auxin employment begins in the embryo of the plant, where the directional distribution of auxin ushers in subsequent growth and development of primary growth poles, then forms buds of future organs. Next, it helps to coordinate proper development of the arising organs, such as roots, cotyledons, and leaves and mediates long-distance signals between them, contributing so to the overall architecture of the plant.<ref name=\"shaping\"/> Throughout the plant's life, auxin helps the plant maintain the polarity of growth,<ref name=\"shaping\"/> and actually \"recognize\" where it has its branches (or any organ) connected.\n\nAn important principle of plant organization based upon auxin distribution is [[apical dominance]], which means the auxin produced by the apical bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior lateral bud growth, which would otherwise compete with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressively acting auxin allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is actually quite complex because auxin transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as [[strigolactone]]s or [[cytokinins]]) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in [[pruning]] by horticulturists.\n\nFinally, the sum of auxin arriving from stems to roots influences the degree of root growth. If shoot tips are removed, the plant does not react just by the outgrowth of lateral buds \u2014 which are supposed to replace to original lead. It also follows that smaller amount of auxin arriving at the roots results in slower growth of roots and the nutrients are subsequently in higher degree invested in the upper part of the plant, which hence starts to grow faster.\n<!---------- Is this section necessary?\n==Locations==\n; Biosynthesis\n\nAuxins are not synthesized everywhere, but each cell retains the potential ability to do so, and only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated.

The uneven distribution of auxin, due to environmental cues, such as unidirectional light or gravity force, results in uneven plant tissue growth, and generally, auxin governs the form and shape of the plant body, direction and strength of growth of all organs, and their mutual interaction.<ref name=\"Benkova 2003\"/>\n\nAuxin stimulates cell elongation by stimulating wall-loosening factors, such as [[elastin]]s, to loosen [[cell wall]]s. The effect is stronger if [[gibberellins]] are also present. Auxin also stimulates cell division if [[cytokinins]] are present. When auxin and cytokinin are applied to [[callus]], rooting can be generated if the auxin concentration is higher than cytokinin concentration. [[Xylem]] tissues can be generated when the auxin concentration is equal to the cytokinins.\n\nAuxin also induces sugar and mineral accumulation at the site of application.\n\n===Wound response===\nAuxin induces the formation and organization of [[phloem]] and [[xylem]].

As more native auxin is transported down the stem to the roots, the overall development of the roots is stimulated. If the source of auxin is removed, such as by trimming the tips of stems, the roots are less stimulated accordingly, and growth of stem is supported instead.\n\nIn horticulture, auxins, especially [[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|NAA]] and [[Indole-3-butyric acid|IBA]], are commonly applied to stimulate root initiation when rooting [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of plants. However, high concentrations of auxin inhibit root elongation and instead enhance adventitious root formation.  Removal of the root tip can lead to inhibition of secondary root formation.\n\n===Apical dominance===\nAuxin induces shoot [[apical dominance]]; the [[axillary bud]]s are inhibited by auxin, as a high concentration of auxin directly stimulates [[ethylene]] synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of apical dominance. When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.<ref>Ji\u0159\u00ed Friml Lab (2012).

Many of them had been found to have economical potential for man-controlled growth and development of plants in agronomy. Synthetic auxins include the following compounds:\n\n<center><gallery caption=\"Gallery of synthetic auxins\">\nImage:2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid structure.svg|[[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D); active herbicide and main auxin in laboratory use\nImage:Kwas naftylooctowy.svg|[[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|\u03b1-Naphthalene acetic acid]] (\u03b1-NAA); often part of commercial rooting powders\nImage:Dicamba.png|[[2-Methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid]] (dicamba); active herbicide\nImage:Picloram.svg|[[4-Amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid]] (tordon or picloram); active herbicide\nFile:2,4,5-T.svg|[[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) \n</gallery></center>\nAuxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to [[dicot]]s and less so to [[monocot]]s. Because of this property, [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] auxin herbicides, including [[2,4-D]] and [[2,4,5-T]], have been developed and used for [[weed]] control.\n\nHowever, some exogenously synthesized auxins, especially [[1-naphthaleneacetic acid]] (NAA) and [[indole-3-butyric acid]] (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of plants or for different agricultural purposes such as the prevention of fruit drop in [[orchard]]s.\n\nUsed in high doses, auxin stimulates the production of [[ethylene]]. Excess ethylene (also native plant hormone) can inhibit elongation growth, cause [[leaf|leaves]] to fall ([[abscission]]), and even kill the plant. Some synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-D and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) were marketed also as [[herbicide]]s. [[Dicots]], such as [[dandelion]]s, are much more susceptible to auxins than [[monocots]], such as [[grass]]es and [[cereals|cereal]] crops. So, these synthetic auxins are valuable as synthetic herbicides. 2,4-D was the first widely used herbicide, and it is still so.<ref>[http://www.24d.org/ The Industry Task Force II on 2,4-D Research Data]</ref> [[2,4-D]] was first commercialized by the [[Sherwin-Williams]] company and saw use in the late 1940s. It is easy and inexpensive to manufacture.\n\n\t3,5,6-TPA while known as an herbicide, has also been shown to increase the size of fruit in plants. At increased concentrations, the hormone can be lethal. Dosing down to the correct concentration has been shown to alter photosynthetic pathways. This hindrance to the plant causes a response that increases carbohydrate production leading to bigger fruiting bodies.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00344-011-9230-z | volume=31 | issue=2 | title=Synthetic Auxin 3,5,6-TPA Provokes Citrus clementina (Hort. ex Tan) Fruitlet Abscission by Reducing Photosynthate Availability | year=2012 | journal=Journal of Plant Growth Regulation | pages=186\u2013194 | last1 = Mesejo | first1 = Carlos | last2 = Rosito | first2 = Salvatore | last3 = Reig | first3 = Carmina | last4 = Mart\u00ednez-Fuentes | first4 = Amparo | last5 = Agust\u00ed | first5 = Manuel}}</ref>\n\n; Herbicide manufacture\nThe [[defoliant]] [[Agent Orange]], used extensively by British forces in the [[Malayan Emergency]] and American forces in the [[Vietnam War]], was a mix of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.

Auxins play a cardinal role in coordination of many growth and behavioral processes in plant life cycles and are essential for plant body development. The Dutch biologist [[Frits Warmolt Went]] first described auxins and their role in plant growth in the 1920s.<ref>\n[https://archive.is/20010724034517/http://bob.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/fwent.html Frits Warmolt Went]\n</ref>\n[[Kenneth V.

Went and Thimann co-authored a book on plant hormones, ''Phytohormones'', in 1937.\n\n==Overview==\nAuxins were the first of the major [[plant hormone]]s to be discovered. They derive their name from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word \u03b1\u03c5\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''auxein'' \u2013 \"to grow/increase\"). Auxin is present in all parts of a plant, although in very different concentrations. The concentration in each position is crucial developmental information, so it is subject to tight regulation through both metabolism and transport. The result is the auxin creates \"patterns\" of auxin concentration maxima and minima in the plant body, which in turn guide further development of respective cells, and ultimately of the plant as a whole.\n\nThe (dynamic and environment responsive) [[Pattern formation#Biology|pattern]] of auxin distribution within the plant is a key factor for plant growth, its reaction to its environment, and specifically for development of plant organs<ref name=\"shaping\"/><ref name=\"Benkova 2003\"/> (such as [[leaf|leaves]] or [[flower]]s). It is achieved through very complex and well-coordinated [[active transport|active]] transport of auxin molecules from cell to cell throughout the plant body \u2014 by the so-called [[polar auxin transport]].<ref name=\"shaping\"/> Thus, a plant can (as a whole) react to external conditions and adjust to them, without requiring a [[nervous system]]. Auxins typically act in concert with, or in opposition to, other plant hormones. For example, the ratio of auxin to [[cytokinin]] in certain plant tissues determines initiation of root versus shoot buds.\n\nOn the molecular level, all auxins are compounds with an aromatic ring and a [[carboxylic acid]] group.<ref name=\"Taiz\"/> The most important member of the auxin family is [[indole-3-acetic acid]] (IAA),<ref name=Simon>{{cite journal |last1=Simon |first1= L. |first2= J. |last2= Bousquet |first3= R.C. |last3= L\u00e9vesque |first4= M. |last4=Lalonde |date=1993 |title=Origin and diversification of endomycorrhizal fungi and coincidence with vascular land plants |journal=Nature |volume=363 |issue= 6424 |pages= 67\u201369 |bibcode=1993Natur.363...67S |doi=10.1038/363067a0 }}</ref> which generates the majority of auxin effects in intact plants, and is the most potent native auxin.

However the seedlings showed no signs of development towards light if the tip was covered with an opaque cap, or if the tip was removed. The Darwins concluded that the tip of the coleoptile was responsible for sensing light, and proposed that a messenger is transmitted in a downward direction from the tip of the coleoptile, causing it to bend.<ref name=\"Whippo\">{{cite journal |pmid=16670442 |year=2006 |last1=Whippo |first1=CW |last2=Hangarter |first2=RP |title=Phototropism: Bending towards enlightenment |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=1110\u20139 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.039669 |pmc=1456868 |journal=The Plant Cell}}</ref>\n\n===Peter Boysen-Jensen===\nIn 1913, Danish scientist Peter Boysen-Jensen demonstrated that the signal was not transfixed but mobile.

The seedlings responded normally bending towards the light. However, when the tip was separated by an impermeable substance, there was no curvature of the stem.<ref name=\"bare_url\">Mendipweb [http://www.plant-hormones.info/auxins.htm Nature of auxin]</ref>\n\n===Frits Went===\n{{main|Frits Warmolt Went}}\n\nIn 1928, the Dutch botanist [[Frits Warmolt Went]] showed that a chemical messenger diffuses from coleoptile tips. Went's experiment identified how a growth promoting chemical causes a coleoptile to grow towards the light. Went cut the tips of the coleoptiles and placed them in the dark, putting a few tips on agar blocks that he predicted would absorb the growth-promoting chemical. On control coleoptiles, he placed a block that lacked the chemical. On others, he placed blocks containing the chemical, either centered on top of the coleoptile to distribute the chemical evenly or offset to increase the concentration on one side.<ref name=\"Whippo\" />\n\nWhen the growth-promoting chemical was distributed evenly the coleoptile grew straight. If the chemical was distributed unevenly, the coleoptile curved away from the side with the cube, as if growing towards the light, even though it was grown in the dark. Went later proposed that the messenger substance is a growth-promoting hormone, which he named auxin, that becomes asymmetrically distributed in the bending region. Went concluded that auxin is at a higher concentration on the shaded side, promoting cell elongation, which results in coleoptiles bending towards the light.<ref name=\"bare_url\" />\n\n==Hormonal activity==\nAuxins help \ndevelopment at all levels in plants, from the [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] level, through organs, and ultimately to the whole plant.\n\n=== Molecular mechanisms ===\nWhen a plant cell comes into contact with auxin, it causes dramatic changes in [[gene expression]], with many genes up- or down-regulated.

F-box proteins target other proteins for degradation via the [[Ubiquitin|ubiquitin degradation pathway]]. When TIR1/ AFB proteins bind to auxin, the auxin acts as a 'molecular glue' that allows these proteins to then bind to their targets (see below).\n\nAnother auxin-binding protein, ABP1 is now often regarded as an auxin receptor (at the [[apoplast]]), but it is generally considered to have a much more minor role than the TIR1/AFB signaling pathway, and much less is known about ABP1 signaling.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Aux/IAA and ARF signalling modules ====\n[[File: Auxin signal cascade.jpg|thumb|''' The auxin signal cascade:''' In the absence of auxin, Aux/IAA bind to and suppress the transcriptional activity of ARFs. When auxin is present it forms a 'molecular glue' between TIR1 and Aux/IAAs, which leads to the degradation of these repressors. ARFs are then free to bind to DNA and to cause changes in transcription.]]\nAuxin response factors (ARFs) are a large group of [[transcription factor]]s that act in auxin signaling. In the absence of auxin, ARFs bind to a class of repressors known as Aux/IAAs. Aux/IAA suppress the ability of ARFs to enhance gene transcription. Additionally, the binding of Aux/IAA to ARFs brings Aux/IAA into contact with the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] of auxin-regulated genes. When at these promoters, Aux/IAA repress the expression of these genes through recruiting other factors to make modifications to the [[DNA]] structure.\n\nThe binding of auxin to TIR1/AFBs allows them to bind to Aux/IAAs. When bound by TIR1/AFBs, Aux/IAAs are marked for degradation. The degradation of Aux/IAA frees ARF proteins, which are then able to activate or repress genes at whose promoters they are bound.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe large number of Aux/IAA and ARF binding pairs possible, and their different distributions between cell types and across developmental age are thought to account for the astonishingly diverse responses that auxin produces.\n\nIn June 2018 it was demonstrated that plant tissues can respond to auxin in a TIR1-dependent manner extremely quickly (probably too quickly to be explained by changes in gene expression). This has led some scientists to suggest that there is an as yet unidentified TIR1-dependent auxin-signalling pathway that differs from the well-known transcriptional response.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fendrych|first=Maty\u00e1\u0161|last2=Akhmanova|first2=Maria|last3=Merrin|first3=Jack|last4=Glanc|first4=Matou\u0161|last5=Hagihara|first5=Shinya|last6=Takahashi|first6=Koji|last7=Uchida|first7=Naoyuki|last8=Torii|first8=Keiko U.|last9=Friml|first9=Ji\u0159\u00ed|date=2018-06-25|title=Rapid and reversible root growth inhibition by TIR1 auxin signalling|journal=Nature Plants|volume=4|issue=7|pages=453\u2013459|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41477-018-0190-1|pmid=29942048|pmc=6104345|issn=2055-0278}}</ref>\n\n=== On a cellular level ===\nOn the cellular level, auxin is essential for [[cell growth]], affecting both [[cell division]] and cellular expansion. Auxin concentration level, together with other local factors, contributes to [[cell differentiation]] and specification of the cell fate.\n\nDepending on the specific tissue, auxin may promote axial elongation (as in shoots), lateral expansion (as in root swelling), or isodiametric expansion (as in fruit growth). In some cases (coleoptile growth), auxin-promoted cellular expansion occurs in the absence of cell division. In other cases, auxin-promoted cell division and cell expansion may be closely sequenced within the same tissue (root initiation, fruit growth). In a living plant, auxins and other plant hormones nearly always appear to interact to determine patterns of plant development.\n\n===Organ patterns===\nGrowth and division of plant cells together result in the growth of [[Biological tissue|tissue]], and specific tissue growth contributes to the development of plant [[organ (anatomy)#Plant organs|organ]]s.\n\nGrowth of cells contributes to the plant's size, unevenly localized growth produces bending, turning and directionalization of organs- for example, stems turning toward light sources ([[phototropism]]), roots growing in response to gravity ([[gravitropism]]), and other [[tropism]]s originated because cells on one side grow faster than the cells on the other side of the organ. So, precise control of auxin distribution between different cells has paramount importance to the resulting form of plant growth and organization.\n\n====Auxin transport and the uneven distribution of auxin====\n{{further|polar auxin transport}}\n\nTo cause growth in the required domains, auxins must of necessity be active preferentially in them. Local auxin maxima can be formed by active biosynthesis in certain cells of tissues, for example via tryptophan-dependent pathways,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mashiguchi|first=Kiyoshi|date=2011|title=The main auxin biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis|journal=PNAS|doi=10.1073/pnas.1108434108|pmid=22025724|volume=108|issue=45|pmc=3215075|pages=18512\u20137|bibcode=2011PNAS..10818512M}}</ref> but auxins are not synthesized in all cells (even if cells retain the potential ability to do so, only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated in them). For that purpose, auxins have to be not only translocated toward those sites where they are needed but also they must have an established mechanism to detect those sites. Translocation is driven throughout the plant body, primarily from [[meristem|peaks of shoots]] to peaks of roots (from up to down).\n\nFor long distances, relocation occurs via the stream of fluid in [[phloem]] vessels, but, for short-distance transport, a unique system of coordinated polar transport directly from cell to cell is exploited. This short-distance, active transport exhibits some [[morphogen]]etic properties.\n\nThis process, [[polar auxin transport]], is directional, very strictly regulated, and based in uneven distribution of auxin efflux carriers on the plasma membrane, which send auxins in the proper direction.

Auxin employment begins in the embryo of the plant, where the directional distribution of auxin ushers in subsequent growth and development of primary growth poles, then forms buds of future organs. Next, it helps to coordinate proper development of the arising organs, such as roots, cotyledons, and leaves and mediates long-distance signals between them, contributing so to the overall architecture of the plant.<ref name=\"shaping\"/> Throughout the plant's life, auxin helps the plant maintain the polarity of growth,<ref name=\"shaping\"/> and actually \"recognize\" where it has its branches (or any organ) connected.\n\nAn important principle of plant organization based upon auxin distribution is [[apical dominance]], which means the auxin produced by the apical bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior lateral bud growth, which would otherwise compete with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressively acting auxin allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is actually quite complex because auxin transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as [[strigolactone]]s or [[cytokinins]]) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in [[pruning]] by horticulturists.\n\nFinally, the sum of auxin arriving from stems to roots influences the degree of root growth. If shoot tips are removed, the plant does not react just by the outgrowth of lateral buds \u2014 which are supposed to replace to original lead. It also follows that smaller amount of auxin arriving at the roots results in slower growth of roots and the nutrients are subsequently in higher degree invested in the upper part of the plant, which hence starts to grow faster.\n<!---------- Is this section necessary?\n==Locations==\n; Biosynthesis\n\nAuxins are not synthesized everywhere, but each cell retains the potential ability to do so, and only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated.

When auxin and cytokinin are applied to [[callus]], rooting can be generated if the auxin concentration is higher than cytokinin concentration. [[Xylem]] tissues can be generated when the auxin concentration is equal to the cytokinins.\n\nAuxin also induces sugar and mineral accumulation at the site of application.\n\n===Wound response===\nAuxin induces the formation and organization of [[phloem]] and [[xylem]].

As more native auxin is transported down the stem to the roots, the overall development of the roots is stimulated. If the source of auxin is removed, such as by trimming the tips of stems, the roots are less stimulated accordingly, and growth of stem is supported instead.\n\nIn horticulture, auxins, especially [[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|NAA]] and [[Indole-3-butyric acid|IBA]], are commonly applied to stimulate root initiation when rooting [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of plants. However, high concentrations of auxin inhibit root elongation and instead enhance adventitious root formation.  Removal of the root tip can lead to inhibition of secondary root formation.\n\n===Apical dominance===\nAuxin induces shoot [[apical dominance]]; the [[axillary bud]]s are inhibited by auxin, as a high concentration of auxin directly stimulates [[ethylene]] synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of apical dominance. When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.<ref>Ji\u0159\u00ed Friml Lab (2012).

VIB (the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology). http://www.vib.be/en/news/Pages/That-is-why-plants-grow-towards-the-light!.aspx</ref>\n\n===Fruit growth and development===\nAuxin is required for fruit growth and development and delays fruit [[senescence]]. When seeds are removed from strawberries, fruit growth is stopped; exogenous auxin stimulates the growth in fruits with seeds removed. For fruit with unfertilized seeds, exogenous auxin results in [[parthenocarpy]] (\"virgin-fruit\" growth).\n\nFruits form abnormal morphologies when auxin transport is disturbed.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nemhauser JL, Feldman LJ, Zambryski PC |title=Auxin and ETTIN in ''Arabidopsis'' gynoecium morphogenesis |journal=Development |volume=127 |issue=18 |pages=3877\u201388 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10952886 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10952886}}</ref> In ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' fruits, auxin controls the release of seeds from the fruit (pod). The valve margins are a specialised tissue in pods that regulates when pod will open (dehiscence). Auxin must be removed from the valve margin cells to allow the valve margins to form. This process requires modification of the auxin transporters (PIN proteins).<ref name=\"Sorefan2009\"/>\n\n===Flowering===\nAuxin plays also a minor role in the initiation of flowering and development of reproductive organs. In low concentrations, it can delay the [[senescence]] of flowers. A number of plant mutants have been described that affect flowering and have deficiencies in either auxin synthesis or transport. In maize, one example is [[bif2 barren inflorescence2]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=McSteen |first=P |author2=Malcomber, S|author3=Skirpan, A|author4=Lunde, C|author5=Wu, X|author6=Kellogg, E|author7= Hake, S |title=barren inflorescence2 Encodes a co-ortholog of the PINOID serine/threonine kinase and is required for organogenesis during inflorescence and vegetative development in maize |journal=Plant Physiology |date=June 2007 |volume=144 |issue=2 |pages=1000\u201311 |doi=10.1104/pp.107.098558 |pmid=17449648 |pmc=1914211}}</ref>\n\n===Ethylene biosynthesis===\nIn low concentrations, auxin can inhibit ethylene formation and transport of precursor in plants; however, high concentrations can induce the synthesis of ethylene.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Y.-B.|last2=Yang|first2=S.

Many of them had been found to have economical potential for man-controlled growth and development of plants in agronomy. Synthetic auxins include the following compounds:\n\n<center><gallery caption=\"Gallery of synthetic auxins\">\nImage:2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid structure.svg|[[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D); active herbicide and main auxin in laboratory use\nImage:Kwas naftylooctowy.svg|[[1-Naphthaleneacetic acid|\u03b1-Naphthalene acetic acid]] (\u03b1-NAA); often part of commercial rooting powders\nImage:Dicamba.png|[[2-Methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid]] (dicamba); active herbicide\nImage:Picloram.svg|[[4-Amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid]] (tordon or picloram); active herbicide\nFile:2,4,5-T.svg|[[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) \n</gallery></center>\nAuxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to [[dicot]]s and less so to [[monocot]]s. Because of this property, [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] auxin herbicides, including [[2,4-D]] and [[2,4,5-T]], have been developed and used for [[weed]] control.\n\nHowever, some exogenously synthesized auxins, especially [[1-naphthaleneacetic acid]] (NAA) and [[indole-3-butyric acid]] (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of plants or for different agricultural purposes such as the prevention of fruit drop in [[orchard]]s.\n\nUsed in high doses, auxin stimulates the production of [[ethylene]]. Excess ethylene (also native plant hormone) can inhibit elongation growth, cause [[leaf|leaves]] to fall ([[abscission]]), and even kill the plant. Some synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-D and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) were marketed also as [[herbicide]]s. [[Dicots]], such as [[dandelion]]s, are much more susceptible to auxins than [[monocots]], such as [[grass]]es and [[cereals|cereal]] crops. So, these synthetic auxins are valuable as synthetic herbicides. 2,4-D was the first widely used herbicide, and it is still so.<ref>[http://www.24d.org/ The Industry Task Force II on 2,4-D Research Data]</ref> [[2,4-D]] was first commercialized by the [[Sherwin-Williams]] company and saw use in the late 1940s. It is easy and inexpensive to manufacture.\n\n\t3,5,6-TPA while known as an herbicide, has also been shown to increase the size of fruit in plants. At increased concentrations, the hormone can be lethal. Dosing down to the correct concentration has been shown to alter photosynthetic pathways. This hindrance to the plant causes a response that increases carbohydrate production leading to bigger fruiting bodies.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00344-011-9230-z | volume=31 | issue=2 | title=Synthetic Auxin 3,5,6-TPA Provokes Citrus clementina (Hort. ex Tan) Fruitlet Abscission by Reducing Photosynthate Availability | year=2012 | journal=Journal of Plant Growth Regulation | pages=186\u2013194 | last1 = Mesejo | first1 = Carlos | last2 = Rosito | first2 = Salvatore | last3 = Reig | first3 = Carmina | last4 = Mart\u00ednez-Fuentes | first4 = Amparo | last5 = Agust\u00ed | first5 = Manuel}}</ref>\n\n; Herbicide manufacture\nThe [[defoliant]] [[Agent Orange]], used extensively by British forces in the [[Malayan Emergency]] and American forces in the [[Vietnam War]], was a mix of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. The compound 2,4-D is still in use and is thought to be safe, but 2,4,5-T was more or less banned by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1979. The [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]] is an unavoidable contaminant produced in the manufacture of 2,4,5-T. As a result of the integral dioxin contamination, 2,4,5-T has been implicated in [[leukemia]], [[miscarriage]]s, [[birth defect]]s, [[liver]] damage, and other [[disease]]s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Auxin binding protein]]\n* [[Fusicoccin]]\n* [[Herbicide]]; ''specifically, see the chapter: <sup>[[Herbicide#History|#History]]</sup>''\n** [[Phenoxy herbicide]]\n* [[Pruning fruit trees]]\n* [[Tropism]]\n*[[Witch's broom]]\n*[[Toshio Murashige]]\n*[[Folke K.
