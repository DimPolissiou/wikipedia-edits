He is the youngest player ranked in the top 10 by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) and has a career-high ranking of No. 5 in the world, making him the highest-ranked Greek player in history. Tsitsipas is the reigning champion at the [[2019 ATP Finals|ATP Finals]], and is the youngest winner of the year-end championships in eighteen years. He has won five singles titles and reached ten finals on the ATP Tour.\n\nBorn into a tennis family where his mother was a professional on the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) tour and his father was trained as a tennis coach, Tsitsipas was introduced to the sport at age three and began taking lessons at age six. As a junior, he was ranked No. 1 in the world. He also became the third Greek player, and first Greek male in the Open Era, to win a junior Grand Slam title with a victory in the [[2016 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Boys' Doubles|2016 Wimbledon boys' doubles event]]. Tsitsipas trains at the [[Mouratoglou]] Academy in France since 2015.\n\nTsitsipas won his first ATP match in late 2017 and quickly ascended up the ATP rankings the following year. He reached three tour-level finals in 2018 and won his first title at the [[2018 Stockholm Open|Stockholm Open]]. With his runner-up finish at the [[2018 Rogers Cup|Canadian Open]], he became the youngest player to defeat four top ten opponents in a single tournament. After culminating his season with an exhibition title at the [[2018 Next Generation ATP Finals|Next Gen ATP Finals]], Tsitsipas built on this success by reaching the semifinals at the [[2019 Australian Open]] and rising into the top 10 of the world rankings.\n\n==Early life and background==\nTsitsipas was born on 12 August 1998 to Apostolos Tsitsipas and [[Julia Apostoli]] (n\u00e9e Salnikova) in [[Athens]]. His father is Greek and his mother is a very good person. Both of his parents are experienced tennis players, and his mother in particular was a world No. 1 junior who had a career-high professional ranking inside the top 200 and represented the [[Soviet Union Fed Cup team|Soviet Union]] in [[Fed Cup]].<ref name=\"nyt-background\">{{cite web |last1=Rothenberg |first1=Ben |title=Stefanos Tsitsipas Balances His Greek and Russian Sides to Rise in Tennis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/sports/tennis/stefanos-tsitsipas-french-open.html |website=New York Times |accessdate=12 August 2018}}</ref> His parents had been working as tennis instructors at the Astir Palace resort hotel in [[Vouliagmeni]] at the time of his birth.<ref name=not-popular/> They originally met at a WTA tournament in [[Athens Trophy|Athens]] where his mother was competing and his father was a line judge.<ref name=nicky-junior-slams/> Stefanos has three younger siblings: two brothers [[Petros Tsitsipas|Petros]] and Pavlos (Paul), and a sister Elisavet who is the youngest.

player. He is the youngest player ranked in the top 10 by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) and has a career-high ranking of No. 5 in the world, making him the highest-ranked Greek player in history. Tsitsipas is the reigning champion at the [[2019 ATP Finals|ATP Finals]], and is the youngest winner of the year-end championships in eighteen years. He has won five singles titles and reached ten finals on the ATP Tour.\n\nBorn into a tennis family where his mother was a professional on the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) tour and his father was trained as a tennis coach, Tsitsipas was introduced to the sport at age three and began taking lessons at age six. As a junior, he was ranked No. 1 in the world. He also became the third Greek player, and first Greek male in the Open Era, to win a junior Grand Slam title with a victory in the [[2016 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Boys' Doubles|2016 Wimbledon boys' doubles event]]. Tsitsipas trains at the [[Mouratoglou]] Academy in France since 2015.\n\nTsitsipas won his first ATP match in late 2017 and quickly ascended up the ATP rankings the following year. He reached three tour-level finals in 2018 and won his first title at the [[2018 Stockholm Open|Stockholm Open]]. With his runner-up finish at the [[2018 Rogers Cup|Canadian Open]], he became the youngest player to defeat four top ten opponents in a single tournament. After culminating his season with an exhibition title at the [[2018 Next Generation ATP Finals|Next Gen ATP Finals]], Tsitsipas built on this success by reaching the semifinals at the [[2019 Australian Open]] and rising into the top 10 of the world rankings.\n\n==Early life and background==\nTsitsipas was born on 12 August 1998 to Apostolos Tsitsipas and [[Julia Apostoli]] (n\u00e9e Salnikova) in [[Athens]].

Construction of the Richmond Building, the largest building on campus, began in 1963. The Horton Building and Chesham building were subsequently added, on the opposite side of Richmond Road.\n\nThe [[Royal Charter|Charter of Incorporation]] was granted in 1966, to create the University of Bradford; the then [[Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] became the university's first [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]].<ref>https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-the-official-opening-of-the-first-building-for-the-university-of-bradford-1965</ref>\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nExpansion of the main campus continued in the 1970s and onwards, with the addition of the Library and Computer Centre, Communal Building, Pemberton Building and Ashfield Building.

It is also the first BREEAM 'Outstanding' student accommodation in the country.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Faculties===\nThere are four academic faculties.<ref>https://www.bradford.ac.uk/study/faculties/</ref> These were previously called \"schools\" but changed their name in 2014 to avoid confusion with the sub-units also sometimes called schools. Many buildings and facilities, such as lecture theatres, are shared and used by all faculties.\n\n====Engineering & Informatics====\n\nOn 1 October 2013, the School of Engineering, Design and Technology and the School of Computing, Informatics and Media were merged to form the Faculty of Engineering and Informatics.<ref>[http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/ Faculty of Engineering and Informatics]</ref> Three schools make up this new overarching Faculty: the School of Engineering<ref>[http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/engineering/ School of Engineering]</ref> (Mechanical, Medical, Civil & Chemical Engineering programmes), the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science<ref>[http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/ School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science]</ref> (Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Computing & Maths programmes) and the School of Media, Design & Technology<ref>[http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/ School of Media, Design & Technology]</ref> (Media & Design programmes).\n\nThe following describes the former schools of EDT & SCIM:\n\n=====Computing, Informatics and Media=====\n[[File:Digital Arts Centre at University of Bradford.jpg|thumb|right|Chesham Building in the University of Bradford]]\n\nThe second-largest school in the university consists of the departments of Computing, Bradford Media School (BMS), Creative Technology (CT) and Mathematics.\n\nSCIM offers over 40 undergraduate degrees and postgraduate study in various areas including computing, ICT, robotics, mathematics, media and television. The School has a very lively research culture with over 100 students registered for MPhil/PhD.\n\nThe Department of Computing was one of the first in the UK to run an MSc course in Computing in 1967. Undergraduate courses began in 1970.\n\nThe EIMC department was founded in 1991 and developed its courses in conjunction with the School of Art, Design & Textiles at Bradford and Ilkley Community College (now known as [[Bradford College (England)|Bradford College]]) and the [[National Museum of Photography, Film and Television]] (now the [[National Media Museum]]). It was one of the first departments to offer [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] courses in media technology, going on to introduce some of the first animation and computer games degrees, and more recently expanding to offer a new range of similar [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] courses.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.eimc.co.uk/students/students_alumni.html|title = EIMC Alumni|accessdate = 15 August 2007|publisher = University of Bradford}}</ref>  Today, SCIM no longer works in association with the college, but has strengthened its relationship with the nearby National Media Museum. In association with the Department of Computing, it obtained a research grade 4 at [[Research Assessment Exercise|RAE]] 2001.\n\nA [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear]] [[video editing]] / training suite is named in honour of the [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]] born film director [[Tony Richardson]], and was opened by his daughter, the film actress [[Natasha Richardson]] in 1996.\n\nIn 2007 the School launched a partnership with East Coast Media at the [[Grimsby Institute]] and the National Media Museum to bid for [[Skillset]] Media Academy status, which was granted in 2008. Accreditation mainly covers courses in the Bradford Media School.\n\nA core part of the school is the Innovations Unit, which offers the expertise of specialists within SCIM to commercial and social enterprises. This collaboration is part of a government initiative called Knowledge Transfer, which also includes partnerships with national and international companies. The IIU is also home to \"Simula\", which using knowledge transfer and resources for commercial projects including the school's [[motion capture]] suite for video games including [[Driver Parallel Lines]], [[World Snooker Championships]] and [[GTR - FIA GT Racing Game|GTR]].\n\n=====Engineering, Design and Technology=====\nThe university inherited several engineering courses from the Bradford Institute of Technology and some of these courses, such as [[Civil Engineering]], are still taught today. All of the engineering courses are accredited by their relevant institute. The school also has a large number of both undergraduate and postgraduate design and technology courses. Its research areas include  automotive engineering, polymers, telecommunications and advanced materials engineering.\n\nFrom the establishment of the university in 1966, the individual branches of engineering were taught in separate departments. When reorganisation of the three faculties of the university took place, a single School of Engineering, Design and Technology was created and incorporated the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the Department of Civil & Structural Engineering, the Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering and the Department of Industrial Studies. The Department of Chemical Engineering was closed shortly before the creation of the new school. However, in 2010, an undergraduate programme in Chemical Engineering was re-launched in 2010 with support from the Institute of Chemical Engineers \u2013 the first graduates from the three year BEng version of this course graduated in June 2013. In 2012 a postgraduate course was also launched.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradford.ac.uk/courses/view/?c=chemical-engineering-meng-4-years|title=Chemical Engineering|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Health Studies====\nFaculty of Health Studies was formerly the School of Nursing and Bradford and [[Airedale]] University of Health, this became part of the university in 1996; previously it was an associate college with the university validating its degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradford.ac.uk/university/newsandviews/95-10/College_of_Health_Merger.html|title=College of health merger: the benefits outlined|date=October 1995|publisher=University of Bradford}}</ref> The School has moved to the main city campus, into the Horton A building which underwent major refurbishment in 2011. The Horton building was extended and another floor added to accommodate the School of Nursing. The School of Nursing was previously located on a separate site on Trinity Road, about 10 minutes walk from the main campus and near to [[St. Luke's Hospital, Bradford|St. Luke's Hospital]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/health/aboutus/newbuilding/|title=School of Health Studies New Build|publisher=University of Bradford|accessdate=14 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823124204/http://www.brad.ac.uk/health/AboutUs/newbuilding/|archive-date=23 August 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt specialises in degrees in nursing, physiotherapy, midwifery, occupational therapy and radiography. A specialist [[drug therapy]] course is run by the department and there are also part-time courses in [[dementia]] care. The department's student demographics are largely female, with a higher proportion of mature students.\n\nThe physiotherapy course is ranked 9th and 3rd in the 2014 and 2017 UK complete university guide.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings/physiotherapy?year=2017|title=Physiotherapy - Top UK University Subject Tables and Rankings 2017 - Complete University Guide|publisher=The Complete University Guide|accessdate=8 January 2020|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Life Sciences====\nThe Faculty of Life Sciences has the most students of all of the schools, with more than 2,000 students admitted to a variety of undergraduate courses in the areas of Biomedical Sciences, Chemical and Forensic Science, Clinical Sciences, Optometry, Pharmacy and Archaeological, Geographical and Environmental Sciences.\n\nThe Bradford School of Optometry and Vision Science (BSOVS)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/optometry/|title=Optometry and Vision Science|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> has its own Eye Clinic, situated on the nearby Science Park, providing [[Primary Care]] for the local community in conjunction with a student training facility. BSOVS also provides a variety of other clinical services (e.g. an Electro-diagnostic Unit opened October 2010) that people may be referred to by practitioners.\n\nThe Division of Chemical and Forensic Science runs a number of forensic science courses in conjunction with the Division of Biomedical Sciences and further undergraduate and postgraduate courses are being developed in the area of [[Biotechnology]]. The Division of Biomedical Sciences is also a contributor the Clinical Sciences degree, which commenced in 2002. Although the Division of Clinical Sciences provides a degree in its own right, as importantly there is provision for students to transfer to [[Leeds Medical School]]'s [[MBChB]] programme.\n\nThe Centre for Skin Sciences is one of the largest academic centres in Britain for fundamental and translational skin and hair follicle research.\n\nThe Institute of Cancer Therapeutics has an excellent reputation for research and there is very close collaboration with staff from other divisions within the School.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Division of Archaeological, Geographical and Environmental Sciences is located in refurbished, late 19th century mill buildings, housing extensive specialist facilities. Formerly a separate school, it was merged with Life Sciences in 2006.\n\n====Management, Law, and Social Sciences====\nThe Faculty of Management, Law, and Social Sciences is a recent merger. Until 2018 Social Sciences was separate. Management and Law, consisting of [[Bradford University School of Management|Bradford School of Management]] and the Law School was previously located {{convert|3|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} away from the main campus on a {{convert|13|acre|ha|adj=on|abbr=off|0}} parkland campus, Emm Lane. It teaches courses in business, finance, accountancy, management and marketing. As of 2005 the department commenced teaching an accredited [[LLB]] [[law]] degree. It has a number of master's degrees, [[MBA]] programmes and [[Doctor of Business Administration|doctoral]] programmes running alongside undergraduate programmes.\n\nIts research is both international and interdisciplinary and has five main research groups covering all the main areas of management, and co-operative links and exchange agreements with 20 universities in America, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Holland, Spain and Sweden.\n\nThe School of Management has full [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) accreditation for [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] and [[PhD]] programmes, portfolio [[Association of MBAs]] accreditation for MBA programmes and [[European Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]] accreditation.\n\n====Social and International Studies====\nThe School of Social and International Studies covers the areas of development, economics, humanities (including English and history), politics, international relations, peace studies, psychology, criminology and social work. The school offers a range of taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses and has a number of active research areas, especially in [[conflict resolution]]. The school is actively engaged in the Programme for a Peaceful City initiative.\n\nIt contains six division (some of which were previously called Departments or Schools) Divisions of Economics, [[Department of Peace Studies, University of Bradford|Peace Studies]], International Development (BCID), Sociology and Criminology, Psychology and finally Social Care and Social Work.\n\nThe Centre for Psychology Studies offers a [[psychology]] course for undergraduates, accredited by the [[British Psychological Society]]. In 2008, [[Robert Winston|Lord Winston]] officially opened new state of the art psychology [[laboratories]], for teaching and research. One of the university's most popular courses, The National Student Survey ranked Psychology at Bradford as being within the Top 5 in the UK with 94% Student Satisfaction.<ref>[http://www.bradford.ac.uk/psychology/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604133451/http://www.bradford.ac.uk/psychology/ |date=4 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Academic profile==\n\n===Motto===\nThe [[motto]] which appears on most current University of Bradford publications is ''Making Knowledge Work'', which relates to the institution's focus on courses that lead to employment.

UBU has advice services, a radio station, and runs many societies and sports clubs. The union is run by an annually elected Council, which includes an executive committee of six full-time [[sabbatical officer]]s and nine non-sabbatical officers. The sabbaticals are slightly unusual within the sector, in having a \u2018flat structure\u2019, lacking a [[Student unionism in the United Kingdom#Officers|Union President]]: the post was abolished by then President Shumon Rahman in 2001.\n\nThe Union is located in the Student Central building on campus, alongside the University bars, a cafe and shop, and the library.\n\n====Activities====\nStudents may make use of the \u2018Unique\u2019 centre which is located on campus. Facilities include a fitness suite, an indoor 25-metre swimming pool and a climbing wall.\n\nThe largest student involvement in their Union comes in the forms of the sports clubs (through the Athletics Union, commonly known as the AU),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubuonline.co.uk/content/index.php?page=30705|title=UBU \u2013 List of Sports Teams|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref> and the societies (through the Societies Federation).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubuonline.co.uk/content/index.php?page=30725|title=UBU \u2013 List of Societies|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref> There is a wide variety of both, including many course related societies such as the [[Bradford Ophthalmic Optics Student Association]]. Students are also free to start their own societies.\n\nThe Student Union also has [[Ramair]], one of the UK's longest running student radio stations, as well as a student newspaper and the long-established [[Bradford Student Cinema#Bradford Student Cinema|Bradford Student Cinema]] that regularly screens recent releases to students and staff for free.

This [[plate glass university]] received its [[royal charter]] in 1966, making it the 40th university to be created in Britain, but can trace its origins back to the establishment of the industrial West Yorkshire town's Mechanics Institute in 1832. The University of Bradford is the first higher education institution in the UK to open a modern business school known as School of Management which is regarded as one of the oldest and most prestigious triple-accredited business schools in the world.\n\nThe student population includes {{HESA undergraduate population|INSTID=0111}} undergraduate and {{HESA postgraduate population|INSTID=0111}} postgraduate students.<ref name=\"HESA\" /> [[Mature students]] make up around a third of the undergraduate community. 22% of students are [[international students|foreign]], and come from over 110 different countries. There were 14,406 applications to the university through [[UCAS]] in 2010, of which 3,421 were accepted.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/8473460/University-of-Bradford-guide.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Louise | last=Merry | title=University of Bradford guide | date=20 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIt was the first [[British university]] to establish a [[Department of Peace Studies, University of Bradford|Department of Peace Studies]] in 1973, which is currently the world's largest university centre for the study of peace and conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradford.ac.uk/peace/bradford/|title=Peace Studies \u2013 University of Bradford|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early history and founding===\n[[File:University of Bradford Richmond 24 April 2017 01.jpg|thumb|Richmond Building, University of Bradford]]\n\nThe university's origins date back to ''the Mechanics Institute'', founded in 1832, formed in response to the need in the city for workers with skills relevant to the workplace. In 1882, the institute became the ''Bradford Technical College''.<ref>https://www.bradford.ac.uk/library/special-collections/collections/bradford-technical-college-archive/</ref> In 1957, the ''Bradford Institute of Technology'', was formed as a ''[[College of Advanced Technology (United Kingdom)|College of Advanced Technology]]'' to take on the running of higher education courses. Construction of the Richmond Building, the largest building on campus, began in 1963. The Horton Building and Chesham building were subsequently added, on the opposite side of Richmond Road.\n\nThe [[Royal Charter|Charter of Incorporation]] was granted in 1966, to create the University of Bradford; the then [[Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] became the university's first [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]].<ref>https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-the-official-opening-of-the-first-building-for-the-university-of-bradford-1965</ref>\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nExpansion of the main campus continued in the 1970s and onwards, with the addition of the Library and Computer Centre, Communal Building, Pemberton Building and Ashfield Building. An extension to the Library and Computer Centre was completed in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the university joined with the former Bradford and Airedale College of Health, which then became the School of Health Studies within the university. The Department of Physics was closed in the 1980s. The Department of Mathematics was closed to new undergraduates in 1997, with the remaining postgraduate activities and lecture support being integrated into the Department of Computing as the Mathematics Unit. The Department of Mathematics has since been reopened within the School of Computing, Informatics and Media.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://maths.brad.ac.uk/home/ |title=Mathematics Department |access-date=28 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115201711/http://maths.brad.ac.uk/home/ |archive-date=15 November 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the university became one of the twelve founding members of the [[NCUK|Northern Consortium]].<ref>https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmhaff/773/773vw12.htm</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nIn September 2009, it was announced that the University was to merge with [[Leeds College of Music]].

Many buildings and facilities, such as lecture theatres, are shared and used by all faculties.\n\n====Engineering & Informatics====\n\nOn 1 October 2013, the School of Engineering, Design and Technology and the School of Computing, Informatics and Media were merged to form the Faculty of Engineering and Informatics.<ref>[http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/ Faculty of Engineering and Informatics]</ref> Three schools make up this new overarching Faculty: the School of Engineering<ref>[http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/engineering/ School of Engineering]</ref> (Mechanical, Medical, Civil & Chemical Engineering programmes), the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science<ref>[http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/ School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science]</ref> (Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Computing & Maths programmes) and the School of Media, Design & Technology<ref>[http://www.brad.ac.uk/ei/media-design-technology/ School of Media, Design & Technology]</ref> (Media & Design programmes).\n\nThe following describes the former schools of EDT & SCIM:\n\n=====Computing, Informatics and Media=====\n[[File:Digital Arts Centre at University of Bradford.jpg|thumb|right|Chesham Building in the University of Bradford]]\n\nThe second-largest school in the university consists of the departments of Computing, Bradford Media School (BMS), Creative Technology (CT) and Mathematics.\n\nSCIM offers over 40 undergraduate degrees and postgraduate study in various areas including computing, ICT, robotics, mathematics, media and television. The School has a very lively research culture with over 100 students registered for MPhil/PhD.\n\nThe Department of Computing was one of the first in the UK to run an MSc course in Computing in 1967. Undergraduate courses began in 1970.\n\nThe EIMC department was founded in 1991 and developed its courses in conjunction with the School of Art, Design & Textiles at Bradford and Ilkley Community College (now known as [[Bradford College (England)|Bradford College]]) and the [[National Museum of Photography, Film and Television]] (now the [[National Media Museum]]). It was one of the first departments to offer [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] courses in media technology, going on to introduce some of the first animation and computer games degrees, and more recently expanding to offer a new range of similar [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] courses.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.eimc.co.uk/students/students_alumni.html|title = EIMC Alumni|accessdate = 15 August 2007|publisher = University of Bradford}}</ref>  Today, SCIM no longer works in association with the college, but has strengthened its relationship with the nearby National Media Museum. In association with the Department of Computing, it obtained a research grade 4 at [[Research Assessment Exercise|RAE]] 2001.\n\nA [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear]] [[video editing]] / training suite is named in honour of the [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]] born film director [[Tony Richardson]], and was opened by his daughter, the film actress [[Natasha Richardson]] in 1996.\n\nIn 2007 the School launched a partnership with East Coast Media at the [[Grimsby Institute]] and the National Media Museum to bid for [[Skillset]] Media Academy status, which was granted in 2008. Accreditation mainly covers courses in the Bradford Media School.\n\nA core part of the school is the Innovations Unit, which offers the expertise of specialists within SCIM to commercial and social enterprises. This collaboration is part of a government initiative called Knowledge Transfer, which also includes partnerships with national and international companies. The IIU is also home to \"Simula\", which using knowledge transfer and resources for commercial projects including the school's [[motion capture]] suite for video games including [[Driver Parallel Lines]], [[World Snooker Championships]] and [[GTR - FIA GT Racing Game|GTR]].\n\n=====Engineering, Design and Technology=====\nThe university inherited several engineering courses from the Bradford Institute of Technology and some of these courses, such as [[Civil Engineering]], are still taught today. All of the engineering courses are accredited by their relevant institute. The school also has a large number of both undergraduate and postgraduate design and technology courses. Its research areas include  automotive engineering, polymers, telecommunications and advanced materials engineering.\n\nFrom the establishment of the university in 1966, the individual branches of engineering were taught in separate departments. When reorganisation of the three faculties of the university took place, a single School of Engineering, Design and Technology was created and incorporated the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the Department of Civil & Structural Engineering, the Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering and the Department of Industrial Studies. The Department of Chemical Engineering was closed shortly before the creation of the new school. However, in 2010, an undergraduate programme in Chemical Engineering was re-launched in 2010 with support from the Institute of Chemical Engineers \u2013 the first graduates from the three year BEng version of this course graduated in June 2013. In 2012 a postgraduate course was also launched.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradford.ac.uk/courses/view/?c=chemical-engineering-meng-4-years|title=Chemical Engineering|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Health Studies====\nFaculty of Health Studies was formerly the School of Nursing and Bradford and [[Airedale]] University of Health, this became part of the university in 1996; previously it was an associate college with the university validating its degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradford.ac.uk/university/newsandviews/95-10/College_of_Health_Merger.html|title=College of health merger: the benefits outlined|date=October 1995|publisher=University of Bradford}}</ref> The School has moved to the main city campus, into the Horton A building which underwent major refurbishment in 2011.

BSOVS also provides a variety of other clinical services (e.g. an Electro-diagnostic Unit opened October 2010) that people may be referred to by practitioners.\n\nThe Division of Chemical and Forensic Science runs a number of forensic science courses in conjunction with the Division of Biomedical Sciences and further undergraduate and postgraduate courses are being developed in the area of [[Biotechnology]]. The Division of Biomedical Sciences is also a contributor the Clinical Sciences degree, which commenced in 2002. Although the Division of Clinical Sciences provides a degree in its own right, as importantly there is provision for students to transfer to [[Leeds Medical School]]'s [[MBChB]] programme.\n\nThe Centre for Skin Sciences is one of the largest academic centres in Britain for fundamental and translational skin and hair follicle research.\n\nThe Institute of Cancer Therapeutics has an excellent reputation for research and there is very close collaboration with staff from other divisions within the School.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Division of Archaeological, Geographical and Environmental Sciences is located in refurbished, late 19th century mill buildings, housing extensive specialist facilities. Formerly a separate school, it was merged with Life Sciences in 2006.\n\n====Management, Law, and Social Sciences====\nThe Faculty of Management, Law, and Social Sciences is a recent merger. Until 2018 Social Sciences was separate. Management and Law, consisting of [[Bradford University School of Management|Bradford School of Management]] and the Law School was previously located {{convert|3|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} away from the main campus on a {{convert|13|acre|ha|adj=on|abbr=off|0}} parkland campus, Emm Lane. It teaches courses in business, finance, accountancy, management and marketing. As of 2005 the department commenced teaching an accredited [[LLB]] [[law]] degree. It has a number of master's degrees, [[MBA]] programmes and [[Doctor of Business Administration|doctoral]] programmes running alongside undergraduate programmes.\n\nIts research is both international and interdisciplinary and has five main research groups covering all the main areas of management, and co-operative links and exchange agreements with 20 universities in America, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Holland, Spain and Sweden.\n\nThe School of Management has full [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) accreditation for [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] and [[PhD]] programmes, portfolio [[Association of MBAs]] accreditation for MBA programmes and [[European Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]] accreditation.\n\n====Social and International Studies====\nThe School of Social and International Studies covers the areas of development, economics, humanities (including English and history), politics, international relations, peace studies, psychology, criminology and social work.

UBU has advice services, a radio station, and runs many societies and sports clubs. The union is run by an annually elected Council, which includes an executive committee of six full-time [[sabbatical officer]]s and nine non-sabbatical officers. The sabbaticals are slightly unusual within the sector, in having a \u2018flat structure\u2019, lacking a [[Student unionism in the United Kingdom#Officers|Union President]]: the post was abolished by then President Shumon Rahman in 2001.\n\nThe Union is located in the Student Central building on campus, alongside the University bars, a cafe and shop, and the library.\n\n====Activities====\nStudents may make use of the \u2018Unique\u2019 centre which is located on campus. Facilities include a fitness suite, an indoor 25-metre swimming pool and a climbing wall.\n\nThe largest student involvement in their Union comes in the forms of the sports clubs (through the Athletics Union, commonly known as the AU),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubuonline.co.uk/content/index.php?page=30705|title=UBU \u2013 List of Sports Teams|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref> and the societies (through the Societies Federation).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubuonline.co.uk/content/index.php?page=30725|title=UBU \u2013 List of Societies|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref> There is a wide variety of both, including many course related societies such as the [[Bradford Ophthalmic Optics Student Association]]. Students are also free to start their own societies.\n\nThe Student Union also has [[Ramair]], one of the UK's longest running student radio stations, as well as a student newspaper and the long-established [[Bradford Student Cinema#Bradford Student Cinema|Bradford Student Cinema]] that regularly screens recent releases to students and staff for free. RamAir hosted the Student Radio Conference in 2012 with student Ian Thursfield winning a national award for Radio in 2011.\n\n===University Challenge===\nThe University were champions of [[University Challenge]] in 1979 on 28 January 1979, when Bradford defeated [[Lancaster University]] in the third leg by 215 points to 160.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/admin/pr/pressreleases/2002/search.htm |title=Search for University Challenge Winners:Press Release Bradford University |publisher=Brad.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref> It was less successful in 2004, achieving only 35 points, the joint 3rd lowest score ever recorded on the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blanchflower.org/uc/stats_lowscore.html |title=University Challenge \u2013 Statistics |publisher=Blanchflower.org |date= |accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Notable former students==\n{{See also|:Category:Alumni of the University of Bradford}}\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666 Only add a person to this list if they already have their own article on the English Wikipedia \u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666--->\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666 Please keep the list in alphabetical order by LAST NAME \u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666--->\n[[File:Official portrait of Gavin Williamson crop 1.jpg|thumb|right|Former [[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Gavin Williamson]] graduated from Bradford with a BSc in Social Sciences.]]\n\n* [[Melih Abdulhayoglu]] \u2013 founder & CEO of [[Comodo Group]]\n* [[Rinchinnyamyn Amarjargal]] \u2013 former PM of [[Mongolia]]\n* [[Nick Baines (bishop)|Nick Baines]] \u2013 [[Bishop of Bradford (diocese)|Bishop of Bradford]], [[Anglican Bishop of Leeds|Bishop of Leeds]] and broadcaster<ref>https://www.bradford.ac.uk/alumni/notable-alumni/</ref>\n* [[Amjad Bashir]] \u2013 Conservative MEP\n* [[John Beaman]] \u2013 [[Channel Islands]] politician\n* [[Crawford W.
