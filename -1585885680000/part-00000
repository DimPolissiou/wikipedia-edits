It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be [[contact call]]s, are animated two-note calls variously described as ''terric, terric'', ''cr-rook, cr-rook'' or ''put-put, put-put''.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Yellow-faced Honeyeater callistemon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower|The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs.]]\n\n===Habitat===\nAcross its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitats\u2014in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata]]'') with [[ironbark]]s and [[stringybark]]s, such as narrow-leaved ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus crebra]]'') and silver-leaved ironbark ([[Eucalyptus melanophloia|''E. melanophloia'']]), with a light shrubby [[understorey]], and less often in dry, open forests and [[woodland]]s dominated by ''[[Angophora]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Casuarina]]'' or ''[[Callitris]]'', or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (''[[Eucalyptus delegatensis]]'') and woodlands dominated by snow gum (''[[Eucalyptus pauciflora|E. pauciflora]]'') or white box (''[[Eucalyptus albens|E. albens]]''). It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after [[Bushfires in Australia|fire]] or [[logging]], though it is more common in mature forests.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=725}} Where it is found in woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an [[understory]] of sclerophyll plants.<ref name=\"Ford and Paton 76\">{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Hugh A.|last2=Paton|first2=David C.|title=Resource partitioning and competition in honeyeaters of the genus ''Meliphaga''|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|date=1976|volume=1|issue=4|pages=281\u2013287|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1976.tb01118.x}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near [[Cooktown]] in [[Far North Queensland]], southwest between a line from [[Charters Towers]] to [[Albury]] and the coast, and then west to the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]] and Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied.

The controversial alliance of Nicaragua's two major parties is aimed at distributing power between the PLC and FSLN, and preventing other parties from rising.

Ortega abandoned the revolutionary tone of the past, and infused his campaign with religious imagery.

The split in the Constitutionalist Liberal Party helped allow the FSLN to become the largest party in Congress; however, the Sandinista vote had a minuscule split between the FSLN and MRS, and that the liberal party combined is larger than the Frente Faction.

The controversial alliance of Nicaragua's two major parties is aimed at distributing power between the PLC and FSLN, and preventing other parties from rising. After sealing the agreement in January 2000, the two parties controlled the three key institutions of the state: the Comptroller General of the Republic, the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Nicaragua)|Supreme Court]], and the Supreme Electoral Council.<ref name=\"FSLNAdaptation\"/> ''\"El Pacto,\"'' as it is known in Nicaragua, is said to have personally benefited former presidents Ortega and Alem\u00e1n greatly, while constraining then-president Bola\u00f1os.

Once the main collective leadership body of the party, with nine members, the DN no longer met routinely, and only three historic members remained. Instead, the body just supported decisions already made by the secretary-general.

Ortega abandoned the revolutionary tone of the past, and infused his campaign with religious imagery. In speeches, he gave thanks to \u201cGod and the Revolution\u201d for the post-1990 democracy, and claimed a Sandinista victory would enable the Nicaraguan people to \u201cpass through the sea and reach the Promised Land.\u201d{{sfn|Baltodano|2012|pp=76-7}}  The U.S. opposed Ortega's candidacy from the beginning.

Ortega personally attacked [[Herty Lewites|Lewites]]\u2019 Jewish background, compared him to Judas, and warned he \u201ccould end up hanged.\u201d{{sfn|Baltodano|2012|p=83}} However, Lewites died several months before the elections.\n\nOrtega emphasized peace and reconciliation in his campaign, and selected a former Contra leader, [[Jaime Morales Carazo|Jaime Morales Corazo]], as his running mate.{{sfn|DeFronzo|2011|p=281}} The FSLN also won 38 seats in the congressional elections, becoming the party with the largest representation in parliament. The split in the Constitutionalist Liberal Party helped allow the FSLN to become the largest party in Congress; however, the Sandinista vote had a minuscule split between the FSLN and MRS, and that the liberal party combined is larger than the Frente Faction. In 2010, several liberal congressmen raised accusations about the FSLN presumably attempting to buy votes to pass constitutional reforms that would allow Ortega to run for office for the 6th time since 1984.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/06/15/politica/27852|title=Ofertas de \"ca\u00f1onazos\" en US$500 mil|last=Uriarte|first=Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9|date=15 June 2010|work=La Prensa|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019083239/http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/06/15/politica/27852|archive-date=19 October 2013|language=Spanish|trans-title=Offers of canonization for US$500 million}}</ref>\n\n==Second presidency (2007\u2013present)==\n{{Main|2011 Nicaraguan general election||Nicaraguan general election, 2016}}\n{{Infobox President styles\n| image    = [[File:Coat of arms of Nicaragua.svg|75px]]\n| name     = Daniel Ortega\n| dipstyle = ''Daniel Ortega, Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica de Nicaragua'' Daniel Ortega, President of the Republic of Nicaragua\n| offstyle = ''Presidente Ortega'' President Ortega\n| altstyle = ''Se\u00f1or Presidente'' Mister President\n}}\nSoon after his inauguration, Ortega paid an official visit to Iran and met [[Iranian President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].

{"title_page": "Obstructing the field", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n'''Obstructing the field''' is one of the nine methods of [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissing]] a [[batsman]] in the sport of [[cricket]]. It dictates that either batsman can be given out if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the [[Fielding (cricket)|fielding side]] by word or action. It is governed by Law 37 of the [[laws of cricket]], and is a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed; in the history of cricket, there has been only one instance in [[Test cricket|Test matches]], six occasions in [[One Day International]] (ODI) games, and only one instance in [[Twenty20]] International matches. However, there have also been seven instances in Test cricket, and two in ODIs, where a batsman has been dismissed [[handled the ball]], a mode of dismissal now folded into obstructing the field. In most cases an obstruction occurs when a batsman thinks that he is going to be [[Run out (cricket)|run out]] and he blocks the ball with his bat or changes his course while [[running between wickets]] to block the ball. The obstruction has to be deliberate, so a batsman will not be out if the contact with the ball is inadvertent.\n\nThe only time a batsman has been dismissed obstructing the ball in a Test match was during the [[South African cricket team in England in 1951|South African cricket team's tour of England in 1951]] when, in the fifth Test, England's [[Leonard Hutton]] [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|top edged]] the ball and, thinking the ball would hit the stumps, attempted to hit the ball away, thereby preventing the [[wicket-keeper]] from [[Catch (cricket)|catching]] the ball.\n\n==Definition==\nObstructing the field is Law 37 in the [[Laws of cricket]] established by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC). A batsman can be given out for obstructing the field if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action.<ref name=\"mcc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-37-obstructing-the-field/ |title=Law 37 \u2013 Obstructing the field |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nLaw 37 describes the following three circumstances where this applies (but the law is not limited to these circumstances):\n*If, in the act of playing the ball, the batsmen wilfully strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat, unless this is to avoid injury.{{efn|This situation was previously covered in a separate Law:[[Handled the ball]].}}\n\n*If either batsman should wilfully obstruct or distract a fielder preventing a catch being made.\n*If, at any time while the ball is in play and without the consent of a fielder, he uses his bat or any part of his person, to return the ball to any fielder.\nThe latter situation isan is being helpful in returning the ball. A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion, and any runs that have been completed before the offence is committed are scored (unless the obstruction prevents a catch being made{{efn|In this case any penalty runs will stand.<ref name=\"mcc\"/>}}).\n\n==Earliest recorded instance==\nThe first known instance of a player being dismissed in a manner equivalent to the modern term 'Obstructing the field' occurred in a minor match at Sheffield on 27 August 1792, between [[Sheffield Cricket Club]] and Bents Green. The Bents Green player John Shaw, who scored 7 in the first innings, had his dismissal recorded as \"run out of the ground to hinder a catch\". The information was recorded by [[G. B. Buckley]] who found it in the ''Sheffield Advertiser'' dated 31 August 1792. Sheffield won by 10 wickets in a match that was notable for two other reasons, these being that it was the first match played in [[Yorkshire]] for which full scores are recorded and it was the earliest known instance of a three innings match.<ref>Buckley, pp.27\u201328.</ref>\n\n==Dismissals in international cricket==\n===Test cricket===\n[[Len Hutton]] is the only man given out this way in Test cricket, for an incident that occurred at [[The Oval]] during the [[South_African_cricket_team_in_England_in_1951#Fifth_Test|fifth Test]] of South Africa's tour of England in 1951.\n\n===One Day Internationals===\nIn [[One Day International]]s, [[Rameez Raja]] (for Pakistan against England at Karachi in 1987) was given out for hitting the ball away with his bat to avoid being run out going for his century off the last ball of the innings, and [[Mohinder Amarnath]] (for India against Sri Lanka at Ahmedabad in 1989) was given out for kicking the ball away to avoid being run out. Another batsman to be given out this way is [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] of [[Pakistan]] in the first ODI of [[India]] vs [[Pakistan]] Hutch Cup on 6 February 2006. After Inzamam drove the ball to mid off, Indian [[Suresh Raina]] threw it back to the striker's end, Inzamam stopping it with his bat. Umpire [[Simon Taufel]] gave him out as he was in the line of the stumps and out of his crease (and thus would have been run out had the ball hit the stumps).\n\n[[Mohammad Hafeez]] of Pakistan was dismissed obstructing the field on 21 March 2013 in the 4th ODI of the bilateral series match against South Africa. He became the first man to be given out obstructing the field after the new playing conditions were introduced.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-pakistan-2013/engine/current/match/567371.html]</ref> His teammate, [[Anwar Ali (cricketer born 1987)|Anwar Ali]], was dismissed obstructing the field on 27 November 2013 in the second ODI against South Africa.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-pakistan-2013-14/content/player/232491.html]</ref>\n\n[[Ben Stokes]] of England was dismissed obstructing the field on 5 September 2015 in the second ODI against Australia for stopping the ball with his hand when the bowler, Mitchell Starc, had thrown the ball in an attempt to run him out.<ref>http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283167.html</ref>\n\nThe complete list of batsmen given out obstructing the field in [[One Day International]]s is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ One Day International dismissals obstructed the field\n|-\n!

It dictates that either batsman can be given out if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the [[Fielding (cricket)|fielding side]] by word or action. It is governed by Law 37 of the [[laws of cricket]], and is a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed; in the history of cricket, there has been only one instance in [[Test cricket|Test matches]], six occasions in [[One Day International]] (ODI) games, and only one instance in [[Twenty20]] International matches. However, there have also been seven instances in Test cricket, and two in ODIs, where a batsman has been dismissed [[handled the ball]], a mode of dismissal now folded into obstructing the field. In most cases an obstruction occurs when a batsman thinks that he is going to be [[Run out (cricket)|run out]] and he blocks the ball with his bat or changes his course while [[running between wickets]] to block the ball. The obstruction has to be deliberate, so a batsman will not be out if the contact with the ball is inadvertent.\n\nThe only time a batsman has been dismissed obstructing the ball in a Test match was during the [[South African cricket team in England in 1951|South African cricket team's tour of England in 1951]] when, in the fifth Test, England's [[Leonard Hutton]] [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|top edged]] the ball and, thinking the ball would hit the stumps, attempted to hit the ball away, thereby preventing the [[wicket-keeper]] from [[Catch (cricket)|catching]] the ball.\n\n==Definition==\nObstructing the field is Law 37 in the [[Laws of cricket]] established by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC). A batsman can be given out for obstructing the field if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action.<ref name=\"mcc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-37-obstructing-the-field/ |title=Law 37 \u2013 Obstructing the field |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nLaw 37 describes the following three circumstances where this applies (but the law is not limited to these circumstances):\n*If, in the act of playing the ball, the batsmen wilfully strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat, unless this is to avoid injury.{{efn|This situation was previously covered in a separate Law:[[Handled the ball]].}}\n\n*If either batsman should wilfully obstruct or distract a fielder preventing a catch being made.\n*If, at any time while the ball is in play and without the consent of a fielder, he uses his bat or any part of his person, to return the ball to any fielder.\nThe latter situation is rarely applied, as the fielding side generally accept that the batsman is being helpful in returning the ball. A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion, and any runs that have been completed before the offence is committed are scored (unless the obstruction prevents a catch being made{{efn|In this case any penalty runs will stand.<ref name=\"mcc\"/>}}).\n\n==Earliest recorded instance==\nThe first known instance of a player being dismissed in a manner equivalent to the modern term 'Obstructing the field' occurred in a minor match at Sheffield on 27 August 1792, between [[Sheffield Cricket Club]] and Bents Green. The Bents Green player John Shaw, who scored 7 in the first innings, had his dismissal recorded as \"run out of the ground to hinder a catch\". The information was recorded by [[G. B. Buckley]] who found it in the ''Sheffield Advertiser'' dated 31 August 1792. Sheffield won by 10 wickets in a match that was notable for two other reasons, these being that it was the first match played in [[Yorkshire]] for which full scores are recorded and it was the earliest known instance of a three innings match.<ref>Buckley, pp.27\u201328.</ref>\n\n==Dismissals in international cricket==\n===Test cricket===\n[[Len Hutton]] is the only man given out this way in Test cricket, for an incident that occurred at [[The Oval]] during the [[South_African_cricket_team_in_England_in_1951#Fifth_Test|fifth Test]] of South Africa's tour of England in 1951.\n\n===One Day Internationals===\nIn [[One Day International]]s, [[Rameez Raja]] (for Pakistan against England at Karachi in 1987) was given out for hitting the ball away with his bat to avoid being run out going for his century off the last ball of the innings, and [[Mohinder Amarnath]] (for India against Sri Lanka at Ahmedabad in 1989) was given out for kicking the ball away to avoid being run out. Another batsman to be given out this way is [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] of [[Pakistan]] in the first ODI of [[India]] vs [[Pakistan]] Hutch Cup on 6 February 2006. After Inzamam drove the ball to mid off, Indian [[Suresh Raina]] threw it back to the striker's end, Inzamam stopping it with his bat. Umpire [[Simon Taufel]] gave him out as he was in the line of the stumps and out of his crease (and thus would have been run out had the ball hit the stumps).\n\n[[Mohammad Hafeez]] of Pakistan was dismissed obstructing the field on 21 March 2013 in the 4th ODI of the bilateral series match against South Africa.

The palace complex is about a kilometer away from the [[Phra Pathommachedi]]. The complex consists of five buildings and a [[Ganesh]] shrine.\n\n==History==\n===Royal residence===\n[[File:0004933 SanamchandraPalace Ch.pongsakorn.jpg|thumb|In front of Sanam Chandra Palace]]\nBefore ascending the throne, the then [[Crown Prince]] [[Vajiravudh]] came to this city to pay homage to Phra Pathommachedi. He wished to build a palace here as a retreat and a residence during his pilgrimage trip to the stupa. He viewed the area as a strategic location. In 1907, he bought about 335 acres of land around Noen Prasart Hill ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e19\u0e34\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e17}}; {{Rtgs|''Noen Prasat''}}; \"Castle Hill\") from local people. Noen Prasart Hill is believed to be the site of an ancient palace. He then had Luang Phitak Manop (Noi Silapi, later Phraya Visukam Prasit) designed and supervised the construction of the palace. The construction began in 1902 by the end of [[Chulalongkorn]]'s reign (1868 \u2013 1910). It was completed in 1911. Vajiravudh named it Sanam Chandra Palace after a natural pool nearby called \"Sa Nam Chand\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e30\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c}}; {{Rtgs|''Sa Nam Chan''}}; \"Moon Pond\"). In addition, the king had another plan for this palace. It was to serve not only as a retreat, but also as a stronghold during a national crisis. Here, he regularly held practices for the [[Wild Tigers Corps]], a paramilitary troop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palaces.thai.net/day/index_sc.htm |title=Welcome to Sanam Chandra Palace |website=Palaces.thai.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}</ref> According to Vajiravudh's will, the palace was given to the government to be the site of [[Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy|military academy]]. However, after reign of Vajiravudh the palace has been closed and transformed to [[Nakhon Pathom]]'s administrative area. Some palace halls had been dismantled and moved to National Museum in Bangkok for preservation.\n\n===Silpakorn University Campus===\nIn 1965 [[Silpakorn University]], a well known Thai university, for art and archaeology study, improved its educational program with additional new faculties and urgently need larger area to accommodate the expansion.

The palace complex is about a kilometer away from the [[Phra Pathommachedi]]. The complex consists of five buildings and a [[Ganesh]] shrine.\n\n==History==\n===Royal residence===\n[[File:0004933 SanamchandraPalace Ch.pongsakorn.jpg|thumb|In front of Sanam Chandra Palace]]\nBefore ascending the throne, the then [[Crown Prince]] [[Vajiravudh]] came to this city to pay homage to Phra Pathommachedi. He wished to build a palace here as a retreat and a residence during his pilgrimage trip to the stupa. He viewed the area as a strategic location. In 1907, he bought about 335 acres of land around Noen Prasart Hill ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e19\u0e34\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e17}}; {{Rtgs|''Noen Prasat''}}; \"Castle Hill\") from local people. Noen Prasart Hill is believed to be the site of an ancient palace. He then had Luang Phitak Manop (Noi Silapi, later Phraya Visukam Prasit) designed and supervised the construction of the palace. The construction began in 1902 by the end of [[Chulalongkorn]]'s reign (1868 \u2013 1910). It was completed in 1911. Vajiravudh named it Sanam Chandra Palace after a natural pool nearby called \"Sa Nam Chand\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e30\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c}}; {{Rtgs|''Sa Nam Chan''}}; \"Moon Pond\"). In addition, the king had another plan for this palace. It was to serve not only as a retreat, but also as a stronghold during a national crisis. Here, he regularly held practices for the [[Wild Tigers Corps]], a paramilitary troop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palaces.thai.net/day/index_sc.htm |title=Welcome to Sanam Chandra Palace |website=Palaces.thai.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}</ref> According to Vajiravudh's will, the palace was given to the government to be the site of [[Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy|military academy]]. However, after reign of Vajiravudh the palace has been closed and transformed to [[Nakhon Pathom]]'s administrative area. Some palace halls had been dismantled and moved to National Museum in Bangkok for preservation.\n\n===Silpakorn University Campus===\nIn 1965 [[Silpakorn University]], a well known Thai university, for art and archaeology study, improved its educational program with additional new faculties and urgently need larger area to accommodate the expansion. The university and Thai cabinet approved to use the area of Sanam Chandra Palace to be the new university campus since the area was suitable since the palace was once belong to [[Vajiravudh]], an archeologist and artist himself. Also in the palace ground has [[Ganesh]] Shrine, god of art and the symbol of university seal. Moreover, [[Nakhon Pathom]] is an important archaeological site for [[Dvaravati]] in Thailand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.su.ac.th/html_about/about_location_sanamchandra02.asp |accessdate=July 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125133641/http://www.su.ac.th/html_about/about_location_sanamchandra02.asp |archivedate=January 25, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Restoration===\nIn 1981 [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]] registered Sanam Chandra Palace as historical site.
