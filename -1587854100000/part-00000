His father was [[Austrians|Austrian]] and his mother was Spanish. He began his musical career with piano lessons at the age of four, and he sang in the school choir by age eight. His older brother, [[Francisco Kraus Trujillo]], a [[baritone]], studied music and opera alongside him.\n\n\n\n\n\n==Career== \nAfter refining his technique singing Spanish [[zarzuela]] on stage in [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]], Kraus made his professional opera debut in [[Cairo]] during 1956 as the Duke in ''[[Rigoletto]]'', which became one of his signature roles. In 1958, he sang Alfredo at the [[Teatro Nacional de S\u00e3o Carlos]] in [[Lisbon]] in a production of ''[[La traviata]]'' with [[Maria Callas]], a live recording of which was later released.\n\nKraus made his [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] debut as Edgardo in ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' in 1959 and his [[La Scala]] debut as Elvino in ''[[La sonnambula]]'' in 1960. He made his American debut with [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] in 1962, and his [[Metropolitan Opera]] debut in 1966 in ''Rigoletto'', the role of his last performance there in 1994.\n\nIn subsequent decades, Kraus extended his repertoire to include more Italian operas such as ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'', ''[[La fille du r\u00e9giment]]'', ''[[Linda di Chamounix]]'', ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' and ''[[La favorite|La favorita]]'' by [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]; and French operas such as ''[[Rom\u00e9o et Juliette]]'', ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann|Les contes d'Hoffmann]]'', ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' and ''[[Lakm\u00e9]]'', while continuing to sing his hallmark roles of ''Werther'' and of Des Grieux in ''[[Manon]]''. He also recorded a number of rarely performed French operas including ''[[La jolie fille de Perth]]'' and ''[[Les p\u00eacheurs de perles]]'', both by [[Georges Bizet]], and ''[[La muette de Portici]]'' by [[Daniel Auber]]. He also performed in some very well known works, such as ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and ''Faust''.\n\nKraus came to be virtually synonymous with such [[Voice type|lyric tenor]] roles as Werther, Faust, Don Ottavio (''Don Giovanni''), [[L'elisir d'amore|Nemorino]], and [[I puritani|Arturo]].  He was also known for his performances of Spanish music, notably many classics from the [[zarzuela]] repertoire, which he continued to perform live on stage in Spain until the end of his career, and many of which he recorded complete for [[EMI]] Spain as well as for his own label, Carillon.\n\n==Technique==\nThanks to his superlative technique and careful husbanding of his vocal resources, Kraus sang onstage until his early 70s. He studied voice technique in Milan with [[Mercedes Llopart]].  \n \nKraus was also noted for extremely refined musicianship, accompanied by a seemingly effortless high register. As a result, many opera connoisseurs consider him to be one of the best tenors of the end of the 20th century.  He was admired for his cultivated musical education and his complete respect for his chosen profession. His first priority was the integrity of his artistic interpretation of a piece, rather than his formidable range and excellent technique.\n\nHe performed all over the world, including the [[Teatro Col\u00f3n]] in [[Buenos Aires]], Teatro Municipal in [[Caracas]], [[Teatro Municipal (Santiago)|Teatro Municipal]] in [[Santiago, Chile]], [[Teatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Teatro Municipal]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and the [[Liceu]] in [[Barcelona]].\n\nIn 1991, Kraus was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]]. In 1997, his home city of [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] opened The Alfredo Kraus Auditorium in his honor.\n\n==Later years==\n\nThe loss of his wife in 1997 affected Kraus so deeply that he stopped performing for eight months.  A proud and strong-willed man, he eventually returned to the stage and to teaching. He said, \"I don't have the will for singing but I must do it, because, in a sense, it is a sign that I have overcome the tragedy. Singing is a form of admitting that I'm alive.\"\n\nKraus died on 10 September 1999 in [[Madrid]], at the age of 71, after a long illness.\n\n==Complete repertoire==\n{{Main|Repertoire of Alfredo Kraus}}\n==Videography==\n* ''[[The Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala]]'' (1983), Deutsche Grammophon DVD, 00440-073-4538, 2009\n* ''[[James Levine's 25th Anniversary Metropolitan Opera Gala]]'' (1996), Deutsche Grammophon DVD, B0004602-09, 2005\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Alfredo Kraus auditorium D81 5089 (25727538068).jpg|Alfredo Kraus auditorium\nFile:Alfredo Kraus auditorium D81 5108 (38889644124).jpg|Alfredo Kraus auditorium\nFile:Alfredo Kraus auditorium EM1B8988 (25727372108).jpg|Alfredo Kraus auditorium\nFile:Alfredo Kraus D81 5092 (39597907491).jpg|Statue of Alfredo Kraus outside the auditorium \n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*[[Elizabeth Forbes (musicologist)|Forbes, Elizabeth]], [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990914/ai_n14253926/print Obituary: Alfredo Kraus], ''[[The Independent]]'', September 14, 1999.\n*Hamilton, David.

It is often contrasted with, or used as the basis for, works of [[fan fiction]]. The alternative terms '''mythology''', '''timeline''', '''universe''' and '''continuity''' are often used, with the first of these being used especially to refer to a richly detailed fictional canon requiring a large degree of [[suspension of disbelief]] (e.g. an entire imaginary world and history), while the latter two typically refer to a single arc where all events are directly connected chronologically. Other times, the word can mean \"to be acknowledged by the creator(s)\".\n\nInfluential or widely accepted fan theories may be referred as \"[[#Fanon|fanon]]\", a [[portmanteau]] of ''fan'' and ''canon''.

All nominations are considered at an initial meeting at the beginning of November. The final selection process takes place in the middle of November and the names are released to the media in December.\n\nEach nomination is eligible for three consecutive years.

All nominations are considered at an initial meeting at the beginning of November. The final selection process takes place in the middle of November and the names are released to the media in December.\n\nEach nomination is eligible for three consecutive years. If at the end of three consecutive years of eligibility, a nomination has not been selected for induction, the nomination must sit inactive for a period of one year after which the nomination can be resubmitted. \n\n===Banquet of Champions===\nThe BC Sports Hall of Fame hosts an annual Banquet of Champions, the official induction and public recognition ceremony, attracting over 1000 guests.
