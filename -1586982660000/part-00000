Fuad's administration began to modernize everything in the country including economy, military, education, etc. The military modernization was focused on mechanization, building new military schools and mobilizing more men & reestablishing units. In 1928, the corps' name was changed to ''Royal Egyptian Cavalry Corps.'' The mechanization process  completely modernized the [[Egyptian Cavalry Corps]] whose many units (except the Royal Guards) replaced their traditional horse formations with Armored Vehicles and Tanks so that by the late 1930s all of the Corps was mechanized.\n\n=== World War II ===\nInformation about the Egyptian Armored units that fought are not totally known, it's only known that Egypt had around 7 Cavalry Regiments and that the 12th & 16th Regiments fought on the western desert campaign. A huge change also happened in the Corps, where the Cavalry before the war was using Armored Cars and [[Light tank|Light Tanks]] while prior to the war and after it the Corps started to use Medium and [[Heavy tank|Heavy Tanks]] (i.e. Crusader MKII, Matilda, Centurion, etc). \n\n=== First Arab-Israel War ===\nDuring the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|First Arab-Israeli war,]] Egyptian Cavalry units were sent with the 20,000 man strong Expeditionary forces. They made use of [[M4 Sherman|M4 Shermans]] and [[Light Tank Mk VI|Vickers MKII.]] \n\n=== Suez Crisis ===\nArmored Corps involvement in the 1956 war began on October 29, 1956, when a [[reconnaissance]] regiment, followed by the 1st and 2nd Armoured Groups (brigades) was ordered to cross the Canal, from its location in the [[Deversoir Air Base|Deversoir]] area to the eastern side to counter Israeli advances. The plan was to drive the division into [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and attack [[Cairo]] from the Northeast but this plan was quickly exposed and the division was sent to the Port Said front instead. \n\n=== North Yemen Civil War ===\nAs the political and military situation worsened after the [[1962 Yemeni coup d'\u00e9tat]], Egypt decided to intervene in the [[North Yemen Civil War]] with a small military force, and then later with a large scale invasion force. The Egyptian Armored Corps fought there extensively, with the [[4th Armoured Division (Egypt)|4th Armoured Division]] and armored brigades supporting infantry divisions. Their most notable service there was during the Ramadan Offensive.\n\n=== Six-Day War ===\nThe Egyptian Armored Corps were obliterated in Sinai during the [[Six-Day War]].

The Armored Corps replaced the old T-54s and T-34s with T-62s, got trained on newer tactics, new better commanders got in command and new units were formed. \n=== Yom Kippur War ===\nAs the Egyptian Military was modernized after Six Day War, the Armored Corps got new formations, equipment and strategies of attacking such as adding a reserve armored brigade to armored divisions and replacing the old T-34s and SU-100s with T-62s and BMP-1s. \n\n==== Operation Badr ====\nArtillery bombarded the [[Bar Lev Line]] fortifications at the beginning of the [[Yom Kippur War]]. Supporting Infantry stormed the east bank of [[Suez Canal]] engaging [[Israel Defense Force]] personnel. Israeli reservist armoured forces began engaging the Egyptian forces, but were defeated by Anti-Tank squadrons using the [[AT-3 Sagger]] wire-guided anti-tank missiles. Israeli Armored units lost approximately 320 of 400 tanks to these Anti-Tank Squadrons.\n\nEgyptian Infantry seized a number hardpoints and fortresses along the [[Bar Lev Line]] through a series of battles. On October 7th, Egyptian Armored units of the [[Second Army (Egypt)|2nd]] and [[Third Army (Egypt)|3rd Armies]] and [[Port Said]] Sector passed over the bridgeheads made by pontoons constructed by the Egyptian Combat Engineers and entered combat with the Infantry formations in several battles such as [[Battle of Firdan]] alongside the [[2nd Infantry Division (Egypt)|2nd Infantry Division]] and the heavy Armored battles of [[El Qantara, Egypt|El Qantarah]] alongside the [[18th Infantry Division (Egypt)|18th Infantry Division]].\n\nThe Armored Corps's most notable action throughout the war was the advance of the 12th Brigade of the [[4th Armoured Division (Egypt)|4th Armoured Division]] 22 KM deep into Sinai without having Air or Artillery cover or even Anti-Tank support against a fully prepared Israeli force, although the Brigade wasn't supported very well so it managed to trick the Israeli defenders and made a surprise attack on them which led to heavy casualties on the Israeli side, however, the Israelis ultimately defeated them.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== Gulf War ===\nAfter Iraq invaded Kuwait, Egypt joined the [[Coalition of the Gulf War]].

It is a day and boarding school for about 574 pupils between the ages of eleven and eighteen, and a member of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]].\n\n== History ==\nThe nineteenth century saw the founding of a large number of new schools in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], especially by the churches\u2014including the [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodist Church]]. Although there were already several leading schools that offered an education for the sons of Ministers of the church, some [[Methodists]] were asking also for schools to be established for sons of lay church members. The Methodist Conference set up a committee to look at the possibility of starting a new school at either [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]].\n\nFollowing several visits to Cambridge, they discovered that a twenty-acre (80,000 m<sup>2</sup>) site called \"The Leys Estate\" was being offered for sale. The estate was situated within easy reach of the city centre on the [[Trumpington Road]], and it was close to the [[River Cam]] and to a number of Cambridge Colleges. The estate was acquired for the sum of \u00a314,275 on 27 September 1872. The [[William Fiddian Moulton|Reverend Doctor W. F. Moulton]], who had been the secretary of the committee, was asked to become [[head teacher|headmaster]] of the new school. The school opened on 16 February 1875 with sixteen boys, all from English Methodist families. After two years there were 100 pupils.\n\nDuring the twentieth century, The Leys grew significantly and by 1930 the number of pupils had reached 271. During [[World War Two]], the school temporarily moved to the Atholl Palace Hotel in [[Pitlochry]], [[Scotland]], returning to Cambridge in 1946. During the [[Cold War]], the school was designated the auxiliary headquarters to the [[Regional Seat of Government]] for Cambridge in time of war.<ref>http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/features/sfs/file5.htm The Leys School was designated a Regional Seat of Government in wartime</ref> Today the majority of the pupils are boarders and since the admission of girls to the [[Sixth Form]] in the 1980s, the school has become fully [[co-educational]]. It now accepts pupils from the age of eleven, rather than the age of thirteen as it was before.\n\n[[File:Leys Gates.JPG|thumb|250px|left|School gates]]\nDue to its location, the school is popular with [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] academics as a place to send their children, as well as a place to teach. For example the [[physicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]] sent his son to the school and gave a number of talks to its pupils.\n\n== Principles ==\nDespite its [[Methodist]] traditions it has, for more than fifty years, been liberal on religion (although never secular). Many pupils received [[confirmation]] into the [[Church of England]] in the [[Memorial Chapel, The Leys School|school chapel]], and some others have had religious backgrounds from faiths other than the Christianity. Despite its religious liberalism, The Leys is predominantly a Christian school and they state openly that \"The School\u2019s Christian ethos lies at the heart of our education philosophy.\"\n\nPupils attend chapel services  twice a week; a weekday service on a Friday afternoon plus Sunday services with the whole boarding community on a monthly basis with a weekly service with just their House on another specified day of the week. In addition, [[Holy Communion]] takes place once a term.\n\nThe school motto is \"''In Fide Fiducia''\" (Latin for \"In Faith, Trust\"), which is also the motto for its associated [[Preparatory school (England)|prep school]], [[St Faith's School]]. The two schools make up The Leys and St Faith's Foundation. The school song is Rev. B. Hellier's ''\u03a7\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5''.\n\n== Academic results ==\n{{Update|section|date=April 2015}}\n\n===A Levels===\n===2016 A Level results===\n103 pupils sat A Levels this summer, The Leys achieved an overall pass rate of 100%.  75% of all results were at grades A*-B, with 42% at A grade or better.\n\n===GCSEs===\nHalf of the Year 11 pupils achieved 9 or more A*s and A grades at GCSE.  100% of Leysian pupils secured five or more A*-C grades, including English and Mathematics. Over two thirds of all GCSEs taken resulted in an A* or A grade; over 99% produced an A*-C pass.\n\n== Sport ==\nThe main sports played by boys during the three terms are:\n*[[Rugby union]] (Autumn)\n* Rowing\n*Grass and [[AstroTurf]] [[Field Hockey|Hockey]] (Spring)\n*[[Cricket]] (Summer)\n*[[Tennis]]\n*Football\n\nGirls play:\n*Hockey (Autumn)\n*[[Netball]] (Spring)\n*[[Tennis]] (Summer)\n\nThe school has a range of sports facilities spread across its {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} site. Other than the above-mentioned sports, the sports pitches include [[hardcourt|concrete]], [[grass court|grass]] and AstroTurf tennis courts and a football pitch. The AstroTurf pitches are fully lit for night-time play. Indoor facilities include a fully equipped [[fitness centre]], a sports hall for indoor sports such as [[badminton]] and [[netball]], three [[squash (sport)|squash]] courts and an [[aerobics]] studio. The school has a 25-meter heated indoor swimming pool and a rowing boathouse on the [[River Cam]] as well as several boats.\n\nThe Leys' U15 Rugby team won the national [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-1166415/Daily-Mail-RBS-U15-Vase-Leys-unleash-armoury-sink-Kings-Macc.html 2008/09] ''[[Daily Mail]]/[[The Royal Bank of Scotland|RBS]] Vase'' - team achieved the double by winning the U18 Vase in [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-2125062/Daily-Mail-RBS-U18-Vase-The-Leys-16-Ravens-Wood-8.html 2011/12]\n\nThe Leys swims, competing against [[Eton College|Eton]] (the only team to do so), and on a national level at the annual ''Bath Cup''.\n\nThere is also a very active rowing club, with a newly-refurbished boat house in position on the Cam, shared with King's, Churchill and Selwyn Colleges. Along with sailing (at [[St. Ives, Cambridgeshire|St. Ives]]), this is a minority sport, counted among \"pitch games\" (the school's name for non-[[team sport]]s).  Other pitch games, include [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[badminton]], [[tennis]], [[sport of athletics|athletics]], [[karate]], [[Eton Fives]] and [[golf]].\n\nFamous Leysian sportsmen include Neil White (Olympic hockey in 1948); [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] (Captain of England's cricket team); Geoff Windsor-Lewis (Wales Rugby, 1960); Paul Svehlik (England and Great Britain Hockey); and Neil Christie (Olympic rowing, 1976 and 1980).\n\n== Houses ==\nThere are 11 separate houses at the Leys, the oldest being School House founded in 1875.\n\n*'''School''' is a thirteen to eighteen boys' boarding house with 30\u201335 boarders and 18-20 home boarders.

Hilton is reported to have said that the inspiration for the protagonist, Chips, came chiefly from [[William Henry Balgarnie|W.H. Balgarnie]], one of the masters at The Leys (1900\u201330) who was in charge of the Leys Fortnightly (where Hilton's first short stories and essays were published). Over the years old boys have written to Geoffery Houghton, a master of The Leys for a number of years and a historian of the school, confirming the links between Chips and Balgarnie. As with Mr. Chips, Balgarnie died at the school, at the age of 82, having been linked with the school for 51 years and living his last years in modest lodgings opposite the school. Again, like Mr. Chips, Balgarnie was a strict disciplinarian, but would also invite boys to visit him for tea and biscuits.\n\nHilton wrote, upon Balgarnie's death that \"Balgarnie was, I suppose, the chief model for my story. When I read so many other stories about public school life, I am struck by the fact that I suffered no such purgatory as their authors apparently did, and much of this miracle was due to Balgarnie.\" [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2002/12/09/batc09.xml] Furthermore, the facial hair of one of the masters at The Leys earned him the nickname \"Chops,\" a likely inspiration for Mr. Chips' name.\n\n== The Leys Memorial ==\nThe [[Memorial Chapel, The Leys School|Memorial Chapel of The Leys]] is situated on the grounds of the school. It was built as a memorial to the first headmaster of The Leys, [[William Fiddian Moulton]]. Plans for the chapel, designed by architect Robert Curwen, were first presented to the school's second headmaster, W. T. A. Barber; he deemed the project an unnecessary luxury. Services were held in the school hall until 1904 when the governors approved the chapel's construction. The cost, including all furnishings, was estimated in 1925 to have been \u00a339,000.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid at the marble West Door by [[Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont]] on 8 June 1905 and the chapel was consecrated on 27 October 1906. The building's design is [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], to complement the surrounding buildings. All visible woodwork is in [[oak]]. The roof comprises elaborately worked tussels{{clarify|truss?|date=November 2018}} and [[tracery]] work, somewhat after the lines of the famous roof of [[Westminster Hall]]. The floor is of alternating black and white marble. The chapel was designed to seat 350 boys, with the west balcony reserved for household staff.\n\nIn the First World War, 927 Leysians joined the [[British armed forces|armed services]] and 146 of them died. A memorial to the old Leysians who died, costing \u00a348,000 and funded by donation, was on 6 June 1920 unveiled by the [[George VI|Duke of York]]. The memorial consists of four rows of names divided in the middle by a statue of an armoured [[St George]], below which is written \"To The Immortal Memory of Old Leysians Who Fell In The War Of 1914\u20131919\", and in large block capitals the words \"My Marks And Scars With Me To Be A Witness For Me That I Have Fought His Battles Who Now Will Be My Reward.\"\n\nThe Chapel has fourteen windows; the Governors commissioned H. J. Salisbury to decorate them according to a unified theme.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Please clarify|clarification needed]]'']</sup> The work was modelled on the windows of the [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]. Because the Leys is a Methodist school, the work was required to be simple and avoid complex symbolism. All but one of the windows depicts passages from the New Testament concerning the story of [[Christ]]; the large window over the main entrance instead shows ten Old Testament subjects forecasting the coming of the [[Messiah]].\n\nThe [[Pulpit]] is made of oak and has a brass inscription reading \"To the Glory of God and for the Preaching of His holy word this Pulpit was carved by Anne Hobson, Helen Mary Chubb, and George Hayter Chubb, and presented by the latter to The Leys, October, 1906.\"\n\n== The Leys Thistle ==\nThe Scottish community at the school set up the 'Leys Thistle' in October 1915 in order to unite Scottish families while they were away from Scotland. The 'Thistle' was created by Scottish members of North 'A'. Following the first meeting on Halloween 1915, the 'rush to join was tremendous'<ref>{{cite web |title=The Leys Thistle, March 1917 |url=http://leysheritage.daisy.websds.net/Filename.ashx?systemFileName=Leys1917_Thistle+_01.pdf&origFilename=Leys1917_Thistle+_01.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> and many applicants were said to have lied about Scottish heritage to get into the club, such was the demand. The publication of the society was called the 'Leys Thistle' and the first publication was in March 1917. The motto of the club is ''[[Nemo Me Impune Lacessit]]'' or 'no one touches me with impunity'.\n\nThe first publication of the 'The Leys Thistle' states that the club had only three rules:\n* 'That we, a brotherhood of fellows, united with each other to help and do anything can do to live up to the glorious traditions of Scotland.'\n* 'To be an influence for good in the School: although we can't do much, still we can live decent and clean sportsmen's lives.'\n* \"To keep the society going: although the older fellows are leaving, still we look to younger generations to keep the flag flying.'\n\n==Notable alumni==\nKnown as '''Old Leysians''', they include:\n\n===Academia===\n*[[James Hope Moulton|James Moulton]] (1875\u201381)\n*[[John Clapham (economic historian)|Sir John Clapham]] (North 'A' House, 1887\u201392): Historian\n*[[Reginald Hine]], Historian\n*[[Louis Arnaud Reid]] (1909-1912): writer on aesthetics; foundation professor of the philosophy of education, London Institute of Education; Leys Board of Governors\n*[[Eric A.

It is a day and boarding school for about 574 pupils between the ages of eleven and eighteen, and a member of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]].\n\n== History ==\nThe nineteenth century saw the founding of a large number of new schools in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], especially by the churches\u2014including the [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodist Church]]. Although there were already several leading schools that offered an education for the sons of Ministers of the church, some [[Methodists]] were asking also for schools to be established for sons of lay church members. The Methodist Conference set up a committee to look at the possibility of starting a new school at either [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]].\n\nFollowing several visits to Cambridge, they discovered that a twenty-acre (80,000 m<sup>2</sup>) site called \"The Leys Estate\" was being offered for sale. The estate was situated within easy reach of the city centre on the [[Trumpington Road]], and it was close to the [[River Cam]] and to a number of Cambridge Colleges. The estate was acquired for the sum of \u00a314,275 on 27 September 1872. The [[William Fiddian Moulton|Reverend Doctor W. F. Moulton]], who had been the secretary of the committee, was asked to become [[head teacher|headmaster]] of the new school. The school opened on 16 February 1875 with sixteen boys, all from English Methodist families. After two years there were 100 pupils.\n\nDuring the twentieth century, The Leys grew significantly and by 1930 the number of pupils had reached 271. During [[World War Two]], the school temporarily moved to the Atholl Palace Hotel in [[Pitlochry]], [[Scotland]], returning to Cambridge in 1946. During the [[Cold War]], the school was designated the auxiliary headquarters to the [[Regional Seat of Government]] for Cambridge in time of war.<ref>http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/features/sfs/file5.htm The Leys School was designated a Regional Seat of Government in wartime</ref> Today the majority of the pupils are boarders and since the admission of girls to the [[Sixth Form]] in the 1980s, the school has become fully [[co-educational]]. It now accepts pupils from the age of eleven, rather than the age of thirteen as it was before.\n\n[[File:Leys Gates.JPG|thumb|250px|left|School gates]]\nDue to its location, the school is popular with [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] academics as a place to send their children, as well as a place to teach. For example the [[physicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]] sent his son to the school and gave a number of talks to its pupils.\n\n== Principles ==\nDespite its [[Methodist]] traditions it has, for more than fifty years, been liberal on religion (although never secular). Many pupils received [[confirmation]] into the [[Church of England]] in the [[Memorial Chapel, The Leys School|school chapel]], and some others have had religious backgrounds from faiths other than the Christianity. Despite its religious liberalism, The Leys is predominantly a Christian school and they state openly that \"The School\u2019s Christian ethos lies at the heart of our education philosophy.\"\n\nPupils attend chapel services  twice a week; a weekday service on a Friday afternoon plus Sunday services with the whole boarding community on a monthly basis with a weekly service with just their House on another specified day of the week. In addition, [[Holy Communion]] takes place once a term.\n\nThe school motto is \"''In Fide Fiducia''\" (Latin for \"In Faith, Trust\"), which is also the motto for its associated [[Preparatory school (England)|prep school]], [[St Faith's School]]. The two schools make up The Leys and St Faith's Foundation. The school song is Rev. B. Hellier's ''\u03a7\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5''.\n\n== Academic results ==\n{{Update|section|date=April 2015}}\n\n===A Levels===\n===2016 A Level results===\n103 pupils sat A Levels this summer, The Leys achieved an overall pass rate of 100%.  75% of all results were at grades A*-B, with 42% at A grade or better.\n\n===GCSEs===\nHalf of the Year 11 pupils achieved 9 or more A*s and A grades at GCSE.  100% of Leysian pupils secured five or more A*-C grades, including English and Mathematics. Over two thirds of all GCSEs taken resulted in an A* or A grade; over 99% produced an A*-C pass.\n\n== Sport ==\nThe main sports played by boys during the three terms are:\n*[[Rugby union]] (Autumn)\n* Rowing\n*Grass and [[AstroTurf]] [[Field Hockey|Hockey]] (Spring)\n*[[Cricket]] (Summer)\n*[[Tennis]]\n*Football\n\nGirls play:\n*Hockey (Autumn)\n*[[Netball]] (Spring)\n*[[Tennis]] (Summer)\n\nThe school has a range of sports facilities spread across its {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} site. Other than the above-mentioned sports, the sports pitches include [[hardcourt|concrete]], [[grass court|grass]] and AstroTurf tennis courts and a football pitch. The AstroTurf pitches are fully lit for night-time play. Indoor facilities include a fully equipped [[fitness centre]], a sports hall for indoor sports such as [[badminton]] and [[netball]], three [[squash (sport)|squash]] courts and an [[aerobics]] studio. The school has a 25-meter heated indoor swimming pool and a rowing boathouse on the [[River Cam]] as well as several boats.\n\nThe Leys' U15 Rugby team won the national [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-1166415/Daily-Mail-RBS-U15-Vase-Leys-unleash-armoury-sink-Kings-Macc.html 2008/09] ''[[Daily Mail]]/[[The Royal Bank of Scotland|RBS]] Vase'' - team achieved the double by winning the U18 Vase in [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-2125062/Daily-Mail-RBS-U18-Vase-The-Leys-16-Ravens-Wood-8.html 2011/12]\n\nThe Leys swims, competing against [[Eton College|Eton]] (the only team to do so), and on a national level at the annual ''Bath Cup''.\n\nThere is also a very active rowing club, with a newly-refurbished boat house in position on the Cam, shared with King's, Churchill and Selwyn Colleges. Along with sailing (at [[St. Ives, Cambridgeshire|St. Ives]]), this is a minority sport, counted among \"pitch games\" (the school's name for non-[[team sport]]s).  Other pitch games, include [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[badminton]], [[tennis]], [[sport of athletics|athletics]], [[karate]], [[Eton Fives]] and [[golf]].\n\nFamous Leysian sportsmen include Neil White (Olympic hockey in 1948); [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] (Captain of England's cricket team); Geoff Windsor-Lewis (Wales Rugby, 1960); Paul Svehlik (England and Great Britain Hockey); and Neil Christie (Olympic rowing, 1976 and 1980).\n\n== Houses ==\nThere are 11 separate houses at the Leys, the oldest being School House founded in 1875.\n\n*'''School''' is a thirteen to eighteen boys' boarding house with 30\u201335 boarders and 18-20 home boarders.

Hilton is reported to have said that the inspiration for the protagonist, Chips, came chiefly from [[William Henry Balgarnie|W.H. Balgarnie]], one of the masters at The Leys (1900\u201330) who was in charge of the Leys Fortnightly (where Hilton's first short stories and essays were published). Over the years old boys have written to Geoffery Houghton, a master of The Leys for a number of years and a historian of the school, confirming the links between Chips and Balgarnie. As with Mr. Chips, Balgarnie died at the school, at the age of 82, having been linked with the school for 51 years and living his last years in modest lodgings opposite the school. Again, like Mr. Chips, Balgarnie was a strict disciplinarian, but would also invite boys to visit him for tea and biscuits.\n\nHilton wrote, upon Balgarnie's death that \"Balgarnie was, I suppose, the chief model for my story. When I read so many other stories about public school life, I am struck by the fact that I suffered no such purgatory as their authors apparently did, and much of this miracle was due to Balgarnie.\" [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2002/12/09/batc09.xml] Furthermore, the facial hair of one of the masters at The Leys earned him the nickname \"Chops,\" a likely inspiration for Mr. Chips' name.\n\n== The Leys Memorial ==\nThe [[Memorial Chapel, The Leys School|Memorial Chapel of The Leys]] is situated on the grounds of the school. It was built as a memorial to the first headmaster of The Leys, [[William Fiddian Moulton]]. Plans for the chapel, designed by architect Robert Curwen, were first presented to the school's second headmaster, W. T. A. Barber; he deemed the project an unnecessary luxury. Services were held in the school hall until 1904 when the governors approved the chapel's construction. The cost, including all furnishings, was estimated in 1925 to have been \u00a339,000.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid at the marble West Door by [[Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont]] on 8 June 1905 and the chapel was consecrated on 27 October 1906. The building's design is [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], to complement the surrounding buildings. All visible woodwork is in [[oak]]. The roof comprises elaborately worked tussels{{clarify|truss?|date=November 2018}} and [[tracery]] work, somewhat after the lines of the famous roof of [[Westminster Hall]]. The floor is of alternating black and white marble. The chapel was designed to seat 350 boys, with the west balcony reserved for household staff.\n\nIn the First World War, 927 Leysians joined the [[British armed forces|armed services]] and 146 of them died. A memorial to the old Leysians who died, costing \u00a348,000 and funded by donation, was on 6 June 1920 unveiled by the [[George VI|Duke of York]]. The memorial consists of four rows of names divided in the middle by a statue of an armoured [[St George]], below which is written \"To The Immortal Memory of Old Leysians Who Fell In The War Of 1914\u20131919\", and in large block capitals the words \"My Marks And Scars With Me To Be A Witness For Me That I Have Fought His Battles Who Now Will Be My Reward.\"\n\nThe Chapel has fourteen windows; the Governors commissioned H. J. Salisbury to decorate them according to a unified theme.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Please clarify|clarification needed]]'']</sup> The work was modelled on the windows of the [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]. Because the Leys is a Methodist school, the work was required to be simple and avoid complex symbolism. All but one of the windows depicts passages from the New Testament concerning the story of [[Christ]]; the large window over the main entrance instead shows ten Old Testament subjects forecasting the coming of the [[Messiah]].\n\nThe [[Pulpit]] is made of oak and has a brass inscription reading \"To the Glory of God and for the Preaching of His holy word this Pulpit was carved by Anne Hobson, Helen Mary Chubb, and George Hayter Chubb, and presented by the latter to The Leys, October, 1906.\"\n\n== 'The Leys Thistle' ==\nThe Scottish community at the school set up the 'The Leys Thistle' in October 1915 in order to unite Scottish families while they were away from Scotland. The 'Thistle' was created by Scottish members of North 'A'. Following the first meeting on Halloween 1915, the 'rush to join was tremendous'<ref>{{cite web |title=The Leys Thistle, March 1917 |url=http://leysheritage.daisy.websds.net/Filename.ashx?systemFileName=Leys1917_Thistle+_01.pdf&origFilename=Leys1917_Thistle+_01.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> and many applicants were said to have lied about Scottish heritage to get into the club, such was the demand. The publication of the society was called the 'Leys Thistle' and the first publication was in March 1917. The motto of the club is ''[[Nemo Me Impune Lacessit]]'' or 'no one touches me with impunity'.\n\nThe first publication of the 'The Leys Thistle' states that the club had only three rules:\n* 'That we, a brotherhood of fellows, united with each other to help and do anything can do to live up to the glorious traditions of Scotland.'\n* 'To be an influence for good in the School: although we can't do much, still we can live decent and clean sportsmen's lives.'\n* \"To keep the society going: although the older fellows are leaving, still we look to younger generations to keep the flag flying.'\n\n==Notable alumni==\nKnown as '''Old Leysians''', they include:\n\n===Academia===\n*[[James Hope Moulton|James Moulton]] (1875\u201381)\n*[[John Clapham (economic historian)|Sir John Clapham]] (North 'A' House, 1887\u201392): Historian\n*[[Reginald Hine]], Historian\n*[[Louis Arnaud Reid]] (1909-1912): writer on aesthetics; foundation professor of the philosophy of education, London Institute of Education; Leys Board of Governors\n*[[Eric A.

Daegu and surrounding [[North Gyeongsang Province]] are often referred to as [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk]], with a total population over 5 million. \n\nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} from the seacoast, near the [[Geumho River]] and its mainstream, [[Nakdong River]] in [[Gyeongsang-do]]. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the [[Yeongnam]] [[List of regions of Korea|region]]. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom [[Jinhan]]. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the [[Silla Kingdom]], which unified the [[Korean Peninsula]]. During the [[Joseon Dynasty]] period, the city was the capital of [[Gyeongsang-do]], one of the traditional [[Eight Provinces of Korea|eight provinces]] of the country.\n\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eslstarter.com/south-korea-province-guide-daegu.php|title=Teaching jobs in South Korea - ESLstarter|website=www.eslstarter.com}}</ref> Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abcarticledirectory.com/Article/Daegu---The-City-of-Textile-Industry/1669374|title=Daegu - The City of Textile Industry|access-date=2012-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726220423/http://www.abcarticledirectory.com/Article/Daegu---The-City-of-Textile-Industry/1669374|archive-date=2012-07-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city.

In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">YUM (Yeungnam University Museum).

Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\n\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the [[Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms]] ([[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]], [[Jinhan]], and [[Byeonhan]]) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as [[Dalgubeol]]. It was absorbed into the kingdom of [[Silla]] no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current [[Dalseong Park]].\n\n[[File:\uce60\uace1\uc1a1\ub9bc\uc0ac\uc624\uce35\uc804\ud0d1\uc0ac\ub9ac\uc7a5\uce58.jpg|left|thumb|Reliquary from eighth-century Silla, [[Daegu National Museum]]]]\n\n===Silla===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's [[Tang Dynasty]]. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King [[Sinmun of Silla|Sinmun]] considered moving the capital from [[Gyeongju]] to Daegu, but was unable to do so.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 76 and Shin (1999).</ref>  This initiative is known only through a single line in the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure.<ref>Lee (1984) and Shin (1999) both make this assumption.</ref> The city was given its current name in 757.\n\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu.<ref>FPCP (Foundation for the Preservation of Cultural Properties). ''Daegu Chilgok Sam Taekji Munhwayejeok Balguljosa Bogoseo'' [Excavation Report of the Cultural Site at Localities 2 and 3, Building Area 3, Chilgok, Daegu]. 3 vols. Antiquities Research Report 62. FPCP, Gyeongju, 2000.</ref> The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo===\nDuring the [[Later Three Kingdoms period]], 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with [[Hubaekje]]. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of [[Goryeo]] under [[Wang Geon]] and those of Hubaekje under [[Gyeon Hwon]]. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general [[Shin Sung-gyeom]]. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of [[Goryeo]].\n\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"[[Ansim Station|Ansim]]\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"[[Banwol-dong, Ansan|Banwol]]\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\n\nIn the [[Goryeo]] period, the first edition of the ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'' was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 131.</ref>  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the [[Mongol invasions of Korea]].<ref>Lee (1984), p. 149.</ref>\n\n===Joseon===\n[[File:Daegu dalseongdo.jpg|thumb|left|Daegu in the 18th century]]\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the [[Great Yeongnam Road]] which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and [[Jinju]].\n\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the [[Gyeongsang-do]], which is current Daegu, [[Busan]], [[Ulsan]], [[Gyeongsangbuk-do]], and [[Gyeongsangnam-do]]. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\n\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the [[Yangnyeongsi]] herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the [[Nakdong River]] valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. [[Seomun Market]], which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n===Korean Empire and colonial rule===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern [[post office]]s, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 294.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed [[Gyeongbu Line]] main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\n\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets [[Dongseongno]] and [[Bukseongno]], \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\n\n[[Independence movement]]s against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the [[Independence Club]] was opened in the town.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 302.</ref>  As the demise of the [[Korean Empire]] approached in 1907, local citizens led by [[Seo Sang-don]] organized the [[National Debt Repayment Movement]]. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the [[March 1st movement]] of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 343.</ref>\n\n===After 1945===\nIn 1946, the [[Daegu October Incident]] took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 377.</ref> An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen.<ref>[http://www.greenleft.org.au/2000/412/23267 Green Left \u2013 Features: HISTORICAL FEATURE: The Korean War \u2013 a war of counter-revolution<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111154939/http://www.greenleft.org.au/2000/412/23267 |date=2007-11-11 }}</ref> It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the [[South Korean presidential election of 1960|presidential election]] of that year.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 384.</ref>\n\nDaegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.<ref>Cumings (1997), pp. 243\u2013244.</ref>  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in [[Yeosu]] the previous month.<ref>Nahm (1996), p. 379.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], heavy fighting occurred nearby along the [[Nakdong River]]. Daegu sat inside the [[Pusan Perimeter]], however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, [[Politicide|political killing]]s of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the [[Battle of Taegu]].\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of [[Park Chung-hee]], when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level [[Special cities of South Korea|directly governed city]] (''Jikhalsi''), and was redesignated as a [[Special cities of South Korea|metropolitan city]] (''Gwangyeoksi'') in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest [[metropolitan area]] in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\n\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of [[COVID-19]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fear grips Daegu, South Korea, amid coronavirus |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/fear-grips-daegu-south-korea-amid-coronavirus/story?id=69175021 |work=ABC News |date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Daegu city hall context.jpg|thumb|right|Daegu City Hall]]\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in [[Jung District, Daegu|Jung District]] and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in [[Buk District, Daegu|Buk District]]. The provincial government will be relocated to [[Andong]] in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the [[Liberty Korea Party]], the main [[Conservatism|conservative]] political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: [[Roh Tae-woo]] and [[Park Geun-hye]]. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in [[Elections in South Korea|elections]].\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n[[File:00-daegu-en.svg|362.988x362.988px|thumb|Administrative divisions]]\n{{Main|List of districts and county of Daegu}}\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (''Gu'') and 1 county (''Gun'')\n* [[Jung District, Daegu|Jung District]] ({{lang|ko|\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340}}) \u2013 ''means the central district.''\n* [[Dong District, Daegu|Dong District]] ({{lang|ko|\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340}}) \u2013 ''means the east district.''\n* [[Seo District, Daegu|Seo District]] ({{lang|ko|\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340}}) \u2013 ''means the west district.''\n* [[Nam District, Daegu|Nam District]] ({{lang|ko|\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340}}) \u2013 ''means the south district.''\n* [[Buk District, Daegu|Buk District]] ({{lang|ko|\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340}}) \u2013 ''means the north district.''\n* [[Suseong District]] ({{lang|ko|\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340}})\n* [[Dalseo District]] ({{lang|ko|\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340}})\n* [[Dalseong County]] ({{lang|ko|\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1}})\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:Countryandcitydaegu.jpg|none|thumb|1031x1031px|View of both the city of Daegu, with Jisan-dong and Beommul-dong]]\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains.

In [[Holdridge life zones|Holdridge climate classification]], Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year.

is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are [[textile]]s, [[metal]]s and [[machinery]]. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as [[Daegu Bank]], [[Korea Delphi]], [[Hwasung corp.]], and [[TaeguTec]] are situated in this city, and [[Samsung]] and [[Kolon Industries|Kolon]] were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\n\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk]] region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006.<ref>{{in lang|ko}} http://www.yeongnam.co.kr/Pdf/2007/03/17/120101-17032007999.pdf The Yeongnam Ilbo (2007-03-17)</ref> The electronics industries in [[Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do|Gumi]] and the steel industries in [[Pohang]] provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for [[Anycall]] ([[Samsung Mobile]]) and [[POSCO]]'s main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone]] by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\n\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the [[Korean Peninsula]] with [[Seoul]] in the center and [[Pyongyang]] in the north (currently [[North Korea]]), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like [[Seomun Market]] are still flourishing in the city.\n\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\n\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n[[File:2017\ub144 \ub300\uad6c\uad6d\uc81c\ubbf8\ub798\uc790\ub3d9\ucc28\uc5d1\uc2a4\ud3ec.jpg|none|thumb|Daegu International Future Auto EXPO 2017]]\n[[File:2017 \ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6dICT\uc735\ud569\uc5d1\uc2a4\ud3ec.jpg|none|thumb|Korean ICT Convergence Expo]]\n[[File:\ud55c\uad6d\ub1cc\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0-\ucca8\ub2e8\uc7a5\ube44\uc13c\ud130.jpg|none|thumb|Korean Brain Research Center - Advanced Equipment Center]]\n[[File:2017 \uadf8\ub9b0\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc5d1\uc2a4\ud3ec.jpg|none|thumb|2017 Green Energy Expo]]\n<br />\n===Fashion industry===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its [[fashion]] industry based on its textile and [[clothing]] manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the [http://www.fashiondaegu.com/eng/index.asp Daegu Fashion Fair]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [http://www.previewin.com/ Preview in Daegu] annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.<ref>{{in lang|ko}} http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/11/24/2009112401092.html The Chosun Ilbo (2009-11-25)</ref>\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n[[File:Daegu skyline as seen from KNU's Technopark.jpg|thumb|right|Daegu skyline as seen from KNU's Technopark]]\nGenerally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, [[Buddhism]] has been strong; today there are still many temples. [[Korean Confucianism|Confucianism]] is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n===Sights===\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called [[Gatbawi]] on the top of Gwanbong, [[Palgongsan]]. It is famous for its stone [[Gat (hat)|gat]] (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NXYPDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT394&dq=Gatbawi+daegu&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4qKOs_rjbAhUrEqYKHS5tC58Q6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q=Gatbawi%20daegu&f=false|title=Insight Guides South Korea|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, [[Gyeongsan]], [[Gyeongbuk]].\n\n[[File:Donghwasa Temple.jpg|thumb|left|Scenery of [[Donghwasa]]]]\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as [[Donghwasa]], [[Pagyesa]], and [[Buinsa]]. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon ({{Korean|labels=no|\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0|\u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662}}) and Nokdong-seowon ({{Korean|labels=no|\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0|\u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662}}) are also located in the suburbs.\n\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the [[Otgol village]] (''Gyeongju Choi'' clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (''Nampyeong Mun'''s). In the urban area, the [[Joseon Dynasty]]'s administrative or educational buildings including [[Gyeongsang-gamyeong]] ({{lang|ko|\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df}}) and [[Daegu-hyanggyo]] ({{lang|ko|\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821}}) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called [[Yeongnam-jeilmun]] ({{lang|ko|\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580}}, meaning the first gateway in [[Yeongnam]]), has been restored in [[Mangudang Park]]. Western style modern architecture like [[Gyesan Cathedral]] and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area.

Several buildings, in the present [[Keisung Academy]] and the [[Kyungpook National University|KNU]] middle/high school, are famous too.\n\n[[Yangnyeongsi]] ({{lang|ko|\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02}}) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\n\nNearby tourist attractions include [[Haeinsa]]\u2014a [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple that houses the ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'' (a woodblock edition of the ''[[Tripitaka]]'' and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of [[Hapcheon]], [[Gyeongnam]]. The historic city of [[Gyeongju]], [[Gyeongbuk]], the capital of the ancient kingdom of [[Silla]] is located east of Daegu.\n\n===Mountains and parks===\n{{See also|List of parks in Daegu}}\n[[File:Dalgubeol Grand Bell in Daegu.jpg|thumb|right|Dalgubeol-daejong, a city bell at the Gukchae Bosang Park]]\n[[File:Daegu Botanical Garden Bridge.jpg|thumb|Daegu Botanical Garden bridge]]\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit.<ref>[http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=1751292 cable car ride]</ref> There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\n\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only [[zoo]] and some monuments as well as the wall. [[Duryu Park]] or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has [[Daegu Tower]], [[Woobang Land]], Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong ({{lang|ko|\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418}}), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n===Downtown and shopping===\n\n[[Dongseongno]] ({{lang|ko|\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def}}) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the [[Daegu Station]] to ''Jung-ang pachulso'' (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city [[Jung-gu, Daegu|Jung-gu]]. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of [[Daegu-eupseong]] ({{lang|ko|\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce}}, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, [[Seoul]].  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.<ref>{{in lang|ko}} http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20090210026021 The Seoul Shinmun (2009-02-10)</ref>\n[[File:Seomun Market Gate.JPG|thumb|The sign of the [[Seomun Market]]]]\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in [[Dalseo-gu]] is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around [[Kyungpook National University]] in [[Buk-gu, Daegu|Buk-gu]]. ''Deuran-gil'' (means the street inside the field) in [[Suseong-gu]] is known for many restaurants.\n\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local [[Daegu Department Store]] also operates two branches, while another local chain, [[Donga Department Store]] operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as [[Seomun Market]] and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n===Festivals===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called ''Seokjeondaeje'' is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\n\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. [[Daegu International Opera Festival]] (DIOF) in October since 2003, [[Daegu International Musical Festival]] (DIMF), and [[Daegu International Bodypainting Festival]] (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\n\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, [[Dongseongno]] festival, [[Palgongsan]] maple festival, [[Biseulsan]] azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\n\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the [[World Bodypainting Festival]] in [[Seeboden]], [[Austria]].\n\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\n\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_2_1.jsp?cid=1987434|script-title=ko:Colorful Daegu Festival (\uceec\ub7ec\ud480\ub300\uad6c\ud398\uc2a4\ud2f0\ubc8c) {{!}} Official Korea Tourism Organization|website=english.visitkorea.or.kr|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref> In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu.

TBC (Taegu Broadcasting Corporation) depends on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]. They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city. Each television broadcasting company has its own radio station as well.\n\n===International Daegu===\nDaegu is largely a homogeneous community that includes few non-Koreans. However, a number of immigrants from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] work in automotive-parts factories on the city's west side. In addition, there is a small group of [[English language|English]]-speaking Westerners working in English schools and university programs. The American military bases are also home to several hundred Americans. Recently Chinese students have begun studying Korean at universities in Daegu, and there is an increasing number of graduate and post-graduate students from other Asian countries. As elsewhere in Korea, Korean food overwhelmingly dominates; Chinese, Japanese and Western food forms the bulk of non-Korean food but recently Indian and Russian foods have become available.\n\nDaegu hosts three [[United States|American]] military bases, [[Camp Henry]], [[Camp George]] which houses Daegu American School, and [[Camp Walker]]. Camp Walker houses Daegu High School for high school children, while Camp George hold the school for elementary and middle school (both of which are primarily for children of military personnel and US Military civilian employees). Camp George also houses most of the married [Enlisted] ranked soldiers. Camp Henry and Camp Walker serve as the primary place of work for all the military personnel. Camp Walker serves as the home to enlisted Sergeants Major and Officer ranked soldiers, Major and up. Although non-military families can enroll their children at the school, most either home-school their children or send them to a small Christian private school which teaches about 25 children near the central business district of Daegu.\n\n==Religion==\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|label1 = Not religious\n|value1 = 32.7\n|color1 = Gray\n|label2 = [[Buddhism]]\n|value2 = 50.5\n|color2 = Gold\n|label3 = [[Protestantism]]\n|value3 = 12\n|color3 = DodgerBlue\n|label4 = [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]\n|value4 = 5.8\n|color4 = DarkOrchid\n}}\nAccording to the census of 2015, of the people of Daegu 50.5% follow [[Buddhism]] and 17.9% follow [[Christianity]] (12% [[Protestantism]] and 5.8% [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 34.7% of the population is mostly not religious or follow other indigenous religions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?orgId=101&tblId=DT_1WD11&vw_cd=MT_ZTITLE&list_id=D21D2&scrId=&seqNo=&lang_mode=ko&obj_var_id=&itm_id=&conn_path=K1&path=%25EC%2582%25AC%25ED%259A%258C%2520%253E%2520%25EC%2582%25AC%25ED%259A%258C%25EC%25A1%25B0%25EC%2582%25AC%2520%253E%2520%25EC%2582%25AC%25ED%259A%258C%25EC%25B0%25B8%25EC%2597%25AC%2520%253E%25201999%25EC%25A2%2585%25EA%25B5%2590%25EC%259D%25B8%25EA%25B5%25AC#|title=KOSIS|website=kosis.kr}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|Education in South Korea}}\n{{As of|2019||df=}}, Daegu has 229 elementary schools, 125 middle schools including the Dong-Pyeong Middle School, and 93 high schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daegu.go.kr/Statistics/Download.ashx?no=321&idx=1&file=14.+%b1%b3%c0%b0%b9%d7%b9%ae%c8%ad.xls |script-title=ko:2009\ub144\ub3c4 \ub300\uad6c\ud1b5\uacc4\uc5f0\ubcf4 \u2169\u2163.\uad50\uc721\ubc0f\ubb38\ud654 |date=2009-04-01 |publisher=Daegu Metropolitan City}}</ref> There are two specialized public high schools which are [[Daegu Science High School]] and [[Taegu Foreign Language High School]], and some other high schools such as [[Keisung Academy]], Gyeongsin High School and Daeryun High School have good grades for university admission.

During the [[Joseon Dynasty]] period, the city was the capital of [[Gyeongsang-do]], one of the traditional [[Eight Provinces of Korea|eight provinces]] of the country.\n\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s\u20131980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry.

Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\n\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the [[Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms]] ([[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]], [[Jinhan]], and [[Byeonhan]]) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as [[Dalgubeol]]. It was absorbed into the kingdom of [[Silla]] no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current [[Dalseong Park]].\n\n[[File:\uce60\uace1\uc1a1\ub9bc\uc0ac\uc624\uce35\uc804\ud0d1\uc0ac\ub9ac\uc7a5\uce58.jpg|left|thumb|Reliquary from eighth-century Silla, [[Daegu National Museum]]]]\n\n===Silla===\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's [[Tang Dynasty]]. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King [[Sinmun of Silla|Sinmun]] considered moving the capital from [[Gyeongju]] to Daegu, but was unable to do so.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 76 and Shin (1999).</ref>  This initiative is known only through a single line in the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure.<ref>Lee (1984) and Shin (1999) both make this assumption.</ref> The city was given its current name in 757.\n\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu.<ref>FPCP (Foundation for the Preservation of Cultural Properties). ''Daegu Chilgok Sam Taekji Munhwayejeok Balguljosa Bogoseo'' [Excavation Report of the Cultural Site at Localities 2 and 3, Building Area 3, Chilgok, Daegu]. 3 vols. Antiquities Research Report 62. FPCP, Gyeongju, 2000.</ref> The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo===\nDuring the [[Later Three Kingdoms period]], 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with [[Hubaekje]]. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of [[Goryeo]] under [[Wang Geon]] and those of Hubaekje under [[Gyeon Hwon]]. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general [[Shin Sung-gyeom]]. However,  the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of [[Goryeo]].\n\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"[[Ansim Station|Ansim]]\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"[[Banwol-dong, Ansan|Banwol]]\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\n\nIn the [[Goryeo]] period, the first edition of the ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'' was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 131.</ref>  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the [[Mongol invasions of Korea]].<ref>Lee (1984), p. 149.</ref>\n\n===Joseon===\n[[File:Daegu dalseongdo.jpg|thumb|left|Daegu in the 18th century]]\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the [[Great Yeongnam Road]] which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and [[Jinju]].\n\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the [[Gyeongsang-do]], which is current Daegu, [[Busan]], [[Ulsan]], [[Gyeongsangbuk-do]], and [[Gyeongsangnam-do]]. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\n\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the [[Yangnyeongsi]] herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the [[Nakdong River]] valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. [[Seomun Market]], which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n===Korean Empire and colonial rule===\nThe Korean hermit kingdom finally opened itself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern [[post office]]s, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 294.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed [[Gyeongbu Line]] main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\n\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets [[Dongseongno]] and [[Bukseongno]], \"east fortress street\" and \"north fortress street\", which now run where the wall once stood.\n\n[[Independence movement]]s against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the [[Independence Club]] was opened in the town.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 302.</ref>  As the demise of the [[Korean Empire]] approached in 1907, local citizens led by [[Seo Sang-don]] organized the [[National Debt Repayment Movement]]. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the [[March 1st movement]] of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 343.</ref>\n\n===After 1945===\nIn 1946, the [[Daegu October Incident]] took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 377.</ref> An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack, killing as many as 38 policemen.<ref>[http://www.greenleft.org.au/2000/412/23267 Green Left \u2013 Features: HISTORICAL FEATURE: The Korean War \u2013 a war of counter-revolution<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111154939/http://www.greenleft.org.au/2000/412/23267 |date=2007-11-11 }}</ref> It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the [[South Korean presidential election of 1960|presidential election]] of that year.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 384.</ref>\n\nDaegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.<ref>Cumings (1997), pp. 243\u2013244.</ref>  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in [[Yeosu]] the previous month.<ref>Nahm (1996), p. 379.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], heavy fighting occurred nearby along the [[Nakdong River]]. Daegu sat inside the [[Pusan Perimeter]], however, so remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, [[Politicide|political killing]]s of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements was fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the [[Battle of Taegu]].\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of [[Park Chung-hee]], when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level [[Special cities of South Korea|directly governed city]] (''Jikhalsi''), and was redesignated as a [[Special cities of South Korea|metropolitan city]] (''Gwangyeoksi'') in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest [[metropolitan area]] in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\n\nIn February 2020, Daegu became known for the spread of [[COVID-19]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fear grips Daegu, South Korea, amid coronavirus |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/fear-grips-daegu-south-korea-amid-coronavirus/story?id=69175021 |work=ABC News |date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Daegu city hall context.jpg|thumb|right|Daegu City Hall]]\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in [[Jung District, Daegu|Jung District]] and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in [[Buk District, Daegu|Buk District]]. The provincial government will be relocated to [[Andong]] in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the [[Liberty Korea Party]], the main [[Conservatism|conservative]] political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: [[Roh Tae-woo]] and [[Park Geun-hye]]. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in [[Elections in South Korea|elections]].\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n[[File:00-daegu-en.svg|362.988x362.988px|thumb|Administrative divisions]]\n{{Main|List of districts and county of Daegu}}\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (''Gu'') and 1 county (''Gun'')\n* [[Jung District, Daegu|Jung District]] ({{lang|ko|\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340}}) \u2013 ''means the central district.''\n* [[Dong District, Daegu|Dong District]] ({{lang|ko|\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340}}) \u2013 ''means the east district.''\n* [[Seo District, Daegu|Seo District]] ({{lang|ko|\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340}}) \u2013 ''means the west district.''\n* [[Nam District, Daegu|Nam District]] ({{lang|ko|\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340}}) \u2013 ''means the south district.''\n* [[Buk District, Daegu|Buk District]] ({{lang|ko|\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340}}) \u2013 ''means the north district.''\n* [[Suseong District]] ({{lang|ko|\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340}})\n* [[Dalseo District]] ({{lang|ko|\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340}})\n* [[Dalseong County]] ({{lang|ko|\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1}})\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:Countryandcitydaegu.jpg|none|thumb|1031x1031px|View of both the city of Daegu, with Jisan-dong and Beommul-dong]]\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains.

The [[Geumho River]] flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.\n\n===Climate===\nDaegu has a cooler version of a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cwa''). In [[Holdridge life zones|Holdridge climate classification]], Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is {{convert|0.6|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and that for August, the warmest month, is {{convert|26.4|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.

is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are [[textile]]s, [[metal]]s and [[machinery]]. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. Many companies such as [[Daegu Bank]], [[Korea Delphi]], [[Hwasung corp.]], and [[TaeguTec]] are situated in this city, and [[Samsung]] and [[Kolon Industries|Kolon]] were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\n\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk]] region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006.<ref>{{in lang|ko}} http://www.yeongnam.co.kr/Pdf/2007/03/17/120101-17032007999.pdf The Yeongnam Ilbo (2007-03-17)</ref> The electronics industries in [[Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do|Gumi]] and the steel industries in [[Pohang]] provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for [[Anycall]] ([[Samsung Mobile]]) and [[POSCO]]'s main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone]] by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\n\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the [[Korean Peninsula]] with [[Seoul]] in the center and [[Pyongyang]] in the north (currently [[North Korea]]), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like [[Seomun Market]] are still flourishing in the city.\n\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\n\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n[[File:2017\ub144 \ub300\uad6c\uad6d\uc81c\ubbf8\ub798\uc790\ub3d9\ucc28\uc5d1\uc2a4\ud3ec.jpg|none|thumb|Daegu International Future Auto EXPO 2017]]\n[[File:2017 \ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6dICT\uc735\ud569\uc5d1\uc2a4\ud3ec.jpg|none|thumb|Korean ICT Convergence Expo]]\n[[File:\ud55c\uad6d\ub1cc\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0-\ucca8\ub2e8\uc7a5\ube44\uc13c\ud130.jpg|none|thumb|Korean Brain Research Center - Advanced Equipment Center]]\n[[File:2017 \uadf8\ub9b0\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc5d1\uc2a4\ud3ec.jpg|none|thumb|2017 Green Energy Expo]]\n<br />\n===Fashion industry===\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its [[fashion]] industry based on its textile and [[clothing]] manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'.

Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon ({{Korean|labels=no|\ub3c4\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0|\u9053\u6771\u66f8\u9662}}) and Nokdong-seowon ({{Korean|labels=no|\ub179\ub3d9\uc11c\uc6d0|\u9e7f\u6d1e\u66f8\u9662}}) are also located in the suburbs.\n\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the [[Otgol village]] (''Gyeongju Choi'' clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (''Nampyeong Mun'''s).

Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\n\nNearby tourist attractions include [[Haeinsa]]\u2014a [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple that houses the ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'' (a woodblock edition of the ''[[Tripitaka]]'' and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of [[Hapcheon]], [[Gyeongnam]]. The historic city of [[Gyeongju]], [[Gyeongbuk]], the capital of the ancient kingdom of [[Silla]] is located east of Daegu.\n\n===Mountains and parks===\n{{See also|List of parks in Daegu}}\n[[File:Dalgubeol Grand Bell in Daegu.jpg|thumb|right|Dalgubeol-daejong, a city bell at the Gukchae Bosang Park]]\n[[File:Daegu Botanical Garden Bridge.jpg|thumb|Daegu Botanical Garden bridge]]\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit.<ref>[http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=1751292 cable car ride]</ref> There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\n\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only [[zoo]] and some monuments as well as the wall. [[Duryu Park]] or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has [[Daegu Tower]], [[Woobang Land]], Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong ({{lang|ko|\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418}}), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n===Downtown and shopping===\n\n[[Dongseongno]] ({{lang|ko|\ub3d9\uc131\ub85c, \u6771\u57ce\u8def}}) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the [[Daegu Station]] to ''Jung-ang pachulso'' (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city [[Jung-gu, Daegu|Jung-gu]]. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of [[Daegu-eupseong]] ({{lang|ko|\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce}}, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, [[Seoul]].  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.<ref>{{in lang|ko}} http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20090210026021 The Seoul Shinmun (2009-02-10)</ref>\n[[File:Seomun Market Gate.JPG|thumb|The sign of the [[Seomun Market]]]]\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors.

''Deuran-gil'' (means the street inside the field) in [[Suseong-gu]] is known for many restaurants.\n\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local [[Daegu Department Store]] also operates two branches, while another local chain, [[Donga Department Store]] operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as [[Seomun Market]] and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n===Festivals===\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called ''Seokjeondaeje'' is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\n\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. [[Daegu International Opera Festival]] (DIOF) in October since 2003, [[Daegu International Musical Festival]] (DIMF), and [[Daegu International Bodypainting Festival]] (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\n\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, [[Dongseongno]] festival, [[Palgongsan]] maple festival, [[Biseulsan]] azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\n\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the [[World Bodypainting Festival]] in [[Seeboden]], [[Austria]].\n\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\n\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_2_1.jsp?cid=1987434|script-title=ko:Colorful Daegu Festival (\uceec\ub7ec\ud480\ub300\uad6c\ud398\uc2a4\ud2f0\ubc8c) {{!}} Official Korea Tourism Organization|website=english.visitkorea.or.kr|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref> In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu.

[[Daegu Metro Line 1|Line 1]] crosses the city from northeast to southwest, while [[Daegu Metro Line 2|Line 2]] crosses from west to east. [[Daegu Metro Line 3|Line 3]] from northwest to southeast is an elevated [[monorail]]. All the lines are and will be operated by the [https://archive.today/20121220011937/http://www.dtro.or.kr/open_content/en/main Daegu Metropolitan Transit Corporation] (DTRO). Another line will operate in a few years as a heavy rail system using the Gumi\u2013Daegu\u2013Gyeongsan section of Gyeongbu Line. Line 4 is a long-range plan and will be a circle line. Fare is 1400 won and 1250 won with a prepaid card. There is a free interchange scheme between the metro and bus within an hour of first use for the prepaid card users.\n\n===Road===\nThere are two types of buses which are local and limited express. Limited express buses have more seats, but often passengers are required to stand. {{As of|2017}}, Local [[bus]] fare costs around 1,400 [[South Korean won|won]], Limited express bus fare would set you back around 1,800 won. Discounted fare is available with a prepaid card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://businfo.daegu.go.kr/ba/page/fare.do|title=Daegu Bus Information_Fare Guide|website=businfo.daegu.go.kr}}</ref>\n\nBus route numbers are made up with 3 digits, each number indicates the area that bus serves. For example, number 407 bus runs from zone four, to zone zero, and then to zone seven. Other routes, usually circular, are named for the districts they serve and numbered 1 through 3.\n\nTraffic is sometimes heavy, however, the major thoroughfares handle fairly high volumes of traffic without too much trouble.\n[[File:\ub300\uad6c\uad6d\uc81c\uacf5\ud56d.jpg|thumb|Daegu International Airport]]\n\n===Air===\nDaegu is served by [[Daegu International Airport]], located in northeastern Daegu.

The match attracted 41,000 spectators, down on expectations owing in part to a one-day tram strike.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Herald|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=League to decide grounds for finals|date=25 May 1945|page=10|author=P.

It was released as the lead single from the soundtrack on November 7, 1995, by [[Arista Records]]. The song was written and produced by [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]]. A mid-tempo [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[ballad]], composed in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[C major]], the song's lyrics speak about growing up and learning to let go. The song garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, many of whom noted Houston's vocal maturity in the song.\n\nIn the United States, it became the third single to debut on top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s history, and Houston's eleventh (and final) number one single. It was later certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for shipments of one million copies. The song also reached number one in Canada and Spain, and the top 10 in Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Sweden. Additionally, it peaked within the top 20 in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. At the [[39th Grammy Awards|39th Annual Grammy Awards]], held on February 26, 1997, \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" received four nominations, including the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year#1990s|Grammy Award for the Song of the Year]], and won in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song#1990s|Best R&B Song]]. The song also won four other awards, including a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award]].\n\nThe [[music video]] for the song, directed by [[Forest Whitaker]], shows close-up scenes of Houston inter-cut with scenes from the film ''Waiting to Exhale''. Houston performed the song at the 39th Grammy Awards ceremony, and on the [[HBO]] special ''[[Classic Whitney Live from Washington, D.C.]]'' in October 1997. It was included in the set-list of Houston's three tours and select dates of various concerts.\n\n== Background and release ==\nIn 1994, Houston signed with [[20th Century Fox]] to play the role of Savannah Jackson in the film ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'', which was adapted from the novel of the same name by [[Terry McMillan]].<ref name=\"fred\"/> Initially, she had no interest in recording songs for the film's soundtrack, as she wanted to concentrate on her acting. The film's director, [[Forest Whitaker]], hired [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds]] to compose the [[film score]] and the accompanying soundtrack.<ref name=\"fred\"/> Though Babyface visited the set of the film and tried to convince her, Houston was determined not to record songs for the soundtrack. She finally agreed after hearing Babyface play one of the songs she liked.<ref name=\"fred\"/> In an interview with [[Fred Bronson]], Babyface explained the development of the song:\n<blockquote>\n\"When Whitney first heard the song, she figured I'd lost it\u2014I couldn't come up with words anymore. And, actually she's right. I couldn't think of anything for that particular part. It felt like it should groove there. But I knew it couldn't groove without any vocals, so I started humming along with it and that's what happened. The 'shoops' came. But they felt so good, I thought 'Why not?' It doesn't have to mean anything.\"<ref name=\"fred\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|page =842}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBabyface produced the song,<ref name=\"fred\"/>  and it was released as the lead single

It was released as the lead single from the soundtrack on November 7, 1995, by [[Arista Records]]. The song was written and produced by [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]]. A mid-tempo [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[ballad]], composed in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[C major]], the song's lyrics speak about growing up and learning to let go. The song garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, many of whom noted Houston's vocal maturity in the song.\n\nIn the United States, it became the third single to debut on top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s history, and Houston's eleventh (and final) number one single. It was later certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for shipments of one million copies. The song also reached number one in Canada and Spain, and the top 10 in Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Sweden. Additionally, it peaked within the top 20 in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. At the [[39th Grammy Awards|39th Annual Grammy Awards]], held on February 26, 1997, \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" received four nominations, including the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year#1990s|Grammy Award for the Song of the Year]], and won in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song#1990s|Best R&B Song]]. The song also won four other awards, including a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award]].\n\nThe [[music video]] for the song, directed by [[Forest Whitaker]], shows close-up scenes of Houston inter-cut with scenes from the film ''Waiting to Exhale''. Houston performed the song at the 39th Grammy Awards ceremony, and on the [[HBO]] special ''[[Classic Whitney Live from Washington, D.C.]]'' in October 1997. It was included in the set-list of Houston's three tours and select dates of various concerts.\n\n== Background and release ==\nIn 1994, Houston signed with [[20th Century Fox]] to play the role of Savannah Jackson in the film ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'', which was adapted from the novel of the same name by [[Terry McMillan]].<ref name=\"fred\"/> Initially, she had no interest in recording songs for the film's soundtrack, as she wanted to concentrate on her acting. The film's director, [[Forest Whitaker]], hired [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds]] to compose the [[film score]] and the accompanying soundtrack.<ref name=\"fred\"/> Though Babyface visited the set of the film and tried to convince her, Houston was determined not to record songs for the soundtrack. She finally agreed after hearing Babyface play one of the songs she liked.<ref name=\"fred\"/> In an interview with [[Fred Bronson]], Babyface explained the development of the song:\n<blockquote>\n\"When Whitney first heard the song, she figured I'd lost it\u2014I couldn't come up with words anymore. And, actually she's right. I couldn't think of anything for that particular part. It felt like it should groove there. But I knew it couldn't groove without any vocals, so I started humming along with it and that's what happened. The 'shoops' came. But they felt so good, I thought 'Why not?' It doesn't have to mean anything.\"<ref name=\"fred\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|page =842}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBabyface produced the song,<ref name=\"fred\"/>  and it was released as the lead single from ''Waiting to Exhale'' soundtrack on November 7, 1995, through [[Arista Records]].<ref name=\"usatoday\">{{cite news|url

Lomax, Jessica Lippincott and David M. Lovelace. The generic name is derived from the Greek \u1f19\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c2, Hesperis, \"western\", \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2, ''ornis'', \"bird\", and ~eides, \"form\". The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] honours the Miessler family for its support of the project. The [[holotype]], '''WYDICE-DML-001''', was found in a layer of the middle Morrison Formation dating from the [[Tithonian]]. It consists of a partial skeleton containing the rear skull and lower jaws, [[hyoid bone]]s, five neck vertebrae, the first back vertebra, twelve tail vertebrae, a rib, chevrons, the left shoulder girdle, the right humerus, the left arm, a thighbone piece, and the left and right lower legs minus the right toes.  The skeleton was partially articulated, representing a subadult or adult individual.<ref name=\"Hesperornithoides\">{{cite journal |last1=Hartman |first1=Scott |last2=Mortimer |first2=Mickey |last3=Wahl |first3=William R. |last4=Lomax |first4=Dean R. |last5=Lippincott |first5=Jessica |last6=Lovelace |first6=David M. |title=A new paravian dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of North America supports a late acquisition of avian flight |journal=PeerJ |date=2019 |volume=7 |pages=e7247 |doi=10.7717/peerj.7247|pmid=31333906 |pmc=6626525 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Hesperornithoides size.png|thumb|left|Size comparison with a 1.7 m tall human]]\n[[File:Hesperornithoides.png|thumb|right|200px|''Hesperornithoides'' [[Paleoart|portrait]]]]\nThe length of the holotype individual was in 2019 estimated at {{convert|89|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. Such a body size is rather limited for a troodontid. The specimen may represent an adult or subadult individual, due to the lack of cranial and body proportions associated with juvenile individuals. Nevertheless, either assignation would not be much different; for instance, the estimated {{convert|89|cm|in|abbr=on}} would become {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The describing authors established some derived or [[apomorphic]] traits relative to the [[Paraves]]. The [[jugal bone]] is pneumatised. The rear branch of the [[lacrimal bone]] is short, with less than 15% of the length of the descending branch, measured from the inner corner downwards. The [[quadrate bone]] is part of the outer edge of the ''foramen paraquadraticum''. In the lower jaw the external side opening is small, with less than an eighth of the length of the jaw as a whole. On the [[humerus]], the ridge towards the inner condyle represents more than 15% of the total distal width of the element. The third claw of the hand is about as large as the second claw. The lower inner corner of the shinbone projects to the front.<ref name=\"Hesperornithoides\"/>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Hesperornithoides skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|270px|Skeletal reconstruction by Scott Hartman]]\nThe phylogenetic analysis of 2005 placed the specimen as a close relative of ''[[Sinornithoides]]''.<ref name=\"hartmanetal2005\">Hartman, S., Lovelace, D., and Wahl, W., (2005). \"Phylogenetic assessment of a maniraptoran from the Morrison Formation.\" ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'', '''25''', Supplement to No. 3, pp. 67A\u201368A http://www.bhbfonline.org/AboutUs/Lori.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726091958/http://www.bhbfonline.org/AboutUs/Lori.pdf |date=2012-07-26 }}</ref> Unpublished phylogenetic results presented at the SVP 2017 conference recovered ''Hesperornithoides'' (then known by the informal name \"Lori\") as a relative of ''[[Sinovenator]]''.<ref>http://vertpaleo.org/Annual-Meeting/Annual-Meeting-Home/SVP-2017-program-book-7-20-17a-(1).aspx</ref> The presence of this derived [[maniraptoran]] along with several others, such as ''[[Anchiornis]]'' and ''[[Eosinopteryx]]'', in Jurassic sediments was a strong refutation of the [[Temporal paradox (paleontology)|temporal paradox]] argument used by those who oppose the consensus view that birds evolved from dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Hesperornithoides\"/>\n\nIn 2019, ''Hesperornithoides'' was placed in the [[Troodontidae]], in a relatively basal position, in a [[clade]] with ''[[Daliansaurus]]'', ''[[Xixiasaurus]]'' and ''[[Sinusonasus]]'', as shown in the cladogram below:<ref name=\"Hesperornithoides\"/>\n{{clade|style=font-size:100%; line-height:100%\n|label1=[[Troodontidae]]\n|1={{clade\n |1=[[Sinovenatorinae]]\n |2={{clade\n  |1=''[[Almas ukhaa|Almas]]''\n  |2=''[[Liaoningvenator]]''\n  |3={{clade \n   |1={{clade\n    |1={{clade \n     |1='''''Hesperornithoides'''''\n     |2={{clade \n      |1=''[[Xixiasaurus]]''\n      |2=''[[Sinusonasus]]'' }} }} \n    |2=''[[Daliansaurus]]'' }}\n   |2=\"Derived troodontids\" }} }} }} }}\n\n==Palaeobiology==\n[[File:Hesperornithoides skull block.png|thumb|Block containing the skull]]\nMany large dinosaurs have been discovered in the Morrison Formation during the nineteenth century; ''Hesperornithoides'' proves that the full wealth of species had not yet been revealed.

In 2005, a [[phylogenetic]] analysis including it was presented in an abstract for the ''[[Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology]]''.<ref name=\"hartmanetal2005\"/> The same year the specimen was donated to the Big Horn Basin Foundation which in 2016 joined the The [[Wyoming Dinosaur Center]], Inc.<ref name=\"Hesperornithoides\"/> \n\nIn 2019, the [[type species]] ''Hesperornithoides miessleri'' was named and described by Scott Hartman, Mickey Mortimer, William Wahl, Dean R. Lomax, Jessica Lippincott and David M. Lovelace. The generic name is derived from the Greek \u1f19\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c2, Hesperis, \"western\", \u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2, ''ornis'', \"bird\", and ~eides, \"form\". The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] honours the Miessler family for its support of the project. The [[holotype]], '''WYDICE-DML-001''', was found in a layer of the middle Morrison Formation dating from the [[Tithonian]]. It consists of a partial skeleton containing the rear skull and lower jaws, [[hyoid bone]]s, five neck vertebrae, the first back vertebra, twelve tail vertebrae, a rib, chevrons, the left shoulder girdle, the right humerus, the left arm, a thighbone piece, and the left and right lower legs minus the right toes.  The skeleton was partially articulated, representing a subadult or adult individual.<ref name=\"Hesperornithoides\">{{cite journal |last1=Hartman |first1=Scott |last2=Mortimer |first2=Mickey |last3=Wahl |first3=William R. |last4=Lomax |first4=Dean R. |last5=Lippincott |first5=Jessica |last6=Lovelace |first6=David M. |title=A new paravian dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of North America supports a late acquisition of avian flight |journal=PeerJ |date=2019 |volume=7 |pages=e7247 |doi=10.7717/peerj.7247|pmid=31333906 |pmc=6626525 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Hesperornithoides size.png|thumb|left|Size comparison with a 1.7 m tall human]]\n[[File:Hesperornithoides.png|thumb|right|200px|''Hesperornithoides'' [[Paleoart|portrait]]]]\nThe length of the holotype individual was in 2019 estimated at {{convert|89|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. Such a body size is rather limited for a troodontid. The specimen may represent an adult or subadult individual, due to the lack of cranial and body proportions associated with juvenile individuals. Nevertheless, either assignation would not be much different; for instance, the estimated {{convert|89|cm|in|abbr=on}} would become {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The describing authors established some derived or [[apomorphic]] traits relative to the [[Paraves]]. The [[jugal bone]] is pneumatised. The rear branch of the [[lacrimal bone]] is short, with less than 15% of the length of the descending branch, measured from the inner corner downwards. The [[quadrate bone]] is part of the outer edge of the ''foramen paraquadraticum''. In the lower jaw the external side opening is small, with less than an eighth of the length of the jaw as a whole. On the [[humerus]], the ridge towards the inner condyle represents more than 15% of the total distal width of the element. The third claw of the hand is about as large as the second claw. The lower inner corner of the shinbone projects to the front.<ref name=\"Hesperornithoides\"/>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Hesperornithoides skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|270px|Skeletal reconstruction by Scott Hartman]]\nThe phylogenetic analysis of 2005 placed the specimen as a close relative of ''[[Sinornithoides]]''.<ref name=\"hartmanetal2005\">Hartman, S., Lovelace, D., and Wahl, W., (2005). \"Phylogenetic assessment of a maniraptoran from the Morrison Formation.\" ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'', '''25''', Supplement to No. 3, pp. 67A\u201368A http://www.bhbfonline.org/AboutUs/Lori.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726091958/http://www.bhbfonline.org/AboutUs/Lori.pdf |date=2012-07-26 }}</ref> Unpublished phylogenetic results presented at the SVP 2017 conference recovered ''Hesperornithoides'' (then known by the informal name \"Lori\") as a relative of ''[[Sinovenator]]''.<ref>http://vertpaleo.org/Annual-Meeting/Annual-Meeting-Home/SVP-2017-program-book-7-20-17a-(1).aspx</ref> The presence of this derived [[maniraptoran]] along with several others, such as ''[[Anchiornis]]'' and ''[[Eosinopteryx]]'', in Jurassic sediments was a strong refutation of the [[Temporal paradox (paleontology)|temporal paradox]] argument used by those who oppose the consensus view that birds evolved from dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Hesperornithoides\"/>\n\nIn 2019, ''Hesperornithoides'' was placed in the [[Troodontidae]], in a relatively basal position, in a [[clade]] with ''[[Daliansaurus]]'', ''[[Xixiasaurus]]'' and ''[[Sinusonasus]]'', as shown in the cladogram below:<ref name=\"Hesperornithoides\"/>\n{{clade|style=font-size:100%; line-height:100%\n|label1=[[Troodontidae]]\n|1={{clade\n |1=[[Sinovenatorinae]]\n |2={{clade\n  |1=''[[Almas ukhaa|Almas]]''\n  |2=''[[Liaoningvenator]]''\n  |3={{clade \n   |1={{clade\n    |1={{clade \n     |1='''''Hesperornithoides'''''\n     |2={{clade \n      |1=''[[Xixiasaurus]]''\n      |2=''[[Sinusonasus]]'' }} }} \n    |2=''[[Daliansaurus]]'' }}\n   |2=\"Derived troodontids\" }} }} }} }}\n\n==Palaeobiology==\n[[File:Hesperornithoides skull block.png|thumb|Block containing the skull]]\nMany large dinosaurs have been discovered in the Morrison Formation during the nineteenth century; ''Hesperornithoides'' proves that the full wealth of species had not yet been revealed.

From the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of the icosahedron, Cartesian coordinates for a pentagonal pyramid with edge length 2 may be inferred as\n\n:<math>(1,0,\\tau),\\,(0,\\tau,1),\\,(\\tau,1,0),(\\tau,-1,0),(0-\\tau,1),</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c4'' (sometimes written as ''\u03c6'') is the [[golden ratio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IcosahedralGroup.html|title=Icosahedral Group|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe height ''H'', from the midpoint of the pentagonal face to the apex, of a pentagonal pyramid with edge length ''a'' may therefore be computed as:\n\n:<math>H = \\left(\\sqrt{{\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{10}}}\\right)a \\approx 0.52573a.</math>\n\nIts [[surface area]], ''A'', can be computed as the area of pentagonal base plus five times the area of one triangle:\n:<math>A = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}\\left(10+\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{75+30\\sqrt{5}}\\right)}\\right)\\approx 3.88554a^2.</math>\n\nIts [[volume]] can be calculated as:\n:<math>V = \\left(\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{5}}{24}\\right)a^3 \\approx 0.30150a^3.</math><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PentagonalPyramid.html|title=Pentagonal Pyramid|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n== Related polyhedra ==\nThe pentagrammic [[star pyramid]] has the same [[vertex arrangement]], but connected onto a [[pentagram]] base:\n:[[File:Pentagram pyramid.png|160px]]\n\n{{Pyramids}}\n\n{| class=wikitable width=320\n|[[File:Pentagonal frustum.svg|160px]]<br>Pentagonal [[frustum]] is a pentagonal pyramid with its apex truncated\n|[[File:Icosahedron.png|160px]]<br>The top of an [[icosahedron]] is a pentagonal pyramid\n|}\n\n=== Dual polyhedron ===\n\nThe pentagonal pyramid is topologically a [[self-dual polyhedron]].
