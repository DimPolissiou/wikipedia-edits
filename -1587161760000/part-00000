The railway brought new prosperity to Falmouth, as it made it easy for tourists to reach the town. It also allowed the swift transport of the goods recently disembarked from the ships in the port. The town now has three railway stations. [[Falmouth Docks railway station]] is the original terminus and is close to Pendennis Castle and Gyllyngvase beach. [[Falmouth Town railway station]] was opened on 7 December 1970 and is convenient for the [[National Maritime Museum]] Cornwall, the waterfront, and town centre. \n\n[[Penmere railway station]] opened on 1 July 1925 towards the north of Falmouth and within easy walking distance of the top of The Moor. All three stations are served by regular trains from [[Truro]] on the [[Maritime Line]].

Falmouth received its Order of Charter in 1661.\n\nAs of 2019, it is governed by sixteen councillors (four represent the Boslowick Ward, three each for the Arwenack, Penwerris, Smithick and Trescobeas). Each of them serves a four-year term. The council provides municipal services while strategic services are provided by [[Cornwall Council]], a unitary authority governing the entirety of mainland Cornwall. Falmouth elects five councillors to Cornwall Council.\n\n== Economy, industry and tourism ==\n[[File:Falmouth Cornwall Harbour.jpg|thumb|right|Falmouth Harbour, [[National Maritime Museum Cornwall|National Maritime Museum, Cornwall]] and [[Pendennis Castle]].]]\n\nWhile Falmouth's maritime activity has much declined from its heyday, the docks are still a major contributor to the town's economy. It is the largest port in Cornwall. Falmouth remains a cargo port and the bunkering of vessels and the transfer of cargoes also keep the port's facilities busy. The port is popular with cruise ship operators.\n\nFurther up the sheltered reaches of the Fal there are several ships laid up, awaiting sailing orders and/or new owners/charterers.\n\nFalmouth is a popular holiday destination and it is now primarily a tourist resort. The five main beaches starting next to Pendennis Castle and moving along the coast towards the Helford river are Castle, Tunnel, [[Gyllyngvase]], [[Swanpool, Cornwall|Swanpool]] and [[Maenporth]] beaches. The [[National Maritime Museum Cornwall]] opened in February 2003. The building was designed by the architect M. J.

The town was the birthplace of Toad, Mole and Rat: [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' began as a series of letters sent to his son. The first two were written at the Greenbank Hotel whilst Grahame was a guest in May 1907. Reproductions of the letters are currently on display in the hotel. ''[[Poldark]]'' author [[Winston Graham]] knew the town well and set his novel ''The Forgotten Story'' (1945) in Falmouth.\n\nThe town has been the setting for several films and television programmes. British film star [[Will Hay]] was a familiar face in Falmouth in 1935 whilst filming his comedy ''[[Windbag the Sailor]]''.  The film had many scenes of the docks area. The docks area was featured in some scenes with [[John Mills]] for the 1948 film ''[[Scott of the Antarctic (film)|Scott of the Antarctic]]''.  [[Robert Newton]], [[Bobby Driscoll]] and other cast members of the 1950 Walt Disney film ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (some scenes were filmed along the [[River Fal]]) were visitors to the town.  Stars from the BBC TV serial ''[[The Onedin Line]]'' stayed in the town during filming in the late 1970s.  In 2011 [[Paramount Pictures]] filmed parts of the film ''[[World War Z (film)|World War Z]]'' starring [[Brad Pitt]] in Falmouth Docks and off the coast.\n\nFalmouth has the first \"Polytechnic\": [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]] which went into administration briefly in 2010 but is now a feature of the town with frequent art exhibitions, stage performances and an art house cinema.\n\nFalmouth is home to many theatre groups, including Falmouth Theatre Company, Falmouth Young Generation and Amity Theatre. Falmouth Theatre Company, also known as FTC, is the oldest local company with performances dating back to 1927.\n\nThe [[Falmouth Art Gallery]] is a public gallery with a diverse 19th and 20th century art collection including many notable modern Cornish artists exhibited in four to five seasonal exhibitions a year, as well as a \"family friendly and free\" community and schools education programme.\n\nThe Anglican parish churches are dedicated to [[Church of King Charles the Martyr, Falmouth|King Charles the Martyr]] and to [[All Saints' Church, Falmouth|All Saints]]. A third church is [[St Michael's Church, Penwerris]]. The Roman Catholic church of St Mary Immaculate is in Killigrew Street. It was designed by [[J. A. Hansom]] and built in 1868; the tower and spire (1881) are by J. S. Hansom; the baptistery and porch were added in 1908 to the original designs. The style is a blend of Gothic and Burgundian Romanesque, creating a very French effect. Two of the stained glass windows are early works of [[Dom Charles Norris]].<ref>Beacham, Peter & Pevsner, Nikolaus (2014). Cornwall.

Some of the U.S. [[D-day]] landings originated from Falmouth harbour and the surrounding rivers and creeks.\n\nThe ''[[SS Flying Enterprise]]'', a cargo vessel that had sailed from [[Hamburg]] on 21 December 1951, ran into a storm on the Western Approaches to the English Channel. A crack appeared on her deck and the cargo shifted. A number of vessels went to her aid including the tug ''Turmoil'' which was stationed in Falmouth, but they found it impossible to take the ''Flying Enterprise'' in tow. The ship was finally taken in tow on 5 January 1952 by the ''Turmoil'' when she was some {{convert|300|nmi|km}} from Falmouth. It took several days to reach port. On 10 January the tow line parted when the ship was still {{convert|41|nmi|km}} from Falmouth. Two other tugs joined the battle to save the ship and cargo, but the ''Flying Enterprise'' finally sank later that day. Captain Carlsen and the tug's mate Kenneth Dancy, the only crew members still on board, were picked up by the ''Turmoil'' and taken to Falmouth to a hero's welcome.\n\n=== Road ===\nFalmouth is a terminus of the [[A39 road]], connecting to [[Bath, Somerset]] some {{convert|180|mi|km|-1}} distant.\n\n=== Railway ===\nFalmouth has three railway stations (described above) at the southern end of an {{convert|11+3/4|mi|km|0}} branch line (the [[Maritime Line]]) to the county town of [[Truro]].

Falmouth received its Order of Charter in 1661.\n\nAs of 2019, it is governed by sixteen councillors (four represent the Boslowick Ward, three each for the Arwenack, Penwerris, Smithick and Trescobeas). Each of them serves a four-year term. The council provides municipal services while strategic services are provided by [[Cornwall Council]], a unitary authority governing the entirety of mainland Cornwall. Falmouth elects five councillors to Cornwall Council.\n\n== Economy, industry and tourism ==\n[[File:Falmouth Cornwall Harbour.jpg|thumb|right|Falmouth Harbour, [[National Maritime Museum Cornwall|National Maritime Museum, Cornwall]] and [[Pendennis Castle]].]]\n\nWhile Falmouth's maritime activity has much declined from its heyday, the docks are still a major contributor to the town's economy. It is the largest port in Cornwall. Falmouth remains a cargo port and the bunkering of vessels and the transfer of cargoes also keep the port's facilities busy. The port is popular with cruise ship operators.\n\nFurther up the sheltered reaches of the Fal there are several ships laid up, awaiting sailing orders and/or new owners/charterers.\n\nFalmouth is a popular holiday destination and it is now primarily a tourist resort. The five main beaches starting next to Pendennis Castle and moving along the coast towards the Helford river are Castle, Tunnel, [[Gyllyngvase]], [[Swanpool, Cornwall|Swanpool]] and [[Maenporth]] beaches. The [[National Maritime Museum Cornwall]] opened in February 2003. The building was designed by the architect M. J. Long.<ref>{{cite web| title =Falmouth International Maritime Initiative| publisher =Long/Kentish Practice | url =http://www.longkentish.com/projects.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080402074955/http://www.longkentish.com/projects.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Falmouth & Penryn Packet'', first published in 1858, is still based in the town as the lead title in a series of [[Packet Newspapers]] for central and western [[Cornwall]].<ref name=\"britishpapers1\">{{cite web|title=British Newspapers Online entry for Falmouth & Penryn Packet|url=http://www.britishpapers.co.uk/england-sw/falmouth-penryn-packet|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[The West Briton]] newspaper, first published in 1810, is a weekly tabloid newspaper which has a ''Falmouth & Penryn'' edition reporting on the area.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:FalmouthObservatory2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Meteorological Observation Tower, built by the \"[[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society|Poly]]\"]]\n\nFalmouth has many literary connections. The town was the birthplace of Toad, Mole and Rat: [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' began as a series of letters sent to his son. The first two were written at the Greenbank Hotel whilst Grahame was a guest in May 1907. Reproductions of the letters are currently on display in the hotel. ''[[Poldark]]'' author [[Winston Graham]] knew the town well and set his novel ''The Forgotten Story'' (1945) in Falmouth.\n\nThe town has been the setting for several films and television programmes. British film star [[Will Hay]] was a familiar face in Falmouth in 1935 whilst filming his comedy ''[[Windbag the Sailor]]''.  The film had many scenes of the docks area. The docks area was featured in some scenes with [[John Mills]] for the 1948 film ''[[Scott of the Antarctic (film)|Scott of the Antarctic]]''.  [[Robert Newton]], [[Bobby Driscoll]] and other cast members of the 1950 Walt Disney film ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (some scenes were filmed along the [[River Fal]]) were visitors to the town.  Stars from the BBC TV serial ''[[The Onedin Line]]'' stayed in the town during filming in the late 1970s.  In 2011 [[Paramount Pictures]] filmed parts of the film ''[[World War Z (film)|World War Z]]'' starring [[Brad Pitt]] in Falmouth Docks and off the coast.\n\nFalmouth has the first \"Polytechnic\": [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]] which went into administration briefly in 2010 but is now a feature of the town with frequent art exhibitions, stage performances and an art house cinema.\n\nFalmouth is home to many theatre groups, including Falmouth Theatre Company, Falmouth Young Generation and Amity Theatre. Falmouth Theatre Company, also known as FTC, is the oldest local company with performances dating back to 1927.\n\nThe [[Falmouth Art Gallery]] is a public gallery with a diverse 19th and 20th century art collection including many notable modern Cornish artists exhibited in four to five seasonal exhibitions a year, as well as a \"family friendly and free\" community and schools education programme.\n\nThe Anglican parish churches are dedicated to [[Church of King Charles the Martyr, Falmouth|King Charles the Martyr]] and to [[All Saints' Church, Falmouth|All Saints]]. A third church is [[St Michael's Church, Penwerris]]. The Roman Catholic church of St Mary Immaculate is in Killigrew Street. It was designed by [[J. A. Hansom]] and built in 1868; the tower and spire (1881) are by J. S. Hansom; the baptistery and porch were added in 1908 to the original designs. The style is a blend of Gothic and Burgundian Romanesque, creating a very French effect. Two of the stained glass windows are early works of [[Dom Charles Norris]].<ref>Beacham, Peter & Pevsner, Nikolaus (2014). Cornwall.

Together with [[Carrick Roads]], it forms the third deepest natural harbour in the world, and the deepest in Western Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.falmouthtowncouncil.co.uk/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=17 |title= About Falmouth |accessdate=2009-06-03 |publisher= Falmouth Town Council}}</ref> It has been the start or finish point of various round-the-world record-breaking voyages, such as those of [[Robin Knox-Johnston]] and Dame [[Ellen MacArthur]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the [[United States Navy]] had a large base in Falmouth harbour as well as an army base in the town.  Some of the U.S. [[D-day]] landings originated from Falmouth harbour and the surrounding rivers and creeks.\n\nThe ''[[SS Flying Enterprise]]'', a cargo vessel that had sailed from [[Hamburg]] on 21 December 1951, ran into a storm on the Western Approaches to the English Channel. A crack appeared on her deck and the cargo shifted. A number of vessels went to her aid including the tug ''Turmoil'' which was stationed in Falmouth, but they found it impossible to take the ''Flying Enterprise'' in tow. The ship was finally taken in tow on 5 January 1952 by the ''Turmoil'' when she was some {{convert|300|nmi|km}} from Falmouth. It took several days to reach port. On 10 January the tow line parted when the ship was still {{convert|41|nmi|km}} from Falmouth. Two other tugs joined the battle to save the ship and cargo, but the ''Flying Enterprise'' finally sank later that day. Captain Carlsen and the tug's mate Kenneth Dancy, the only crew members still on board, were picked up by the ''Turmoil'' and taken to Falmouth to a hero's welcome.\n\n=== Road ===\nFalmouth is a terminus of the [[A39 road]], connecting to [[Bath, Somerset]] some {{convert|180|mi|km|-1}} distant.\n\n=== Railway ===\nFalmouth has three railway stations (described above) at the southern end of an {{convert|11+3/4|mi|km|0}} branch line (the [[Maritime Line]]) to the county town of [[Truro]]. The train takes roughly 35 minutes inbound and 30 minutes outbound. It stops at Truro, Perranwell, Penryn, Penmere, Falmouth Town and Falmouth Docks.\n\n== Education ==\nThere are five [[primary school]]s in the town and one [[secondary school]], namely [[Falmouth School]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/137223|title=Find an inspection report|last=enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk|first=Ofsted Communications Team.|date=2010-11-05|website=reports.ofsted.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.falmouth.cornwall.sch.uk/|title=Welcome to Falmouth School's Website|website=www.falmouth.cornwall.sch.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref>\n\n[[Falmouth University]] has a campus at the original town site, Woodlane, and another in the [[Combined Universities in Cornwall]] campus at [[Tremough]], [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], which it shares with the [[University of Exeter]].

Falmouth CC play at the Trescobeas ground on Trescobeas Road.\n\n[[File:Falmouth sunset.jpg|thumb|left|Winter sunset over Falmouth Bay from Castle Drive.]]\nWith its proximity to sheltered and unsheltered waters, Falmouth has long been a popular boating and water sports location.

He is portrayed by [[Rob Lowe]]. Married to [[Kitty Walker]] ([[Calista Flockhart]]), he was a Republican [[United States Senator]] from the state of [[California]], a former candidate for [[President of the United States]], and a former candidate for [[Governor of California]].\n\n==Storylines==\n===Season 1===\nRobert McCallister first met Katherine 'Kitty' Walker ([[Calista Flockhart]]) when she interviewed him on her talk show. Recently divorced, his marriage to Courtney ([[Marin Hinkle]]), with whom he had two young children, was marred by a scandal regarding allegations of his infidelity. Kitty was more interested in asking for his help to get her brother Justin ([[Dave Annable]]) out of being sent to [[Iraq]], but Robert could do nothing. When Kitty's talk show folded, Robert asked her to become the [[communications director]] for his presidential campaign. They soon began a romantic relationship, over the vehement objections of her gay brother, Kevin ([[Matthew Rhys]]), who objected to Robert's record on [[gay marriage]]. Thanks to Kitty, Kevin had a brief relationship with Robert's brother Jason ([[Eric Winter]]), which ended badly, not doing much to endear Robert or Kevin to each other, but they came to an understanding.\n\n===Season 2===\nRobert and Kitty got engaged and had their party at Kitty's family home. Robert's own family, however, stole the spotlight. Robert came under the spotlight when the Republican primary for president kicked into a higher gear. During the [[Gulf War]], Robert was hailed as a hero for something he did not actually do. This secret was revealed during the [[primary election|primary]], causing his opponent to question his patriotism. Robert was forced to hire a very skilled [[political consultant|consultant]] named Isaac ([[Danny Glover]]), whom he disliked due to Isaac outing Jason while working for one of Robert's primary opponents during a [[California State Senate|state senate]] campaign. When Jason found out Isaac had been the one responsible, and was now working for Robert, he was furious, but soon forgave his brother.\n\nKitty discovered she was pregnant. She had a [[miscarriage]], but wanted to try again. This led to some tension with Robert, who didn't want any more kids, even though he'd told her otherwise. They worked out the conflict and got married.\n\n===Season 3===\nRobert soldiered on in his primary campaign, but eventually conceded defeat to the frontrunner, a deep conservative who had engaged in what Robert and Kitty saw as dirty tricks. He asked Robert to be his [[running mate]], much to Kitty's disgust. Robert considered the idea, but ultimately rejected him. In a later episode, Kitty is watching a newscast about the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration of Barack Obama]], signaling that the show takes place in real time with the actual winner of the race, despite the fictional candidates in this show.\n\nRobert announces his candidacy for governor of California shortly before suffering a heart attack on the way to see his new adopted baby at the hospital. His recovery is a source of tension to his marriage.\n\n===Season 4===\nRobert steps down as senator and his soon to be vacant seat is vied for by his wife Kitty, who during the first half of the season battles (and enters remission for) stage 3 lymphoma. Though his marriage with Kitty faces a number of bumps, he spends this season developing his skills as a supportive husband. Robert and Kitty renew their vows before her bone marrow transplant. In the season 4 finale, it's revealed that Robert's heart has been acting up again and he's taken to the hospital following chest pains at dinner. The following night, his car strikes a truck as they are returning home. He was last shown with a gaping head wound, unable to communicate with Kitty.\n\n===Season 5===\nA year later, Robert is still in a coma with Kitty tending to him, refusing to let him go. The entire family is doubtful of his recovery chances and Justin finally tells Kitty that Robert wouldn't want this, using his last words to help Holly as proof. Kitty realizes he's right and shuts off Robert's life support.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Brothers & Sisters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mccallister, Robert}}\n[[Category:Brothers & Sisters characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Scottish descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional Republicans (United States)]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States presidential candidates]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2006]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States senators]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n{{long plot|date=November 2010}}\n{{in-universe|date=November 2010}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Robert McCallister (''Brothers & Sisters'')}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name        = Robert McCallister\n| series      = [[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]\n| image       = BS- Robert 2.jpg\n| imagesize   = 250px\n| first       = \"[[Brothers & Sisters (season 1)|Mistakes Were Made, Part 2]]\"<br>1x09, November 19, 2006\n| last        = \"[[Brothers & Sisters (season 4)|On The Road Again]]\"<br>4x24, May 16, 2010\n| cause       = \n| creator     = [[Jon Robin Baitz]]\n| portrayer   = [[Rob Lowe]]\n| episode     = \n| species     = \n| gender      = Male\n| age         = 45\n| born        = c. 1965<ref>In the episode airing January 13, 2008, Robert said that he was twenty-five during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], which was fought from August 1990 \u2014 February 1991.</ref>\n| death       = 2010\n| specialty   = \n| occupation  = [[United States senator|U.S. senator]] for [[California]]\n| title       = \n| callsign    = \n| family      = Jason McCallister \n| spouse      = Courtney McCallister (divorced)<br>[[Kitty Walker]] (2007\u201310)\n| children    = Sophia McCallister<br>Jack McCallister<br>Evan McCallister \n| relatives   = \n| residence  = [[San Marino, California|San Marino]], [[California]]\n| religion   = [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]\n| nationality = [[United States|American]]\n}}\n\n'''Robert Alexander McCallister''' is a fictional character on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''.
