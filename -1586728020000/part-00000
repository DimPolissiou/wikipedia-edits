By the Treaty of Versailles provinces had been severed from Germany in almost all directions.\n\nThe two most important cessions of territory were the loss of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] to [[France]] and of a large stretch of territory in [[West Prussia]], [[Province of Posen|Posen]], and [[Upper Silesia]] to [[Poland]]. Of these, the territory ceded to Poland amounted to nearly {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2|-4}}, and, coupled with the establishment of [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] as an independent state, which was also imposed upon Germany, this loss had the effect of cutting off [[East Prussia]] from the main territory of Germany.\n\nDanzig and Memel were to be ceded to the Allies, their fate to be subsequently decided. A portion of Silesia was to be ceded to [[Czechoslovakia]]. Also, apart from the actual cessions of territory, the treaty arranged that [[plebiscite]]s should be held in certain areas to decide the destinies of the districts concerned. Certain districts of East Prussia and West Prussia were to poll to decide whether they should belong to Germany or to Poland. A third portion of Silesia, which was in dispute between Germany and Poland, was to exercise the right of self-determination. The small districts of [[Eupen]] and [[Malmedy]] were to decide whether they would belong to [[Belgium]] or to Germany. The middle and southern districts of the province of [[Schleswig]], which had been annexed to [[Prussia]] in 1866, were to decide their own destinies. Finally, the coal-producing valley of the [[Saar (1920-1935)|Saarland]], which had been provisionally separated from Germany, was to be the subject of a referendum after the lapse of fifteen years.\n\nThe Allied and Associated governments had assumed the task of revising territorial changes and arrangements dating back to the latter half of the 18th century. The conference cancelled completely the expansion of Germany over the past 150 years; but did not cancel the schism in Germany\u2014the exclusion of Austria\u2014which had been incidental to that expansion.\n\n[[File:Hoch-Cut_With_the_Kitchen_Knife.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Hannah_H\u00f6ch#Cut_with_the_Kitchen_Knife_Dada_through_the_Last_Weimar_Beer-Belly_Cultural_Epoch_in_Germany_(1919)|Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada Through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany]]'' is an example of [[photomontage]] by [[Dada]] artist [[Hannah H\u00f6ch]]. She is considered a progenitor of the subversive art style]]\n[[Raoul Hausmann]], [[George Grosz]], [[Hannah H\u00f6ch]] and other artists helped establish the Berlin wing of the [[Dada movement]], an [[avant garde]] artistic movement that defied the established forms of classical art. [[Photomontage]], a technique Hausmann claims to have originated with H\u00f6ch in 1918, becomes associated with Berlin Dada style.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elger |first1=Dietmar |title=Dadism |date=2004 |publisher=Tachen |page=34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0ES7-5Hp7gC&pg=PA34 |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Events ==\n===Internal territorial changes in Germany===\nThe following describes the internal territorial rearrangements which were made after the establishment of the German republic. During the period of the Hohenzollern empire there had been twenty-six states within the German federation. During the war the number had been reduced by one by the fusion of the principalities of [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]] and [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]]. After the revolution there was a rapid reduction in the number of smaller states. Alsace-Lorraine was, of course, returned to France, and the two [[principalities of Reuss]]\u2014the so-called Elder and Younger lines\u2014united into a single state. The Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] split into two halves; [[Coburg (district)|Coburg]] voluntarily united itself with Bavaria, and [[Sachsen-Gotha|Gotha]] later in the year 1919 entered into negotiations with a number of the other small states of central Germany to bring about a general union of the little republics concerned. Six states took part in these negotiations, which were brought to a successful conclusion at the end of December 1919. The states which thus agreed to unite were: (1) Schwarzburg, (2) Reuss, (3) Gotha, (4) [[Saxe-Weimar]], (5) [[Saxe-Meiningen]], and (6) [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The total population of the United States was just over 1,500,000, and their joint area was just over {{convert|4500|sqmi|km2|-2}}. The states took the name of [[Thuringia]] (''Einheitsstaat Th\u00fcringen''). The town of [[Weimar]] was made the capital of the new state.\n\nIt will be seen that owing to these various fusions and changes the twenty-six states of the German federation were reduced to eighteen.\n\n===Political situation at the beginning of the year===\nIn considering the general political situation in the country at the beginning of 1920, it is notable that from the time of the revolution until the end of 1919, the Liberal and Radical parties in combination with the so-called Majority Social Democratic Party had held power continuously, and had been strikingly confirmed in their position by the general election held in January 1919. The chief point of interest in the general election had been the close correspondence of the results with those that used to be obtained in the elections for the old [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in the time of the Empire. On February 11, 1919, the new parliament elected [[Friedrich Ebert]] as president of the German republic. [[Philipp Scheidemann]] acted as [[minister-president]] during the first half of 1919, but at the time of the signing of the treaty of peace in June he was succeeded by [[Gustav Bauer]], one of the best-known leaders of the Majority Social Democratic Party, who had not been a member of Scheidemann's government. The government persevered but the ministry and the parties which supported them were placed in an unstable and very difficult position. On one side, the government had to face the extreme hostility of the conservative party, who had been opposed from the beginning to the new republican institutions. On the other side, they faced the extreme revolutionaries, who, for entirely different reasons, had been opposed to the submission to the Entente, and desired an alliance with the Bolshevik forces of the Soviet Union. During 1919 the government had been faced greater difficulties from the parties of the left than the parties of the right, and the extreme Socialists had made several unsuccessful attempts at armed insurrection. The reactionary groups were also capable of making serious trouble for the government. {{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Anti-government agitation===\nDuring January and February there were no events of first-class importance, but in March there were kaleidoscopic changes in Berlin, which illustrated dramatically the difficulty of the position of the moderate German government, placed as it was, between the extremists of the right and of the left. During the early weeks of the year certain people in the conservative party were agitating actively against the government, and were endeavouring to find some pretext\u2014preferably a democratic pretext\u2014for taking action against them. One of the most prominent persons in this movement was Dr. [[Wolfgang Kapp]], who had once held office as president of East Prussia, and had been a founder of the Fatherland Party and an associate of the Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]]. During January and February Kapp entered into correspondence with the prime minister, Bauer, and brought complaints against the government. The chief of these complaints were that Ebert had remained in power too long, since according to the constitution the president ought to be elected by the whole nation, and not merely (as Ebert had been) by the National Assembly; that the ministry itself had likewise retained power too long, since it and the parliament which supported it were elected and established only for the purpose of concluding peace; that the government's administration had been inefficient and had failed to restore the economic position in the country, which had remained deplorable since the conclusion of the armistice. There was but little substance in any of these charges, except, perhaps, the first; and there is every reason to suspect that they were only put forward as a cover for different, and possibly sinister, designs. Ebert and Bauer naturally paid no attention to Dr. Kapp's demands; and in the middle of March the reactionaries seem to have thought that the time had arrived for them to come out into the open and declare opposition.\n\nOn March 12 Bauer appears to have obtained information regarding the plot, and possibly it was this which induced the conspirators to act earlier than they had intended and certainly prematurely. Kapp had obtained an important accomplice in the person of General Baron [[Walther von L\u00fcttwitz]], who was the commander of the 1st Division of the [[Reichswehr]]. Another commander of the Reichswehr, General [[Georg Maerker]], also appears to have been very doubtful in his loyalty to the government. During the past twelve months both these soldiers had served well under the able, but ruthless, cruel, and traitorous war minister, [[Gustav Noske]], in the work of suppressing the insurrections of the ''[[Spartacist League|Spartacists]]'', a group of anti-war German radicals. Repression of the German pacifists and internationalists, it would turn out, was an activity in which reactionaries and moderates could easily cooperate without friction.\n\n===Coup in Berlin===\nFinding that his plot was discovered, Dr. Kapp attempted a sudden ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in Berlin, which met with fleeting success. Supported by the Marine Brigade Erhardt (the first paramilitary group to use the [[swastika]] as its emblem), by the irregular \"[[Baltic region|Baltic]]\" troops (the German troops who had occasioned trouble in [[Courland]] in the previous year by fighting independently of any government), who were now stationed at [[D\u00f6beritz]], by the former guard cavalry division, and by the [[Reichswehr]] troops whom General von L\u00fcttwitz had led, Kapp advanced upon Berlin in the early hours of March 13. Realizing that the generals in command of the Reichswehr had betrayed their trust, Ebert and Bauer fled from Berlin to Dresden, and were fortunate in being able to escape before the Baltic troops arrived. Immediately after he reached Berlin, at 10 am, Dr. Kapp issued a proclamation declaring that the Ebert-Bauer administration had ceased to exist and that he was himself acting as imperial chancellor, and that General von L\u00fcttwitz had been appointed minister of defense. The proclamation also stated that Dr. Kapp only regarded his administration as provisional, and that he would \"restore constitutional conditions\" by holding new elections. The new government disclaimed any intention of restoring the monarchy, but all Kapp's chief supporters were monarchists, and he had the old imperial colours\u2014black, white, and red\u2014hoisted in the capital. It was also perhaps significant that immediately after the ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' much coming and going was reported from ex-Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]]'s Dutch home at Amerongen.\n\nEbert and his associates were not slow to decide upon the measures to be taken against the reactionaries. They issued an appeal to the working classes to engage in a drastic general strike. The appeal, which was signed by Ebert, Bauer, and Noske, read as follows:\n\n:\"The military revolt has come. [[Hermann Ehrhardt|Ehrhardt]]'s [[Marinebrigade Ehrhardt|naval brigade]] is advancing on Berlin to overthrow the government. These servants of the state, who fear the dissolution of the army, desire to put reactionaries in the seat of the government. We refuse to bend before military compulsion. We did not make the revolution in order to have again to recognize militarism. We will not cooperate with the criminals of the Baltic states. We should be ashamed of ourselves, did we act otherwise.\n\n:A thousand times, No! Cease work! Stifle the opportunity of this military dictatorship! Fight with all the means at your command to retain the republic. Put all differences of opinion aside.\n\n:Only one means exists against the return of Wilhelm II. That is the cessation of all means of communication. No hand may be moved. No [[proletarian]] may assist the dictator. Strike along the whole line.\"\n\nThe response to this appeal by the working classes was enthusiastic and almost universal. Except in East Prussia and to some extent in Pomerania and Silesia, the Kapp \"government\" obtained scarcely any support in the country; and the Saxon, Bavarian, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Baden governments all rallied to the support of President Ebert\u2014though notwithstanding the loyalty of the Saxons, the president and the prime minister thought it advisable to remove from Dresden to Stuttgart. Kapp and von L\u00fcttwitz met with the bitter hostility of the working classes in Berlin, who succeeded in bringing to a standstill the whole life of the capital.\n\nIt was, indeed, apparent after forty-eight hours that the extraordinary success of the general strike would make the new Kapp regime impossible. During the first two days there were rumours that in order to avoid civil war Ebert and Bauer were willing to compromise with the conspirators; but it soon became obvious that any such course would be unnecessary.\n\nThe feature which hampered Kapp fatally was the complete success of the strike in Berlin itself; and since his writ did not even run in the capital, the usurping chancellor felt compelled to resign on March 17. He endeavoured to cover up his failure, by alleging that his mission had been fulfilled, in that the government had now proclaimed that they would hold a general election within a few weeks, but his protestations notwithstanding, it was obvious to all the onlookers that his real designs had been to displace the old government altogether, and very probably to upset the entire republican regime. A meeting of the National Assembly was held at Stuttgart on March 18, and the prime minister made a long speech dealing with Kapp's escapade, but before then, the crisis had already passed\u2014and had in fact given place to a crisis of a totally different kind. On March 18 some of the members of the government returned to Berlin, and on that day also Kapp's troops\u2014who were known as the \"Baltic\" troops, although the name properly applied only to a section of them\u2014left the capital. Their departure was unfortunately marked by a most disagreeable incident. As they marched through the streets towards the Brandenburg Gate, the populace which had always been entirely hostile to them, collected in great numbers and followed the soldiers, jeering vociferously. The legionaries were in an ill-humour at the failure of their coup, and being further aggravated by the behaviour of the crowds, when the last detachment reached the Brandenburg Gate they wheeled about, and fired several volleys into the mass of civilians who had followed them. A panic ensued, and a considerable number of persons were killed and wounded. Kapp himself fled to Sweden.\n\nSee also [[Kapp Putsch]].\n\n===Return of government===\nWhen the government returned to the capital, they found that the strike which they had utilized to overcome Kapp had now got beyond control; and indeed in the east end of Berlin, Soviets were being declared, and Daunig had declared himself president of a new German Communist republic. The government called off the strike, but a large number of the strikers refused to return to work. On March 19 [[Spartacist League|Spartacist]] risings occurred in many different places, especially in western Prussia, [[Bavaria]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], and [[Leipzig]]. In Leipzig the rising was extremely serious, and in suppressing this local insurrection the government had to use aeroplanes over the streets of the city in order to intimidate the Communists. The Communist leaders decided to direct the strike, the power of which had been proved against Kapp, against the government itself. In Berlin, with the active assistance of the prime minister of Prussia, [[Paul Hirsch (politician)|Paul Hirsch]], the federal government were soon able to gain control of affairs; and in [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]], Bavaria, and W\u00fcrttemberg the troops were also able to overcome speedily the insurrection. But in the west, in Westphalia and the Rhineland, the situation became extremely serious. The position was in this part of Germany complicated by the existence of the neutral zone lying between the territory occupied by the Entente, and the main part of Germany, where the government were of course free to move their forces as they pleased. Apart from a small force for police purposes, the German government were not allowed to send troops into the neutral zone. The military police in the zone were quite incapable of dealing with the Spartacist insurrection; and the insurgents speedily took possession of [[Essen, Germany|Essen]], after a treacherous attack on the rear of the small government force. The revolutionists also seized [[Wesel]]. The union of \"Red\" Germany with Bolshevik Russia was proclaimed. The government took alarm at the development of the Spartacist peril, and on March 23 it was even rumoured that a purely Socialist government\u2014containing several members of the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]]\u2014was to be formed. This rumour proved to be untrue, but two of the ablest members of the cabinet, Noske and [[Matthias Erzberger]], who were especially obnoxious to the Communists, were asked by Bauer to resign. The resignation of these two ministers was in some sense a concession to the extremists, but the latter refused to consider compromise. Feeling overwhelmed with the difficulty of the situation, Bauer himself resigned on March 26. Fortunately Ebert had no difficulty in finding a statesman willing to undertake the burden of the chancellorship. The president asked [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]], who had previously held the office of minister for foreign affairs, to form an administration. Within forty-eight hours it was announced that M\u00fcller had succeeded in forming a cabinet, which included (as did the previous administration) members of all the three moderate parties, the Clericals, the Democrats, and the Majority Social Democrats. The new cabinet was composed as follows:\n\n{|\n|-----\n| Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs\n<td>[[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]]\n|-----\n| Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs\n<td>von Haniel\n|-----\n| Minister of the Interior and Vice-Chancellor\n<td>[[Erich Koch-Weser]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Posts\n<td>[[Johannes Giesberts]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Finance\n<td>[[Joseph Wirth]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Transport\n<td>[[Johannes Bell]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Justice\n<td>[[Andreas Blunck]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Labour\n<td>[[Alexander Schlicke]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Economics\n<td>[[Robert Schmidt (German politician)|Robert Schmidt]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Defense\n<td>[[Otto Gessler]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Food\n<td>[[Andreas Hermes]]\n|-----\n| Minister without Portfolio\n<td>[[Eduard David]]\n|-----\n| President of the Treasury\n<td>[[Gustav Bauer]]\n|}\n\nM\u00fcller's tenure of the Foreign Office was only temporary, and before the middle of April he relinquished that position to Dr. [[Adolf K\u00f6ster]]. At the same time there was a reconstruction of the government of Prussia, [[Otto Braun]] becoming premier. The new ministry was constituted on much the same lines as that of Germany, and including members of all the three moderate parties.\n\n===Ruhr Uprising===\nAs soon as he assumed office M\u00fcller had to deal with the pressing problem of the insurrection in the [[Ruhr valley]], and the neutral zone generally. The German government applied to the Allies for permission to send troops into the disturbed districts in excess of the numbers allowed by the Treaty of Versailles. It appears that in view of the situation which had arisen the British and Italian governments made various suggestions for a temporary modification of these particular provisions of the Treaty of Versailles (Articles 42 to 44). It was proposed, for instance, that German forces might be allowed to occupy the Ruhr valley under whatever guarantees Marshal Foch might think necessary; or that the German troops should be accompanied by Allied officers; or that the matter should be left in the hands of the German government with a warning that if the neutral zone were not re-evacuated as soon as practicable, a further district of Germany would be occupied by the Entente. The French government, however, raised difficulties; and declared that if the Germans were allowed to send forces into the Ruhr District, they (the French) should be allowed to occupy [[Frankfurt]], [[Homburg, Saarland|Homburg]], and other neighbouring German towns, with the sanction of the Allies, during the period that the German troops were in the neutral zone. Owing to these differences of opinion between the Allied governments no quick decision was reached; in the meantime, the insurrection in the Ruhr Valley was becoming daily more serious. Moreover, the German government themselves hindered a settlement by indicating that they could not accept the French suggestion of a parallel occupation of Frankfurt by French troops. It was obvious that matters would soon reach a crisis, notwithstanding the conciliatory efforts of the British government It came as no great surprise, when, on April 3, German regular troops, of the Reichswehr, entered the neutral zone in force, although no permission for them to do so had been granted by the Entente. The troops were under the command of General von Watter, and they experienced no serious difficulty in dealing with the Spartacists, although the latter possessed some artillery. The revolutionary headquarters at [[M\u00fclheim]] were taken on April 4.\n\n===International intervention===\nThese incidents led to somewhat sensational developments between the French, British, and German governments. Immediately after the German troops crossed the line, the French government itself gave orders to its own troops to advance, and Frankfurt was occupied on April 6 and Homburg on the following day. The French government proclaimed the necessity of this move on the ground that Articles 42 to 44 of the Treaty of Versailles had been broken by the Germans. The French advance occasioned extreme bitterness of feeling in Germany, more particularly as some of the occupying troops were black; and the attitude of the crowds in Frankfurt became so hostile, that on one occasion the French troops brought a machine-gun into action, and a number of civilians were killed and wounded. The British government also disapproved of the French action, partly because they regarded the advance as an extreme measure which should only have been adopted in the last resort, and still more so because the French move had been made independently, and without the sanction of the other Allied governments. The British held that the enforcement of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles was an affair for the Allies collectively, and not for any single Allied government.\n\nThe Franco-British difference of opinion was, however, of short duration (see [[1920 in France]]); and it was soon made clear that whilst the British government were disposed to think that there had been a genuine necessity to send the German troops into the Ruhr valley, they were equally as determined as the French to see that the terms of the treaty were observed. And the extreme rapidity with which the German troops overcame the revolutionaries tended to bring the whole crisis to an end.\n\nOn April 12 M\u00fcller made a statement on the situation in the National Assembly at Berlin. He complained of French militarism, and in particular that Senegalese negroes should have been quartered in Frankfurt University. He laid the blame for the developments largely upon Kapp and his associates; and said that it was owing to the undermining of the loyalty of the Reichswehr by the reactionaries, that the working classes had now lost confidence in the republican army. The latest casualty list which had been received from the disturbed area proved the severity of the actions which had taken place; 160 officers and men had been killed and nearly 400 had been wounded. The advance of the German troops into the Ruhr had been necessary in order to protect the lives and property of peaceable citizens living in that district. It was true, said the speaker, that according to Articles 42 and 43 of the treaty of peace, the German government were not allowed to assemble armed forces in the neutral zone, because to do so would constitute a hostile act against the signatory powers; but, he asked, was this prescription laid down in order to prevent the reestablishment of public order? By an agreement of August 1919, the Entente had sanctioned the maintenance in the neutral zone of a military police force, and therefore the Entente, including France, had recognized that measures necessary for the preservation of order in the neutral zone did not constitute a violation of the treaty.\n\n===San Remo meeting===\nA meeting of the Supreme Council, consisting of the British, French, and Italian prime ministers, was opened at [[Sanremo|San Remo]] on April 19; and the Council had to deal, among other questions, with the German invasion of the Ruhr Valley, and with the problem of disarmament generally. [[David Lloyd George]], with the support of [[Francesco Saverio Nitti]], proposed that the German government should be invited to attend the conference; but this was strongly opposed by [[Alexandre Millerand]], and the proposal therefore lapsed. The result of the discussions at San Remo on the German question was that a note dealing with the question of disarmament was sent to the German government at the end of April. The note declared that so long as the German government was not taking serious steps to carry out the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, it was impossible for the Allied governments even to consider the German request that the permanent force of 100,000 men, allowed by the treaty, should be increased. Germany was not fulfilling her engagements either in the destruction of the materials of war, or in the reduction of the number of troops, or in the provision of coal, or with regard to reparation. The Allied governments intended to insist upon the carrying out of the terms of the treaty, though in cases where the German government were faced with unavoidable difficulties, the Allied governments would not necessarily insist upon a literal interpretation of the terms. It was not their intention to annex any portion of German territory.\n\nSo far as the occupation of the Ruhr valley was concerned the above note came almost after the event as the rapidity with which the Reichswehr overcame the insurgents made it possible for the German government to withdraw the troops within a few weeks. At the end of April the foreign minister, Dr. K\u00f6ster, declared that the French ought now to evacuate Frankfurt, Darmstadt, and Homburg, because the German troops had been reduced to 17,500 which was permitted by the agreement of August 1919. On the Allied side, however, it was stated that the force must be reduced forthwith to twenty battalions, six squadrons, and two batteries; and that even this force would have to be replaced entirely by a body of 10,000 police by July 10. The German government made the necessary reductions, and on May 17 the French evacuated Frankfurt and the other occupied towns.\n\n===General election===\nThe reactionary and Spartacist insurrections having been thus quelled, the German government proceeded, in accordance with their declarations, to make the necessary preparations for holding the general election. The elections were fixed for Sunday, June 6. All the parties undertook active campaigns, but the general public showed less interest in these elections for the new Reichstag than they had shown in the elections for the temporary National Assembly in January 1919. The total number of electors was about 32,000,000, approximately 15,000,000 men and 17,000,000 women; but only about 80% of the voters exercised their rights. In the elections of 1919, the results had been strikingly in accord with the last general election for the Reichstag before the war; and had therefore constituted a remarkable popular confirmation of the attitude of the Reichstag bloc during the war. The present elections yielded different results. The three moderate parties had been in an overwhelming majority both in the last imperial Reichstag and also in the new republican National Assembly. They were again returned with a majority over the right and left political wings combined, but the majority was now very small. The German political parties were now grouped, from right to left, as follows: the National Party (the old Conservatives), the German People's Party (the old National Liberals); the Democrats (the old Radicals); the Clericals (the old Centre, which now included Protestant as well as Catholic Clericals); the Majority Social Democrats; the Minority or Independent Social Democrats; and lastly the Communists or Spartacists, whose opinions were comparable with those of the Bolsheviks of Russia.\n\nIn January 1919, the Communists, presumably realizing their numerical insignificance, had refused to take part in the polling. On this occasion, however, they decided to enter the contest, and one of the remarkable features of the elections was the utter collapse of the Spartacists. The satisfaction which the rout of the Spartacists caused to most moderate Germans was, however, tempered by the success of the Independent Social Democrats, who had for months been growing increasingly more extreme in their views, and were now, indeed, one of the most extreme Socialist parties in all Europe, outside Russia. The total number of deputies in the new Reichstag was slightly greater than in the National Assembly, being about 470, the exact number being doubtful until the destinies of the plebiscite areas in West Prussia, East Prussia, and Silesia had been decided. The Spartacists won only two seats. The Independent Social Democrats, however, increased their membership of the house from twenty-two to eighty. The success of the Independent Social Democrats was gained, as might have been expected, chiefly at the expense of the Majority Social Democrats, who had been by far the largest party in the National Assembly. Indeed, the reduction in numbers of the Majority Social Democrats was almost exactly the same as the increase in numbers of the Minority Social Democrats. The total of the Majority Social Democrats fell from 165 to 110. The Clerical electorate, whose strength lay in the west and south, was as always a remarkably constant feature. The Clericals returned with eighty-eight deputies, as against ninety in the Assembly.\n\nPassing to a consideration of the Liberal and Conservative parties, one finds that on the right wing of politics there had also been a remarkable change. The Democrats fared worse in the elections than any other party. The two parties of the right were returned in far greater strength than they had possessed in the National Assembly. The number of Democrats fell from 75 to 45, which was the more remarkable when the increased size of the house is considered. The German National Party, representing the old Conservatives, and still avowed monarchists, increased their strength from 43to 65. But the most remarkable gains were those of the German People's Party. This party\u2014the old National Liberals\u2014represented chiefly the great industrial interests and had been very influential, though not very numerous, under the Empire. In January 1919, they had been almost annihilated at the polls, and had won only twenty-two seats. Now, however, they returned with over sixty deputies.\n\nIt will be seen that the elections apparently revealed two diametrically opposite tendencies: a drift from the moderates to the extreme left, and a drift from the moderates to the extreme right. These two tendencies had affected adversely the Majority Social Democrats and Democrats respectively. To some extent this possibly reflected popular discontent with the existing government, with a tendency for the Democrats to vote for the German People's Party and the Majority Social Democrats to drift to the Independent Social Democrats. The exception in this drift to the political extremes was to be found, with the supporters of the Clerical Party, whose political fidelity was proverbial. It was not the most extreme parties, the German Nationals and the Communists, who profited by the ministerial discontent, but the German People's Party and the Independent Social Democrats.\n\nThe Majority Social Democrats were still the largest party in the country, as in the house, and secured about 5,500,000 votes\u2014nearly 1,000,000 more than the respective totals of the Independent Social Democrats and the Clericals, whose strength was about equal. The Democrats secured a little over 2,000,000 votes; whilst the two parties of the right together secured over 7,000,000 votes, about equally divided between them.\n\nThe two parties of the right had increased their total vote by some 3,500,000, and the democratic vote had sunk by about the same number. The total poll of the Majority Social Democrats had sunk by some 5,500,000, whilst the poll of the Minority Social Democrats had risen by more than 2,500,000. When allowance is made for the decrease in the total poll, there was virtually no difference in the Clerical poll, as compared with January 1919. It will be seen that as between the non-Socialists and the Socialists as a whole, the position of the non-Socialists had markedly improved, and they had, in fact, slightly increased their aggregate poll, notwithstanding the diminution of the total number of electors who exercised their rights.\n\n===New cabinet===\nOwing to the changes in the relative strength of parties, it was several weeks before a cabinet could be formed; and after several politicians had attempted in vain to form a new cabinet, [[Konstantin Fehrenbach]], one of the most respected leaders of the Clerical Party, succeeded in doing so. What might have been an extremely unstable parliamentary position was avoided by the good sense shown by the German People's Party, who were led by [[Gustav Stresemann]]. The German People's Party decided to abandon their position of opposition and their association with the Conservatives, and agreed to unite with the Clericals and Democrats to form a government. The Majority Social Democrats would not actually join a ministry which included the German People's Party, but they agreed to lend the new government their general support in the Reichstag. Thus it came about that twenty months after the revolution an entirely non-Socialist government came into power in Germany, though it was true that the new government depended partly upon the support of the Majority Social Democrats, whose moderation, however, made them more comparable to the Radical-Socialists of France and to Radicals in other countries, than to the Socialist parties of most other countries in Europe. Fehrenbach was born in 1852 and entered the Bavarian parliament as a Catholic and a representative of Freiburg when he was about thirty years of age. He was elected to the Reichstag in 1903 and he became president of that house in 1918. And in 1919 he became president of the National Assembly.\n\nFehrenbach was able to form a strong cabinet from the personal point of view. [[Rudolf Heinze]] became vice-chancellor and minister for justice, Dr. [[Walter Simons]] became foreign minister, [[Joseph Wirth]] became minister of finance, [[Erich Koch-Weser]] was minister of the interior, and [[Johannes Giesberts]] was minister of posts. Noske was not a member of the new cabinet.\n\nThe new chancellor made his first declaration to the Reichstag on June 28, and declared that so long as the formerly hostile states refused to modify the Treaty of Versailles, the German government could have no other policy than to endeavour to the best of their ability to carry out the terms of that treaty.\n\n===Spa conference===\n{{main|Spa Conference of 1920}}\nAt the meeting of the Supreme Council at San Remo in April it was decided to invite the German government to a conference at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], in Belgium, in order to settle the questions relating to disarmament and reparations which arose under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The Spa Conference was held during the first half of July, and Fehrenbach himself attended the conference at which Lloyd George and Millerand were also present. Before going into the conference with the Germans the Allies agreed amongst themselves as to the proportions of the total German reparation which should be allotted to each of the Allied countries. Thus France was to receive 52%, the British Empire 22%, Italy 10%, Belgium 8%, and Serbia 5%, the small remaining proportion to be divided amongst other claimants. Apart from her 8% Belgium was to have the privilege of transferring her entire war debt to Germany's shoulders, and she was also to have a prior claim upon the first \u00a3100,000,000 paid by Germany. These proportions were settled, but the total amount to be paid by Germany was not decided.\n\nThe conference was to have been opened on July 5, and a preliminary sitting was in fact held on that day, but owing to the non-arrival of [[Otto Gessler]], the German minister of defense, it was not possible to proceed with the serious consideration of the first subject on the agenda, which was the question of German disarmament. The conference was held under the presidency of the Belgian prime minister, [[L\u00e9on Delacroix]], and the Belgian foreign minister, [[Paul Hymans]], also attended. The British representatives, in addition to Lloyd George himself, were [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] and Sir [[Laming Worthington-Evans]]. The chief Italian representative was [[Count Sforza]], the distinguished and successful foreign minister. The German chancellor was accompanied by Simons and Wirth.\n\nOn the following day Gessler arrived, and he proceeded at once to make a formal request that the 100,000 men, which was the limit of the German army allowed by the treaty, should continue to be exceeded, on the ground that it was impossible for the government to keep order with such a small force. Lloyd George then explained the reasons for the Allies' anxiety. He said that the treaty allowed Germany 100,000 men, 100,000 rifles, and 2,000 machine guns. Germany, however, still possessed a regular army of 200,000 men, and also possessed 50,000 machine guns, and 12,000 guns. Moreover, she had only surrendered 1,500,000 rifles, although it was obvious that there must be millions of rifles in the country. During the discussions on the following days it transpired from statements made by the chief of the General Staff himself, General von Seeckt, that in addition to the Reichswehr there were various other organized forces in Germany such as the Einwohnerwehr and the Sicherheitspolizei. The Einwohnerwehr alone appear to have numbered over 500,000 men. General von Seeckt proposed that the regular army should be reduced gradually to 100,000 men by October 1921. A discussion upon this matter took place between the Allies, and it was decided that Germany should be given until January 1, 1921, to reduce the strength of the Reichswehr to the treaty figure of 100,000 men. The exact conditions laid down were that Germany should reduce the Reichswehr to 150,000 men by October 1, withdraw the arms of the Einwohnerwehr and the Sicherheitspolizei, and issue a proclamation demanding the surrender of all arms in the hands of the civilian population, with effective penalties in the event of default. On July 9 the German delegates signed the agreement embodying these stipulations in regard to disarmament.\n\nThe later sittings of the conference were concerned with the question of the trial of the German \"war criminals\", the delivery of coal as a form of reparation, and various other financial matters. It was the question of coal which required the closest attention, largely owing to the extreme need of France for supplies of coal, and the agreement relating to this matter was signed on July 16. It was decided that for six months after August 1 the German government should deliver up 2,000,000 tons of coal per month.\n\nThe question of the war criminals referred to above had been under discussion since the beginning of the year. The Treaty of Versailles had required that certain persons with an especially evil record in the war should be handed over to the Allies. Lists of the chief persons coming under the heading of \"war criminals\" were published by the Allied governments at the end of January. The lists included a number of very well known persons, such as the Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], General von Kluck, Admiral von Tirpitz, and Admiral von Capelle. However, the ex-Emperor Wilhelm had fled to the Netherlands, and since the Dutch government definitely declined to hand him over to the Allies, it was generally held, especially in Britain, that it was difficult to press forward very vigorously with the punishment of those who, however important their positions, had only been the emperor's servants. It was therefore subsequently decided that the German government itself should be instructed to proceed with the punishment of the war criminals concerned. But it transpired at Spa that the German government had been extremely dilatory in taking the necessary proceedings.\n\n===Rest of 1920===\nThe last five months of the year were much less eventful in Germany. The country was still suffering from a shortage of food, though not in the acute degree which was so painfully characteristic of Austria and also of some of the other countries farther east. The German government appears to have made serious efforts to comply with their treaty obligations regarding disarmament and reparation. Thus, in the three weeks following the Spa Conference over 4,000 heavy guns and field guns were destroyed; and measures were taken to obtain the very large number of arms which existed all over the country in the hands of the civilian population. Great numbers of livestock were also handed over to the Allies. Thus France received from Germany (up to November 30) over 30,000 horses, over 65,000 cattle, and over 100,000 sheep. Belgium received, up to the same date, 6,000 horses, 67,000 cattle, and 35,000 sheep.\n\nThe financial position of the country remained extremely serious. The total national debt (funded debt and floating debt) amounted to 200,000,000,000 marks, that is, \u00a310,000,000,000 sterling at the old prewar rate of exchange. The anticipated revenue for the year 1920\u201321 was 27,950,000,000 marks, and the anticipated ordinary expenditure was 23,800,000,000 marks. There was, however, also an anticipated extraordinary expenditure of no less than 11,600,000,000 marks. A heavy deficit on the railways was also expected. The [[exchange value]] of the mark had fallen disastrously since the armistice, and though it rose towards the end of the year, the mark was still reckoned at over 200 to the pound sterling in December.\n\nVarious statistics of population were published during the year. Among other significant features, it was stated that the number of children under five years of age, in the whole of the territories of the former Hohenzollern empire, had sunk from 8,000,000 in 1911 to 5,000,000 in 1919.\n\nAfter resigning from the cabinet, Noske became president of the province of [[Hannover]].\n\n==Births==\n* [[20 February]] \u2013 [[Karl Albrecht]], German entrepreneur (died [[2014 in Germany|2014]])\n* [[22 February]] \u2013 [[Maria Hellwig]], German yodeler, popular performer of volkst\u00fcmliche Musik (Alpine folk music), and television presenter (died [[2010 in Germany|2010]])\n* [[15 April]] \u2013 [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]], German politician, former [[President of Germany]] (died [[2015 in Germany|2015]])\n* [[2 June]] \u2013 [[Marcel Reich-Ranicki]], German literary critic (died [[2013 in Germany|2013]])\n* [[18 June]] \u2013 [[Utta Danella]], German writer (died [[2015 in Germany|2015]])\n* [[8 October]] \u2013 [[Maria Beig]], German author (died [[2018 in Germany|2018]])<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kopitzki |first1=Siegmund |title=Konstanz: Die Stimme Oberschwabens: Zum Tod der Autorin Maria Beig |url=https://www.suedkurier.de/ueberregional/kultur/Die-Stimme-Oberschwabens-Zum-Tod-der-Autorin-Maria-Beig;art10399,9882521 |website=S\u00dcDKURIER Online |accessdate=11 June 2019 |language=de |date=7 September 2018}}</ref>\n* [[31 October]] \u2013 [[Fritz Walter]], German footballplayer (died [[2002 in Germany|2002]])\n\n==Deaths==\n* [[12 May]] \u2013 [[Casar Flaischlen]], German poet (born [[1864 in Germany|1864]])\n* [[14 June]] \u2013 [[Max Weber]], German sociologist, philosopher, jurist, and political economist (born [[1864 in Germany|1864]])\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Germany year nav}}\n{{Year in Europe|1920}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1920}}\n[[Category:1920 in Germany| ]]\n[[Category:1920 by country]]\n[[Category:1920 in Europe]]\n[[Category:Years of the 20th century in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=June 2019}}\n{{essay|date=February 2011}}\n}}\n{{Year in Germany|1920}}\nEvents in the year '''1920 in [[Germany]]'''.\n\n== Incumbents ==\n===National level===\n[[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]]\n*[[Friedrich Ebert]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]])\n[[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]]\n*[[Gustav Bauer]] (Social Democrats) to 27 March, then [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]] ''(1st term)'' (Social Democrats) to 25 June, then [[Constantin Fehrenbach]] ([[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre]])\n\n== Overview ==\nConsider first the territorial changes which had been brought about by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (and also certain internal territorial rearrangements which had taken place as the result of the revolution). By the Treaty of Versailles provinces had been severed from Germany in almost all directions.\n\nThe two most important cessions of territory were the loss of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] to [[France]] and of a large stretch of territory in [[West Prussia]], [[Province of Posen|Posen]], and [[Upper Silesia]] to [[Poland]]. Of these, the territory ceded to Poland amounted to nearly {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2|-4}}, and, coupled with the establishment of [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] as an independent state, which was also imposed upon Germany, this loss had the effect of cutting off [[East Prussia]] from the main territory of Germany.\n\nDanzig and Memel were to be ceded to the Allies, their fate to be subsequently decided. A portion of Silesia was to be ceded to [[Czechoslovakia]]. Also, apart from the actual cessions of territory, the treaty arranged that [[plebiscite]]s should be held in certain areas to decide the destinies of the districts concerned. Certain districts of East Prussia and West Prussia were to poll to decide whether they should belong to Germany or to Poland. A third portion of Silesia, which was in dispute between Germany and Poland, was to exercise the right of self-determination. The small districts of [[Eupen]] and [[Malmedy]] were to decide whether they would belong to [[Belgium]] or to Germany. The middle and southern districts of the province of [[Schleswig]], which had been annexed to [[Prussia]] in 1866, were to decide their own destinies. Finally, the coal-producing valley of the [[Saar (1920-1935)|Saarland]], which had been provisionally separated from Germany, was to be the subject of a referendum after the lapse of fifteen years.\n\nThe Allied and Associated governments had assumed the task of revising territorial changes and arrangements dating back to the latter half of the 18th century. The conference cancelled completely the expansion of Germany over the past 150 years; but did not cancel the schism in Germany\u2014the exclusion of Austria\u2014which had been incidental to that expansion.\n\n[[File:Hoch-Cut_With_the_Kitchen_Knife.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Hannah_H\u00f6ch#Cut_with_the_Kitchen_Knife_Dada_through_the_Last_Weimar_Beer-Belly_Cultural_Epoch_in_Germany_(1919)|Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada Through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany]]'' is an example of [[photomontage]] by [[Dada]] artist [[Hannah H\u00f6ch]].

During the period of the Hohenzollern empire there had been twenty-six states within the German federation. During the war the number had been reduced by one by the fusion of the principalities of [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]] and [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]]. After the revolution there was a rapid reduction in the number of smaller states. Alsace-Lorraine was, of course, returned to France, and the two [[principalities of Reuss]]\u2014the so-called Elder and Younger lines\u2014united into a single state. The Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] split into two halves; [[Coburg (district)|Coburg]] voluntarily united itself with Bavaria, and [[Sachsen-Gotha|Gotha]] later in the year 1919 entered into negotiations with a number of the other small states of central Germany to bring about a general union of the little republics concerned. Six states took part in these negotiations, which were brought to a successful conclusion at the end of December 1919. The states which thus agreed to unite were: (1) Schwarzburg, (2) Reuss, (3) Gotha, (4) [[Saxe-Weimar]], (5) [[Saxe-Meiningen]], and (6) [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The total population of the United States was just over 1,500,000, and their joint area was just over {{convert|4500|sqmi|km2|-2}}. The states took the name of [[Thuringia]] (''Einheitsstaat Th\u00fcringen''). The town of [[Weimar]] was made the capital of the new state.\n\nIt will be seen that owing to these various fusions and changes the twenty-six states of the German federation were reduced to eighteen.\n\n===Political situation at the beginning of the year===\nIn considering the general political situation in the country at the beginning of 1920, it is notable that from the time of the revolution until the end of 1919, the Liberal and Radical parties in combination with the so-called Majority Social Democratic Party had held power continuously, and had been strikingly confirmed in their position by the general election held in January 1919. The chief point of interest in the general election had been the close correspondence of the results with those that used to be obtained in the elections for the old [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in the time of the Empire. On February 11, 1919, the new parliament elected [[Friedrich Ebert]] as president of the German republic. [[Philipp Scheidemann]] acted as [[minister-president]] during the first half of 1919, but at the time of the signing of the treaty of peace in June he was succeeded by [[Gustav Bauer]], one of the best-known leaders of the Majority Social Democratic Party, who had not been a member of Scheidemann's government. The government persevered but the ministry and the parties which supported them were placed in an unstable and very difficult position. On one side, the government had to face the extreme hostility of the conservative party, who had been opposed from the beginning to the new republican institutions. On the other side, they faced the extreme revolutionaries, who, for entirely different reasons, had been opposed to the submission to the Entente, and desired an alliance with the Bolshevik forces of the Soviet Union. During 1919 the government had been faced greater difficulties from the parties of the left than the parties of the right, and the extreme Socialists had made several unsuccessful attempts at armed insurrection. The reactionary groups were also capable of making serious trouble for the government. {{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Anti-government agitation===\nDuring January and February there were no events of first-class importance, but in March there were kaleidoscopic changes in Berlin, which illustrated dramatically the difficulty of the position of the moderate German government, placed as it was, between the extremists of the right and of the left. During the early weeks of the year certain people in the conservative party were agitating actively against the government, and were endeavouring to find some pretext\u2014preferably a democratic pretext\u2014for taking action against them. One of the most prominent persons in this movement was Dr. [[Wolfgang Kapp]], who had once held office as president of East Prussia, and had been a founder of the Fatherland Party and an associate of the Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]]. During January and February Kapp entered into correspondence with the prime minister, Bauer, and brought complaints against the government. The chief of these complaints were that Ebert had remained in power too long, since according to the constitution the president ought to be elected by the whole nation, and not merely (as Ebert had been) by the National Assembly; that the ministry itself had likewise retained power too long, since it and the parliament which supported it were elected and established only for the purpose of concluding peace; that the government's administration had been inefficient and had failed to restore the economic position in the country, which had remained deplorable since the conclusion of the armistice. There was but little substance in any of these charges, except, perhaps, the first; and there is every reason to suspect that they were only put forward as a cover for different, and possibly sinister, designs. Ebert and Bauer naturally paid no attention to Dr. Kapp's demands; and in the middle of March the reactionaries seem to have thought that the time had arrived for them to come out into the open and declare opposition.\n\nOn March 12 Bauer appears to have obtained information regarding the plot, and possibly it was this which induced the conspirators to act earlier than they had intended and certainly prematurely. Kapp had obtained an important accomplice in the person of General Baron [[Walther von L\u00fcttwitz]], who was the commander of the 1st Division of the [[Reichswehr]]. Another commander of the Reichswehr, General [[Georg Maerker]], also appears to have been very doubtful in his loyalty to the government. During the past twelve months both these soldiers had served well under the able, but ruthless, cruel, and traitorous war minister, [[Gustav Noske]], in the work of suppressing the insurrections of the ''[[Spartacist League|Spartacists]]'', a group of anti-war German radicals. Repression of the German pacifists and internationalists, it would turn out, was an activity in which reactionaries and moderates could easily cooperate without friction.\n\n===Coup in Berlin===\nFinding that his plot was discovered, Dr. Kapp attempted a sudden ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in Berlin, which met with fleeting success. Supported by the Marine Brigade Erhardt (the first paramilitary group to use the [[swastika]] as its emblem), by the irregular \"[[Baltic region|Baltic]]\" troops (the German troops who had occasioned trouble in [[Courland]] in the previous year by fighting independently of any government), who were now stationed at [[D\u00f6beritz]], by the former guard cavalry division, and by the [[Reichswehr]] troops whom General von L\u00fcttwitz had led, Kapp advanced upon Berlin in the early hours of March 13. Realizing that the generals in command of the Reichswehr had betrayed their trust, Ebert and Bauer fled from Berlin to Dresden, and were fortunate in being able to escape before the Baltic troops arrived. Immediately after he reached Berlin, at 10 am, Dr. Kapp issued a proclamation declaring that the Ebert-Bauer administration had ceased to exist and that he was himself acting as imperial chancellor, and that General von L\u00fcttwitz had been appointed minister of defense. The proclamation also stated that Dr. Kapp only regarded his administration as provisional, and that he would \"restore constitutional conditions\" by holding new elections. The new government disclaimed any intention of restoring the monarchy, but all Kapp's chief supporters were monarchists, and he had the old imperial colours\u2014black, white, and red\u2014hoisted in the capital. It was also perhaps significant that immediately after the ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' much coming and going was reported from ex-Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]]'s Dutch home at Amerongen.\n\nEbert and his associates were not slow to decide upon the measures to be taken against the reactionaries. They issued an appeal to the working classes to engage in a drastic general strike. The appeal, which was signed by Ebert, Bauer, and Noske, read as follows:\n\n:\"The military revolt has come. [[Hermann Ehrhardt|Ehrhardt]]'s [[Marinebrigade Ehrhardt|naval brigade]] is advancing on Berlin to overthrow the government. These servants of the state, who fear the dissolution of the army, desire to put reactionaries in the seat of the government. We refuse to bend before military compulsion. We did not make the revolution in order to have again to recognize militarism. We will not cooperate with the criminals of the Baltic states. We should be ashamed of ourselves, did we act otherwise.\n\n:A thousand times, No! Cease work! Stifle the opportunity of this military dictatorship! Fight with all the means at your command to retain the republic. Put all differences of opinion aside.\n\n:Only one means exists against the return of Wilhelm II. That is the cessation of all means of communication. No hand may be moved. No [[proletarian]] may assist the dictator. Strike along the whole line.\"\n\nThe response to this appeal by the working classes was enthusiastic and almost universal. Except in East Prussia and to some extent in Pomerania and Silesia, the Kapp \"government\" obtained scarcely any support in the country; and the Saxon, Bavarian, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Baden governments all rallied to the support of President Ebert\u2014though notwithstanding the loyalty of the Saxons, the president and the prime minister thought it advisable to remove from Dresden to Stuttgart. Kapp and von L\u00fcttwitz met with the bitter hostility of the working classes in Berlin, who succeeded in bringing to a standstill the whole life of the capital.\n\nIt was, indeed, apparent after forty-eight hours that the extraordinary success of the general strike would make the new Kapp regime impossible. During the first two days there were rumours that in order to avoid civil war Ebert and Bauer were willing to compromise with the conspirators; but it soon became obvious that any such course would be unnecessary.\n\nThe feature which hampered Kapp fatally was the complete success of the strike in Berlin itself; and since his writ did not even run in the capital, the usurping chancellor felt compelled to resign on March 17. He endeavoured to cover up his failure, by alleging that his mission had been fulfilled, in that the government had now proclaimed that they would hold a general election within a few weeks, but his protestations notwithstanding, it was obvious to all the onlookers that his real designs had been to displace the old government altogether, and very probably to upset the entire republican regime. A meeting of the National Assembly was held at Stuttgart on March 18, and the prime minister made a long speech dealing with Kapp's escapade, but before then, the crisis had already passed\u2014and had in fact given place to a crisis of a totally different kind. On March 18 some of the members of the government returned to Berlin, and on that day also Kapp's troops\u2014who were known as the \"Baltic\" troops, although the name properly applied only to a section of them\u2014left the capital. Their departure was unfortunately marked by a most disagreeable incident. As they marched through the streets towards the Brandenburg Gate, the populace which had always been entirely hostile to them, collected in great numbers and followed the soldiers, jeering vociferously. The legionaries were in an ill-humour at the failure of their coup, and being further aggravated by the behaviour of the crowds, when the last detachment reached the Brandenburg Gate they wheeled about, and fired several volleys into the mass of civilians who had followed them. A panic ensued, and a considerable number of persons were killed and wounded. Kapp himself fled to Sweden.\n\nSee also [[Kapp Putsch]].\n\n===Return of government===\nWhen the government returned to the capital, they found that the strike which they had utilized to overcome Kapp had now got beyond control; and indeed in the east end of Berlin, Soviets were being declared, and Daunig had declared himself president of a new German Communist republic. The government called off the strike, but a large number of the strikers refused to return to work. On March 19 [[Spartacist League|Spartacist]] risings occurred in many different places, especially in western Prussia, [[Bavaria]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], and [[Leipzig]]. In Leipzig the rising was extremely serious, and in suppressing this local insurrection the government had to use aeroplanes over the streets of the city in order to intimidate the Communists. The Communist leaders decided to direct the strike, the power of which had been proved against Kapp, against the government itself. In Berlin, with the active assistance of the prime minister of Prussia, [[Paul Hirsch (politician)|Paul Hirsch]], the federal government were soon able to gain control of affairs; and in [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]], Bavaria, and W\u00fcrttemberg the troops were also able to overcome speedily the insurrection. But in the west, in Westphalia and the Rhineland, the situation became extremely serious. The position was in this part of Germany complicated by the existence of the neutral zone lying between the territory occupied by the Entente, and the main part of Germany, where the government were of course free to move their forces as they pleased. Apart from a small force for police purposes, the German government were not allowed to send troops into the neutral zone. The military police in the zone were quite incapable of dealing with the Spartacist insurrection; and the insurgents speedily took possession of [[Essen, Germany|Essen]], after a treacherous attack on the rear of the small government force. The revolutionists also seized [[Wesel]]. The union of \"Red\" Germany with Bolshevik Russia was proclaimed. The government took alarm at the development of the Spartacist peril, and on March 23 it was even rumoured that a purely Socialist government\u2014containing several members of the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]]\u2014was to be formed. This rumour proved to be untrue, but two of the ablest members of the cabinet, Noske and [[Matthias Erzberger]], who were especially obnoxious to the Communists, were asked by Bauer to resign. The resignation of these two ministers was in some sense a concession to the extremists, but the latter refused to consider compromise. Feeling overwhelmed with the difficulty of the situation, Bauer himself resigned on March 26. Fortunately Ebert had no difficulty in finding a statesman willing to undertake the burden of the chancellorship. The president asked [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]], who had previously held the office of minister for foreign affairs, to form an administration. Within forty-eight hours it was announced that M\u00fcller had succeeded in forming a cabinet, which included (as did the previous administration) members of all the three moderate parties, the Clericals, the Democrats, and the Majority Social Democrats. The new cabinet was composed as follows:\n\n{|\n|-----\n| Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs\n<td>[[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]]\n|-----\n| Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs\n<td>von Haniel\n|-----\n| Minister of the Interior and Vice-Chancellor\n<td>[[Erich Koch-Weser]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Posts\n<td>[[Johannes Giesberts]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Finance\n<td>[[Joseph Wirth]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Transport\n<td>[[Johannes Bell]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Justice\n<td>[[Andreas Blunck]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Labour\n<td>[[Alexander Schlicke]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Economics\n<td>[[Robert Schmidt (politician)|Robert Schmidt]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Defense\n<td>[[Otto Gessler]]\n|-----\n| Minister of Food\n<td>[[Andreas Hermes]]\n|-----\n| Minister without Portfolio\n<td>[[Eduard David]]\n|-----\n| President of the Treasury\n<td>[[Gustav Bauer]]\n|}\n\nM\u00fcller's tenure of the Foreign Office was only temporary, and before the middle of April he relinquished that position to Dr. [[Adolf K\u00f6ster]]. At the same time there was a reconstruction of the government of Prussia, [[Otto Braun]] becoming premier. The new ministry was constituted on much the same lines as that of Germany, and including members of all the three moderate parties.\n\n===Ruhr Uprising===\nAs soon as he assumed office M\u00fcller had to deal with the pressing problem of the insurrection in the [[Ruhr valley]], and the neutral zone generally. The German government applied to the Allies for permission to send troops into the disturbed districts in excess of the numbers allowed by the Treaty of Versailles. It appears that in view of the situation which had arisen the British and Italian governments made various suggestions for a temporary modification of these particular provisions of the Treaty of Versailles (Articles 42 to 44). It was proposed, for instance, that German forces might be allowed to occupy the Ruhr valley under whatever guarantees Marshal Foch might think necessary; or that the German troops should be accompanied by Allied officers; or that the matter should be left in the hands of the German government with a warning that if the neutral zone were not re-evacuated as soon as practicable, a further district of Germany would be occupied by the Entente. The French government, however, raised difficulties; and declared that if the Germans were allowed to send forces into the Ruhr District, they (the French) should be allowed to occupy [[Frankfurt]], [[Homburg, Saarland|Homburg]], and other neighbouring German towns, with the sanction of the Allies, during the period that the German troops were in the neutral zone. Owing to these differences of opinion between the Allied governments no quick decision was reached; in the meantime, the insurrection in the Ruhr Valley was becoming daily more serious. Moreover, the German government themselves hindered a settlement by indicating that they could not accept the French suggestion of a parallel occupation of Frankfurt by French troops. It was obvious that matters would soon reach a crisis, notwithstanding the conciliatory efforts of the British government It came as no great surprise, when, on April 3, German regular troops, of the Reichswehr, entered the neutral zone in force, although no permission for them to do so had been granted by the Entente. The troops were under the command of General von Watter, and they experienced no serious difficulty in dealing with the Spartacists, although the latter possessed some artillery. The revolutionary headquarters at [[M\u00fclheim]] were taken on April 4.\n\n===International intervention===\nThese incidents led to somewhat sensational developments between the French, British, and German governments. Immediately after the German troops crossed the line, the French government itself gave orders to its own troops to advance, and Frankfurt was occupied on April 6 and Homburg on the following day. The French government proclaimed the necessity of this move on the ground that Articles 42 to 44 of the Treaty of Versailles had been broken by the Germans. The French advance occasioned extreme bitterness of feeling in Germany, more particularly as some of the occupying troops were black; and the attitude of the crowds in Frankfurt became so hostile, that on one occasion the French troops brought a machine-gun into action, and a number of civilians were killed and wounded. The British government also disapproved of the French action, partly because they regarded the advance as an extreme measure which should only have been adopted in the last resort, and still more so because the French move had been made independently, and without the sanction of the other Allied governments. The British held that the enforcement of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles was an affair for the Allies collectively, and not for any single Allied government.\n\nThe Franco-British difference of opinion was, however, of short duration (see [[1920 in France]]); and it was soon made clear that whilst the British government were disposed to think that there had been a genuine necessity to send the German troops into the Ruhr valley, they were equally as determined as the French to see that the terms of the treaty were observed. And the extreme rapidity with which the German troops overcame the revolutionaries tended to bring the whole crisis to an end.\n\nOn April 12 M\u00fcller made a statement on the situation in the National Assembly at Berlin. He complained of French militarism, and in particular that Senegalese negroes should have been quartered in Frankfurt University. He laid the blame for the developments largely upon Kapp and his associates; and said that it was owing to the undermining of the loyalty of the Reichswehr by the reactionaries, that the working classes had now lost confidence in the republican army. The latest casualty list which had been received from the disturbed area proved the severity of the actions which had taken place; 160 officers and men had been killed and nearly 400 had been wounded. The advance of the German troops into the Ruhr had been necessary in order to protect the lives and property of peaceable citizens living in that district. It was true, said the speaker, that according to Articles 42 and 43 of the treaty of peace, the German government were not allowed to assemble armed forces in the neutral zone, because to do so would constitute a hostile act against the signatory powers; but, he asked, was this prescription laid down in order to prevent the reestablishment of public order? By an agreement of August 1919, the Entente had sanctioned the maintenance in the neutral zone of a military police force, and therefore the Entente, including France, had recognized that measures necessary for the preservation of order in the neutral zone did not constitute a violation of the treaty.\n\n===San Remo meeting===\nA meeting of the Supreme Council, consisting of the British, French, and Italian prime ministers, was opened at [[Sanremo|San Remo]] on April 19; and the Council had to deal, among other questions, with the German invasion of the Ruhr Valley, and with the problem of disarmament generally. [[David Lloyd George]], with the support of [[Francesco Saverio Nitti]], proposed that the German government should be invited to attend the conference; but this was strongly opposed by [[Alexandre Millerand]], and the proposal therefore lapsed. The result of the discussions at San Remo on the German question was that a note dealing with the question of disarmament was sent to the German government at the end of April. The note declared that so long as the German government was not taking serious steps to carry out the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, it was impossible for the Allied governments even to consider the German request that the permanent force of 100,000 men, allowed by the treaty, should be increased. Germany was not fulfilling her engagements either in the destruction of the materials of war, or in the reduction of the number of troops, or in the provision of coal, or with regard to reparation. The Allied governments intended to insist upon the carrying out of the terms of the treaty, though in cases where the German government were faced with unavoidable difficulties, the Allied governments would not necessarily insist upon a literal interpretation of the terms. It was not their intention to annex any portion of German territory.\n\nSo far as the occupation of the Ruhr valley was concerned the above note came almost after the event as the rapidity with which the Reichswehr overcame the insurgents made it possible for the German government to withdraw the troops within a few weeks. At the end of April the foreign minister, Dr. K\u00f6ster, declared that the French ought now to evacuate Frankfurt, Darmstadt, and Homburg, because the German troops had been reduced to 17,500 which was permitted by the agreement of August 1919. On the Allied side, however, it was stated that the force must be reduced forthwith to twenty battalions, six squadrons, and two batteries; and that even this force would have to be replaced entirely by a body of 10,000 police by July 10. The German government made the necessary reductions, and on May 17 the French evacuated Frankfurt and the other occupied towns.\n\n===General election===\nThe reactionary and Spartacist insurrections having been thus quelled, the German government proceeded, in accordance with their declarations, to make the necessary preparations for holding the general election. The elections were fixed for Sunday, June 6. All the parties undertook active campaigns, but the general public showed less interest in these elections for the new Reichstag than they had shown in the elections for the temporary National Assembly in January 1919. The total number of electors was about 32,000,000, approximately 15,000,000 men and 17,000,000 women; but only about 80% of the voters exercised their rights. In the elections of 1919, the results had been strikingly in accord with the last general election for the Reichstag before the war; and had therefore constituted a remarkable popular confirmation of the attitude of the Reichstag bloc during the war. The present elections yielded different results. The three moderate parties had been in an overwhelming majority both in the last imperial Reichstag and also in the new republican National Assembly. They were again returned with a majority over the right and left political wings combined, but the majority was now very small. The German political parties were now grouped, from right to left, as follows: the National Party (the old Conservatives), the German People's Party (the old National Liberals); the Democrats (the old Radicals); the Clericals (the old Centre, which now included Protestant as well as Catholic Clericals); the Majority Social Democrats; the Minority or Independent Social Democrats; and lastly the Communists or Spartacists, whose opinions were comparable with those of the Bolsheviks of Russia.\n\nIn January 1919, the Communists, presumably realizing their numerical insignificance, had refused to take part in the polling. On this occasion, however, they decided to enter the contest, and one of the remarkable features of the elections was the utter collapse of the Spartacists. The satisfaction which the rout of the Spartacists caused to most moderate Germans was, however, tempered by the success of the Independent Social Democrats, who had for months been growing increasingly more extreme in their views, and were now, indeed, one of the most extreme Socialist parties in all Europe, outside Russia. The total number of deputies in the new Reichstag was slightly greater than in the National Assembly, being about 470, the exact number being doubtful until the destinies of the plebiscite areas in West Prussia, East Prussia, and Silesia had been decided. The Spartacists won only two seats. The Independent Social Democrats, however, increased their membership of the house from twenty-two to eighty. The success of the Independent Social Democrats was gained, as might have been expected, chiefly at the expense of the Majority Social Democrats, who had been by far the largest party in the National Assembly. Indeed, the reduction in numbers of the Majority Social Democrats was almost exactly the same as the increase in numbers of the Minority Social Democrats. The total of the Majority Social Democrats fell from 165 to 110. The Clerical electorate, whose strength lay in the west and south, was as always a remarkably constant feature. The Clericals returned with eighty-eight deputies, as against ninety in the Assembly.\n\nPassing to a consideration of the Liberal and Conservative parties, one finds that on the right wing of politics there had also been a remarkable change. The Democrats fared worse in the elections than any other party. The two parties of the right were returned in far greater strength than they had possessed in the National Assembly. The number of Democrats fell from 75 to 45, which was the more remarkable when the increased size of the house is considered. The German National Party, representing the old Conservatives, and still avowed monarchists, increased their strength from 43to 65. But the most remarkable gains were those of the German People's Party. This party\u2014the old National Liberals\u2014represented chiefly the great industrial interests and had been very influential, though not very numerous, under the Empire. In January 1919, they had been almost annihilated at the polls, and had won only twenty-two seats. Now, however, they returned with over sixty deputies.\n\nIt will be seen that the elections apparently revealed two diametrically opposite tendencies: a drift from the moderates to the extreme left, and a drift from the moderates to the extreme right. These two tendencies had affected adversely the Majority Social Democrats and Democrats respectively. To some extent this possibly reflected popular discontent with the existing government, with a tendency for the Democrats to vote for the German People's Party and the Majority Social Democrats to drift to the Independent Social Democrats. The exception in this drift to the political extremes was to be found, with the supporters of the Clerical Party, whose political fidelity was proverbial. It was not the most extreme parties, the German Nationals and the Communists, who profited by the ministerial discontent, but the German People's Party and the Independent Social Democrats.\n\nThe Majority Social Democrats were still the largest party in the country, as in the house, and secured about 5,500,000 votes\u2014nearly 1,000,000 more than the respective totals of the Independent Social Democrats and the Clericals, whose strength was about equal. The Democrats secured a little over 2,000,000 votes; whilst the two parties of the right together secured over 7,000,000 votes, about equally divided between them.\n\nThe two parties of the right had increased their total vote by some 3,500,000, and the democratic vote had sunk by about the same number. The total poll of the Majority Social Democrats had sunk by some 5,500,000, whilst the poll of the Minority Social Democrats had risen by more than 2,500,000. When allowance is made for the decrease in the total poll, there was virtually no difference in the Clerical poll, as compared with January 1919. It will be seen that as between the non-Socialists and the Socialists as a whole, the position of the non-Socialists had markedly improved, and they had, in fact, slightly increased their aggregate poll, notwithstanding the diminution of the total number of electors who exercised their rights.\n\n===New cabinet===\nOwing to the changes in the relative strength of parties, it was several weeks before a cabinet could be formed; and after several politicians had attempted in vain to form a new cabinet, [[Konstantin Fehrenbach]], one of the most respected leaders of the Clerical Party, succeeded in doing so. What might have been an extremely unstable parliamentary position was avoided by the good sense shown by the German People's Party, who were led by [[Gustav Stresemann]]. The German People's Party decided to abandon their position of opposition and their association with the Conservatives, and agreed to unite with the Clericals and Democrats to form a government. The Majority Social Democrats would not actually join a ministry which included the German People's Party, but they agreed to lend the new government their general support in the Reichstag. Thus it came about that twenty months after the revolution an entirely non-Socialist government came into power in Germany, though it was true that the new government depended partly upon the support of the Majority Social Democrats, whose moderation, however, made them more comparable to the Radical-Socialists of France and to Radicals in other countries, than to the Socialist parties of most other countries in Europe. Fehrenbach was born in 1852 and entered the Bavarian parliament as a Catholic and a representative of Freiburg when he was about thirty years of age. He was elected to the Reichstag in 1903 and he became president of that house in 1918. And in 1919 he became president of the National Assembly.\n\nFehrenbach was able to form a strong cabinet from the personal point of view. [[Rudolf Heinze]] became vice-chancellor and minister for justice, Dr. [[Walter Simons]] became foreign minister, [[Joseph Wirth]] became minister of finance, [[Erich Koch-Weser]] was minister of the interior, and [[Johannes Giesberts]] was minister of posts. Noske was not a member of the new cabinet.\n\nThe new chancellor made his first declaration to the Reichstag on June 28, and declared that so long as the formerly hostile states refused to modify the Treaty of Versailles, the German government could have no other policy than to endeavour to the best of their ability to carry out the terms of that treaty.\n\n===Spa conference===\n{{main|Spa Conference of 1920}}\nAt the meeting of the Supreme Council at San Remo in April it was decided to invite the German government to a conference at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], in Belgium, in order to settle the questions relating to disarmament and reparations which arose under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The Spa Conference was held during the first half of July, and Fehrenbach himself attended the conference at which Lloyd George and Millerand were also present. Before going into the conference with the Germans the Allies agreed amongst themselves as to the proportions of the total German reparation which should be allotted to each of the Allied countries. Thus France was to receive 52%, the British Empire 22%, Italy 10%, Belgium 8%, and Serbia 5%, the small remaining proportion to be divided amongst other claimants. Apart from her 8% Belgium was to have the privilege of transferring her entire war debt to Germany's shoulders, and she was also to have a prior claim upon the first \u00a3100,000,000 paid by Germany. These proportions were settled, but the total amount to be paid by Germany was not decided.\n\nThe conference was to have been opened on July 5, and a preliminary sitting was in fact held on that day, but owing to the non-arrival of [[Otto Gessler]], the German minister of defense, it was not possible to proceed with the serious consideration of the first subject on the agenda, which was the question of German disarmament. The conference was held under the presidency of the Belgian prime minister, [[L\u00e9on Delacroix]], and the Belgian foreign minister, [[Paul Hymans]], also attended. The British representatives, in addition to Lloyd George himself, were [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] and Sir [[Laming Worthington-Evans]]. The chief Italian representative was [[Count Sforza]], the distinguished and successful foreign minister. The German chancellor was accompanied by Simons and Wirth.\n\nOn the following day Gessler arrived, and he proceeded at once to make a formal request that the 100,000 men, which was the limit of the German army allowed by the treaty, should continue to be exceeded, on the ground that it was impossible for the government to keep order with such a small force. Lloyd George then explained the reasons for the Allies' anxiety. He said that the treaty allowed Germany 100,000 men, 100,000 rifles, and 2,000 machine guns. Germany, however, still possessed a regular army of 200,000 men, and also possessed 50,000 machine guns, and 12,000 guns. Moreover, she had only surrendered 1,500,000 rifles, although it was obvious that there must be millions of rifles in the country. During the discussions on the following days it transpired from statements made by the chief of the General Staff himself, General von Seeckt, that in addition to the Reichswehr there were various other organized forces in Germany such as the Einwohnerwehr and the Sicherheitspolizei. The Einwohnerwehr alone appear to have numbered over 500,000 men. General von Seeckt proposed that the regular army should be reduced gradually to 100,000 men by October 1921. A discussion upon this matter took place between the Allies, and it was decided that Germany should be given until January 1, 1921, to reduce the strength of the Reichswehr to the treaty figure of 100,000 men. The exact conditions laid down were that Germany should reduce the Reichswehr to 150,000 men by October 1, withdraw the arms of the Einwohnerwehr and the Sicherheitspolizei, and issue a proclamation demanding the surrender of all arms in the hands of the civilian population, with effective penalties in the event of default. On July 9 the German delegates signed the agreement embodying these stipulations in regard to disarmament.\n\nThe later sittings of the conference were concerned with the question of the trial of the German \"war criminals\", the delivery of coal as a form of reparation, and various other financial matters. It was the question of coal which required the closest attention, largely owing to the extreme need of France for supplies of coal, and the agreement relating to this matter was signed on July 16. It was decided that for six months after August 1 the German government should deliver up 2,000,000 tons of coal per month.\n\nThe question of the war criminals referred to above had been under discussion since the beginning of the year. The Treaty of Versailles had required that certain persons with an especially evil record in the war should be handed over to the Allies. Lists of the chief persons coming under the heading of \"war criminals\" were published by the Allied governments at the end of January. The lists included a number of very well known persons, such as the Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], General von Kluck, Admiral von Tirpitz, and Admiral von Capelle. However, the ex-Emperor Wilhelm had fled to the Netherlands, and since the Dutch government definitely declined to hand him over to the Allies, it was generally held, especially in Britain, that it was difficult to press forward very vigorously with the punishment of those who, however important their positions, had only been the emperor's servants. It was therefore subsequently decided that the German government itself should be instructed to proceed with the punishment of the war criminals concerned. But it transpired at Spa that the German government had been extremely dilatory in taking the necessary proceedings.\n\n===Rest of 1920===\nThe last five months of the year were much less eventful in Germany. The country was still suffering from a shortage of food, though not in the acute degree which was so painfully characteristic of Austria and also of some of the other countries farther east. The German government appears to have made serious efforts to comply with their treaty obligations regarding disarmament and reparation. Thus, in the three weeks following the Spa Conference over 4,000 heavy guns and field guns were destroyed; and measures were taken to obtain the very large number of arms which existed all over the country in the hands of the civilian population. Great numbers of livestock were also handed over to the Allies. Thus France received from Germany (up to November 30) over 30,000 horses, over 65,000 cattle, and over 100,000 sheep. Belgium received, up to the same date, 6,000 horses, 67,000 cattle, and 35,000 sheep.\n\nThe financial position of the country remained extremely serious. The total national debt (funded debt and floating debt) amounted to 200,000,000,000 marks, that is, \u00a310,000,000,000 sterling at the old prewar rate of exchange. The anticipated revenue for the year 1920\u201321 was 27,950,000,000 marks, and the anticipated ordinary expenditure was 23,800,000,000 marks. There was, however, also an anticipated extraordinary expenditure of no less than 11,600,000,000 marks. A heavy deficit on the railways was also expected. The [[exchange value]] of the mark had fallen disastrously since the armistice, and though it rose towards the end of the year, the mark was still reckoned at over 200 to the pound sterling in December.\n\nVarious statistics of population were published during the year. Among other significant features, it was stated that the number of children under five years of age, in the whole of the territories of the former Hohenzollern empire, had sunk from 8,000,000 in 1911 to 5,000,000 in 1919.\n\nAfter resigning from the cabinet, Noske became president of the province of [[Hannover]].\n\n==Births==\n* [[20 February]] \u2013 [[Karl Albrecht]], German entrepreneur (died [[2014 in Germany|2014]])\n* [[22 February]] \u2013 [[Maria Hellwig]], German yodeler, popular performer of volkst\u00fcmliche Musik (Alpine folk music), and television presenter (died [[2010 in Germany|2010]])\n* [[15 April]] \u2013 [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]], German politician, former [[President of Germany]] (died [[2015 in Germany|2015]])\n* [[2 June]] \u2013 [[Marcel Reich-Ranicki]], German literary critic (died [[2013 in Germany|2013]])\n* [[18 June]] \u2013 [[Utta Danella]], German writer (died [[2015 in Germany|2015]])\n* [[8 October]] \u2013 [[Maria Beig]], German author (died [[2018 in Germany|2018]])<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kopitzki |first1=Siegmund |title=Konstanz: Die Stimme Oberschwabens: Zum Tod der Autorin Maria Beig |url=https://www.suedkurier.de/ueberregional/kultur/Die-Stimme-Oberschwabens-Zum-Tod-der-Autorin-Maria-Beig;art10399,9882521 |website=S\u00dcDKURIER Online |accessdate=11 June 2019 |language=de |date=7 September 2018}}</ref>\n* [[31 October]] \u2013 [[Fritz Walter]], German footballplayer (died [[2002 in Germany|2002]])\n\n==Deaths==\n* [[12 May]] \u2013 [[Casar Flaischlen]], German poet (born [[1864 in Germany|1864]])\n* [[14 June]] \u2013 [[Max Weber]], German sociologist, philosopher, jurist, and political economist (born [[1864 in Germany|1864]])\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Germany year nav}}\n{{Year in Europe|1920}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1920}}\n[[Category:1920 in Germany| ]]\n[[Category:1920 by country]]\n[[Category:1920 in Europe]]\n[[Category:Years of the 20th century in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Tassedethe", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 1 link to disambiguation page -(You can help)-Robert Schmidt (politician)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_in_Germany"}

Named for [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States|U.S. president]], the state was made out of the western part of the [[Washington Territory]], which was ceded by the [[British Empire]] in 1846, in accordance with the [[Oregon Treaty]] in the settlement of the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. The state, which is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Oregon]] to the south, [[Idaho]] to the east, and the [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] is the [[state capital]]; the state's largest city is [[Seattle]]. Washington is often referred to as '''Washington State''' to distinguish it from the nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\nWashington is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|18th largest state]], with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 km<sup>2</sup>), and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|13th most populous]] state, with more than 7.6 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], the center of transportation, business, and industry along [[Puget Sound]], an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep [[fjord]]s, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep [[temperate rainforest]]s in the west; [[mountain range]]s in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Western United States]], after [[California]]. [[Mount Rainier]], an active [[stratovolcano]], is the state's highest elevation, at almost {{convert|14411|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and is the most [[topographically prominent]] mountain in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]]\n\nWashington is a leading lumber producer; its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. Washington is the nation's largest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. Washington ranks second only to California in wine production.\n\nManufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding, and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has more than a thousand dams, including the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage.\n\nWashington is one of the [[List of U.S. states by income|wealthiest]] and most socially progressive states in the country.{{dubious|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}} The state consistently ranks among the best for [[life expectancy]] and low [[unemployment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|title=America's best states to live in, ranked|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=November 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107001023/https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Along with [[Colorado]], Washington was one of the [[Cannabis in Washington (state)|first to legalize medicinal and recreational]] [[cannabis]], was among the first thirty-six states to legalize [[same-sex marriage]], doing so in 2012, and was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal [[abortion]]s [[Abortion in the United States#History|on request]] before the 1973 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' loosened abortion laws nationwide. Similarly, Washington voters approved a [[Washington Death with Dignity Act|2008 referendum]] on legalization of [[assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]], and is currently one of only five states, along with [[Oregon]], [[California]], [[Colorado]] and [[Vermont]], as well as [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]] to have legalized the practice.

A [[Mediterranean Climate]] predominates in western Washington, and a much drier [[semi-arid climate]] prevails east of the Cascade Range. Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] and [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high pressure [[anticyclone]] system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion. For Washington, this means [[prevailing winds]] from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably [[dry season]].\n\nIn the autumn and winter, a low-pressure [[cyclone]] system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean. The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably [[wet season]]. The term \"[[Pineapple Express]]\" is used colloquially to describe [[atmospheric river]] events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions into the Pacific Northwest.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kruckeberg | first = Arthur R. | title = The Natural History of Puget Sound Country | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1991 | pages = 42\u201343 | isbn = 978-0-295-97477-4}}</ref>\n\nDespite western Washington's having a marine climate similar to many coastal cities of Europe, there are exceptions such as the \"Big Snow\" events of 1880, 1881, 1893, and 1916, and the \"deep freeze\" winters of 1883\u20131884, 1915\u20131916, 1949\u20131950, and 1955\u20131956, among others.

The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as {{convert|160|in}} of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a [[temperate rainforest]]. Weeks may pass without a clear day. The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than {{convert|200|in|disp=or|sp=us}} water equivalent) in the country. In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only {{convert|6|in}}. Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing [[orographic lift]] of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels. This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range. In both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures. While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations. [[Mount Baker]], near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world.

Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central [[Columbia Plateau]]\u2014especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the [[Okanagan Highland]]. Thus, instead of rain forests, much of eastern Washington is covered with [[grassland]] and [[shrub-steppe]].\n\n====Temperatures====\n\nThe average annual temperature ranges from {{convert|51|F}} on the Pacific coast to {{convert|40|F}} in the northeast. The lowest temperature recorded in the state was {{convert|-48|F}} in [[Winthrop, Washington|Winthrop]] and [[Mazama, Washington|Mazama]]. The highest recorded temperature in the state was {{convert|118|F}} at [[Ice Harbor Dam]]. Both records were set east of the Cascades.

He claimed the coastal lands up to [[Prince William Sound]] for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which they maintained made the Pacific a \"Spanish lake\" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire.\n\nIn 1778, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] explorer Captain [[James Cook]] sighted [[Cape Flattery]], at the entrance to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], but Cook did not realize the strait existed. It was not discovered until [[Charles William Barkley]], captain of the ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]'', sighted it in 1787. The straits were further explored by [[Spain|Spanish explorers]] [[Manuel Quimper]] in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791, and British explorer [[George Vancouver]] in 1792.\n\n===Settlement===\n\n{{Main|Oregon pioneer history}}\n\nThe British-Spanish [[Nootka Convention]] of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States. American captain [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]] (for whom [[Grays Harbor County, Washington|Grays Harbor County]] is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the [[Columbia Rediviva|''Columbia'']]. Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in [[sea otter]] pelts. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] entered the state on October 10, 1805.\n\nExplorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], on his voyage down the Columbia River, camped at the confluence with the Snake River on July 9, 1811, and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the [[North West Company]] to build a trading post at the site.\n[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Fur trading at [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]] in 1841]]\n\nBritain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as \"joint occupancy\" of lands west of the [[Continental Divide]] to the Pacific Ocean as part of the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, west to the Pacific, was deferred until a later time. Spain, in 1819, ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession.\n\nNegotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into [[Oregon Country]], [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the [[Columbia District]].\n\nFur trapper [[James Sinclair (fur trader)|James Sinclair]], on orders from [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]], Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, led some 200 settlers from the [[Red River Colony]] west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near [[Fort Vancouver]]. The party crossed the Rockies into the [[Columbia Valley]], near present-day [[Radium Hot Springs]], British Columbia, then traveled south-west down the [[Kootenai River]] and Columbia River. Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the [[Oregon Treaty]] on June 15, 1846.\n\nIn 1836, a group of missionaries, including [[Marcus Whitman]], established several missions and Whitman's own settlement Waiilatpu, in what is now southeastern Washington state, near present day [[Walla Walla County, Washington|Walla Walla County]], in territory of both the [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] and the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] Indian tribes. Whitman's settlement would in 1843 help the [[Oregon Trail]], the overland emigration route to the west, get established for thousands of emigrants in the following decades. Marcus provided medical care for the Native Americans, but when Indian patients\u2014lacking immunity to new, \"European\" diseases\u2014died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held \"medicine man\" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and murdered Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the [[Whitman massacre]] in 1847. This event triggered the [[Cayuse War]] between settlers and Indians.\n\n[[Fort Nisqually]], a farm and trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company and the first European settlement in the [[Puget Sound]] area, was founded in 1833. Black pioneer [[George Washington Bush]] and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from [[Missouri]] and [[Tennessee]], respectively, led four white families into the territory and founded New Market, now [[Tumwater, Washington|Tumwater]], in 1846. They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon's discriminatory settlement laws.<ref>{{cite web | title = Articles on George Washington Bush | publisher = City of Tumwater, WA | url = http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm | accessdate = June 15, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070714212032/http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm\n| archivedate = July 14, 2007 }}</ref> After them, many more settlers, migrating overland along the Oregon Trail, wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{Main|Oregon boundary dispute|Provisional Government of Oregon|Oregon Treaty|Oregon Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Washington Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Seattle - looking east on Yesler Way, 1887.jpg|thumb|Seattle in 1887]]\n\nThe growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory.

In eastern Washington, the [[Yakima River]] Valley became known for its apple orchards, while the growth of wheat using [[Dryland farming|dry farming]] techniques became particularly productive. Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests, and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the [[Douglas fir]]. Other industries that developed in the state included fishing, salmon canning and mining.\n\n===Industrial era===\n\n[[File:B-17Es at Boeing Plant, Seattle, Washington, 1943.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]] bombers under construction, circa{{nbsp}}1942]]\n\nFor a long period, [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] had large smelters where gold, silver, copper, and lead ores were treated. [[Seattle]] was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country, and for a time, it possessed a large shipbuilding industry. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and the [[Boeing]] company became an established icon in the area.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], a series of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] were constructed along the Columbia river as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], the largest concrete structure in the United States.\n\nDuring World War II, the state became a focus for war industries. While the Boeing Company produced many of the nation's [[heavy bomber]]s, ports in Seattle, [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships. Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific, a number of whom were quartered at [[Golden Gardens Park]]. In eastern Washington, the [[Hanford Site|Hanford Works]] [[Nuclear power|atomic energy]] plant was opened in 1943, and played a major role in the construction of the nation's [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bombs]].\n\n===Mount St. Helens eruption, 1980===\n\n{{Main|1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens}}\n\nOn May 18, 1980, following a period of heavy tremors and eruptions, the northeast face of [[Mount St. Helens]] [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|erupted violently]], destroying a large part of the top of the volcano.

The North Cascades Highway, [[Washington State Route 20|State Route 20]], closes every year due to snowfall and avalanches in the area of [[Washington Pass]]. The [[Cayuse Pass|Cayuse]] and [[Chinook Pass|Chinook]] Passes east of Mount Rainier also close in winter.\n\nWashington is crossed by a number of freight railroads, and Amtrak's passenger [[Amtrak Cascades|Cascade route]] between Eugene, Oregon and Vancouver, BC is the eighth busiest Amtrak service in the U.S. Seattle's [[King Street Station]], the busiest station in Washington, and 15th busiest in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|title=Amtrak|website=www.amtrak.com|access-date=January 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214015155/https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|archive-date=December 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> serves as the terminus for the two long distance Amtrak routes in Washington, the [[Empire Builder]] to Chicago and the [[Coast Starlight]] to Los Angeles.

A 2004 study of 40 mothers from Oregon, Washington, [[British Columbia]], and Montana found PBDEs in the breast milk of every woman tested.\n\nThree recent studies by the [[Washington State Department of Ecology]] showed toxic chemicals banned decades ago linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish from 45 sites. The toxic substances included [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]; [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], two chlorinated pesticides, [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] and [[dieldrin]], and PBDEs. As a result of the study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the [[Washington State Department of Health]] advises the public not to eat [[mountain whitefish]] from the [[Wenatchee River]] from [[Leavenworth, Washington|Leavenworth]] downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs.

Washington has voted for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee in every election since [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]].\n\nDue to Western Washington's large population, Democrats usually fare better statewide.

Named for [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States|U.S. president]], the state was made out of the western part of the [[Washington Territory]], which was ceded by the [[British Empire]] in 1846, in accordance with the [[Oregon Treaty]] in the settlement of the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. The state, which is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Oregon]] to the south, [[Idaho]] to the east, and the [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] is the [[state capital]]; the state's largest city is [[Seattle]]. Washington is often referred to as '''Washington State''' to distinguish it from the nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\nWashington is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|18th largest state]], with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 km<sup>2</sup>), and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|13th most populous]] state, with more than 7.6 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], the center of transportation, business, and industry along [[Puget Sound]], an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep [[fjord]]s, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep [[temperate rainforest]]s in the west; [[mountain range]]s in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Western United States]], after [[California]]. [[Mount Rainier]], an active [[stratovolcano]], is the state's highest elevation, at almost {{convert|14411|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and is the most [[topographically prominent]] mountain in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]]\n\nWashington is a leading lumber producer; its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. Washington is the nation's largest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. Washington ranks second only to California in wine production.\n\nManufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding, and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has more than a thousand dams, including the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage.\n\nWashington is one of the [[List of U.S. states by income|wealthiest]] and most socially progressive states in the country.{{dubious|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}} The state consistently ranks among the best for [[life expectancy]] and low [[unemployment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|title=America's best states to live in, ranked|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=November 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107001023/https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Along with [[Colorado]], Washington was one of the [[Cannabis in Washington (state)|first to legalize medicinal and recreational]] [[cannabis]], was among the first thirty-six states to legalize [[same-sex marriage]], doing so in 2012, and was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal [[abortion]]s [[Abortion in the United States#History|on request]] before the 1973 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Roe v.

Similarly, Washington voters approved a [[Washington Death with Dignity Act|2008 referendum]] on legalization of [[assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]], and is currently one of only five states, along with [[Oregon]], [[California]], [[Colorado]] and [[Vermont]], as well as [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]] to have legalized the practice.

A [[Mediterranean Climate]] predominates in western Washington, and a much drier [[semi-arid climate]] prevails east of the Cascade Range. Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] and [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high pressure [[anticyclone]] system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion. For Washington, this means [[prevailing winds]] from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably [[dry season]].\n\nIn the autumn and winter, a low-pressure [[cyclone]] system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean. The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably [[wet season]]. The term \"[[Pineapple Express]]\" is used colloquially to describe [[atmospheric river]] events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions into the Pacific Northwest.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kruckeberg | first = Arthur R. | title = The Natural History of Puget Sound Country | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1991 | pages = 42\u201343 | isbn = 978-0-295-97477-4}}</ref>\n\nDespite western Washington's having a marine climate similar to many coastal cities of Europe, there are exceptions such as the \"Big Snow\" events of 1880, 1881, 1893, and 1916, and the \"deep freeze\" winters of 1883\u20131884, 1915\u20131916, 1949\u20131950, and 1955\u20131956, among others.

During the El Ni\u00f1o phase, the jet stream enters the U.S. farther south through California, therefore late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snowpack. The La Ni\u00f1a phase reinforces the jet stream through the Pacific Northwest, causing Washington to have more rain and snow than average.\n\nIn 2006, the Climate Impacts Group at the [[University of Washington]] published ''The Impacts of Climate change in Washington's Economy'', a preliminary assessment on the risks and opportunities presented given the possibility of a rise in global temperatures and their effects on Washington state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/economic_impacts.htm |title=Climate Change\u2014Economic Impacts |publisher=Ecy.wa.gov |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730040420/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/economic_impacts.htm |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n====Rain shadow effects====\n\n{{main|Rain shadow}}\n\n[[File:Wa rain map.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Washington experiences extensive variation in rainfall.]]\n\nRainfall in Washington varies dramatically going from east to west. The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as {{convert|160|in}} of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a [[temperate rainforest]]. Weeks may pass without a clear day. The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than {{convert|200|in|disp=or|sp=us}} water equivalent) in the country. In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only {{convert|6|in}}. Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing [[orographic lift]] of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels. This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range. In both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures. While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations. [[Mount Baker]], near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world. In 1999, it set the world record for snowfall in a single season\u2014{{convert|1140|in|ft m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases99/aug99/noaa99056.html | title = Mt.

Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central [[Columbia Plateau]]\u2014especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the [[Okanagan Highland]].

He claimed the coastal lands up to [[Prince William Sound]] for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which they maintained made the Pacific a \"Spanish lake\" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire.\n\nIn 1778, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] explorer Captain [[James Cook]] sighted [[Cape Flattery]], at the entrance to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], but Cook did not realize the strait existed. It was not discovered until [[Charles William Barkley]], captain of the ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]'', sighted it in 1787. The straits were further explored by [[Spain|Spanish explorers]] [[Manuel Quimper]] in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791, and British explorer [[George Vancouver]] in 1792.\n\n===Settlement===\n\n{{Main|Oregon pioneer history}}\n\nThe British-Spanish [[Nootka Convention]] of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States. American captain [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]] (for whom [[Grays Harbor County, Washington|Grays Harbor County]] is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the [[Columbia Rediviva|''Columbia'']]. Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in [[sea otter]] pelts. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] entered the state on October 10, 1805.\n\nExplorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], on his voyage down the Columbia River, camped at the confluence with the Snake River on July 9, 1811, and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the [[North West Company]] to build a trading post at the site.\n[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Fur trading at [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]] in 1841]]\n\nBritain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as \"joint occupancy\" of lands west of the [[Continental Divide]] to the Pacific Ocean as part of the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, west to the Pacific, was deferred until a later time. Spain, in 1819, ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession.\n\nNegotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into [[Oregon Country]], [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the [[Columbia District]].\n\nFur trapper [[James Sinclair (fur trader)|James Sinclair]], on orders from [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]], Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, led some 200 settlers from the [[Red River Colony]] west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near [[Fort Vancouver]]. The party crossed the Rockies into the [[Columbia Valley]], near present-day [[Radium Hot Springs]], British Columbia, then traveled south-west down the [[Kootenai River]] and Columbia River. Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the [[Oregon Treaty]] on June 15, 1846.\n\nIn 1836, a group of missionaries, including [[Marcus Whitman]], established several missions and Whitman's own settlement Waiilatpu, in what is now southeastern Washington state, near present day [[Walla Walla County, Washington|Walla Walla County]], in territory of both the [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] and the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] Indian tribes. Whitman's settlement would in 1843 help the [[Oregon Trail]], the overland emigration route to the west, get established for thousands of emigrants in the following decades. Marcus provided medical care for the Native Americans, but when Indian patients\u2014lacking immunity to new, \"European\" diseases\u2014died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held \"medicine man\" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and murdered Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the [[Whitman massacre]] in 1847. This event triggered the [[Cayuse War]] between settlers and Indians.\n\n[[Fort Nisqually]], a farm and trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company and the first European settlement in the [[Puget Sound]] area, was founded in 1833. Black pioneer [[George Washington Bush]] and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from [[Missouri]] and [[Tennessee]], respectively, led four white families into the territory and founded New Market, now [[Tumwater, Washington|Tumwater]], in 1846. They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon's discriminatory settlement laws.<ref>{{cite web | title = Articles on George Washington Bush | publisher = City of Tumwater, WA | url = http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm | accessdate = June 15, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070714212032/http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm\n| archivedate = July 14, 2007 }}</ref> After them, many more settlers, migrating overland along the Oregon Trail, wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{Main|Oregon boundary dispute|Provisional Government of Oregon|Oregon Treaty|Oregon Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Washington Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Seattle - looking east on Yesler Way, 1887.jpg|thumb|Seattle in 1887]]\n\nThe growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory.

In eastern Washington, the [[Yakima River]] Valley became known for its apple orchards, while the growth of wheat using [[Dryland farming|dry farming]] techniques became particularly productive. Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests, and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the [[Douglas fir]]. Other industries that developed in the state included fishing, salmon canning and mining.\n\n===Industrial era===\n\n[[File:B-17Es at Boeing Plant, Seattle, Washington, 1943.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]] bombers under construction, circa{{nbsp}}1942]]\n\nFor a long period, [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] had large smelters where gold, silver, copper, and lead ores were treated. [[Seattle]] was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country, and for a time, it possessed a large shipbuilding industry. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and the [[Boeing]] company became an established icon in the area.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], a series of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] were constructed along the Columbia river as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], the largest concrete structure in the United States.\n\nDuring World War II, the state became a focus for war industries. While the Boeing Company produced many of the nation's [[heavy bomber]]s, ports in Seattle, [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships. Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific, a number of whom were quartered at [[Golden Gardens Park]]. In eastern Washington, the [[Hanford Site|Hanford Works]] [[Nuclear power|atomic energy]] plant was opened in 1943, and played a major role in the construction of the nation's [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bombs]].\n\n===Mount St. Helens eruption, 1980===\n\n{{Main|1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens}}\n\nOn May 18, 1980, following a period of heavy tremors and eruptions, the northeast face of [[Mount St. Helens]] [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|erupted violently]], destroying a large part of the top of the volcano.

The North Cascades Highway, [[Washington State Route 20|State Route 20]], closes every year due to snowfall and avalanches in the area of [[Washington Pass]]. The [[Cayuse Pass|Cayuse]] and [[Chinook Pass|Chinook]] Passes east of Mount Rainier also close in winter.\n\nWashington is crossed by a number of freight railroads, and Amtrak's passenger [[Amtrak Cascades|Cascade route]] between Eugene, Oregon and Vancouver, BC is the eighth busiest Amtrak service in the U.S. Seattle's [[King Street Station]], the busiest station in Washington, and 15th busiest in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|title=Amtrak|website=www.amtrak.com|access-date=January 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214015155/https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|archive-date=December 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> serves as the terminus for the two long distance Amtrak routes in Washington, the [[Empire Builder]] to Chicago and the [[Coast Starlight]] to Los Angeles.

A 2004 study of 40 mothers from Oregon, Washington, [[British Columbia]], and Montana found PBDEs in the breast milk of every woman tested.\n\nThree recent studies by the [[Washington State Department of Ecology]] showed toxic chemicals banned decades ago linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish from 45 sites. The toxic substances included [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]; [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], two chlorinated pesticides, [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] and [[dieldrin]], and PBDEs. As a result of the study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the [[Washington State Department of Health]] advises the public not to eat [[mountain whitefish]] from the [[Wenatchee River]] from [[Leavenworth, Washington|Leavenworth]] downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs.

Washington has voted for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee in every election since [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]].\n\nDue to Western Washington's large population, Democrats usually fare better statewide.

Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo. The scroll crest first appeared on the teams shorts for the start of the 1978\u201379 season.<ref name=\"Rangers Crest Badges\">{{cite web|url=http://www.danburymint.co.uk/index.php?act=product&product_id=4250&cat_id=&mediacode=&kiks_code=|title=The Badges of Rangers Football Club|publisher=Danbury Mint|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=The earliest badge featured the celebrated RFC scroll crest believed to have been used since 1872.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation. '1872\u20132012' appeared above the scroll crest with the words '140 years' featuring below.<ref name=\"Rangers Crest Gersnet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.therangersarchive.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=261&Itemid=326|title=The Rangers Crest|publisher=Gersnet Online|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=From 1990 to 1994 'Rangers Football Club' and the 'Ready' motto were placed above and below the Crest respectively.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.

Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.

Kinnaird's mother was [[Mary Jane Kinnaird]] and he was born in London.

This bank later merged with others in 1896 to become [[Barclays Bank]] of which he was a main board director until his death.\n\nIn 1875, he married Mary Alma Victoria Agnew (1854\u20131923), the daughter of [[Sir Andrew Agnew, 8th Baronet]], and Lady Mary Noel, and had seven children,<ref>{{cite web|title=Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird, 11th Baron Kinnaird|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p8023.htm#i80226|publisher=ThePeerage.com}}</ref> including:\n\n* Douglas Arthur Kinnaird, who was born on 20 August 1879 and served during the [[First World War]] as a Captain in the 1st Battalion of the [[Scots Guards]]; he died on 24 October 1914 and is buried at [[Ypres]] in [[Belgium]].\n* Kenneth Fitzgerald Kinnaird (1880\u20131972), who inherited his father's titles; he married Frances Clifton (1876\u20131960) and was the father of Graham Charles Kinnaird (1912\u20131997), 13th Lord Kinnaird, upon whose death the titles became dormant.\n* Arthur Middleton Kinnaird, who was born on 20 April 1885 and served as a Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of the Scots Guards; he died on  27 November 1917 and is buried at [[Ruyaulcourt]].\n* Patrick Kinnaird (1898\u20131948), who married, in 1912, Margaret Stella Wright (div.) and, in 1925, Violet Sandford.\n\n== Football career ==\n===Player===\nKinnaird first played football while at [[Cheam School]] and was captain of the school team in 1859, aged 12, for a match against [[Harrow School]]. He continued to play football at [[Eton College]], winning the House Cup in 1861 with Joynes's House, but was never selected for the school eleven. He first played association football early in 1866.\n\nAs a player, Kinnaird had a remarkable record in the [[FA Cup]]. He played in a record nine FA Cup finals. He was on the winning side three times with [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] and twice with the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]], and celebrated his fifth Cup Final victory by standing on his head in front of the pavilion. In the course of his career as a Cup Final player, Kinnaird played in every position, from goalkeeper to forward. It was while playing in goal for Wanderers in the [[1877 FA Cup Final|1877 final]] that he suffered the indignity of scoring the first significant [[own goal]] in football history, accidentally stepping backwards over his own goal line after fielding an innocuous long shot from an [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University]] forward.  The match finished 1\u20131 and Wanderers won with a second goal in extra time.  Some time after the match, for unknown reasons, the FA struck the Oxford goal from the records, changing the official score to 2\u20130 (although if Oxford had not scored, there would have been no reason for the game to go to extra time, so by rights they should have annulled Wanderers' second goal as well).<ref name=\"W47\">{{cite book |last= Warsop|first= Keith|title= The Early FA Cup Finals and the Southern Amateurs|year= 2004|publisher= SoccerData|isbn= 1-899468-78-1 |page=47}}</ref>  For the next century, all sources reported the score of the match as 2\u20130.<ref name=\"W47\" />  In the 1980s, after fresh research into contemporary reports of the game by football historians, the FA reinstated the Oxford goal, and now regard the official final score of the 1877 final as 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090616021730/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 June 2009|title=Cup Final Statistics|publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he was born in [[Kensington]], London, as a son of an old [[Perthshire]] family, Kinnaird also played for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].<ref name = rsssf/> He made his solitary appearance against [[England national football team|England]] in the second ever international match, played on 8 March 1873 at [[The Oval]].<ref name = rsssf>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot-intres1880.html |title=Scotland \u2013 International Matches 1872\u20131880 |website= |publisher=RSSSF |date=19 September 2019 |accessdate=21 March 2020 |first1=Alan |last1=Brown |first2=Gabriele |last2=Tossani}}</ref>\n\n====Playing style====\n[[File:Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird.jpg|thumb|130px|Caricature of Kinnaird published in 1912]]\nHe was renowned as perhaps the toughest tackler of his day, giving rise to the (probably apocryphal) story that his wife once expressed the fear that he would \"come home one day with a broken leg.\" A friend is said to have responded: \"You must not worry, madam. If he does, it will not be his own.\" Posterity has awarded Arthur Kinnaird the reputation of being fond of '[[Hacking (rugby)|hacking]]', i.e. deliberately kicking his opponents. This is not entirely fair: reports from his playing days do not criticise him, and he owes his notoriety to an oft-repeated anecdote which first appeared in an October 1892 issue of ''Pastime'' magazine, a weekly sporting journal that was edited by Nicholas Lane 'Pa' Jackson, founder of the [[Corinthian_F.C.|Corinthian Football Club]] and a committee member of the Football Association.\n\nJackson wrote: 'The keen rivalry which at one time existed between the Old Etonians and Old Harrovians lent an additional zest to the matches between them, and in one of these Lord Kinnaird's energy was expended as much on the shins of his opponents as on the ball. This at length caused a protest from the captain of the Harrovians, who asked, 'Are we going to play the game, or are we going to have hacking?'  'Oh, let us have hacking!' was the noble reply.' Jackson later reveals that the opposing captain was [[C. W. Alcock|Charles Alcock]], which pinpoints the likely origin of the anecdote to a game on 16 November 1872, described as 'a friendly, but most vicious game of football' by The Graphic newspaper. Alcock and [[Morton Peto Betts]] were sufficiently disabled to be unable to play for England in the first official international, two weeks later.\n\nSportswriters and fellow internationals queued to pay tribute to Kinnaird's skill as a footballer both during and after his career. He was, according to \"Tityrus\" (J.A.H. Catton), editor of the ''Athletic News'': \n\n<blockquote>\n\"of yeoman build and shaggy auburn beard, [and] did not quite look the part of a Scottish laird, until one spoke to him, and heard his rich, resonant voice and his short ejaculatory sentences. Of course, he had the voice and manner of an educated man of distinction.<br />\n<br />\n\"He was a leader, and above all things, a muscular type of Christian... As a player, in any position, [he] was an examplar of manly robust football. He popularised the game by his activity as a footballer among every class. He was at much at home with the boys of the Polytechnic, London, as he was with the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]].<br />\n<br />\n\"There was a time when the white ducks of Kinnaird, for he always wore trousers in a match, and his blue and white quartered cap were as familiar on the field as the giant figure of [[W.G. Grace]] with his yellow and red cricket cap... Lord Kinnaird used to say that he played four or five matches a week and never grew tired, but he added, late in life, that he would never have been allowed to stay on the field five minutes in these latter days. Nevertheless, he was fair, above board, and was prepared to receive all the knocks that came his way without a trace of resentment.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n===Administrator===\nAs an administrator, Kinnaird was an FA committeeman at the age of 21, in 1868. He became treasurer 9 years later and president 13 years after that, replacing [[Francis Marindin|Major Francis Marindin]] in 1890. He was to remain president for the next 33 years until his death in 1923, just months before the opening of [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\nHe was an all-round sportsman, twice winning a blue at tennis, in 1868 and 1869, while at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and was first in an international canoe race at the 1867 Paris Exhibition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/kinnaird-the-canoeist.html|title=Kinnaird the canoeist|website=Scottish Sport History \u2013 devoted to our sporting heritage}}</ref> He was [[Cambridge University]] swimming and [[fives]] champion, and won the [[Eton College]] 350 yards race in 1864.\n\n==Other interests==\nOutside of sport he was president of the [[YWCA]] and the [[YMCA]] in England,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RcfKAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA80&dq=11th%20lord%20arthur%20kinnaird%20%22ymca%22&pg=PA82#v=onepage|title=The Victorian Football Miscellany|date=2013-05-29|publisher=Superelastic|isbn=978-0-9562270-5-8|language=en}}</ref> a director of [[Barclays Bank]] and [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 1907, 1908 and 1909.

Some time after the match, for unknown reasons, the FA struck the Oxford goal from the records, changing the official score to 2\u20130 (although if Oxford had not scored, there would have been no reason for the game to go to extra time, so by rights they should have annulled Wanderers' second goal as well).<ref name=\"W47\">{{cite book |last= Warsop|first= Keith|title= The Early FA Cup Finals and the Southern Amateurs|year= 2004|publisher= SoccerData|isbn= 1-899468-78-1 |page=47}}</ref>  For the next century, all sources reported the score of the match as 2\u20130.<ref name=\"W47\" />  In the 1980s, after fresh research into contemporary reports of the game by football historians, the FA reinstated the Oxford goal, and now regard the official final score of the 1877 final as 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090616021730/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 June 2009|title=Cup Final Statistics|publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he was born in [[Kensington]], London, as a son of an old [[Perthshire]] family, Kinnaird also played for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].<ref name = rsssf/> He made his solitary appearance against [[England national football team|England]] in the second ever international match, played on 8 March 1873 at [[The Oval]].<ref name = rsssf>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot-intres1880.html |title=Scotland \u2013 International Matches 1872\u20131880 |website= |publisher=RSSSF |date=19 September 2019 |accessdate=21 March 2020 |first1=Alan |last1=Brown |first2=Gabriele |last2=Tossani}}</ref>\n\n====Playing style====\n[[File:Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird.jpg|thumb|130px|Caricature of Kinnaird published in 1912]]\nHe was renowned as perhaps the toughest tackler of his day, giving rise to the (probably apocryphal) story that his wife once expressed the fear that he would \"come home one day with a broken leg.\" A friend is said to have responded: \"You must not worry, madam. If he does, it will not be his own.\" Posterity has awarded Arthur Kinnaird the reputation of being fond of '[[Hacking (rugby)|hacking]]', i.e. deliberately kicking his opponents. This is not entirely fair: reports from his playing days do not criticise him, and he owes his notoriety to an oft-repeated anecdote which first appeared in an October 1892 issue of ''Pastime'' magazine, a weekly sporting journal that was edited by Nicholas Lane 'Pa' Jackson, founder of the [[Corinthian_F.C.|Corinthian Football Club]] and a committee member of the Football Association.\n\nJackson wrote: 'The keen rivalry which at one time existed between the Old Etonians and Old Harrovians lent an additional zest to the matches between them, and in one of these Lord Kinnaird's energy was expended as much on the shins of his opponents as on the ball. This at length caused a protest from the captain of the Harrovians, who asked, 'Are we going to play the game, or are we going to have hacking?'  'Oh, let us have hacking!' was the noble reply.' Jackson later reveals that the opposing captain was [[C. W. Alcock|Charles Alcock]], which pinpoints the likely origin of the anecdote to a game on 16 November 1872, described as 'a friendly, but most vicious game of football' by The Graphic newspaper. Alcock and [[Morton Peto Betts]] were sufficiently disabled to be unable to play for England in the first official international, two weeks later.\n\nSportswriters and fellow internationals queued to pay tribute to Kinnaird's skill as a footballer both during and after his career. He was, according to \"Tityrus\" (J.A.H. Catton), editor of the ''Athletic News'': \n\n<blockquote>\n\"of yeoman build and shaggy auburn beard, [and] did not quite look the part of a Scottish laird, until one spoke to him, and heard his rich, resonant voice and his short ejaculatory sentences. Of course, he had the voice and manner of an educated man of distinction.<br />\n<br />\n\"He was a leader, and above all things, a muscular type of Christian... As a player, in any position, [he] was an examplar of manly robust football. He popularised the game by his activity as a footballer among every class. He was at much at home with the boys of the Polytechnic, London, as he was with the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]].<br />\n<br />\n\"There was a time when the white ducks of Kinnaird, for he always wore trousers in a match, and his blue and white quartered cap were as familiar on the field as the giant figure of [[W.G. Grace]] with his yellow and red cricket cap... Lord Kinnaird used to say that he played four or five matches a week and never grew tired, but he added, late in life, that he would never have been allowed to stay on the field five minutes in these latter days. Nevertheless, he was fair, above board, and was prepared to receive all the knocks that came his way without a trace of resentment.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n===Administrator===\nAs an administrator, Kinnaird was an FA committeeman at the age of 21, in 1868. He became treasurer 9 years later and president 13 years after that, replacing [[Francis Marindin|Major Francis Marindin]] in 1890. He was to remain president for the next 33 years until his death in 1923, just months before the opening of [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\nHe was an all-round sportsman, twice winning a blue at tennis, in 1868 and 1869, while at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and was first in an international canoe race at the 1867 Paris Exhibition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/kinnaird-the-canoeist.html|title=Kinnaird the canoeist|website=Scottish Sport History \u2013 devoted to our sporting heritage}}</ref> He was [[Cambridge University]] swimming and [[fives]] champion, and won the [[Eton College]] 350 yards race in 1864.\n\n==Other interests==\nOutside of sport he was president of the [[YWCA]] and the [[YMCA]] in England,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RcfKAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA80&dq=11th%20lord%20arthur%20kinnaird%20%22ymca%22&pg=PA82#v=onepage|title=The Victorian Football Miscellany|date=2013-05-29|publisher=Superelastic|isbn=978-0-9562270-5-8|language=en}}</ref> a director of [[Barclays Bank]] and [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 1907, 1908 and 1909.

Sampling 50 suitable double rings would provide astronomers with a more accurate measurement of the dark matter content of the universe and the equation of state of the dark energy to within 10 percent precision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/04/full/ |title=Hubble Finds Double Einstein Ring |accessdate=2008-01-26 |work=Hubblesite.org |publisher=[[Space Telescope Science Institute]] }}</ref>\n\n=== A simulation ===\nTo the right is a simulation depicting a zoom on a [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild black hole]] in the plane of the [[Milky Way]] between us and the centre of the galaxy. The first Einstein ring is to the most distorted region of the picture and shows the [[Disc (galaxy)|galactic disc]]. The zoom then reveals a series of 4 extra rings, increasingly thinner and closer to the black hole shadow. They are multiple images of the galactic disk. The first and third correspond to points which are behind the black hole (from the observer's position) and correspond here to the bright yellow region of the galactic disc (close to the galactic center), whereas the second and fourth correspond to images of objects which are behind the observer, which appear bluer since the corresponding part of the galactic disc is thinner and hence dimmer here.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"120px\" >\nFile:Einstein Rings (Cropped).jpg|Some observed Einstein rings by SLACS\nFile:Cosmic cloning SDSSJ0146-0929.jpg|Graceful arcs around SDSSJ0146-0929 are examples of an Einstein ring\nFile:BlackHole Lensing.gif|A simulated view of a black hole passing in front of a galaxy\nFile:Montage of the SDP.81 Einstein Ring and the lensed galaxy.jpg|Montage of the SDP.81 Einstein Ring and the lensed galaxy\nFile:EnsteinRingZoomOptimised.gif|Einstein rings close to a black hole\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Einstein Rings}}\n* [[Einstein Cross]]\n* [[Einstein radius]]\n* [[SN Refsdal]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Journals ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal | first = R.
