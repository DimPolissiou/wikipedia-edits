Parker managed the company, which manufactured engines, Dorsey's patent reaper and mower, and sugar mill. In 1876 he brought in a partner to manufacture threshers, and the company became Belchamber and Parker. Although they dissolved the partnership two years later, Parker continued to grow his business, adding a blacksmith shop and machine shop.  In 1890, after a destructive fire at his first facility, Parker built the Phoenix Foundry. It was the largest between Cincinnati and [[Portsmouth, Ohio]].<ref name=Sprague/>\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n*The John P.

In the 1880s, Parker gave interviews to the journalist Frank Moody Gregg of the ''Chattanooga News'', who had been researching the resistance movement. He never published his manuscript, and the historian Stuart Seely Sprague found Gregg's manuscript and notes in [[Duke University]] archives.  He edited the memoir for publication, to keep Parker's language, and added a detailed biography in the preface.  \n* The [[John P.

The Chicago architectural firm of [[Holabird, Root & Burgee]] designed the new depot as well new [[Burlington station (Iowa)|depot]] in Burlington, Iowa in 1943. That depot was the standard used to design other CB&Q depots after the war with Ottumwa being one.<ref name=Naumann/> The new Ottumwa depot was completed in 1951 by Benson Construction Company using the [[limestone]] foundation of the old depot and its exterior walls. None of the old depot is visible today. During construction, the railroad used two passenger cars as ticket office and waiting room. Ballingall Park in front of the depot was completed at the same time. The present depot is a two-story structure designed in a simple [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] style. The rectangular building features a flat roof, broad [[eaves]] banded windows, and an exterior clad with [[ashlar]] Lannon stone.\n\n==Local transit connections==\nThe [[Ottumwa Transit Authority]] East-West Route stops near the station.

It was notable for the destruction of five German [[U-boat]]s (the true total was not known to the British until after the war). Two [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Focke-Wulf Condor]] long-range reconnaissance aircraft were shot down by [[F4F Wildcat#Martlet Mk1|Martlet]] fighters. The fighter cover was provided by the  escort carrier {{HMS|Audacity|D10|6}}, which was sunk during the voyage along with a destroyer and two merchant ships. Despite the loss of the escort carrier, it was regarded as the first big convoy victory for the Allies in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\n==Background==\nThe attack on HG 76 was the last in a series of U-boat pack attacks on Gibraltar convoys which had started in the summer of 1941.\n\nPrior to this the U-boat Arm had only enough boats operational to form a single patrol line at any one time, and their focus was on the North Atlantic convoy route. Gibraltar convoys had suffered only occasional adventitious attacks by individual U-boats that had chanced on meeting one while transitting their route.\nBy summer 1941 U-boat Command ([[BdU]]) had sufficient boats to form multiple patrol lines, but this coincided with Hitler\u2019s insistence that the UBW give support to the Axis forces operating in North Africa, by sending boats into the Mediterranean and by attacking the Gibraltar traffic. This phase of the campaign had commenced with a pack attack on [[Convoy OG 69|OG 69]].\n\nFor the Allies the introduction of stable escort groups had allowed the development of convoy protection tactics, giving a measure of success in countering the wolfpack threat. However it was recognized that air cover was needed, to counter shadowing aircraft and to seek out approaching U-boats, and for reinforcement to convoys under attack to provide sufficient ships to hunt U-boats to destruction rather than simply driving them off, as so often happened. The first requirement was met with the commissioning of HMS ''Audacity'', the first in a series of merchant aircraft carriers, and the second by reinforcing the escort, and by the formation of an ASW Strike Force at Gibraltar, which would sweep ahead of a homebound convoy, to attack and destroy patrolling U boats found. By the time came for HG 76 to sail, all these measures were in place.\n\n==Forces involved==\n\n===HMS ''Audacity''===\n\n{{main article|HMS Audacity (D10)|l1=HMS Audacity}}\n''Audacity'' participated in the escort of convoy OG 76 of twenty merchant ships, which sailed from Liverpool for Gibraltar on 31 October. The escort carrier embarked [[802 Naval Air Squadron]] (802 NAS) of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] with eight [[F4F Wildcat#Martlet Mk1|Martlets]] and ten pilots.{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|p=38}}{{efn|The fighters were usually split into standing patrols of two aircraft, which flew over the convoy for about two hours, searching for U-boats and Condors, the danger mainly coming from deck landings.{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|p=38}}}} The weather was atrocious and at times pitched the flight deck {{convert|65|ft|m|abbr=on}} and rolled it {{nowrap|16\u00b0, with}} spray sweeping over the deck. Two Martlets took off on patrol and one managed a safe landing but the other touched down when the stern was rising and was thrown overboard, the pilot being rescued just before the Martlet sank.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}}\n\nOn 8 November, [[Kampfgeschwader 40|''Kampfgeschwader'' 40]] (''KG'' 40) sent six [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Focke-Wulf Condor]] aircraft to locate convoy SL 91, from [[Freetown]] in [[Sierra Leone]] bound for Liverpool.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}} Near noon, the radar on ''Audacity'' detected two of the Condors and a Martlet patrol was sent to intercept. One Condor escaped in cloud but two Martlets caught the second, which shot down one Martlet before the other Martlet shot it down. About three hours later, another Condor was shot down by a head-on attack and a fourth Condor escaped. ''KG'' 40 had lost a third of its operational aircraft and failed to direct any U-boats onto either convoy, OG 76 making a safe arrival at Gibraltar late on 11 November. The presence of ''Audacity'' was now known to ''KG'' 40 and to U-boat Command ([[BdU]]).{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}}\n\n===HG 76===\n\n[[File:HMS Audacity (D10).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|{{center|HMS ''Audacity'', after conversion to an [[escort carrier]]}}]]\nHG 76 comprised 32 ships homeward bound from [[Gibraltar]], many in ballast or carrying trade goods. The [[Convoy Commodore]] was Vice-Admiral R. Fitzmaurice in the steamship ''Spero''. The convoy had a strong escort, consisting of [[36th Escort Group (Royal Navy)|36th Escort Group]] ([[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]] [[Frederic John Walker|F. J. \"Johnnie\" Walker]]), usually composed of two {{sclass-|Bittern|sloop|0}} sloops ({{HMS|Stork|L81|6}} and {{HMS|Deptford|U53|2}}) and seven [[corvette]]s (''Convolvulus'', ''Gardenia'', ''Marigold'', ''Pentstemon'', ''Rhodedendron'', ''Samphire'' and ''Vetch'').{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=396}} Walker, a skilled anti-submarine warfare expert, had taken command of EG 36 in October and  brought the group down to Gibraltar in November with OG 76. He had exercised the group there in anti-submarine patrols that had resulted in the destruction of ''U-433'' by ''Marigold''.{{sfn|Wemyss|2003|pp=19\u201321}} This force was augmented by the new [[escort carrier]] {{HMS|Audacity||2}} and her three escorting [[destroyer]]s, {{HMS|Blankney|L30|2}}, {{HMS|Stanley|I73|2}} and {{HMS|Exmoor|L08|2}}, plus the sloops {{HMS|Fowey|L15|2}}, {{HMS|Black Swan|L57|2}} and the corvettes ''Carnation'' and ''La Malouine'', also at Gibraltar.

U-boat commanders were ordered to signal whenever they found a convoy and shadow it rather than attack. The commander was to send short homing signals every thirty minutes, to guide other U-boats to the convoy. When the pack had assembled, D\u00f6nitz gave the order to attack, usually at night, so that the U-boats could fire their torpedoes on the surface. For the tactic to work, U-boats had to signal their positions to D\u00f6nitz at Kerneval (across the river from [[Keroman Submarine Base]] at [[Lorient]] in [[Brittany]]).{{sfn|Sebag|2001|pp=106\u2013108}}{{efn|If the British could break into [[Enigma machine|naval Enigma]], the position reports would be read.{{sfn|Sebag|2001|p=108}}}} Closer to land, when Condors on {{lang|de|F\u00fchlungshalter}} patrol sighted a convoy, the wireless operator reported its position and course to the BdU and relays of Condors remained over the convoy.{{sfn|Air|2001|p=107}} When the position of a convoy was established, the information was passed to the senior officer of a group of U-boats organised for pack attacks, who ordered the boat nearest to the convoy to shadow it and guide the rest by wireless. When the pack had rendezvoused near the convoy, surface attacks would be made on successive nights, the U-boats withdrawing during the day.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=354\u2013355}}\n\nIn mid December U boat Command was informed that a convoy was assembling at Gibraltar. German agents stationed in the Spanish city of [[Algeciras]], in neutral Spain, were able to overlook the harbour and report any and all activity there, without hindrance from the Axis-friendly Spanish authorities.\nBdU began to assemble a patrol line, code-named ''Seerauber'' (\"Pirate\"), preparatory to launching a pack attack.  Seerauber was an ''ad hoc'' group, as the previous patrol group, code-named ''Steuben'', had disbanded following a fruitless pursuit of\u00a0south-bound OS 12.\n''Seerauber'', comprised seven U-boats: One (''[[German submarine U-67 (1940)|U-67]]'') already in position after a failed attack on OG 77; two from Group ''Steuben'', (''[[German submarine U-434|U-434]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-574|U-574]]'') that had refueled from a clandestine depot ship in [[Vigo]] harbour: two boats (''[[German submarine U-127 (1941)|U-127]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-131 (1941)|U-131]]'') newly arrived from Germany, and two boats (''[[German submarine U-107 (1940)|U-107]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-108 (1940)|U-108]]'') out from bases in France. The group was less than ideal: Five of the seven were Type IX boats, which D\u00f6nitz considered unsuitable for wolfpack attacks, and five of the seven were inexperienced, being on their first patrols <ref>Blair p409</ref>\nThe pack had orders to sink ''Audacity'' at all costs; the pack was reinforced later by three more boats. ''U-108'' sank a Portuguese freighter sailing independently on 14 December.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=396}}{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=108}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===14\u201315 December===\n[[File:Portugal topographic map-pt.png|thumb|{{centre|Topographic map showing Cape St Vincent ({{lang|pt|Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente}}) at the south-west extremity}}]]\nHG 76 sailed from Gibraltar on 14 December 1941, in company with a small convoy bound for Cape Town, and was reported almost immediately by German agents across the bay in neutral [[Spain]], who reported the composition, escort strength and departure time of the convoy; BdU was confused by an agent report that the convoy had returned to port.

It was notable for the destruction of five German [[U-boat]]s (the true total was not known to the British until after the war). Two [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Focke-Wulf Condor]] long-range reconnaissance aircraft were shot down by [[F4F Wildcat#Martlet Mk1|Martlet]] fighters. The fighter cover was provided by the  escort carrier {{HMS|Audacity|D10|6}}, which was sunk during the voyage along with a destroyer and two merchant ships. Despite the loss of the escort carrier, it was regarded as the first big convoy victory for the Allies in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\n==Background==\nThe attack on HG 76 was the last in a series of U-boat pack attacks on Gibraltar convoys which had started in the summer of 1941.\n\nPrior to this the U-boat Arm had only enough boats operational to form a single patrol line at any one time, and their focus was on the North Atlantic convoy route. Gibraltar convoys had suffered only occasional adventitious attacks by individual U-boats that had chanced on meeting one while transitting their route.\nBy summer 1941 U-boat Command ([[BdU]]) had sufficient boats to form multiple patrol lines, but this coincided with Hitler\u2019s insistence that the UBW give support to the Axis forces operating in North Africa, by sending boats into the Mediterranean and by attacking the Gibraltar traffic. This phase of the campaign had commenced with a pack attack on [[Convoy OG 69|OG 69]].\n\nFor the Allies the introduction of stable escort groups had allowed the development of convoy protection tactics, giving a measure of success in countering the wolfpack threat. However it was recognized that air cover was needed, to counter shadowing aircraft and to seek out approaching U-boats, and for reinforcement to convoys under attack to provide sufficient ships to hunt U-boats to destruction rather than simply driving them off, as so often happened. The first requirement was met with the commissioning of HMS ''Audacity'', the first in a series of merchant aircraft carriers, and the second by reinforcing the escort, and by the formation of an ASW Strike Force at Gibraltar, which would sweep ahead of a homebound convoy, to attack and destroy patrolling U boats found. By the time came for HG 76 to sail, all these measures were in place.\n\n==Forces involved==\n\n===HMS ''Audacity''===\n\n{{main article|HMS Audacity (D10)|l1=HMS Audacity}}\n''Audacity'' participated in the escort of convoy OG 76 of twenty merchant ships, which sailed from Liverpool for Gibraltar on 31 October. The escort carrier embarked [[802 Naval Air Squadron]] (802 NAS) of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] with eight [[F4F Wildcat#Martlet Mk1|Martlets]] and ten pilots.{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|p=38}}{{efn|The fighters were usually split into standing patrols of two aircraft, which flew over the convoy for about two hours, searching for U-boats and Condors, the danger mainly coming from deck landings.{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|p=38}}}} The weather was atrocious and at times pitched the flight deck {{convert|65|ft|m|abbr=on}} and rolled it {{nowrap|16\u00b0, with}} spray sweeping over the deck. Two Martlets took off on patrol and one managed a safe landing but the other touched down when the stern was rising and was thrown overboard, the pilot being rescued just before the Martlet sank.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}}\n\nOn 8 November, [[Kampfgeschwader 40|''Kampfgeschwader'' 40]] (''KG'' 40) sent six [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor|Focke-Wulf Condor]] aircraft to locate convoy SL 91, from [[Freetown]] in [[Sierra Leone]] bound for Liverpool.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}} Near noon, the radar on ''Audacity'' detected two of the Condors and a Martlet patrol was sent to intercept. One Condor escaped in cloud but two Martlets caught the second, which shot down one Martlet before the other Martlet shot it down. About three hours later, another Condor was shot down by a head-on attack and a fourth Condor escaped. ''KG'' 40 had lost a third of its operational aircraft and failed to direct any U-boats onto either convoy, OG 76 making a safe arrival at Gibraltar late on 11 November. The presence of ''Audacity'' was now known to ''KG'' 40 and to U-boat Command ([[BdU]]).{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=395\u2013396}}\n\n===HG 76===\n\n[[File:HMS Audacity (D10).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|{{center|HMS ''Audacity'', after conversion to an [[escort carrier]]}}]]\nHG 76 comprised 32 ships homeward bound from [[Gibraltar]], many in ballast or carrying trade goods. The [[Convoy Commodore]] was Vice-Admiral R. Fitzmaurice in the steamship ''Spero''. The convoy had a strong escort, consisting of [[36th Escort Group (Royal Navy)|36th Escort Group]] ([[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]] [[Frederic John Walker|F. J. \"Johnnie\" Walker]]), usually composed of two {{sclass-|Bittern|sloop|0}} sloops ({{HMS|Stork|L81|6}} and {{HMS|Deptford|U53|2}}) and seven [[corvette]]s (''Convolvulus'', ''Gardenia'', ''Marigold'', ''Pentstemon'', ''Rhodedendron'', ''Samphire'' and ''Vetch'').{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=396}} Walker, a skilled anti-submarine warfare expert, had taken command of EG 36 in October and  brought the group down to Gibraltar in November with OG 76. He had exercised the group there in anti-submarine patrols that had resulted in the destruction of ''U-433'' by ''Marigold''.{{sfn|Wemyss|2003|pp=19\u201321}} This force was augmented by the new [[escort carrier]] {{HMS|Audacity||2}} and her three escorting [[destroyer]]s, {{HMS|Blankney|L30|2}}, {{HMS|Stanley|I73|2}} and {{HMS|Exmoor|L08|2}}, plus the sloops {{HMS|Fowey|L15|2}}, {{HMS|Black Swan|L57|2}} and the corvettes ''Carnation'' and ''La Malouine'', also at Gibraltar. This made a total escort of 17 warships.{{sfn|Kaplan|2014|p=120}} A group of destroyers from Force H in Gibraltar, comprising {{HMS|Croome|L62|6}}, {{HMS|Gurkha|G63|2}}, {{HMS|Foxhound|H69|2}} and {{HMAS|Nestor|G02|2}} sailed as an independent U-boat hunting force.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=108}}\n\n===''Seer\u00e4uber''===\n{{main article|Wolfpack (naval tactic)|l1=''Rudeltaktik'' (Wolfpack)}}\n\nSince August 1940, D\u00f6nitz had ended the practice of U-boats freelancing and sending only one report per day. U-boat commanders were ordered to signal whenever they found a convoy and shadow it rather than attack. The commander was to send short homing signals every thirty minutes, to guide other U-boats to the convoy. When the pack had assembled, D\u00f6nitz gave the order to attack, usually at night, so that the U-boats could fire their torpedoes on the surface. For the tactic to work, U-boats had to signal their positions to D\u00f6nitz at Kerneval (across the river from [[Keroman Submarine Base]] at [[Lorient]] in [[Brittany]]).{{sfn|Sebag|2001|pp=106\u2013108}}{{efn|If the British could break into [[Enigma machine|naval Enigma]], the position reports would be read.{{sfn|Sebag|2001|p=108}}}} Closer to land, when Condors on {{lang|de|F\u00fchlungshalter}} patrol sighted a convoy, the wireless operator reported its position and course to the BdU and relays of Condors remained over the convoy.{{sfn|Air|2001|p=107}} When the position of a convoy was established, the information was passed to the senior officer of a group of U-boats organised for pack attacks, who ordered the boat nearest to the convoy to shadow it and guide the rest by wireless. When the pack had rendezvoused near the convoy, surface attacks would be made on successive nights, the U-boats withdrawing during the day.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=354\u2013355}}\n\nIn mid December U boat Command was informed that a convoy was assembling at Gibraltar. German agents stationed in the Spanish city of [[Algeciras]], in neutral Spain, were able to overlook the harbour and report any and all activity there, without hindrance from the Axis-friendly Spanish authorities.\nBdU began to assemble a patrol line, code-named ''Seerauber'' (\"Pirate\"), preparatory to launching a pack attack.  Seerauber was an ''ad hoc'' group, as the previous patrol group, code-named ''Steuben'', had disbanded following a fruitless pursuit of\u00a0south-bound OS 12.\n''Seerauber'', comprised seven U-boats: One (''[[German submarine U-67 (1940)|U-67]]'') already in position after a failed attack on OG 77; two from Group ''Steuben'', (''[[German submarine U-434|U-434]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-574|U-574]]'') that had refueled from a clandestine depot ship in [[Vigo]] harbour: two boats (''[[German submarine U-127 (1941)|U-127]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-131 (1941)|U-131]]'') newly arrived from Germany, and two boats (''[[German submarine U-107 (1940)|U-107]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-108 (1940)|U-108]]'') out from bases in France. The group was less than ideal: Five of the seven were Type IX boats, which D\u00f6nitz considered unsuitable for wolfpack attacks, and five of the seven were inexperienced, being on their first patrols <ref>Blair p409</ref>\nThe pack had orders to sink ''Audacity'' at all costs; the pack was reinforced later by three more boats. ''U-108'' sank a Portuguese freighter sailing independently on 14 December.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=396}}{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=108}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===14\u201315 December===\n[[File:Portugal topographic map-pt.png|thumb|{{centre|Topographic map showing Cape St Vincent ({{lang|pt|Cabo de S\u00e3o Vicente}}) at the south-west extremity}}]]\nHG 76 sailed from Gibraltar on 14 December 1941, in company with a small convoy bound for Cape Town, and was reported almost immediately by German agents across the bay in neutral [[Spain]], who reported the composition, escort strength and departure time of the convoy; BdU was confused by an agent report that the convoy had returned to port. The first sightings of HG 76 were made by [[German submarine U-74 (1940)|''U-74'']] and [[German submarine U-77 (1940)|''U-77'']], both ''en route'' to the Mediterranean and about to transit the Straits.{{sfnBlair|2000|p=410}} ''U-77'' sank one ship from the Cape Town convoy, but ''U-74'' was unable to attack HG 76; [[Fairey Swordfish]] aircraft of [[RAF Gibraltar|RAF Gibraltar Command]] were escorting the convoy and on three occasions during the night of {{nowrap|14/15 December,}} drove off the U-boats.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=725}}{{sfn|Richards|1974|p=351}} The ''Seerauber'' boats formed a patrol line south of [[Cape St Vincent]] but HG 76 passed through the line without detection.

During the night of {{nowrap|16/17 December,}} the wolf pack closed in and ''[[German submarine U-574|U-574]]'' was ordered to the area; by morning on 17 December, the convoy had passed beyond the range of Gibraltar-based aircraft and four U-boats made contact, U-67 and U-108 being forced away from the convoy.

It was so dark that the aircraft were guided to the flight deck with hand torches and again the night was quiet.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=398}} U-107 maintained contact and the wolf pack was joined by ''[[German submarine U-71 (1940)|U-71]]'', ''[[German submarine U-567|U-567]]'' (commanded by leading ace [[Engelbert Endrass]]), and ''[[German submarine U-751|U-751]]'' from Bordeaux and the three original wolf pack boats ''U-67'', ''U-107'' and ''U-108'' re-joined {{lang|de|Seer\u00e4uber}} by 21 December.{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=108}} On 21 December 802 NAS could only keep three Martlets operational, take-off and landing was dangerous in the heavy swell and the pilots were very tired. After the last patrol, the commander of ''Audacity'' ordered the ship out of the convoy {{convert|10|nmi|mi+km|0|abbr=on}} to the starboard as usual but no escorts could be spared.{{sfn|Kaplan|2014|p=133}} At {{nowrap|8:33 p.m.}} during the night of 12/22 December, a ship at the rear of the convoy was torpedoed by U-571 and nearby ships fired snowflakes, illuminating the area to both sides.  ''U-567'' saw the silhouette of ''Audacity'' at close range and at {{nowrap|8:37 p.m.}} torpedoed ''Audacity'', which began to sink at the stern. Two more torpedoes from ''U-571'' hit the carrier, a big explosion blew off the front end and the ship began to sink at the head.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|pp=398\u2013399}} ''Audacity'' sank head first at {{nowrap|10:10 p.m.,}} {{convert|500|nmi|mi+km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Cape Finisterre]].{{sfn|Roskill|1957|p=479}}\n\n===22\u201323 December===\n{{location map|North Atlantic| label=''Audacity'' |position=left\n|marksize=6\n|width=150\n|long=-19.54\n|lat=43.75\n|caption= {{centre|Position of the ''Audacity'' when sunk}}\n}}\nAt {{nowrap|12:40 a.m.}} on the night of {{nowrap|21/22 December,}} ''U-567'' was sunk by depth charges from ''Deptford'', two hours after gaining an Asdic contact; ''Deptford'' then collided with ''Stork'', damaging them both.

At {{nowrap|10:54 a.m.}} a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated Liberator]] of [[No. 120 Squadron RAF|120 Squadron]], 19 Group [[Coastal Command]] based at [[RAF Nutts Corner]] in Ireland {{convert|750|nmi|mi+km|0|abbr=on}} away, arrived over the convoy and saw off a Focke-Wulf Condor. After two hours the Liberator attacked a U-boat and at {{nowrap|4:20 p.m.}} was relieved by a second Liberator, which forced another three U-boats to submerge. The Liberator turned for home with minimal fuel but next day the convoy came into range of continuous air support.{{sfn|Richards|1974|p=351}} On 23 December, D\u00f6nitz, shaken by the loss of five U-boats and the lack of success against the convoy, called off the attack and ''U-67'', ''U-107'', ''U-108'' and ''U-751'' returned to bases in France.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=399}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nDespite the loss of ''Audacity'' and the three other ships, the safe arrival of 30 ships and the destruction of three U-boats (''U-127'' was not included, and ''U-567'' not confirmed until after the war) was judged to be an outstanding victory.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|p=479}} It also confirmed Walker as the Royal Navy\u2019s foremost expert in anti-submarine warfare. The loss of five of the nine U-boats and [[Engelbert Endrass|Endrass]], one of the most experienced U-boat commanders, was considered a grievous blow by

{"title_page": "Ross Errilly Friary", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=November 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n[[Image:RossErrillyFriary.jpg|300px|thumb|Right|The ruins of the Ross Errilly Friary.]]\n\nThe '''Ross Errilly Friary''' ({{lang-ga|Mainistir Ros Oirialaigh}}, often [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] in 18th & 19th century sources as ''Rosserelly'') is a [[medieval]] [[Franciscan]] [[friary]] located about a mile to the northwest of [[Headford]], [[County Galway]], Ireland. It is a [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monument]] of Ireland and among the best-preserved medieval monastic sites in the country.  Though usually referred to by locals as \"Ross Abbey,\" this is not technically correct as the community never had an [[abbot]].<ref>Mooney 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nThe church and bell tower are to the south of a small but well preserved central [[cloister]] and domestic buildings are to the north.   Amongst these are a kitchen (equipped with an oven and a water tank for live fish), a bake house, and a refectory or dining area.  The dormitories are on the upper levels.  One unusual feature is a second courtyard or cloister, built to accommodate the friary's growing population.\n\nLike many other abandoned Christian sites in Ireland, Ross Errilly has continued to be used as a burial ground by area residents.  In addition to tombs that date from the friary's active period, many graves dating from the 18th through 20th centuries can be found inside the church walls.  In some cases, tombstones comprise the floors of walkways and crawlspaces.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Foundation ===\nBoth [[Luke Wadding]] and the [[Annals of the Four Masters|Four Masters]] (who refer to Ross Errilly in their Annals as ''Ros-Oirbhealagh'') record that the abbey was founded in 1351, but this date has been called into question by numerous historians.  Architectural cues and documentary evidence have given rise to a modern consensus that the friary was founded sometime in the middle of the 15th century, perhaps around 1460.<ref>Mooney 12.</ref> The earliest existing documentary evidence however comes from a reference to the friary in the will of Galway man John Blake, son of Henry, who bequeathed the sum of 40 pence to the friary in 1469. But on the other hand some facts in support of the legend on the founding of the friary in 1351 cannot be overlooked. Firstly, history tells us that there was a plague \u2013 the \"Black Death\" rampant in the country in 1348 and succeeding years. Secondly, Archbishop MacHugh, who is credited with the foundation of the friary, was the metropolitan in Tuam. He was a Franciscan and a native of the Headford area and he died of the plague in 1349, and it could have taken three years to build the first part of the friary owing to the prevalence of the plague and the marshy condition of the soil.<ref group=note>\"The Friary of Ross\" a History and a Guide.</ref> In any case, it is clear from the architectural evidence that any religious building that may have been on the site prior to that time was greatly expanded during the 15th century. Around 1473, a delegation of Franciscans from Ross Errilly went to Donegal at the request of the [[Tyrconnell]] clan and founded the Donegal Friary, where the Four Masters would later write their famous Annals.\n\n=== After the English Reformation ===\n\nLife at Ross Errilly was disrupted by the [[English Reformation]].  The Franciscans had loudly opposed [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII's]] break with Rome, which would prove costly after the schism.  In 1538, English authorities imprisoned two hundred of the monks and banished or killed an indeterminate number of others.  The rest of the Franciscans' history at Ross Errilly would be marked by repeated evictions and other persecutions.\n\n[[Image:Refriary fish.jpg|300px|thumb|Right|This tank was used to hold live fish caught from the nearby [[Black River (Ireland)|Black River]].]]\n\nAt the beginning of the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], the abbey was confiscated and given to Richard Burgh, the 2nd [[Earl of Clanrickarde]].  Burgh, a descendant of the de Burghs who had helped found the abbey, quietly gave it back to the Franciscans.  In 1572, an enclosing ditch and wall were constructed around the friary.<ref>Stalley 9.</ref>\n\nIn 1584, the English crown again confiscated the monastery from the Franciscans and gave it to an English noble who evicted the monks and plundered the building's contents.  In 1586, the Earl of Clanrickarde purchased the monastery and again returned it to the Franciscans.\n\nBy the end of the century, however, the crown had once again expelled the monks and converted the monastery into an English garrison for use during the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]].\n\nIn 1604, Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanrickarde, continuing to honour the de Burgh tradition of supporting Ross Errilly, financed the rehabilitation and reoccupation of the monastery by the Franciscans.  Their stay was short-lived; in 1612 Lord Arthur Chichester, [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Deputy of Ireland]], ordered the [[Protestant archbishop of Tuam]], William Daniel, to expel the monks and to demolish the abbey's altars.

The refugees were being led from the town of [[Shrule]] when the Catholic soldiers comprising their escort massacred them.  It's not reliably known how many were killed, but one estimate placed the number of victims at 65.  Burke and the monks brought the survivors back to the Headford area and obtained shelter for them among the townspeople until safe passage to England could be arranged.\n\nThe [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Irish campaigns]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] brought an end to this era of English tolerance of the Catholic Church in Ireland.  For a few nervous years, Ross Errilly served as an informal refugee shelter for Catholic clergy who had been flushed out of other parts of Ireland by Cromwell's forces.\n\nOn 10 August 1656, Cromwellian forces finally made their way to Ross Errilly.  The 140 Franciscans living there had fled a few hours earlier, but the soldiers ransacked the grounds, destroying crosses and other religious iconography and even defiling tombs in search of loot.  Legend maintains that the fleeing monks somehow found the time to remove the bell from the bell tower and sink it in the nearby Black River, where it remains today.  The [[English Restoration]] in 1660 brought [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to the throne. His nominally tolerant policies towards Catholics allowed the reoccupation and repair of the abbey in 1664.\n\n=== Final years ===\n\nThe [[Glorious Revolution of 1688]], which deposed Charles' younger brother, the Catholic [[James II of England|James II]], eventually led to the [[Popery Act 1698|Popery Act of 1698]], which placed a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on Catholic clergy.  Once again, the Franciscans of Ross Errilly became fugitives and abandoned the premises.\n\nLocal records indicate that by 1712, Franciscans had returned to the abbey.  Some sources indicate that the abbey was abandoned again in 1731, for reasons which are unclear.  What's certain is that by 1753, they had returned to the site.  The property was now owned by Lord St. George, a local noble, who picked up where the Clanrickardes had left off and secretly patronised the abbey.  By this time, the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] were in effect and St. George risked life imprisonment by supporting the monks. A vengeful family who had lost a [[lawsuit]] to St. George reported to the authorities that he was sheltering Catholic religious at the monastery.  St. George learned of the accusations and the monks evacuated the monastery for the last time.  Before authorities arrived at the abbey, St. George had the abbey's interior whitewashed and had employed a group of [[weaving|weavers]] and their [[loom]]s inside the building.  The inquiry was ended without further incident, but the sham factory was soon closed and the monks never returned again.\n\nThe monks built cabins of wood and stone on a small island in the Black River, about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) downstream from the abbey.  The island (which no longer exists) was known informally as \"Friars Island,\" and the community supported the monks with food, fuel and clothing via a wooden drawbridge.  For 36 years, the monks continued to celebrate Sunday [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the deteriorating abbey building.  In 1789, a Henry Lynch of [[Ballycurrin]] cheaply leased {{convert|16|acre|m2}} to the dispossessed monks at the foot of a hill in the [[townland]] of Kilroe, near Headford.

It is a [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monument]] of Ireland and among the best-preserved medieval monastic sites in the country.  Though usually referred to by locals as \"Ross Abbey,\" this is not technically correct as the community never had an [[abbot]].<ref>Mooney 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nThe church and bell tower are to the south of a small but well preserved central [[cloister]] and domestic buildings are to the north.   Amongst these are a kitchen (equipped with an oven and a water tank for live fish), a bake house, and a refectory or dining area.  The dormitories are on the upper levels.  One unusual feature is a second courtyard or cloister, built to accommodate the friary's growing population.\n\nLike many other abandoned Christian sites in Ireland, Ross Errilly has continued to be used as a burial ground by area residents.  In addition to tombs that date from the friary's active period, many graves dating from the 18th through 20th centuries can be found inside the church walls.  In some cases, tombstones comprise the floors of walkways and crawlspaces.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Foundation ===\nBoth [[Luke Wadding]] and the [[Annals of the Four Masters|Four Masters]] (who refer to Ross Errilly in their Annals as ''Ros-Oirbhealagh'') record that the abbey was founded in 1351, but this date has been called into question by numerous historians.  Architectural cues and documentary evidence have given rise to a modern consensus that the friary was founded sometime in the middle of the 15th century, perhaps around 1460.<ref>Mooney 12.</ref> The earliest existing documentary evidence however comes from a reference to the friary in the will of Galway man John Blake, son of Henry, who bequeathed the sum of 40 pence to the friary in 1469. But on the other hand some facts in support of the legend on the founding of the friary in 1351 cannot be overlooked. Firstly, history tells us that there was a plague \u2013 the \"Black Death\" rampant in the country in 1348 and succeeding years. Secondly, Archbishop MacHugh, who is credited with the foundation of the friary, was the metropolitan in Tuam. He was a Franciscan and a native of the Headford area and he died of the plague in 1349, and it could have taken three years to build the first part of the friary owing to the prevalence of the plague and the marshy condition of the soil.<ref group=note>\"The Friary of Ross\" a History and a Guide.</ref> In any case, it is clear from the architectural evidence that any religious building that may have been on the site prior to that time was greatly expanded during the 15th century. Around 1473, a delegation of Franciscans from Ross Errilly went to Donegal at the request of the [[Tyrconnell]] clan and founded the Donegal Friary, where the Four Masters would later write their famous Annals.\n\n=== After the English Reformation ===\n\nLife at Ross Errilly was disrupted by the [[English Reformation]].  The Franciscans had loudly opposed [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII's]] break with Rome, which would prove costly after the schism.  In 1538, English authorities imprisoned two hundred of the monks and banished or killed an indeterminate number of others.  The rest of the Franciscans' history at Ross Errilly would be marked by repeated evictions and other persecutions.\n\n[[Image:Refriary fish.jpg|300px|thumb|Right|This tank was used to hold live fish caught from the nearby [[Black River (Ireland)|Black River]].]]\n\nAt the beginning of the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], the abbey was confiscated and given to Richard Burgh, the 2nd [[Earl of Clanrickarde]].  Burgh, a descendant of the de Burghs who had helped found the abbey, quietly gave it back to the Franciscans.  In 1572, an enclosing ditch and wall were constructed around the friary.<ref>Stalley 9.</ref>\n\nIn 1584, the English crown again confiscated the monastery from the Franciscans and gave it to an English noble who evicted the monks and plundered the building's contents.  In 1586, the Earl of Clanrickarde purchased the monastery and again returned it to the Franciscans.\n\nBy the end of the century, however, the crown had once again expelled the monks and converted the monastery into an English garrison for use during the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]].\n\nIn 1604, Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanrickarde, continuing to honour the de Burgh tradition of supporting Ross Errilly, financed the rehabilitation and reoccupation of the monastery by the Franciscans.  Their stay was short-lived; in 1612 Lord Arthur Chichester, [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Deputy of Ireland]], ordered the [[Protestant archbishop of Tuam]], William Daniel, to expel the monks and to demolish the abbey's altars.  Daniel apparently complied with the order, but sent advance word to the residents of Ross Errilly and advised them to evacuate the abbey's most precious items.\n\nIn 1626, the monks returned to Ross Errilly and enjoyed a quarter-century of relative peace.  Records of the [[Franciscan|OFM]] in Ireland indicate that the community at this time consisted of just six priests and two brothers.  One piece of evidence for the friary's occupancy during this period is a handwritten [[testimony|testimonium]], dated 27 November 1636, and signed by a Boetius Mac Egan, then a [[prelate]] in residence at the friary.<ref>{{cite book | last = O'Donovan | first = John (trans.) | authorlink = John O'Donovan (scholar)|editor=[[James Henthorn Todd|Todd, James H.]] |editor2=[[William Reeves (bishop)|Reeves, William]] |title=The Martyrology of Donegal: A Calendar of the Saints of Ireland | url = https://archive.org/details/TheMartyrologyOfDonegal |year=1864 |publisher=Irish Archaeological and Celtic Society |location=Dublin |language=English, Latin | nopp = true |page=liii }}</ref>\n\n=== Rebellion and the Cromwellian era ===\n\nOn 18 February 1642, Ulick Burke and the monks were involved in the rescue of about 40 Protestant refugees of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|1641 uprising]], including the family of Dr. John Maxwell, the Protestant bishop of [[Killala]].

It possessed [[Slovak Army|a small army]] of its own, largely made up of parts inherited from the old [[Czechoslovak Army]]. As a result of German pressure, the 1st Slovak Infantry Division took part in the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939. In the aftermath of the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]], the German government consolidated its control of the Slovak regime.{{Sfn|Rychl\u00edk|2018|pp=121-2}} On 21 June 1941, the Slovak government was informed that it was expected to provide a contingent to participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. It accepted the following day, being the first day of the German offensive.{{Sfn|Rychl\u00edk|2018|p=122}} The Slovak Army was called up, as the regime sought to demonstrate its indispensability to Nazi Germany and its greater loyalty than [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]].\n\n==History ==\nThe Slovak Expeditionary Army Group of about 45,000 men entered the Soviet Union shortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack]]. This army lacked logistic and transportation support, so a much smaller unit, the Slovak Mobile Command (Pilfousek Brigade), was formed from units selected from this force; the rest of the Slovak army was relegated to rear-area security duty. The Slovak Mobile Command was attached to the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 17th Army]] (as was the Hungarian [[Gyorshadtest|Carpathian Group]] also) and shortly thereafter given over to direct German command, the Slovaks lacking the command infrastructure to exercise effective operational control. This unit fought with the 17th Army through July 1941, including at the [[Battle of Uman]].\n\nAt the beginning of August 1941, the Slovak Mobile Command was dissolved and instead two infantry divisions were formed from the Slovak Expeditionary Army Group. The Slovak 2nd Division was a [[Security Division (Wehrmacht)|security division]], but the Slovak 1st Division was a front-line unit which fought in the campaigns of 1941 and 1942, reaching the [[Battle of the Caucasus|Caucasus area]] with [[Army Group B]].

It possessed [[Slovak Army|a small army]] of its own, largely made up of parts inherited from the old [[Czechoslovak Army]]. As a result of German pressure, the 1st Slovak Infantry Division took part in the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939. In the aftermath of the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]], the German government consolidated its control of the Slovak regime.{{Sfn|Rychl\u00edk|2018|pp=121-2}} On 21 June 1941, the Slovak government was informed that it was expected to provide a contingent to participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. It accepted the following day, being the first day of the German offensive.{{Sfn|Rychl\u00edk|2018|p=122}} The Slovak Army was called up, as the regime sought to demonstrate its indispensability to Nazi Germany and its greater loyalty than [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]].\n\n==History ==\nThe Slovak Expeditionary Army Group of about 45,000 men entered the Soviet Union shortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack]]. This army lacked logistic and transportation support, so a much smaller unit, the Slovak Mobile Command (Pilfousek Brigade), was formed from units selected from this force; the rest of the Slovak army was relegated to rear-area security duty. The Slovak Mobile Command was attached to the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 17th Army]] (as was the Hungarian [[Gyorshadtest|Carpathian Group]] also) and shortly thereafter given over to direct German command, the Slovaks lacking the command infrastructure to exercise effective operational control. This unit fought with the 17th Army through July 1941, including at the [[Battle of Uman]].\n\nAt the beginning of August 1941, the Slovak Mobile Command was dissolved and instead two infantry divisions were formed from the Slovak Expeditionary Army Group. The Slovak 2nd Division was a [[Security Division (Wehrmacht)|security division]], but the Slovak 1st Division was a front-line unit which fought in the campaigns of 1941 and 1942, reaching the [[Battle of the Caucasus|Caucasus area]] with [[Army Group B]]. The Slovak 1st Division then shared the fate of the German southern forces, losing their heavy equipment in the [[Kuban bridgehead]], then being badly mangled near [[Melitopol]] in the southern Ukraine. In June 1944, the remnant of the division, no longer considered fit for combat due to low morale, was disarmed and the personnel assigned to construction and [[Military logistics|logistical]] work, a fate which had already befallen the Slovak 2nd Division earlier for the same reason.\n\nSlovak troops took part in [[Operation Bamberg]], an [[Bandenbek\u00e4mpfung|anti-partisan]] action in which 5,000 alleged partisans, including 200 Jews, were shot.<ref>{{cite book | |last1=Hutzelmann |first1=Barbara ||editor1-last=Hutzelmann |editor1-first=Barbara|editor2-last=Hausleitner |editor2-first=Mariana |editor3-last=Hazan  |editor3-first=Souzana|title=Slowakei, Rum\u00e4nien und Bulgarien|trans-title=Slovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria |date=2018 |publisher=[[Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte]] |location=Munich |isbn=978-3-11-036500-9 |language=de| series={{ill|Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europ\u00e4ischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland 1933-1945|de}} [The Persecution and Murder of European Jews by Nazi Germany 1933-1945]|volume=13 |chapter=Einf\u00fchrung: Slowakei |trans-chapter=Introduction: Slovakia|ref=harv|p=39}}</ref>\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|first=Jan |last=Rychl\u00edk|editor1-last=Stahel|editor1-first=David|title=Joining Hitler's Crusade: European Nations and the Invasion of the Soviet Union, 1941|date=2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-316-51034-6|pages=107-33|chapter=Slovakia}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last1=M\u00fcller |first1=Rolf-Dieter |title=The Unknown Eastern Front : the Wehrmacht and Hitler's foreign soldiers |date=2012 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |location=London |isbn=9781780768908}}\n\n[[Category:Operation Barbarossa]]\n[[Category:Military history of Slovakia during World War II]]\n[[Category:Infantry divisions of World War II]]\n[[Category:Foreign volunteer units of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations of the Soviet\u2013German War]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1944]]\n[[Category:1944 disestablishments in Czechoslovakia]]\n", "name_user": "Brigade Piron", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFurther reading", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_Expeditionary_Army_Group"}
