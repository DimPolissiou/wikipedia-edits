Cheese character, and is performed outside the normal showroom. Children are gathered via the public announcement system or by Chuck E. Cheese himself.  The children must dance in order to win free tickets. The free tickets are thrown at the end of the performance for all the children that participated. Chuck comes out every hour on the half hour. The songs that he and the children dance to are usually well-known classic songs such as \"[[If You're Happy and You Know It]]\" and \"[[Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chuck E.

Cheese Tokens|work=Forrest's Token Page|url=http://users.pullman.com/fjstevens/tokens/cec/CEC.html|access-date=2009-03-03}}</ref>  The company once tested a card access method for use with their arcade and skill games in one location. The test location would no longer use tokens, and instead use a refillable card to access credits, which replace tokens, and points, which replace tickets. However, this was later scrapped. It was tested under different names, including \"Chuck E.'s Super Discount Card\" and \"Chuck E. Token Card\".<ref>{{cite web|last=S.|first=Travis|title=CEC Token Cards|work=Showbiz Pizza.com|url=http://www.showbizpizza.com/tokens/cards/index.html|format=CSS|access-date=2009-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=S.|first=Travis|title=Super Discount Card Poster 9Irving, TX 2006)|work=Showbiz Pizza.com|url=http://www.showbizpizza.com/photos/cec/tx_irving_cv3/03.jpg|format=JPG|access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref>\nThis method is currently being tested in some markets again. Instead of electronic tickets like the former cards, patrons still carry paper tickets, and the card just takes the place of the metal tokens. CECE, or CEC Entertainment, has called the new system \"Play Pass\".\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Chuck E. Cheese animatronic, Laguna Hills, CA.jpg |thumb |right |Chuck E. Cheese animatronic, with \"Pizza Time\" clock, in 2017.]]\n\nAlong with the arcade, the other main draw for the centers since the beginning was its animatronic show.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Loftus |first1=Jamie |title=A History of Chuck E.

The original show featured Crusty The Cat (the first character to face retirement as he was soon replaced with Mr. Munch in 1978), Pasqually the singing chef, Jasper T. Jowls, the Warblettes, and the main focus of the show, Chuck E. Cheese.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pizza Time Theatre Program|publisher=[[Atari]]|year=1977|format=PDF|url=http://www.showbizpizza.com/info/promo/ptt/ptt_77menu.pdf|access-date=2009-03-03}}</ref> In the early 90s, when the franchise unified Chuck E. Cheese with ShowBiz Pizza, the animatronics used for [[the Rock-afire Explosion]] band were redressed as \"Munch's Make Believe Band\", with Chuck E., Jasper, Helen Henny, Munch, and Pasqually costumes replacing the Rock-afire characters.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Loftus |first1=Jamie |title=A History of Chuck E.

Cheese character created by [[Garner Holt]] alongside large television monitors, lighting effects, and interactive elements.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Chuck E.'s New Look|publisher=Garner Holt Productions|year=1998|format=PDF|url=http://www.showbizpizza.com/info/articles/cec/cec_98studioc.pdf|access-date=2009-03-03}}</ref> The other characters appear as puppets on the TV screens. The control system dubbed \"Cyberstar\" was re-designed from the ground up and produced by Dave Philipsen. In some markets, the company has also tried a new store concept that omits the animated show entirely. This is the Circle of Lights stage which either consists of a live Chuck E. Cheese costume character or an animatronic in a futuristic light stage with large television monitors. \n\nIn July 2012, the longstanding rat mascot was rebranded, changing to a slimmer rock star mouse who plays electric guitar. Voice actor [[Duncan Brannan]], who for 19 years had characterized Chuck E. Cheese as a wise-cracking rat from New Jersey, was replaced with [[Jaret Reddick]], the frontman and guitarist for the pop punk band [[Bowling for Soup]].<ref name=\"AP 2012\"/><ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chuck-e-cheese-makeover-duncan-brannan-jaret-reddick-344677</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the chain announced that animatronic shows would be removed in favor of a modernized dance floor. The move was piloted in a handful of locations prior to being implemented company-wide.<ref name=\"AnimatronicRemoval\">{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jennings|title=Chuck E.

The Live show is performed at the front of the stage in the showroom, whenever a child is celebrating a birthday. In the live show a customized rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" is sung to the child that is celebrating the birthday. A costumed Chuck E.

Cheese character, and is performed outside the normal showroom. Children are gathered via the public announcement system or by Chuck E. Cheese himself.  The children must dance in order to win free tickets. The free tickets are thrown at the end of the performance for all the children that participated. Chuck comes out every hour on the half hour. The songs that he and the children dance to are usually well-known classic songs such as \"[[If You're Happy and You Know It]]\" and \"[[Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chuck E.
