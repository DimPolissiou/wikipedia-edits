Typically, perennial crops sequester more carbon than annual crops because the root buildup is allowed to continue undisturbed over many years. Also, perennial crops avoid the yearly [[tillage]] procedures (plowing, digging) associated with growing annual crops. Tilling induces soil [[aeration]], which accelerates the soil carbon [[decomposition]] rate, by stimulating soil [[Microorganism|microbe]] populations. Also, tilling makes it easier for the oxygen (O) atoms in the atmosphere to attach to carbon (C) atoms in the soil, producing CO2.<ref>{{cite journal |quote=Any soil disturbance, such as ploughing and cultivation, is likely to result in short-term respiration losses of soil organic carbon, decomposed by stimulated soil microbe populations (Cheng, 2009; Kuzyakov, 2010).

Perennial agricultural systems, such as grassland, have time to replace their infrequent disturbance losses which can result in higher steady-state soil carbon contents (Gelfand et al., 2011; Zenone et al., 2013). |page=493 |doi=10.1111/gcbb.12294 |pmid=28331551 |title=Environmental costs and benefits of growing ''Miscanthusfor'' bioenergy in the UK |journal=GCB Bioenergy |volume=9 |issue=3 |year=2017 |last1=McCalmont |first1=Jon P. |last2=Hastings |first2=Astley |last3=McNamara |first3=Niall P. |last4=Richter |first4=Goetz M. |last5=Robson |first5=Paul |last6=Donnison |first6=Iain S. |last7=Clifton-Brown |first7=John |pmc=5340280 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:GHG (CO2 and N2O) life cycle emissions for Miscanthus x giganteus and SRC Poplar.jpg|thumb|GHG / CO2 / carbon negativity for Miscanthus x giganteus production pathways.]]\n[[File:Relationship between existing amount of soil organic carbon and soil's potential for carbon sequestration (for Miscanthus x giganteus).jpg|thumb|Relationship between above-ground yield (diagonal lines), soil organic carbon (X axis), and soil's potential for successful/unsuccessful carbon sequestration (Y axis).

This includes any emissions caused by direct or indirect [[land use change]]. Many first generation bioenergy projects are not carbon neutral given these demands. Some have even higher total GHG emissions than some fossil based alternatives.<ref>{{cite journal |quote=The environmental costs and benefits of bioenergy have been the subject of significant debate, particularly for first\u2010generation biofuels produced from food (e.g. grain and oil seed). Studies have reported life\u2010cycle GHG savings ranging from an 86% reduction to a 93% increase in GHG emissions compared with fossil fuels (Searchinger et&nbsp;al., 2008; Davis et&nbsp;al., 2009; Liska et&nbsp;al., 2009; Whitaker et&nbsp;al., 2010). In addition, concerns have been raised that N2O emissions from biofuel feedstock cultivation could have been underestimated (Crutzen et&nbsp;al., 2008; Smith & Searchinger, 2012) and that expansion of feedstock cultivation on agricultural land might displace food production onto land with high carbon stocks or high conservation value (i.e. iLUC) creating a carbon debt which could take decades to repay (Fargione et&nbsp;al., 2008). Other studies have shown that direct nitrogen\u2010related emissions from annual crop feedstocks can be mitigated through optimized management practices (Davis et&nbsp;al., 2013) or that payback times are less significant than proposed (Mello et&nbsp;al., 2014). However, there are still significant concerns over the impacts of iLUC, despite policy developments aimed at reducing the risk of iLUC occurring (Ahlgren & Di Lucia, 2014; Del Grosso et&nbsp;al., 2014). |doi=10.1111/gcbb.12488 |pmid=29497458 |pmc=5815384 |title=Consensus, uncertainties and challenges for perennial bioenergy crops and land use |journal=GCB Bioenergy |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=150\u2013164 |year=2018 |last1=Whitaker |first1=Jeanette |last2=Field |first2=John L. |last3=Bernacchi |first3=Carl J. |last4=Cerri |first4=Carlos E.

This is controversial, as the allocation of GHG emissions to the management and the use of coproducts can have a large effect on the total carbon footprint of resulting bioenergy products (Whitaker et&nbsp;al., 2010; Davis et&nbsp;al., 2013). The potential consequences of land use change (LUC) to bioenergy on GHG balance through food crop displacement or \u2018indirect\u2019 land use change (iLUC) are also an important consideration (Searchinger et&nbsp;al., 2008). |doi=10.1111/gcbb.12263 |pmid=27547244 |pmc=4974899 |title=Potential impacts on ecosystem services of land use transitions to second-generation bioenergy crops in GB |journal=GCB Bioenergy |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=317\u2013333 |year=2016 |last1=Milner |first1=Suzanne |last2=Holland |first2=Robert A. |last3=Lovett |first3=Andrew |last4=Sunnenberg |first4=Gilla |last5=Hastings |first5=Astley |last6=Smith |first6=Pete |last7=Wang |first7=Shifeng |last8=Taylor |first8=Gail }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |quote=While the initial premise regarding bioenergy was that carbon recently captured from the atmosphere into plants would deliver an immediate reduction in GHG emission from fossil fuel use, the reality proved less straightforward. Studies suggested that GHG emission from energy crop production and land-use change might outweigh any CO2 mitigation (Searchinger et al., 2008; Lange, 2011). Nitrous oxide (N2O) production, with its powerful global warming potential (GWP), could be a significant factor in offsetting CO2 gains (Crutzen et al., 2008) as well as possible acidification and eutrophication of the surrounding environment (Kim & Dale, 2005). However, not all biomass feedstocks are equal, and most studies critical of bioenergy production are concerned with biofuels produced from annual food crops at high fertilizer cost, sometimes using land cleared from natural ecosystems or in direct competition with food production (Naik et al., 2010). Dedicated perennial energy crops, produced on existing, lower grade, agricultural land, offer a sustainable alternative with significant savings in greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration when produced with appropriate management (Crutzen et al., 2008; Hastings et al., 2008, 2012; Cherubini et al., 2009; Don- dini et al., 2009a; Don et al., 2012; Zatta et al., 2014; Rich- ter et al., 2015).  |page=490 |doi=10.1111/gcbb.12294 |pmid=28331551 |pmc=5340280 |title=Environmental costs and benefits of growing ''Miscanthusfor'' bioenergy in the UK |journal=GCB Bioenergy |volume=9 |issue=3 |year=2017 |last1=McCalmont |first1=Jon P. |last2=Hastings |first2=Astley |last3=McNamara |first3=Niall P. |last4=Richter |first4=Goetz M. |last5=Robson |first5=Paul |last6=Donnison |first6=Iain S. |last7=Clifton-Brown |first7=John }}</ref> \nTransport fuels might be worse than solid fuels in this regard.<ref>{{cite journal |quote=Significant reductions in GHG emissions have been demonstrated in many LCA studies across a range of bioenergy technologies and scales (Thornley et&nbsp;al., 2009, 2015). The most significant reductions have been noted for heat and power cases. However, some other studies (particularly on transport fuels) have indicated the opposite, that is that bioenergy systems can increase GHG emissions (Smith & Searchinger, 2012) or fail to achieve increasingly stringent GHG savings thresholds. A number of factors drive this variability in calculated savings, but we know that where significant reductions are not achieved or wide variability is reported there is often associated data uncertainty or variations in the LCA methodology applied (Rowe et&nbsp;al., 2011). For example, data uncertainty in soil carbon stock change following LUC has been shown to significantly influence the GHG intensity of biofuel production pathways (Fig.&nbsp;3), whilst the shorter term radiative forcing impact of black carbon particles from the combustion of biomass and biofuels also represents significant data uncertainty (Bond et&nbsp;al., 2013). |doi=10.1111/gcbb.12488 |pmid=29497458 |pmc=5815384 |title=Consensus, uncertainties and challenges for perennial bioenergy crops and land use |journal=GCB Bioenergy |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=150\u2013164 |year=2018 |last1=Whitaker |first1=Jeanette |last2=Field |first2=John L. |last3=Bernacchi |first3=Carl J. |last4=Cerri |first4=Carlos E.

The amount of carbon sequestrated and the amount of GHG (greenhouse gases) emitted affect how the total GHG life cycle cost of a bioenergy project develops. Specifically, a GHG/carbon-negative life cycle is possible if the total below-ground carbon accumulation more than compensates for the above-ground total life-cycle GHG emissions.

This includes any emissions caused by direct or indirect [[land use change]]. Many first generation bioenergy projects are not carbon neutral given these demands. Some have even higher total GHG emissions than some fossil based alternatives.<ref>{{cite journal |quote=The environmental costs and benefits of bioenergy have been the subject of significant debate, particularly for first\u2010generation biofuels produced from food (e.g. grain and oil seed).

In addition, concerns have been raised that N2O emissions from biofuel feedstock cultivation could have been underestimated (Crutzen et&nbsp;al., 2008; Smith & Searchinger, 2012) and that expansion of feedstock cultivation on agricultural land might displace food production onto land with high carbon stocks or high conservation value (i.e. iLUC) creating a carbon debt which could take decades to repay (Fargione et&nbsp;al., 2008). Other studies have shown that direct nitrogen\u2010related emissions from annual crop feedstocks can be mitigated through optimized management practices (Davis et&nbsp;al., 2013) or that payback times are less significant than proposed (Mello et&nbsp;al., 2014). However, there are still significant concerns over the impacts of iLUC, despite policy developments aimed at reducing the risk of iLUC occurring (Ahlgren & Di Lucia, 2014; Del Grosso et&nbsp;al., 2014). |doi=10.1111/gcbb.12488 |pmid=29497458 |pmc=5815384 |title=Consensus, uncertainties and challenges for perennial bioenergy crops and land use |journal=GCB Bioenergy |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=150\u2013164 |year=2018 |last1=Whitaker |first1=Jeanette |last2=Field |first2=John L. |last3=Bernacchi |first3=Carl J. |last4=Cerri |first4=Carlos E.

This is controversial, as the allocation of GHG emissions to the management and the use of coproducts can have a large effect on the total carbon footprint of resulting bioenergy products (Whitaker et&nbsp;al., 2010; Davis et&nbsp;al., 2013). The potential consequences of land use change (LUC) to bioenergy on GHG balance through food crop displacement or \u2018indirect\u2019 land use change (iLUC) are also an important consideration (Searchinger et&nbsp;al., 2008). |doi=10.1111/gcbb.12263 |pmid=27547244 |pmc=4974899 |title=Potential impacts on ecosystem services of land use transitions to second-generation bioenergy crops in GB |journal=GCB Bioenergy |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=317\u2013333 |year=2016 |last1=Milner |first1=Suzanne |last2=Holland |first2=Robert A. |last3=Lovett |first3=Andrew |last4=Sunnenberg |first4=Gilla |last5=Hastings |first5=Astley |last6=Smith |first6=Pete |last7=Wang |first7=Shifeng |last8=Taylor |first8=Gail }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |quote=While the initial premise regarding bioenergy was that carbon recently captured from the atmosphere into plants would deliver an immediate reduction in GHG emission from fossil fuel use, the reality proved less straightforward. Studies suggested that GHG emission from energy crop production and land-use change might outweigh any CO2 mitigation (Searchinger et al., 2008; Lange, 2011). Nitrous oxide (N2O) production, with its powerful global warming potential (GWP), could be a significant factor in offsetting CO2 gains (Crutzen et al., 2008) as well as possible acidification and eutrophication of the surrounding environment (Kim & Dale, 2005). However, not all biomass feedstocks are equal, and most studies critical of bioenergy production are concerned with biofuels produced from annual food crops at high fertilizer cost, sometimes using land cleared from natural ecosystems or in direct competition with food production (Naik et al., 2010). Dedicated perennial energy crops, produced on existing, lower grade, agricultural land, offer a sustainable alternative with significant savings in greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration when produced with appropriate management (Crutzen et al., 2008; Hastings et al., 2008, 2012; Cherubini et al., 2009; Don- dini et al., 2009a; Don et al., 2012; Zatta et al., 2014; Rich- ter et al., 2015).  |page=490 |doi=10.1111/gcbb.12294 |pmid=28331551 |pmc=5340280 |title=Environmental costs and benefits of growing ''Miscanthusfor'' bioenergy in the UK |journal=GCB Bioenergy |volume=9 |issue=3 |year=2017 |last1=McCalmont |first1=Jon P. |last2=Hastings |first2=Astley |last3=McNamara |first3=Niall P. |last4=Richter |first4=Goetz M. |last5=Robson |first5=Paul |last6=Donnison |first6=Iain S. |last7=Clifton-Brown |first7=John }}</ref> \nTransport fuels might be worse than solid fuels in this regard.<ref>{{cite journal |quote=Significant reductions in GHG emissions have been demonstrated in many LCA studies across a range of bioenergy technologies and scales (Thornley et&nbsp;al., 2009, 2015). The most significant reductions have been noted for heat and power cases. However, some other studies (particularly on transport fuels) have indicated the opposite, that is that bioenergy systems can increase GHG emissions (Smith & Searchinger, 2012) or fail to achieve increasingly stringent GHG savings thresholds. A number of factors drive this variability in calculated savings, but we know that where significant reductions are not achieved or wide variability is reported there is often associated data uncertainty or variations in the LCA methodology applied (Rowe et&nbsp;al., 2011). For example, data uncertainty in soil carbon stock change following LUC has been shown to significantly influence the GHG intensity of biofuel production pathways (Fig.&nbsp;3), whilst the shorter term radiative forcing impact of black carbon particles from the combustion of biomass and biofuels also represents significant data uncertainty (Bond et&nbsp;al., 2013). |doi=10.1111/gcbb.12488 |pmid=29497458 |pmc=5815384 |title=Consensus, uncertainties and challenges for perennial bioenergy crops and land use |journal=GCB Bioenergy |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=150\u2013164 |year=2018 |last1=Whitaker |first1=Jeanette |last2=Field |first2=John L. |last3=Bernacchi |first3=Carl J. |last4=Cerri |first4=Carlos E.

Biomass releases carbon dioxide gas that was absorbed during its growth cycle, indicating that released gas can be processed by photosynthetic methods.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrel.gov/research/re-biomass.html|title=Biomass Energy Basics|website=www.nrel.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref> Plants that are the source of the biomass may be a carbon-neutral energy source.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biomass/biomass-and-the-environment.php|title=Biomass and the environment - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nSuccessful sequestration is dependent on planting sites, as the best soils for sequestration are those that are currently low in carbon. The assumption that annual cropland provides greater potential for soil carbon sequestration than grassland appears to be over\u2010simplistic, but there is an opportunity to improve predictions of soil carbon sequestration potential using the information on the initial soil carbon stock as a stronger predictor of \u2206C [change in carbon amount] than prior land use.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Whitaker |first1=Jeanette |last2=Field |first2=John L. |last3=Bernacchi |first3=Carl J. |last4=Cerri |first4=Carlos E.

Environmental groups also argue that it might take decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by new trees. Biomass burning produces [[air pollution]] in the form of [[carbon monoxide]], [[volatile organic compound]]s, particulates and other pollutants.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal|title=Proposed biomass plant: Better than coal?|author=Eartha Jane Melzer|date=January 26, 2010|work=The Michigan Messenger|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205080916/http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal|archivedate=2010-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=J.|last2=Smith|first2=K.
