Oxforddictionaries.com.</ref> The English word is used both as a noun and an adjective and is derived from the Latin: ''adamans'', ''adamantem'' [accusative] referring to the property of impregnable, diamondlike hardness, or to describe a very firm/resolute position, itself from the Greek word ''adamastos'' meaning untameable. Diamond is also derived from the same word. ''Adamant'' and the literary form ''adamantine'' (utilising the suffix -ine meaning 'of the nature of' or 'made of') occur in many works. In mythology Kronos was said to have used an adamantine sickle to castrate his father Uranus; in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', Prometheus is bound to the rocks \"in adamantine bonds infrangible\",<ref>Great Books of the Western World Vol. 4 pg 40</ref> in Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' (in which the gates of [[Tartarus]] are protected by columns of solid adamantine)  and in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', in which adamant and adamantine are mentioned eight times to describe the gates of hell, Satan's shield, fallen angel's armour and Satan's chains. In fiction Adamant is referred to in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy, and the games ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[RuneScape]]'' and many more besides. Adamantine is referred to in the film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (as \"adamantine steel\"), in many books such as [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Mathilda (novella)|Mathilda]]'', and [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'', as well as many games including ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. The word adamant is used as the basis for other fictional materials such as Adamantium (see below), Adamantite (see below), Adamantle (from [[the Sims]]), and [[Adiamante]] (from [[L. E. Modesitt Jr.]]'s [[Adiamante|1996 novel of the same name]]).\n|-\n|Adamantite\n|Numerous works\n|A metal ore that appears in a number of fictional universes. In ''Final Fantasy'' it is a material used to create armour, its source being from another world and its properties including being able to contain great amounts of energy. In ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', it is an uncommon ore used to produce weapons and armour of uncommon, rare and epic grade. In the ''Dark Elf'' book series by Salvatore set in the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' universe it is used to create drow weaponry. It is also used for armour in ''[[The Elder Scrolls III]]'', and in the game ''[[Terraria]]'' it is a red ore used to produce armour and other items besides. The word is an extension of the English noun and adjective ''[[adamant]]'' (see entry above) adding the suffix '-ite' which is often used to form the names of minerals.\n|-\n|[[Adamantium]]\n|[[Marvel Comics]]\n|A fictional metal alloy that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]], first appearing in Marvel Comics' ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #66 (July 1969), by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artists [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] and [[Syd Shores]].

It is part of the \"aethercycle\", similar to the [[water cycle]], and can be used to power everything from bikes to [[colossus (Magic: The Gathering)|colossus]]es. That is, after it is purified using the new distillation process which separates pure aether and its volatile counterpart, aetherflux.\nIn the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV, Aether is one of the principle elements of life and magic in the world.\n|- id=\"Table row arenak\"\n| Arenak \n|[[E.

If an Allomancer burns the metal, it allows the user to see a few seconds into the future as a ghostly image overlaid on the present. This allows the user to gain a significant advantage in combat, as it allow them to know every move their opponent will make. This is cancelled out if the opponent burns atium or [[electrum]] themselves, as it causes a feedback loop and causes the user to see a mess of possible futures. It is extremely valuable in the Final Empire, as it is both very rare and hoarded by the Lord Ruler. The only place it is found is in the pits of Hathsin, where small nuggets are formed in geodes mined by slaves. Using allomancy near the crystals that form the geodes destroys them. When used by a Feruchemist, it allows them to store age and, if compounded, can result in a complete stop of ageing. Its name comes from the holder of the shard, Ati. in the [[Wax and Wayne]] era, no samples exist and it is referred to as 'the lost metal'. It forms the alloy Malatium, also known as the eleventh metal, a metal that allows the user to see past versions of other people. A misting that burns atium is known as a seer. Hemalurgic effects are unknown.\n|-\n|Australium\n|''[[Team Fortress 2]]''\n|An extremely valuable element appearing in ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]. In-game, it appears as a special type of weapon, and as the fuel for the rocket in the map SD_Doomsday in the Special Delivery game mode. In the bonus comics featured on the Team Fortress website, their role is fleshed out more; The Life-Extending machines used by The Administrator, Blutarch, Redmond, and Gray Mann are powered by Australium, and a large part of the plot revolves around hiding the vast stores of Australium <ref>http://www.teamfortress.com/catchup/</ref> Their role in the story is that the material, found in [[Australia]], hence the name Australium, makes one smarter over time, but at the cost of increasing 'manliness and beard levels' in those who use it. As mentioned above, the name comes from the country of Australia and the Neo-Latin '-ium' used to denote a metallic name. Its appearance is similar to the real-life element [[gold]].\n|-\n|{{anchor|bavarium}}Bavarium\n|''[[Just Cause 3]]''\n|Discovered by Medici's tyrannical ruler Sebastiano Di Ravello in the late 1980s, Bavarium is referred to as a \"supermineral\" in reference to its near-infinite potential. Exclusive to Medici, Bavarium is at the core of much of the country's experimental weaponry and equipment- which, as of the ''Bavarium Sea Heist'' DLC, includes gravitational manipulators and personal force fields -as well as a major export; Di Ravello is able to use it as a bargaining chip when dealing with the Agency. In-game, Bavarium- in its refined form, at least -is shown to be highly volatile and prone to large, violent explosions- a small Bavarium-based charge is capable of instantly destroying all but the largest of the game's Chaos Objects.\n|-\n|{{anchor|bolognium|bolonium}}Bolognium / Bolonium\n|Various sources\n|A metallic element with variable properties; a substitute for any unspecified substance or element; or in science fiction writing, a substance or process invented to circumvent explanation or impossibility.

This material comes in a variety of types, each with different properties such as fire, ice, wind, gravity, etc. While there are four main kinds, these can be blended naturally or artificially to create new kinds. While crystalline dust is stable enough to remain out in the open, powdered Dust is highly volatile, and must be stored in special containers for safety. Dust has a variety of uses, including acting as a power source for machinery such as airships and robots. Dust may also be used for combat in the form of dust-filled bullets, as powder placed inside weapons and clothing, or in its crystalline form for raw power. Dust will stop functioning if it is taken outside of the atmosphere of Remnant, meaning it may not be used for space travel. In the series, most of Remnant's supply of this material comes from the Schnee Dust Company, which mines, purifies, and exports the material throughout the world.\n|-\n|Etherium\n|''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''\n|Etherium is a magical [[#Table row aether|Aether]]-infused alloy found on Esper, one of the five shards of the plane of [[Alara block|Alara]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/savor-flavor/perfection-through-etherium-2008-11-18 | title=Perfection Through Etherium | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=18 November 2008}}</ref> Most of Esper's inhabitants have parts of their body replaced by etherium.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/filigree-art-quiz-2008-11-19 | title=Filigree Art Quiz | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=19 November 2008}}</ref> It is also used to craft artifacts like the Filigree texts, sacred texts worked in etherium containing the Vedalken's accumulated knowledge.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/filigree-texts-2008-09-29 | title=The Filigree Texts | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=29 September 2008}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Neutronium|Element Zero]] ([[Periodic table|0-Ez]])\n|''[[Mass Effect]]''\n|Element Zero, or \"Eezo\", is naturally created within dying stars and harvested from supernovas.

Oxforddictionaries.com.</ref> The English word is used both as a noun and an adjective and is derived from the Latin: ''adamans'', ''adamantem'' [accusative] referring to the property of impregnable, diamondlike hardness, or to describe a very firm/resolute position, itself from the Greek word ''adamastos'' meaning untameable. Diamond is also derived from the same word. ''Adamant'' and the literary form ''adamantine'' (utilising the suffix -ine meaning 'of the nature of' or 'made of') occur in many works. In mythology Kronos was said to have used an adamantine sickle to castrate his father Uranus; in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', Prometheus is bound to the rocks \"in adamantine bonds infrangible\",<ref>Great Books of the Western World Vol. 4 pg 40</ref> in Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' (in which the gates of [[Tartarus]] are protected by columns of solid adamantine)  and in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', in which adamant and adamantine are mentioned eight times to describe the gates of hell, Satan's shield, fallen angel's armour and Satan's chains. In fiction Adamant is referred to in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy, and the games ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[RuneScape]]'' and many more besides. Adamantine is referred to in the film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (as \"adamantine steel\"), in many books such as [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Mathilda (novella)|Mathilda]]'', and [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'', as well as many games including ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.

In ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', it is an uncommon ore used to produce weapons and armour of uncommon, rare and epic grade. In the ''Dark Elf'' book series by Salvatore set in the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' universe it is used to create drow weaponry. It is also used for armour in ''[[The Elder Scrolls III]]'', and in the game ''[[Terraria]]'' it is a red ore used to produce armour and other items besides.

If an Allomancer burns the metal, it allows the user to see a few seconds into the future as a ghostly image overlaid on the present. This allows the user to gain a significant advantage in combat, as it allow them to know every move their opponent will make. This is cancelled out if the opponent burns atium or [[electrum]] themselves, as it causes a feedback loop and causes the user to see a mess of possible futures. It is extremely valuable in the Final Empire, as it is both very rare and hoarded by the Lord Ruler. The only place it is found is in the pits of Hathsin, where small nuggets are formed in geodes mined by slaves. Using allomancy near the crystals that form the geodes destroys them. When used by a Feruchemist, it allows them to store age and, if compounded, can result in a complete stop of ageing. Its name comes from the holder of the shard, Ati. in the [[Wax and Wayne]] era, no samples exist and it is referred to as 'the lost metal'. It forms the alloy Malatium, also known as the eleventh metal, a metal that allows the user to see past versions of other people. A misting that burns atium is known as a seer. Hemalurgic effects are unknown.\n|-\n|Australium\n|''[[Team Fortress 2]]''\n|An extremely valuable element appearing in ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]].

This material comes in a variety of types, each with different properties such as fire, ice, wind, gravity, etc. While there are four main kinds, these can be blended naturally or artificially to create new kinds. While crystalline dust is stable enough to remain out in the open, powdered Dust is highly volatile, and must be stored in special containers for safety. Dust has a variety of uses, including acting as a power source for machinery such as airships and robots. Dust may also be used for combat in the form of dust-filled bullets, as powder placed inside weapons and clothing, or in its crystalline form for raw power. Dust will stop functioning if it is taken outside of the atmosphere of Remnant, meaning it may not be used for space travel. In the series, most of Remnant's supply of this material comes from the Schnee Dust Company, which mines, purifies, and exports the material throughout the world.\n|-\n|Etherium\n|''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''\n|Etherium is a magical [[#Table row aether|Aether]]-infused alloy found on Esper, one of the five shards of the plane of [[Alara block|Alara]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/savor-flavor/perfection-through-etherium-2008-11-18 | title=Perfection Through Etherium | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=18 November 2008}}</ref> Most of Esper's inhabitants have parts of their body replaced by etherium.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/filigree-art-quiz-2008-11-19 | title=Filigree Art Quiz | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=19 November 2008}}</ref> It is also used to craft artifacts like the Filigree texts, sacred texts worked in etherium containing the Vedalken's accumulated knowledge.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/filigree-texts-2008-09-29 | title=The Filigree Texts | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=29 September 2008}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Neutronium|Element Zero]] ([[Periodic table|0-Ez]])\n|''[[Mass Effect]]''\n|Element Zero, or \"Eezo\", is naturally created within dying stars and harvested from supernovas.

The mercenary [[Deathstroke]], for example, uses a suit of the volatile variety which could mend itself after being damaged.<ref>''New Teen Titans'' Vol. 1 #10</ref> Both young heroes [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]]'s bionic chassis and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]]'s body armor were made of the depleted variety.\n\nDayton believed Promethium alloys could make most anything coated in them impervious to destruction or abrasion.

Finally in Rhandeia, Corbulo and Tiridates I met to make a peace agreement. The location of Rhandeia suited both Tiridates I and Corbulo. It appealed to Tiridates I because that is where his army had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation; on the other hand, it appealed to Corbulo because he was about to wipe out the ill repute earned before in the same location. When Tiridates I arrived at the Roman camp he took off his royal diadem and placed it on the ground near a statue of Nero, agreeing to receive it back only from Nero in Rome.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge  |publisher = Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge| year = 1842 |location = Great Britain  | page = 496}}</ref> Tiridates I was recognized as the vassal king of Armenia; a Roman garrison would remain in the country permanently, in Sophene while Artaxata would be reconstructed.

While Nero sat on the imperial throne, Tiridates I and his retinue advanced between two lines of soldiers. Arriving in front of the [[dais]], Tiridates I knelt, with hands clasped on his breast. After the thundering shouts and acclamations excited by this spectacle had subsided, Tiridates I addressed the emperor:\n\n{{quote|My Lord, I am a descendant of [[Arsaces I of Parthia|Arsakes]] and the brother of the Kings Vologases and Pacorus. I have come to you who are my god; I have worshipped you as the [sun];{{efn|[[Edward Champlin]] notes: \"When Nero entered with the senators and the guard, he ascended the Rostra and sat in his chair of state, looking back down the Forum in an east-southeasterly direction. That is, as Tiridates I approached him through the ranks of soldiers, the rising sun would have hit Nero full on the face, in all his triumphal splendor. The prince then addressed the emperor from the ground, looking up to him on the Rostra: \"I have come to you, my god, worshipping you as I do Mithra.\" The important point\u2014something Nero would know as an initiate, whether others did or not\u2014is that for Zoroastrians the sun was the eye of Mithra, and Mithra was often so closely associated with the sun as to be identified with it: \"the Sun whom they call Mithres,\" as Strabo puts it. Moreover, when Zoroastrians prayed in the open air, they turned toward the sun, since their religion bound them to pray facing fire. Thus, when Tiridates I stood in the open Roman Forum facing the sunlit emperor, and worshipping him as he did Mithra, he was in essence worshipping the sun. An ex-praetor translated his words and proclaimed them to the crowd. At this stage in Rome's history, very few of those present would have known who Mithra was, but there is a good likelihood that the interpreter relayed Tiridates' words as \"I have come to you, my god, worshipping you as I do the Sun.\" For Nero, the marriage of Roman triumph and Parthian ceremony culminated in a splendid theatrical affirmation of his role as the new god of the Sun.\"</div>{{cite book | last = Champlin | first = Edward | title = Nero | publisher = Belknap Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-674-01192-9 | url = https://archive.org/details/nerocham00cham }}</ref>}} I shall be whatever you would order me to be, because you are my destiny and fortune.}}\n\nTo which Nero replied:\n\n{{quote|You have done well by coming here to enjoy my presence in person.

As the young king was about to kneel a second time, Nero lifted him by his right hand and after kissing him, made him sit at his side on a chair a little lower than his own. Meanwhile, the populace gave tumultuous ovations to both rulers.

The interior of the [[Theatre of Pompey]] and every piece of its furniture was entirely gilded for the occasion; for this reason, Rome thenceforth recalled that date as \"the Golden Day.\" Daytime festivities were on a scale no less lavish than those of the night: Royal purple awnings stretched as protection against the heat of the sun. Nero, clad in green and wearing a chariot driver's headdress, took part in a [[chariot race]]. At the evening banquets, Nero, in gold-embroidered vestments, sang and played the lyre with [[zither]] accompaniment.

No reception comparable to this in magnitude and splendor is recorded in the history of Rome.

That is, as Tiridates I approached him through the ranks of soldiers, the rising sun would have hit Nero full on the face, in all his triumphal splendor. The prince then addressed the emperor from the ground, looking up to him on the Rostra: \"I have come to you, my god, worshipping you as I do Mithra.\" The important point\u2014something Nero would know as an initiate, whether others did or not\u2014is that for Zoroastrians the sun was the eye of Mithra, and Mithra was often so closely associated with the sun as to be identified with it: \"the Sun whom they call Mithres,\" as Strabo puts it. Moreover, when Zoroastrians prayed in the open air, they turned toward the sun, since their religion bound them to pray facing fire. Thus, when Tiridates I stood in the open Roman Forum facing the sunlit emperor, and worshipping him as he did Mithra, he was in essence worshipping the sun. An ex-praetor translated his words and proclaimed them to the crowd. At this stage in Rome's history, very few of those present would have known who Mithra was, but there is a good likelihood that the interpreter relayed Tiridates' words as \"I have come to you, my god, worshipping you as I do the Sun.\" For Nero, the marriage of Roman triumph and Parthian ceremony culminated in a splendid theatrical affirmation of his role as the new god of the Sun.\"</div>{{cite book | last = Champlin | first = Edward | title = Nero | publisher = Belknap Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-674-01192-9 | url = https://archive.org/details/nerocham00cham }}</ref>}} I shall be whatever you would order me to be, because you are my destiny and fortune.}}\n\nTo which Nero replied:\n\n{{quote|You have done well by coming here to enjoy my presence in person.

As the young king was about to kneel a second time, Nero lifted him by his right hand and after kissing him, made him sit at his side on a chair a little lower than his own. Meanwhile, the populace gave tumultuous ovations to both rulers.

The interior of the [[Theatre of Pompey]] and every piece of its furniture was entirely gilded for the occasion; for this reason, Rome thenceforth recalled that date as \"the Golden Day.\" Daytime festivities were on a scale no less lavish than those of the night: Royal purple awnings stretched as protection against the heat of the sun. Nero, clad in green and wearing a chariot driver's headdress, took part in a [[chariot race]]. At the evening banquets, Nero, in gold-embroidered vestments, sang and played the lyre with [[zither]] accompaniment.

{"title_page": "August Borsig", "text_new": "[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12815, August Borsig.jpg|thumb|Portrait of August Borsig]]\n'''Johann Friedrich August Borsig''' (23 June 1804 \u2013 6 July 1854) was a German businessman who founded the ''Borsig-Werke'' factory.\n\nBorsig was born in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]] ([[Wroc\u0142aw]]), the son of [[cuirassier]] and [[Carpentry|carpenter]] foreman Johann George Borsig. After learning his father's trade, he first attended the ''K\u00f6nigliche Provinzial-Kunst- und Bauschule'' (Royal Provincial Art and Building school), then until fall of 1825 the ''K\u00f6nigliche Gewerbe-Institut'' (Royal Institute of Trade). He received his practical training in engine construction at the ''Neue Berliner Eisengie\u00dferei'' (New Iron Foundry of Berlin) of F. A. Egells, where one of his first tasks was the assembly of a [[steam engine]] in [[Wa\u0142brzych|Waldenburg]], Silesia. After the successful completion of this task, Borsig was made factory manager for eight years. In 1828, he married Louise Pahl; they had one son, Albert.\n\n== August Borsig and his company ==\n[[File:Steam train at station.webm|thumbnail|left|Borsig steam locomotive 06-18 type 2-8-2 made in 1930.]]\nFrom early on, Borsig was a supporter of railroads. Despite the lack of experience with railroads in Germany and the risks involved in the founding of a railroad machinery manufacturing company, Borsig used his savings to buy a site at [[Chausseestra\u00dfe (Berlin)|Chausseestra\u00dfe]] (in the ''[[Feuerland]]'') near the [[Oranienburger Tor]], neighboring his old company's factory, and founded his own machine factory, focusing on [[locomotive]]s. The founding date was declared to be 22 July 1837, the day of the first successful casting in the foundry.\n\n[[Image:Borsig.jpg|thumb|220px|Technical drawing of the first steam locomotive (1840)]]\nDespite tremendous costs, the first locomotive, bearing factory number 1 and the name BORSIG, was finished in 1840. This locomotive had an interior frame, a two-axle front pivoted [[bogie]] and an extra dead axle behind the only drive axle. On 21 July 1840, Borsig let it compete against a [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]]-built locomotive on the [[Anhalt Railway|Berlin-J\u00fcterbog railroad]]. The Borsig locomotive won by 10 minutes, proving that in spite of the lack of experience, Germans could build locomotives that were at least as good as the British models, and so the import of locomotives and engineers was no longer necessary. After this victory, the number of orders rose quickly. A further six machines of this type were sold to the [[Berlin-Stettiner Eisenbahn]] and the [[Oberschlesische Eisenbahn]] in 1842.\n\nIn the beginning, the Borsig company also built steam engines for their own needs and machines for other companies as well as cast parts for art and construction. However, the focus soon shifted to locomotive building, and the name Borsig is connected with locomotives to this day. By 1843, railway companies in [[Prussia]] had ordered 18 locomotives, and in 1844, Borsig could exhibit his 24th locomotive at the Berlin industrial fair. <!-- technical locomotive details from German article missing --> The one hundredth locomotive was finished in 1846. Meanwhile, Borsig built the [[steam pump]] for the fountain at [[Sanssouci]] and participated in the building of the domes of the [[St. Nicholas' Church, Potsdam|Nicolai Church]] in [[Potsdam]] and the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]] (Berlin City Palace). The company was expanding rapidly in those years, since new railways were being built all over Germany. In 1847, construction of the new Moabit ironworks started and they became operational in 1849. The machine factory and iron foundry in [[Kirchstra\u00dfe]] was bought in 1850, and this put the total number of employees at the three Berlin factories at 1800, making Borsig's company one of the large-scale enterprises of its time.\n[[Image:Borsigwerke B-Tegel 07-2017 img2.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Gate of the former Borsig-Werke factory in Berlin]]\n\nThe increasing number of orders also increased Borsig's private wealth, and he soon became a rich entrepreneur who was not averse to splendor and a patron for many artists. August Borsig was said to be a strict but just boss with a zest for action. For his workers, he set up a sickness fund, a funeral expense fund, and a savings bank. His company had an instruction room, a dining room and a bath with swimming pool.\n\n[[Image:Borsig steam locomotive.jpg|thumb|right|Borsig steam locomotive used on the Warsaw-Vienna railway]]\nBorsig had become sufficiently important by the end of the 1840s that he was able to weather the economic crisis of 1848-1852 with little damage. <!-- more locomotive technical stuff--> Starting 1851, foreign railway companies also began to order Borsig locomotives, among them the [[Warsaw-Vienna Railway]] and the [[Seel\u00e4ndische Eisenbahn]]. After the 500th locomotive had been completed in 1854, Borsig was made ''Geheimer Kommerzienrat'' (Secret Commerce Councillor). This allowed him to tighten his monopoly position, and 67 of the 68 new Prussian locomotives in 1854 came from Borsig factories.\n\nSome years earlier, his magnificent villa in Berlin-[[Moabit]] had been completed, fulfilling a dream of Borsig's. However, he could not enjoy his wealth for very long. He died in Berlin on 6 July 1854, at the height of his power.\n\n== Further history of the company ==\n\nAfter the death of August Borsig, the company was led and expanded by his son [[Albert Borsig|August Julius Albert Borsig]].\n\nOn the occasion of the completion of the 1000th locomotive, a large celebration with many prominent guests was held, among them the explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. At this time, the company that had started out with 50 workers, had 2800 employees. It continued its expansion, and moved some part of its production to [[Zabrze]] in [[Silesia]] in 1862. In 1872, Borsig was the largest locomotive producer in Europe. Albert Borsig co-founded the [[Maschinenfabrik Deutschland]] on the [[K\u00f6ln-Mindener Eisenbahn]] line in [[Dortmund]] but the most successful chapter in the Borsig business history ended with Albert's death in 1878.\n\nThe company continued to be led mostly by Borsig family members and continued to build large numbers of locomotives, but it began to lose market share to other traffic-related companies.  The company moved to Tegel, a former suburb of Berlin.  The works was inaugurated in 1898. The Tegel works area was one of the most modern facilities in Germany at that time.  It had its own harbour where the ships brought the material for the locomotives. The works itself had long road with every production step at its place. The end of this production lane was the BORSIG Gate. The brand new locomotives left the works through this gate. The company also developed new products that are still part of the current manufacturing program: pressure vessels and compressors. The Great Depression made an end the success of BORSIG as a private company. By 1930, the company was on the verge of [[liquidation]], the locomotive business was saved by a merger with [[AEG]].

After learning his father's trade, he first attended the ''K\u00f6nigliche Provinzial-Kunst- und Bauschule'' (Royal Provincial Art and Building school), then until fall of 1825 the ''K\u00f6nigliche Gewerbe-Institut'' (Royal Institute of Trade). He received his practical training in engine construction at the ''Neue Berliner Eisengie\u00dferei'' (New Iron Foundry of Berlin) of F. A. Egells, where one of his first tasks was the assembly of a [[steam engine]] in [[Wa\u0142brzych|Waldenburg]], Silesia. After the successful completion of this task, Borsig was made factory manager for eight years. In 1828, he married Louise Pahl; they had one son, Albert.\n\n== August Borsig and his company ==\n[[File:Steam train at station.webm|thumbnail|left|Borsig steam locomotive 06-18 type 2-8-2 made in 1930.]]\nFrom early on, Borsig was a supporter of railroads. Despite the lack of experience with railroads in Germany and the risks involved in the founding of a railroad machinery manufacturing company, Borsig used his savings to buy a site at [[Chausseestra\u00dfe (Berlin)|Chausseestra\u00dfe]] (in the ''[[Feuerland]]'') near the [[Oranienburger Tor]], neighboring his old company's factory, and founded his own machine factory, focusing on [[locomotive]]s. The founding date was declared to be 22 July 1837, the day of the first successful casting in the foundry.\n\n[[Image:Borsig.jpg|thumb|220px|Technical drawing of the first steam locomotive (1840)]]\nDespite tremendous costs, the first locomotive, bearing factory number 1 and the name BORSIG, was finished in 1840. This locomotive had an interior frame, a two-axle front pivoted [[bogie]] and an extra dead axle behind the only drive axle. On 21 July 1840, Borsig let it compete against a [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]]-built locomotive on the [[Anhalt Railway|Berlin-J\u00fcterbog railroad]]. The Borsig locomotive won by 10 minutes, proving that in spite of the lack of experience, Germans could build locomotives that were at least as good as the British models, and so the import of locomotives and engineers was no longer necessary. After this victory, the number of orders rose quickly. A further six machines of this type were sold to the [[Berlin-Stettiner Eisenbahn]] and the [[Oberschlesische Eisenbahn]] in 1842.\n\nIn the beginning, the Borsig company also built steam engines for their own needs and machines for other companies as well as cast parts for art and construction. However, the focus soon shifted to locomotive building, and the name Borsig is connected with locomotives to this day. By 1843, railway companies in [[Prussia]] had ordered 18 locomotives, and in 1844, Borsig could exhibit his 24th locomotive at the Berlin industrial fair. <!-- technical locomotive details from German article missing --> The one hundredth locomotive was finished in 1846. Meanwhile, Borsig built the [[steam pump]] for the fountain at [[Sanssouci]] and participated in the building of the domes of the [[St. Nicholas' Church, Potsdam|Nicolai Church]] in [[Potsdam]] and the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]] (Berlin City Palace). The company was expanding rapidly in those years, since new railways were being built all over Germany. In 1847, construction of the new Moabit ironworks started and they became operational in 1849. The machine factory and iron foundry in [[Kirchstra\u00dfe]] was bought in 1850, and this put the total number of employees at the three Berlin factories at 1800, making Borsig's company one of the large-scale enterprises of its time.\n[[Image:Borsigwerke B-Tegel 07-2017 img2.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Gate of the former Borsig-Werke factory in Berlin]]\n\nThe increasing number of orders also increased Borsig's private wealth, and he soon became a rich entrepreneur who was not averse to splendor and a patron for many artists. August Borsig was said to be a strict but just boss with a zest for action. For his workers, he set up a sickness fund, a funeral expense fund, and a savings bank. His company had an instruction room, a dining room and a bath with swimming pool.\n\n[[Image:Borsig steam locomotive.jpg|thumb|right|Borsig steam locomotive used on the Warsaw-Vienna railway]]\nBorsig had become sufficiently important by the end of the 1840s that he was able to weather the economic crisis of 1848-1852 with little damage. <!-- more locomotive technical stuff--> Starting 1851, foreign railway companies also began to order Borsig locomotives, among them the [[Warsaw-Vienna Railway]] and the [[Seel\u00e4ndische Eisenbahn]]. After the 500th locomotive had been completed in 1854, Borsig was made ''Geheimer Kommerzienrat'' (Secret Commerce Councillor). This allowed him to tighten his monopoly position, and 67 of the 68 new Prussian locomotives in 1854 came from Borsig factories.\n\nSome years earlier, his magnificent villa in Berlin-[[Moabit]] had been completed, fulfilling a dream of Borsig's. However, he could not enjoy his wealth for very long. He died in Berlin on 6 July 1854, at the height of his power.\n\n== Further history of the company ==\n\nAfter the death of August Borsig, the company was led and expanded by his son [[Albert Borsig|August Julius Albert Borsig]].\n\nOn the occasion of the completion of the 1000th locomotive, a large celebration with many prominent guests was held, among them the explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. At this time, the company that had started out with 50 workers, had 2800 employees. It continued its expansion, and moved some part of its production to [[Zabrze]] in [[Silesia]] in 1862. In 1872, Borsig was the largest locomotive producer in Europe. Albert Borsig co-founded the [[Maschinenfabrik Deutschland]] on the [[K\u00f6ln-Mindener Eisenbahn]] line in [[Dortmund]] but the most successful chapter in the Borsig business history ended with Albert's death in 1878.\n\nThe company continued to be led mostly by Borsig family members and continued to build large numbers of locomotives, but it began to lose market share to other traffic-related companies.  The company moved to Tegel, a former suburb of Berlin.  The works was inaugurated in 1898. The Tegel works area was one of the most modern facilities in Germany at that time.  It had its own harbour where the ships brought the material for the locomotives. The works itself had long road with every production step at its place. The end of this production lane was the BORSIG Gate. The brand new locomotives left the works through this gate. The company also developed new products that are still part of the current manufacturing program: pressure vessels and compressors. The Great Depression made an end the success of BORSIG as a private company. By 1930, the company was on the verge of [[liquidation]], the locomotive business was saved by a merger with [[AEG]]. Borsig built a number of famous locomotives, among which was the world speed record holder [[DRG Class 05]], the first steam locomotive to hit 200&nbsp;km/h. The last of a total of 16,352 locomotives was built in 1954. The rest of the company went to Rheinmetall.\n\n[[Image:Berlin Erbbegraebnis Borsig AS.jpg|thumb|220px|Johann Friedrich August Borsig's family tomb on the ''[[Dorotheenstadt cemetery|Dorotheenst\u00e4dtischer Friedhof]]'' graveyard, after a sketch by [[Heinrich Strack]]]]\n\n== BORSIG today ==\n[[File:Borsig-tomb.JPG|thumb|right|The memorial pictured in 2007 in the Berlin cemetery]]\n\nAfter World War II, the company was called Borsig AG, owned by [[Rheinmetall]] (as Rheinmetall-Borsig) and later by [[VIAG (company)|VIAG]], a company owned by the German Federal Republic.
