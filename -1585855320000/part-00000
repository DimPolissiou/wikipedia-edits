Other encodings are also used.\n\n===Visual encoding===\nVisual encoding is the process of encoding images and visual sensory information. This means that people can convert the new information that they stored into mental pictures (Harrison, C., Semin, A.,(2009). Psychology. New York p.&nbsp;222) Visual sensory information is temporarily stored within our [[iconic memory]]<ref name=\"text\">Baddeley, A., Eysenck, M.W., & Anderson, M.C. (2009). Memory.

It accepts visual input in addition to input from other systems and encodes the positive or negative values of conditioned stimuli.<ref name=\"Belova\">Belova, M.A., Morrison, S.E., Paton, J.J., & Salzman, C.D.

Memories are a combination of old and new information, so the nature of any particular memory depends as much on the old information already in our memories as it does on the new information coming in through our senses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An introduction to cognitive psychology : processes and disorders|last=Groome, David, 1946-|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=978-1-317-97609-7|edition=Third|location=Hove, East Sussex|pages=176\u2013177|oclc=867050087}}</ref> In other words, how we remember something depends on how we think about it at the time. Many studies have shown that long-term retention is greatly enhanced by elaborative encoding.<ref>Brown and Craik (2000)</ref>\n\n===Semantic encoding===\nSemantic encoding is the processing and encoding of sensory input that has particular meaning or can be applied to a context. Various strategies can be applied such as [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]] and [[mnemonic]]s to aid in encoding, and in some cases, allow deep processing, and optimizing retrieval.\n\nWords studied in semantic or deep encoding conditions are better recalled as compared to both easy and hard groupings of nonsemantic or shallow encoding conditions with response time being the deciding variable.<ref name=\"Demb\">Demb, JB., Desmond, JE., Gabrieli, JD., Glover, GH., Vaidya, CJ., & Wagner, AD. Semantic encoding and retrieval in the left inferior prefrontal cortex: a functional MRI study of task difficulty and process specificity. The Journal of Neuroscience; 15, 5870-5878.</ref> Brodmann's areas 45, 46, and 47 (the left inferior prefrontal cortex or LIPC) showed significantly more activation during semantic encoding conditions compared to nonsemantic encoding conditions regardless of the difficulty of the nonsemantic encoding task presented. The same area showing increased activation during initial semantic encoding will also display decreasing activation with repetitive semantic encoding of the same words. This suggests the decrease in activation with repetition is process specific occurring when words are semantically reprocessed but not when they are nonsemantically reprocessed.<ref name=\"Demb\" /> Lesion and neuroimaging studies suggest that the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] is responsible for initial encoding and that activity in the left lateral prefrontal cortex correlates with the semantic organization of encoded information.<ref name=\"Frey, Stephen, and Michael Petrides. 2002\">Frey, S., & Petrides, M. (2002). Orbitofrontal cortex and memory formation. Neuron, 36(1), 171-176.</ref>\n\n===Acoustic encoding===\nAcoustic encoding is the encoding of auditory impulses. According to Baddeley, processing of auditory information is aided by the concept of the phonological loop, which allows input within our echoic memory to be sub vocally rehearsed in order to facilitate remembering.<ref name=\"text\"/> \nWhen we hear any word, we do so by hearing individual sounds, one at a time. Hence the memory of the beginning of a new word is stored in our echoic memory until the whole sound has been perceived and recognized as a word.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson and Heth(2010)|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour 4e|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location=Chapter 8|page=233}}</ref> \nStudies indicate that lexical, semantic and phonological factors interact in verbal working memory.  The phonological similarity effect (PSE), is modified by word concreteness. This emphasizes that verbal working memory performance cannot exclusively be attributed to phonological or acoustic representation but also includes an interaction of linguistic representation.<ref name=\"Acheson\">Acheson, D.J., MacDonald, M.C., & Postle, B.R. (2010). The Interaction of Concreteness and Phonological Similarity in Verbal Working Memory. Journal of Experimental Psychogy: Learning, Memory and Cognition; 36:1, 17-36.</ref> What remains to be seen is whether linguistic representation is expressed at the time of recall or whether the representational methods used (such as recordings, videos, symbols, etc.) participate in a more fundamental role in encoding and preservation of information in memory.<ref name=\"Acheson\"/> The brain relies primarily on acoustic, rather than semantic, encoding for use in short term storage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Robert W.|last2=Chamberland|first2=Cindy|last3=Tremblay|first3=S\u00e9bastien|last4=Jones|first4=Dylan M.|date=October 2016|title=Perceptual-motor determinants of auditory-verbal serial short-term memory|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|language=en|volume=90|pages=126\u2013146|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2016.04.006}}</ref>\n\n===Other senses===\nTactile encoding is the processing and encoding of how something feels, normally through touch. Neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) react to vibrotactile stimuli by activating in synchronisation with each series of vibrations.<ref name=\"Crawley\">Crawley, AP., Davis, KD., Mikulis.

Journal of Neurophysiology: 80 (3): 1533\u201346</ref> Odors and tastes may also lead to encode.\n\nOrganizational encoding is the course of classifying information permitting to the associations amid a sequence of terms.\n\n==Long-term potentiation==\n\n[[File:Early LTP mechanism.png|right|Early LPT Mechanism]]\n\n{{main|Long-term potentiation}}\n\nEncoding is a biological event that begins with [[perception]]. All perceived and striking sensations travel to the brain's thalamus where all these sensations are combined into one single experience.<ref name=\"mohs\">Mohs, Richard C. \"How Human Memory Works.\"  8 May 2007.  HowStuffWorks.com. <http://health.howstuffworks.com/human-memory.htm>  23 February 2010.</ref> The hippocampus is responsible for analyzing these inputs and ultimately deciding if they will be committed to long-term memory; these various threads of information are stored in various parts of the brain. However, the exact way in which these pieces are identified and recalled later remains unknown.<ref name=\"mohs\"/>\n\nEncoding is achieved using a combination of chemicals and electricity. Neurotransmitters are released when an electrical pulse crosses the synapse which serves as a connection from nerve cells to other cells. The dendrites receive these impulses with their feathery extensions. A phenomenon called [[long-term potentiation]] allows a synapse to increase strength with increasing numbers of transmitted signals between the two neurons. For that to happen, [[NMDA receptor]], which influences the flow of information between neurons by controlling the initiation of long-term potentiation in most hippocampal pathways, need to come to the play. For these NMDA receptors to be activated, there must be two conditions. Firstly, [[glutamate]] has to be released and bound to the NMDA receptor site on postsynaptic neurons. Secondly, excitation has to take place in postsynaptic neurons.<ref>Schacter, D., Gilbert, D. & Wegner, D.(2011) ''Psychology'', 2nd edition, Chapter 6: Memory, p.232</ref> These cells also organise themselves into groups specializing in different kinds of information processing. Thus, with new experiences the brain creates more connections and may 'rewire'. The brain organizes and reorganizes itself in response to one's experiences, creating new memories prompted by experience, education, or training.<ref name=\"mohs\"/> Therefore, the use of a brain reflects how it is organised.<ref name=\"mohs\"/> This ability to re-organize is especially important if ever a part of the brain becomes damaged.  Scientists are unsure of whether the stimuli of what we do not recall are filtered out at the sensory phase or if they are filtered out after the brain examines their significance.<ref name=\"mohs\"/>\n\n===Mapping activity===\n[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) demonstrates a consistent functional anatomical blueprint of hippocampal activation during episodic encoding and retrieval. Activation in the hippocampal region associated with episodic memory encoding has been shown to occur in the rostral portion of the region whereas activation associated with episodic memory retrieval occurs in the caudal portions.<ref name=\"Lepage\">Lepage, M., Habib, R. & Tulving. E. (1998). Hippocampal PET activations of memory encoding and retrieval: The HIPER model. Hippocampus, 8:4: 313-322</ref> This is referred to as the [[Hippocampal memory encoding and retrieval]] model or HIPER model.\n\nOne study used PET to measure cerebral blood flow during encoding and recognition of faces in both young and older participants. Young people displayed increased cerebral blood flow in the right hippocampus and the left prefrontal and temporal cortices during encoding and in the right prefrontal and parietal cortex during recognition.<ref name=\"Grady\">Grady, CL., Horwitz, B., Haxby, JV., Maisog, JM., McIntosh, AR., Mentis, MJ., Pietrini, P., Schapiro, MB., & Underleider, LG. (1995) Age-related reductions in human recognition memory due to inpaired encoding. Science, 269:5221, 218-221.</ref> Elderly people showed no significant activation in areas activated in young people during encoding, however they did show right prefrontal activation during recognition.<ref name=\"Grady\"/> Thus it may be concluded that as we grow old, failing memories may be the consequence of a failure to adequately encode stimuli as demonstrated in the lack of cortical and hippocampal activation during the encoding process.<ref name=\"Grady\"/>\n\nRecent findings in studies focusing on patients with post traumatic stress disorder demonstrate that amino acid transmitters, glutamate and GABA, are intimately implicated in the process of factual memory registration, and suggest that amine neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and serotonin, are involved in encoding emotional memory.<ref name=\"Birmes\">Birmes, P., Escande, M., Schmitt, L. & Senard, JM. (2002). Biological Factors of PTSD: neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Encephale, 28: 241-247.</ref>\n\n==Molecular perspective==\nThe process of encoding is not yet well understood, however key advances have shed light on the nature of these mechanisms. Encoding begins with any novel situation, as the [[brain]] will interact and draw conclusions from the results of this interaction. These learning experiences have been known to trigger a cascade of molecular events leading to the formation of memories.<ref name=\"wagner\">Wagner, M. (2008). The His452Tyr variant of the gene encoding the 5-HT(2a) receptor is specifically associated with consolidation of episodic memory in humans. International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 11, 1163\u20131167.</ref> These changes include the modification of neural synapses, modification of [[proteins]], creation of new [[synapses]], activation of [[gene expression]] and new [[protein synthesis]]. However, encoding can occur on different levels. The first step is [[short-term memory]] formation, followed by the conversion to a [[long-term memory]], and then a long-term memory consolidation process.<ref name=\"kandel\">Kandel, E. (2004). The Molecular Biology of Memory Storage: A Dialog Between Genes and Synapses. Bioscience Reports, 24, 4-5.</ref>\n\n===Synaptic plasticity===\n[[Synaptic plasticity]] is the ability of the [[brain]] to strengthen, weaken, destroy and create neural synapses and is the basis for learning. These molecular distinctions will identify and indicate the strength of each neural connection. The effect of a learning experience depends on the content of such an experience. Reactions that are favoured will be reinforced and those that are deemed unfavourable will be weakened. This shows that the synaptic modifications that occur can operate either way, in order to be able to make changes over time depending on the current situation of the organism. In the short term, synaptic changes may include the strengthening or weakening of a connection by modifying the preexisting proteins leading to a modification in synapse connection strength. In the long term, entirely new connections may form or the number of synapses at a connection may be increased, or reduced.<ref name=\"kandel\"/>\n\n===The encoding process===\nA significant short-term biochemical change is the covalent modification of pre-existing proteins in order to modify synaptic connections that are already active. This allows data to be conveyed in the short term, without consolidating anything for permanent storage. From here a memory or an association may be chosen to become a long-term memory, or forgotten as the synaptic connections eventually weaken. The switch from short to long-term is the same concerning both [[implicit memory]] and [[explicit memory]]. This process is regulated by a number of inhibitory constraints, primarily the balance between protein [[phosphorylation]] and [[dephosphorylation]].<ref name=\"kandel\"/> Finally, long term changes occur that allow consolidation of the target memory. These changes include new protein synthesis, the formation of new synaptic connections and finally the activation of [[gene expression]] in accordance with the new neural configuration.<ref>Sacktor, T.C. (2008). PKMz, LTP Maintenance, and the dynamic molecular biology of memory storage. Progress in Brain Research, 169, Ch 2.</ref> \nThe encoding process has been found to be partially mediated by serotonergic interneurons, specifically in regard to sensitization as blocking these interneurons prevented sensitization entirely. However, the ultimate consequences of these discoveries have yet to be identified. \nFurthermore, the learning process has been known to recruit a variety of modulatory transmitters in order to create and consolidate memories. These transmitters cause the nucleus to initiate processes required for neuronal growth and long term memory, mark specific synapses for the capture of long-term processes, regulate local protein synthesis and even appear to mediate attentional processes required for the formation and recall of memories.\n\n===Encoding and genetics===\nHuman memory, including the process of encoding, is known to be a [[heritable trait]] that is controlled by more than one gene. In fact, twin studies suggest that genetic differences are responsible for as much as 50% of the variance seen in memory tasks.<ref name=\"wagner\"/>\nProteins identified in animal studies have been linked directly to a molecular cascade of reactions leading to memory formation, and a sizeable number of these proteins are encoded by genes that are expressed in humans as well. In fact, variations within these genes appear to be associated with memory capacity and have been identified in recent human genetic studies.<ref name=\"wagner\"/>\n\n==Complementary processes==\nThe idea that the brain is separated into two complementary processing networks ([[default network|task positive]] and [[default network|task negative]]) has recently become an area of increasing interest.{{Vague|date=August 2010}} The task positive network deals with externally oriented processing whereas the task negative network deals with internally oriented processing. Research indicates that these networks are not exclusive and some tasks overlap in their activation. A study done in 2009 shows encoding success and novelty detection activity within the task-positive network have significant overlap and have thus been concluded to reflect common association of externally oriented processing.<ref name=\"cab\">Cabeza, R., Daselaar, S.M., &  Hongkeun, K. (2009). Overlapping brain activity between episodic memory encoding and retrieval: Roles of the task-positive and task-negative networks. Neuroimage;49: 1145\u20131154.</ref> It also demonstrates how encoding failure and retrieval success share significant overlap within the task negative network indicating common association of internally oriented processing.<ref name=\"cab\"/> Finally, a low level of overlap between encoding success and retrieval success activity and between encoding failure and novelty detection activity respectively indicate opposing modes or processing.<ref name=\"cab\"/> In sum task positive and task negative networks can have common associations during the performance of different tasks.\n\n==Depth of processing==\nDifferent levels of processing influence how well information is remembered. These levels of processing can be illustrated by maintenance and elaborate rehearsal.\n\n===Maintenance and elaborative rehearsal===\n''Maintenance rehearsal'' is a shallow form of processing information which involves focusing on an object without thought to its meaning or its association with other objects. For example, the repetition of a series of numbers is a form of maintenance rehearsal. In contrast, ''elaborative or relational rehearsal'' is a process in which you relate new material to information already stored in Long-term memory. It's a deep form of processing information and involves thought of the object's meaning as well as making connections between the object, past experiences and the other objects of focus. Using the example of numbers, one might associate them with dates that are personally significant such as your parents' birthdays (past experiences) or perhaps you might see a pattern in the numbers that helps you to remember them.<ref name=\"1973 craik\">Craik, F. I. M., & Watkins, M. J. (1973). The role of rehearsal in short-term memory. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior'', '''12''' (6), 599\u2013607.</ref>\n[[File:US penny 2003.jpg|thumb|alt=|American Penny]]\nDue to the deeper level of processing that occurs with elaborative rehearsal it is more effective than maintenance rehearsal in creating new memories.<ref name=\" 1973 craik\"/> This has been demonstrated in people's lack of knowledge of the details in everyday objects. For example, in one study where Americans were asked about the orientation of the face on their country's penny few recalled this with any degree of certainty. Despite the fact that it is a detail that is often seen, it is not remembered as there is no need to because the color discriminates the penny from other coins.<ref>Nickerson, R. S. (., & Adams, M. J. (1979). Long-term memory for a common object. Cognitive Psychology, 11(3, pp. 287-307)</ref> The ineffectiveness of maintenance rehearsal, simply being repeatedly exposed to an item, in creating memories has also been found in people's  lack of memory for the layout of the digits 0-9 on calculators and telephones.<ref>Rinck, M. (1999). Memory for everyday objects: Where are the digits on numerical keypads? Applied Cognitive Psychology, 13(4), 329-350.</ref>\n\nMaintenance rehearsal has been demonstrated to be important in learning but its effects can only be demonstrated using indirect methods such as [[lexical decision task]]s,<ref>Oliphant, G. W. (1983). Repetition and recency effects in word recognition. Australian Journal of Psychology, 35(3), 393-403</ref> and word stem completion<ref>Graf, P., Mandler, G., & Haden, P. E. (1982). Simulating amnesic symptoms in normal subjects. Science, 218(4578), 1243\u20131244.</ref> which are used to assess implicit learning. In general, however previous learning by maintenance rehearsal is not apparent when memory is being tested directly or explicitly with questions like \" Is this the word you were shown earlier?\"\n\n===Intention to learn===\n\nStudies have shown that the intention to learn has no direct effect on memory encoding. Instead, memory encoding is dependent on how deeply each item is encoded, which could be affected by intention to learn, but not exclusively. That is, intention to learn can lead to more effective learning strategies, and consequently, better memory encoding, but if you learn something incidentally (i.e. without intention to learn) but still process and learn the information effectively, it will get encoded just as well as something learnt with intention.<ref>Hyde, Thomas S.  & Jenkins, James J. (1973). Recall for words as a function of semantic, graphic, and syntactic orienting tasks. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 12(5), 471-480</ref>\n\nThe effects of elaborative rehearsal or deep processing can be attributed to the number of connections made while encoding that increase the number of pathways available for retrieval.<ref>Craik, F. I., & Tulving, E. (1975). Depth of processing and the retention of words in episodic memory. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 104(3), 268-294.</ref>\n\n==Optimal encoding==\n\n=== Organization ===\nOrganization can be seen as a key to better memory. The section about depth of processing demonstrated the significant effect that levels of processing has on encoding. Researchers have discovered that our minds naturally organize information if the information received is not organized.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schunk, Dale H.|title=Learning theories : an educational perspective|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-13-707195-1|edition=6th|location=Boston|oclc=688559444}}</ref> Levels of processing are also related to the organization of information. For example, the connections that are made between the to-be-remembered item, other to-be-remembered items, previous experiences and context generate retrieval paths for the to-be-remembered item. These connections impose organization on the to-be-remembered item, making it more memorable.<ref>Katona, G. (1940). Organizing and memorizing. New York, NY, US: Columbia University Press.</ref> Researchers have discovered that our minds naturally organize information if the information received is not organized.<ref name=\":3\" /> One natural way information can be organized is through hierarchies.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, the grouping mammals, reptiles, and amphibians is a hierarchy of the animal kingdom. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Schunk, Dale H.|title=Learning theories : an educational perspective|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-13-707195-1|edition=6th|location=Boston|oclc=688559444}}</ref>\n\n===Mnemonics===\n{{main|Mnemonics}}\n[[File:Rainbow-diagram-ROYGBIV.svg|thumb|alt= Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet|The mnemonic \"Roy G. Biv\" can be used to remember the colors of the rainbow]]\n\nFor simple material such as lists of words, mnemonics are the best strategy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Mnemonic Strategies are an example of how finding organization within a set of items helps these items to be remembered. In the absence of any apparent organization within  a group organization can be imposed with the same memory enhancing results. An example of a mnemonic strategy that imposes organization is the ''[[Mnemonic peg system|peg-word system]]'' which associates the to-be-remembered items with a list of easily remembered items. Another example of a mnemonic device commonly used is the first letter of every word system or [[acronyms]]. When learning the colours in a [[rainbow]] most students learn the first letter of every colour and impose their own meaning by associating it with a name such as Roy. G. Biv which stands for red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. In this way mnemonic devices not only help the encoding of specific items but also their sequence. For more complex concepts, understanding is the key to remembering. In a study done by Wiseman and Neisser in 1974 they presented participants with a picture (the picture was of a Dalmatian in the style of [[pointillism]] making it difficult to see the image).<ref>Wiseman, S., & Neisser, U. (1974). Perceptual organization as a determinant of visual recognition memory. American Journal of Psychology, 87(4), 675-681.</ref> They found that memory for the picture was better if the participants understood what was depicted.\n\n===Chunking===\nAnother way understanding may aid memory is by reducing the amount that has to be remembered via [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]. Chunking is the process of organizing objects into meaningful wholes. These wholes are then remembered as a unit rather than separate objects. Words are an example of chunking, where instead of simply perceiving letters we perceive and remember their meaningful wholes: words. The use of chunking increases the number of items we are able to remember by creating meaningful \"packets\" in which many related items are stored as one.\n\n===State-dependent learning===\nFor optimal encoding, connections are not only formed between the items themselves and past experiences, but also between the internal state or mood of the encoder and the situation they are in. The connections that are formed between the encoders internal state or the situation and the items to be remembered are State-dependent. In a 1975 study by Godden and Baddeley the effects of State-dependent learning were shown. They asked deep sea divers to learn various materials while either under water or on the side of the pool. They found that those who were tested in the same condition that they had learned the information in were better able to recall that information, i.e. those who learned the material under water did better when tested on that material under water than when tested on land. Context had become associated with the material they were trying to recall and therefore was serving as a retrieval cue.<ref>Godden, D. R., & Baddeley, A. D. (1975). Context-dependent memory in two natural environments: On land and underwater. British Journal of Psychology, 66(3), 325-331.</ref> Results similar to these have also been found when certain smells are present at encoding.<ref>Cann, A., & Ross, D. A. (1989). Olfactory stimuli as context cues in human memory. American Journal of Psychology, 102(1), 91-102.</ref>\n\nHowever, although the external environment is important at the time of encoding in creating multiple pathways for retrieval, other studies have shown that simply creating the same internal state that you had at the time of encoding is sufficient to serve as a retrieval cue.<ref>Smith, S. M. (1979). Remembering in and out of context. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 5(5), 460-471.</ref> Therefore, putting yourself in the same mindset that you were in at the time of encoding will help recall in the same way that being in the same situation helps recall. This effect called context reinstatement was demonstrated by Fisher and Craik 1977 when they matched retrieval cues with the way information was memorized.<ref>Fisher, R. P., & Craik, F. I. (1977). Interaction between encoding and retrieval operations in cued recall. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 3(6), 701-711.</ref>\n\n===Encoding specificity===\n[[File:Facevase.png|thumb|alt=An ambiguous figure which can be perceived as either a vase or a pair of faces. |Vase or faces?]]\n\nThe context of learning shapes how information is encoded.<ref>Tulving, E. (1983). Elements of episodic memory. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.</ref> For instance,  Kanizsa in 1979 showed a picture that could be interpreted as either a white vase on a black background or 2 faces facing each other on a white background.<ref name=\"kanizsa1979\">Kanizsa, G. (1979). Organization in vision. New York: Praeger.</ref> The participants were primed to see the vase. Later they were shown the picture again but this time they were primed to see the black faces on the white background. Although this was the same picture as they had seen before, when asked if they had seen this picture before, they said no. The reason for this was that they had been primed to see the vase the first time the picture was presented, and  it was therefore unrecognizable the second time as two faces. This demonstrates that the stimulus is understood within the context it is learned in as well the general rule that what really constitutes good learning are tests that test what has been learned in the same way that it was learned.<ref name=\"kanizsa1979\" /> Therefore, to truly be efficient at remembering information, one must consider the demands that future recall will place on this information and study in a way that will match those demands.\n\n=== Generation Effect ===\n''Main Article:'' [[Generation effect]]\n\nAnother principle that may have the potential to aid encoding is the generation effect.

Different models have been developed for different memory tasks, which include item recognition, cued recall, free recall, and sequence memory, in an attempt to accurately explain experimentally observed behaviors.\n\n===Item recognition===\nIn item recognition, one is asked whether or not a given probe item has been seen before. It is important to note that the recognition of an item can include context. That is, one can be asked whether an item has been seen in a study list. So even though one may have seen the word \"apple\" sometime during their life, if it was not on the study list, it should not be recalled.\n\nItem recognition can be modeled using [[Multiple trace theory]] and the attribute-similarity model.<ref>Hintzman, Douglas L. & Block, Richard A. (1971) Repetition and memory: Evidence for a multiple-trace hypothesis. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 88(3), 297-306.</ref> In brief, every item that one sees can be represented as a vector of the item's attributes, which is extended by a vector representing the context at the time of encoding, and is stored in a memory matrix of all items ever seen. When a probe item is presented, the sum of the similarities to each item in the matrix (which is inversely proportional to the sum of the distances between the probe vector and each item in the memory matrix) is computed. If the similarity is above a threshold value, one would respond, \"Yes, I recognize that item.\" Given that context continually drifts by nature of a [[random walk]], more recently seen items, which each share a similar context vector to the context vector at the time of the recognition task, are more likely to be recognized than items seen longer ago.\n\n===Cued recall===\nIn [[Recall (memory)#Cued recall|cued recall]], one is asked to recall the item that was paired with a given probe item. For example, one can be given a list of name-face pairs, and later be asked to recall the associated name given a face.\n\nCued recall can be explained by extending the attribute-similarity model used for item recognition. Because in cued recall, a wrong response can be given for a probe item, the model has to be extended accordingly to account for that. This can be achieved by adding noise to the item vectors when they are stored in the memory matrix. Furthermore, cued recall can be modeled in a probabilistic manner such that for every item stored in the memory matrix, the more similar it is to the probe item, the more likely it is to be recalled. Because the items in the memory matrix contain noise in their values, this model can account for incorrect recalls, such as mistakenly calling a person by the wrong name.\n\n===Free recall===\nIn [[free recall]], one is allowed to recall items that were learned in any order. For example, you could be asked to name as many countries in Europe as you can. Free recall can be modeled using [[Semantic memory#Search of Associative Memory .28SAM.29|SAM]] (Search of Associative Memory) which is based on the dual-store model, first proposed by [[Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin memory model|Atkinson and Shiffrin]] in 1968.<ref>Raaijmakers, J. G. W., Schiffrin, R. M. (1981). Search of associative memory. Psychological Review, 8(2), 98-134</ref> SAM consists of two main components: [[Short-term memory|short-term store]] (STS) and [[Long-term memory|long-term store]] (LTS). In brief, when an item is seen, it is pushed into STS where it resides with other items also in STS, until it displaced and put into LTS. The longer the item has been in STS, the more likely it is to be displaced by a new item. When items co-reside in STS, the links between those items are strengthened. Furthermore, SAM assumes that items in STS are always available for immediate recall.\n\nSAM explains both primacy and recency effects. Probabilistically, items at the beginning of the list are more likely to remain in STS, and thus have more opportunities to strengthen their links to other items. As a result, items at the beginning of the list are made more likely to be recalled in a free-recall task (primacy effect). Because of the assumption that items in STS are always available for immediate recall, given that there were no significant distractors between learning and recall, items at the end of the list can be recalled excellently (recency effect).\n\nIncidentally, the idea of STS and LTS was motivated by the architecture of computers, which contain short-term and long-term storage.\n\n===Sequence memory===\n[[Recall (memory)#Serial recall|Sequence memory]] is responsible for how we remember lists of things, in which ordering matters. For example, telephone numbers are an ordered list of one digit numbers. There are currently two main computational memory models that can be applied to sequence encoding: associative chaining and positional coding.\n\nAssociative chaining theory states that every item in a list is linked to its forward and backward neighbors, with forward links being stronger than backward links, and links to closer neighbors being stronger than links to farther neighbors. For example, associative chaining predicts the tendencies of transposition errors, which occur most often with items in nearby positions. An example of a transposition error would be recalling the sequence \"apple, orange, banana\" instead of \"apple, banana, orange.\"\n\nPositional coding theory suggests that every item in a list is associated to its position in the list. For example, if the list is \"apple, banana, orange, mango\" apple will be associated to list position 1, banana to 2, orange to 3, and mango to 4. Furthermore, each item is also, albeit more weakly, associated to its index +/- 1, even more weakly to +/- 2, and so forth. So banana is associated not only to its actual index 2, but also to 1, 3, and 4, with varying degrees of strength. For example, positional coding can be used to explain the effects of recency and primacy. Because items at the beginning and end of a list have fewer close neighbors compared to items in the middle of the list, they have less competition for correct recall.\n\nAlthough the models of associative chaining and positional coding are able to explain a great amount of behavior seen for sequence memory, they are far from perfect. For example, neither chaining nor positional coding is able to properly illustrate the details of the [[Ranschburg effect]], which reports that sequences of items that contain repeated items are harder to reproduce than sequences of unrepeated items. Associative chaining predicts that recall of lists containing repeated items is impaired because recall of any repeated item would cue not only its true successor but also the successors of all other instances of the item. However, experimental data have shown that spaced repetition of items resulted in impaired recall of the second occurrence of the repeated item.<ref>Crowder, R. G. (1968). Intraserial repetition effects in immediate memory.\nJournal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 7, 446-451.</ref> Furthermore, it had no measurable effect on the recall of the items that followed the repeated items, contradicting the prediction of associative chaining. Positional coding predicts that repeated items will have no effect on recall, since the positions for each item in the list act as independent cues for the items, including the repeated items. That is, there is no difference between the similarity between any two items and repeated items. This, again, is not consistent with the data.\n\nBecause no comprehensive model has been defined for sequence memory to this day, it makes for an interesting area of research.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ebbinghaus2.jpg|thumb|alt=Hermann Ebbinghaus|Hermann Ebbinghaus]]\nEncoding is still relatively new and unexplored but origins of encoding date back to age old philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. A major figure in the history of encoding is [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850\u20131909). Ebbinghaus was a pioneer in the field of memory research. Using himself as a subject he studied how we learn and forget information by repeating a list of [[nonsense syllable]]s to the rhythm of a metronome until they were committed to his memory.<ref name=\"ebbingbook\">Ebbinghaus, H. (1885). Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology.</ref> These experiments lead him to suggest the [[learning curve]].<ref name=\"ebbingbook\"/> He used these relatively meaningless words so that prior associations between meaningful words would not influence learning. He found that lists that allowed associations to be made and semantic meaning was apparent were easier to recall. Ebbinghaus' results paved the way for experimental psychology in memory and other mental processes.\n\nDuring the 1900s further progress in memory research was made. [[Ivan Pavlov]] began research pertaining to [[classical conditioning]]. His research demonstrated the ability to create a semantic relationship between two unrelated items.\nIn 1932 Bartlett proposed the idea of mental [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s. This model proposed that whether new information would be encoded was dependent on its consistency with prior knowledge (mental schemas).<ref name=\" bartlett32\">Bartlett, F. C. (1932). Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.</ref> This model also suggested that information not present at the time of encoding would be added to memory if it was based on schematic knowledge of the world.<ref name=\" bartlett32\"/> In this way, encoding was found to be influenced by prior knowledge. \nWith the advance of [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt theory]] came the realisation that memory for encoded information was often perceived as different from the stimuli that triggered it. It was also influenced by the context that the stimuli were embedded in.\n\nWith advances in technology, the field of neuropsychology emerged and with it a biological basis for theories of encoding. In 1949 [[Donald O. Hebb|Hebb]] looked at the neuroscience aspect of encoding and stated that \"neurons that fire together wire together\" implying that encoding occurred as connections between neurons were established through repeated use. \nThe 1950s and 60's saw a shift to the information processing approach to memory based on the invention of computers, followed by the initial suggestion that encoding was the process by which information is entered into memory. [[George Armitage Miller]] in 1956 wrote his paper on how short-term memory is limited to seven items, plus-or-minus two, called [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]]. This number was appended when studies done on [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]] revealed that seven, plus or minus two could also refer to seven \"packets of information\". \nIn 1974, [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch]] proposed their [[Baddeley's model of working memory|model of working memory]], which consists of the central executive, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and phonological loop as a method of encoding. In 2000, Baddeley added the episodic buffer.<ref name=\"text\"/> Simultaneously [[Endel Tulving]] (1983) proposed the idea of encoding specificity whereby context was again noted as an influence on encoding.\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{memory}}\n{{Mental processes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Encoding (Memory)}}\n[[Category:Memory processes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n[[Memory]] has the ability to '''encode''', [[Storage (memory)|store]] and [[Recall (memory)|recall]] information.

This suggests the decrease in activation with repetition is process specific occurring when words are semantically reprocessed but not when they are nonsemantically reprocessed.<ref name=\"Demb\" /> Lesion and neuroimaging studies suggest that the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] is responsible for initial encoding and that activity in the left lateral prefrontal cortex correlates with the semantic organization of encoded information.<ref name=\"Frey, Stephen, and Michael Petrides. 2002\">Frey, S., & Petrides, M.

Hence the memory of the beginning of a new word is stored in our echoic memory until the whole sound has been perceived and recognized as a word.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson and Heth(2010)|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour 4e|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location=Chapter 8|page=233}}</ref> \nStudies indicate that lexical, semantic and phonological factors interact in verbal working memory.

All perceived and striking sensations travel to the brain's thalamus where all these sensations are combined into one single experience.<ref name=\"mohs\">Mohs, Richard C. \"How Human Memory Works.\"  8 May 2007.  HowStuffWorks.com. <http://health.howstuffworks.com/human-memory.htm>  23 February 2010.</ref> The hippocampus is responsible for analyzing these inputs and ultimately deciding if they will be committed to long-term memory; these various threads of information are stored in various parts of the brain. However, the exact way in which these pieces are identified and recalled later remains unknown.<ref name=\"mohs\"/>\n\nEncoding is achieved using a combination of chemicals and electricity. Neurotransmitters are released when an electrical pulse crosses the synapse which serves as a connection from nerve cells to other cells. The dendrites receive these impulses with their feathery extensions. A phenomenon called [[long-term potentiation]] allows a synapse to increase strength with increasing numbers of transmitted signals between the two neurons. For that to happen, [[NMDA receptor]], which influences the flow of information between neurons by controlling the initiation of long-term potentiation in most hippocampal pathways, need to come to the play. For these NMDA receptors to be activated, there must be two conditions. Firstly, [[glutamate]] has to be released and bound to the NMDA receptor site on postsynaptic neurons. Secondly, excitation has to take place in postsynaptic neurons.<ref>Schacter, D., Gilbert, D. & Wegner, D.(2011) ''Psychology'', 2nd edition, Chapter 6: Memory, p.232</ref> These cells also organise themselves into groups specializing in different kinds of information processing. Thus, with new experiences the brain creates more connections and may 'rewire'. The brain organizes and reorganizes itself in response to one's experiences, creating new memories prompted by experience, education, or training.<ref name=\"mohs\"/> Therefore, the use of a brain reflects how it is organised.<ref name=\"mohs\"/> This ability to re-organize is especially important if ever a part of the brain becomes damaged.  Scientists are unsure of whether the stimuli of what we do not recall are filtered out at the sensory phase or if they are filtered out after the brain examines their significance.<ref name=\"mohs\"/>\n\n===Mapping activity===\n[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) demonstrates a consistent functional anatomical blueprint of hippocampal activation during episodic encoding and retrieval. Activation in the hippocampal region associated with episodic memory encoding has been shown to occur in the rostral portion of the region whereas activation associated with episodic memory retrieval occurs in the caudal portions.<ref name=\"Lepage\">Lepage, M., Habib, R. & Tulving.

Encoding begins with any novel situation, as the [[brain]] will interact and draw conclusions from the results of this interaction. These learning experiences have been known to trigger a cascade of molecular events leading to the formation of memories.<ref name=\"wagner\">Wagner, M. (2008).

However, encoding can occur on different levels. The first step is [[short-term memory]] formation, followed by the conversion to a [[long-term memory]], and then a long-term memory consolidation process.<ref name=\"kandel\">Kandel, E. (2004). The Molecular Biology of Memory Storage: A Dialog Between Genes and Synapses. Bioscience Reports, 24, 4-5.</ref>\n\n===Synaptic plasticity===\n[[Synaptic plasticity]] is the ability of the [[brain]] to strengthen, weaken, destroy and create neural synapses and is the basis for learning. These molecular distinctions will identify and indicate the strength of each neural connection. The effect of a learning experience depends on the content of such an experience. Reactions that are favoured will be reinforced and those that are deemed unfavourable will be weakened. This shows that the synaptic modifications that occur can operate either way, in order to be able to make changes over time depending on the current situation of the organism. In the short term, synaptic changes may include the strengthening or weakening of a connection by modifying the preexisting proteins leading to a modification in synapse connection strength. In the long term, entirely new connections may form or the number of synapses at a connection may be increased, or reduced.<ref name=\"kandel\"/>\n\n===The encoding process===\nA significant short-term biochemical change is the covalent modification of pre-existing proteins in order to modify synaptic connections that are already active. This allows data to be conveyed in the short term, without consolidating anything for permanent storage. From here a memory or an association may be chosen to become a long-term memory, or forgotten as the synaptic connections eventually weaken. The switch from short to long-term is the same concerning both [[implicit memory]] and [[explicit memory]]. This process is regulated by a number of inhibitory constraints, primarily the balance between protein [[phosphorylation]] and [[dephosphorylation]].<ref name=\"kandel\"/> Finally, long term changes occur that allow consolidation of the target memory. These changes include new protein synthesis, the formation of new synaptic connections and finally the activation of [[gene expression]] in accordance with the new neural configuration.<ref>Sacktor, T.C. (2008). PKMz, LTP Maintenance, and the dynamic molecular biology of memory storage. Progress in Brain Research, 169, Ch 2.</ref> \nThe encoding process has been found to be partially mediated by serotonergic interneurons, specifically in regard to sensitization as blocking these interneurons prevented sensitization entirely. However, the ultimate consequences of these discoveries have yet to be identified. \nFurthermore, the learning process has been known to recruit a variety of modulatory transmitters in order to create and consolidate memories. These transmitters cause the nucleus to initiate processes required for neuronal growth and long term memory, mark specific synapses for the capture of long-term processes, regulate local protein synthesis and even appear to mediate attentional processes required for the formation and recall of memories.\n\n===Encoding and genetics===\nHuman memory, including the process of encoding, is known to be a [[heritable trait]] that is controlled by more than one gene. In fact, twin studies suggest that genetic differences are responsible for as much as 50% of the variance seen in memory tasks.<ref name=\"wagner\"/>\nProteins identified in animal studies have been linked directly to a molecular cascade of reactions leading to memory formation, and a sizeable number of these proteins are encoded by genes that are expressed in humans as well. In fact, variations within these genes appear to be associated with memory capacity and have been identified in recent human genetic studies.<ref name=\"wagner\"/>\n\n==Complementary processes==\nThe idea that the brain is separated into two complementary processing networks ([[default network|task positive]] and [[default network|task negative]]) has recently become an area of increasing interest.{{Vague|date=August 2010}} The task positive network deals with externally oriented processing whereas the task negative network deals with internally oriented processing. Research indicates that these networks are not exclusive and some tasks overlap in their activation. A study done in 2009 shows encoding success and novelty detection activity within the task-positive network have significant overlap and have thus been concluded to reflect common association of externally oriented processing.<ref name=\"cab\">Cabeza, R., Daselaar, S.M., &  Hongkeun, K. (2009). Overlapping brain activity between episodic memory encoding and retrieval: Roles of the task-positive and task-negative networks. Neuroimage;49: 1145\u20131154.</ref> It also demonstrates how encoding failure and retrieval success share significant overlap within the task negative network indicating common association of internally oriented processing.<ref name=\"cab\"/> Finally, a low level of overlap between encoding success and retrieval success activity and between encoding failure and novelty detection activity respectively indicate opposing modes or processing.<ref name=\"cab\"/> In sum task positive and task negative networks can have common associations during the performance of different tasks.\n\n==Depth of processing==\nDifferent levels of processing influence how well information is remembered. These levels of processing can be illustrated by maintenance and elaborate rehearsal.\n\n===Maintenance and elaborative rehearsal===\n''Maintenance rehearsal'' is a shallow form of processing information which involves focusing on an object without thought to its meaning or its association with other objects. For example, the repetition of a series of numbers is a form of maintenance rehearsal. In contrast, ''elaborative or relational rehearsal'' is a process in which you relate new material to information already stored in Long-term memory. It's a deep form of processing information and involves thought of the object's meaning as well as making connections between the object, past experiences and the other objects of focus. Using the example of numbers, one might associate them with dates that are personally significant such as your parents' birthdays (past experiences) or perhaps you might see a pattern in the numbers that helps you to remember them.<ref name=\"1973 craik\">Craik, F. I. M., & Watkins, M. J. (1973). The role of rehearsal in short-term memory. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior'', '''12''' (6), 599\u2013607.</ref>\n[[File:US penny 2003.jpg|thumb|alt=|American Penny]]\nDue to the deeper level of processing that occurs with elaborative rehearsal it is more effective than maintenance rehearsal in creating new memories.<ref name=\" 1973 craik\"/> This has been demonstrated in people's lack of knowledge of the details in everyday objects. For example, in one study where Americans were asked about the orientation of the face on their country's penny few recalled this with any degree of certainty. Despite the fact that it is a detail that is often seen, it is not remembered as there is no need to because the color discriminates the penny from other coins.<ref>Nickerson, R. S. (., & Adams, M. J. (1979). Long-term memory for a common object. Cognitive Psychology, 11(3, pp. 287-307)</ref> The ineffectiveness of maintenance rehearsal, simply being repeatedly exposed to an item, in creating memories has also been found in people's  lack of memory for the layout of the digits 0-9 on calculators and telephones.<ref>Rinck, M. (1999). Memory for everyday objects: Where are the digits on numerical keypads? Applied Cognitive Psychology, 13(4), 329-350.</ref>\n\nMaintenance rehearsal has been demonstrated to be important in learning but its effects can only be demonstrated using indirect methods such as [[lexical decision task]]s,<ref>Oliphant, G. W. (1983). Repetition and recency effects in word recognition. Australian Journal of Psychology, 35(3), 393-403</ref> and word stem completion<ref>Graf, P., Mandler, G., & Haden, P. E. (1982). Simulating amnesic symptoms in normal subjects. Science, 218(4578), 1243\u20131244.</ref> which are used to assess implicit learning. In general, however previous learning by maintenance rehearsal is not apparent when memory is being tested directly or explicitly with questions like \" Is this the word you were shown earlier?\"\n\n===Intention to learn===\n\nStudies have shown that the intention to learn has no direct effect on memory encoding. Instead, memory encoding is dependent on how deeply each item is encoded, which could be affected by intention to learn, but not exclusively. That is, intention to learn can lead to more effective learning strategies, and consequently, better memory encoding, but if you learn something incidentally (i.e. without intention to learn) but still process and learn the information effectively, it will get encoded just as well as something learnt with intention.<ref>Hyde, Thomas S.  & Jenkins, James J. (1973). Recall for words as a function of semantic, graphic, and syntactic orienting tasks. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 12(5), 471-480</ref>\n\nThe effects of elaborative rehearsal or deep processing can be attributed to the number of connections made while encoding that increase the number of pathways available for retrieval.<ref>Craik, F. I., & Tulving, E. (1975). Depth of processing and the retention of words in episodic memory. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 104(3), 268-294.</ref>\n\n==Optimal encoding==\n\n=== Organization ===\nOrganization can be seen as the key to better memory. The section about depth of processing demonstrated the significant effect that levels of processing has on encoding. Researchers have discovered that our minds naturally organize information if the information received is not organized.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schunk, Dale H.|title=Learning theories : an educational perspective|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-13-707195-1|edition=6th|location=Boston|oclc=688559444}}</ref> Levels of processing are also related to the organization of information. For example, the connections that are made between the to-be-remembered item, other to-be-remembered items, previous experiences and context generate retrieval paths for the to-be-remembered item. These connections impose organization on the to-be-remembered item, making it more memorable.<ref>Katona, G. (1940). Organizing and memorizing. New York, NY, US: Columbia University Press.</ref> Researchers have discovered that our minds naturally organize information if the information received is not organized.<ref name=\":3\" /> One way information can be organized is through hierarchies.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, the grouping mammals, reptiles, and amphibians is a hierarchy of the animal kingdom. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Schunk, Dale H.|title=Learning theories : an educational perspective|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-13-707195-1|edition=6th|location=Boston|oclc=688559444}}</ref>\n\n===Mnemonics===\n{{main|Mnemonics}}\n[[File:Rainbow-diagram-ROYGBIV.svg|thumb|alt= Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet|The mnemonic \"Roy G. Biv\" can be used to remember the colors of the rainbow]]\n\nFor simple material such as lists of words, mnemonics are the best strategy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Mnemonic Strategies are an example of how finding organization within a set of items helps these items to be remembered. In the absence of any apparent organization within  a group organization can be imposed with the same memory enhancing results. An example of a mnemonic strategy that imposes organization is the ''[[Mnemonic peg system|peg-word system]]'' which associates the to-be-remembered items with a list of easily remembered items. Another example of a mnemonic device commonly used is the first letter of every word system or [[acronyms]]. When learning the colours in a [[rainbow]] most students learn the first letter of every colour and impose their own meaning by associating it with a name such as Roy. G. Biv which stands for red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. In this way mnemonic devices not only help the encoding of specific items but also their sequence. For more complex concepts, understanding is the key to remembering. In a study done by Wiseman and Neisser in 1974 they presented participants with a picture (the picture was of a Dalmatian in the style of [[pointillism]] making it difficult to see the image).<ref>Wiseman, S., & Neisser, U. (1974). Perceptual organization as a determinant of visual recognition memory. American Journal of Psychology, 87(4), 675-681.</ref> They found that memory for the picture was better if the participants understood what was depicted.\n\n===Chunking===\nAnother way understanding may aid memory is by reducing the amount that has to be remembered via [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]. Chunking is the process of organizing objects into meaningful wholes. These wholes are then remembered as a unit rather than separate objects. Words are an example of chunking, where instead of simply perceiving letters we perceive and remember their meaningful wholes: words. The use of chunking increases the number of items we are able to remember by creating meaningful \"packets\" in which many related items are stored as one.\n\n===State-dependent learning===\nFor optimal encoding, connections are not only formed between the items themselves and past experiences, but also between the internal state or mood of the encoder and the situation they are in. The connections that are formed between the encoders internal state or the situation and the items to be remembered are State-dependent. In a 1975 study by Godden and Baddeley the effects of State-dependent learning were shown. They asked deep sea divers to learn various materials while either under water or on the side of the pool. They found that those who were tested in the same condition that they had learned the information in were better able to recall that information, i.e. those who learned the material under water did better when tested on that material under water than when tested on land. Context had become associated with the material they were trying to recall and therefore was serving as a retrieval cue.<ref>Godden, D. R., & Baddeley, A. D. (1975). Context-dependent memory in two natural environments: On land and underwater. British Journal of Psychology, 66(3), 325-331.</ref> Results similar to these have also been found when certain smells are present at encoding.<ref>Cann, A., & Ross, D. A. (1989). Olfactory stimuli as context cues in human memory. American Journal of Psychology, 102(1), 91-102.</ref>\n\nHowever, although the external environment is important at the time of encoding in creating multiple pathways for retrieval, other studies have shown that simply creating the same internal state that you had at the time of encoding is sufficient to serve as a retrieval cue.<ref>Smith, S. M. (1979). Remembering in and out of context. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 5(5), 460-471.</ref> Therefore, putting yourself in the same mindset that you were in at the time of encoding will help recall in the same way that being in the same situation helps recall. This effect called context reinstatement was demonstrated by Fisher and Craik 1977 when they matched retrieval cues with the way information was memorized.<ref>Fisher, R. P., & Craik, F. I. (1977). Interaction between encoding and retrieval operations in cued recall. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 3(6), 701-711.</ref>\n\n===Encoding specificity===\n[[File:Facevase.png|thumb|alt=An ambiguous figure which can be perceived as either a vase or a pair of faces. |Vase or faces?]]\n\nThe context of learning shapes how information is encoded.<ref>Tulving, E. (1983). Elements of episodic memory. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.</ref> For instance,  Kanizsa in 1979 showed a picture that could be interpreted as either a white vase on a black background or 2 faces facing each other on a white background.<ref name=\"kanizsa1979\">Kanizsa, G. (1979). Organization in vision. New York: Praeger.</ref> The participants were primed to see the vase. Later they were shown the picture again but this time they were primed to see the black faces on the white background. Although this was the same picture as they had seen before, when asked if they had seen this picture before, they said no. The reason for this was that they had been primed to see the vase the first time the picture was presented, and  it was therefore unrecognizable the second time as two faces. This demonstrates that the stimulus is understood within the context it is learned in as well the general rule that what really constitutes good learning are tests that test what has been learned in the same way that it was learned.<ref name=\"kanizsa1979\" /> Therefore, to truly be efficient at remembering information, one must consider the demands that future recall will place on this information and study in a way that will match those demands.\n\n=== Generation Effect ===\n''Main Article:'' [[Generation effect]]\n\nAnother principle that may have the potential to aid encoding is the generation effect. The generation effect implies that learning is enhanced when individuals generate information or items themselves rather than reading the content.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=McDaniel|first=Mark A|last2=Waddill|first2=Paula J|last3=Einstein|first3=Gilles O|date=1988|title=A contextual account of the generation effect: A three-factor theory|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=27|issue=5|pages=521\u2013536|doi=10.1016/0749-596x(88)90023-x|issn=0749-596X}}</ref> The key to properly apply the generation effect is to actively supply information rather than passively select an answer to a multiple choice question.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Peter C.|title=Make It Stick|last2=Roediger|first2=Henry L.|last3=McDaniel|first3=Mark A.|date=2014-01-31|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-41937-7|location=Cambridge, MA and London, England|doi=10.4159/9780674419377}}</ref> In 1978, researchers Norman Slameka and Peter Graf conducted an experiment to better understand this effect.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Goldstein, E.

Different models have been developed for different memory tasks, which include item recognition, cued recall, free recall, and sequence memory, in an attempt to accurately explain experimentally observed behaviors.\n\n===Item recognition===\nIn item recognition, one is asked whether or not a given probe item has been seen before. It is important to note that the recognition of an item can include context. That is, one can be asked whether an item has been seen in a study list. So even though one may have seen the word \"apple\" sometime during their life, if it was not on the study list, it should not be recalled.\n\nItem recognition can be modeled using [[Multiple trace theory]] and the attribute-similarity model.<ref>Hintzman, Douglas L. & Block, Richard A. (1971) Repetition and memory: Evidence for a multiple-trace hypothesis. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 88(3), 297-306.</ref> In brief, every item that one sees can be represented as a vector of the item's attributes, which is extended by a vector representing the context at the time of encoding, and is stored in a memory matrix of all items ever seen. When a probe item is presented, the sum of the similarities to each item in the matrix (which is inversely proportional to the sum of the distances between the probe vector and each item in the memory matrix) is computed. If the similarity is above a threshold value, one would respond, \"Yes, I recognize that item.\" Given that context continually drifts by nature of a [[random walk]], more recently seen items, which each share a similar context vector to the context vector at the time of the recognition task, are more likely to be recognized than items seen longer ago.\n\n===Cued recall===\nIn [[Recall (memory)#Cued recall|cued recall]], one is asked to recall the item that was paired with a given probe item. For example, one can be given a list of name-face pairs, and later be asked to recall the associated name given a face.\n\nCued recall can be explained by extending the attribute-similarity model used for item recognition. Because in cued recall, a wrong response can be given for a probe item, the model has to be extended accordingly to account for that. This can be achieved by adding noise to the item vectors when they are stored in the memory matrix. Furthermore, cued recall can be modeled in a probabilistic manner such that for every item stored in the memory matrix, the more similar it is to the probe item, the more likely it is to be recalled. Because the items in the memory matrix contain noise in their values, this model can account for incorrect recalls, such as mistakenly calling a person by the wrong name.\n\n===Free recall===\nIn [[free recall]], one is allowed to recall items that were learned in any order. For example, you could be asked to name as many countries in Europe as you can. Free recall can be modeled using [[Semantic memory#Search of Associative Memory .28SAM.29|SAM]] (Search of Associative Memory) which is based on the dual-store model, first proposed by [[Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin memory model|Atkinson and Shiffrin]] in 1968.<ref>Raaijmakers, J. G. W., Schiffrin, R. M. (1981). Search of associative memory. Psychological Review, 8(2), 98-134</ref> SAM consists of two main components: [[Short-term memory|short-term store]] (STS) and [[Long-term memory|long-term store]] (LTS). In brief, when an item is seen, it is pushed into STS where it resides with other items also in STS, until it displaced and put into LTS. The longer the item has been in STS, the more likely it is to be displaced by a new item. When items co-reside in STS, the links between those items are strengthened. Furthermore, SAM assumes that items in STS are always available for immediate recall.\n\nSAM explains both primacy and recency effects. Probabilistically, items at the beginning of the list are more likely to remain in STS, and thus have more opportunities to strengthen their links to other items. As a result, items at the beginning of the list are made more likely to be recalled in a free-recall task (primacy effect). Because of the assumption that items in STS are always available for immediate recall, given that there were no significant distractors between learning and recall, items at the end of the list can be recalled excellently (recency effect).\n\nIncidentally, the idea of STS and LTS was motivated by the architecture of computers, which contain short-term and long-term storage.\n\n===Sequence memory===\n[[Recall (memory)#Serial recall|Sequence memory]] is responsible for how we remember lists of things, in which ordering matters. For example, telephone numbers are an ordered list of one digit numbers. There are currently two main computational memory models that can be applied to sequence encoding: associative chaining and positional coding.\n\nAssociative chaining theory states that every item in a list is linked to its forward and backward neighbors, with forward links being stronger than backward links, and links to closer neighbors being stronger than links to farther neighbors. For example, associative chaining predicts the tendencies of transposition errors, which occur most often with items in nearby positions. An example of a transposition error would be recalling the sequence \"apple, orange, banana\" instead of \"apple, banana, orange.\"\n\nPositional coding theory suggests that every item in a list is associated to its position in the list. For example, if the list is \"apple, banana, orange, mango\" apple will be associated to list position 1, banana to 2, orange to 3, and mango to 4. Furthermore, each item is also, albeit more weakly, associated to its index +/- 1, even more weakly to +/- 2, and so forth. So banana is associated not only to its actual index 2, but also to 1, 3, and 4, with varying degrees of strength. For example, positional coding can be used to explain the effects of recency and primacy. Because items at the beginning and end of a list have fewer close neighbors compared to items in the middle of the list, they have less competition for correct recall.\n\nAlthough the models of associative chaining and positional coding are able to explain a great amount of behavior seen for sequence memory, they are far from perfect. For example, neither chaining nor positional coding is able to properly illustrate the details of the [[Ranschburg effect]], which reports that sequences of items that contain repeated items are harder to reproduce than sequences of unrepeated items. Associative chaining predicts that recall of lists containing repeated items is impaired because recall of any repeated item would cue not only its true successor but also the successors of all other instances of the item. However, experimental data have shown that spaced repetition of items resulted in impaired recall of the second occurrence of the repeated item.<ref>Crowder, R. G. (1968). Intraserial repetition effects in immediate memory.\nJournal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 7, 446-451.</ref> Furthermore, it had no measurable effect on the recall of the items that followed the repeated items, contradicting the prediction of associative chaining. Positional coding predicts that repeated items will have no effect on recall, since the positions for each item in the list act as independent cues for the items, including the repeated items. That is, there is no difference between the similarity between any two items and repeated items. This, again, is not consistent with the data.\n\nBecause no comprehensive model has been defined for sequence memory to this day, it makes for an interesting area of research.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ebbinghaus2.jpg|thumb|alt=Hermann Ebbinghaus|Hermann Ebbinghaus]]\nEncoding is still relatively new and unexplored but origins of encoding date back to age old philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. A major figure in the history of encoding is [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850\u20131909). Ebbinghaus was a pioneer in the field of memory research. Using himself as a subject he studied how we learn and forget information by repeating a list of [[nonsense syllable]]s to the rhythm of a metronome until they were committed to his memory.<ref name=\"ebbingbook\">Ebbinghaus, H. (1885). Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology.</ref> These experiments lead him to suggest the [[learning curve]].<ref name=\"ebbingbook\"/> He used these relatively meaningless words so that prior associations between meaningful words would not influence learning. He found that lists that allowed associations to be made and semantic meaning was apparent were easier to recall. Ebbinghaus' results paved the way for experimental psychology in memory and other mental processes.\n\nDuring the 1900s further progress in memory research was made. [[Ivan Pavlov]] began research pertaining to [[classical conditioning]]. His research demonstrated the ability to create a semantic relationship between two unrelated items.\nIn 1932 Bartlett proposed the idea of mental [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s. This model proposed that whether new information would be encoded was dependent on its consistency with prior knowledge (mental schemas).<ref name=\" bartlett32\">Bartlett, F. C. (1932). Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.</ref> This model also suggested that information not present at the time of encoding would be added to memory if it was based on schematic knowledge of the world.<ref name=\" bartlett32\"/> In this way, encoding was found to be influenced by prior knowledge. \nWith the advance of [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt theory]] came the realisation that memory for encoded information was often perceived as different from the stimuli that triggered it. It was also influenced by the context that the stimuli were embedded in.\n\nWith advances in technology, the field of neuropsychology emerged and with it a biological basis for theories of encoding. In 1949 [[Donald O. Hebb|Hebb]] looked at the neuroscience aspect of encoding and stated that \"neurons that fire together wire together\" implying that encoding occurred as connections between neurons were established through repeated use. \nThe 1950s and 60's saw a shift to the information processing approach to memory based on the invention of computers, followed by the initial suggestion that encoding was the process by which information is entered into memory. [[George Armitage Miller]] in 1956 wrote his paper on how short-term memory is limited to seven items, plus-or-minus two, called [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]]. This number was appended when studies done on [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]] revealed that seven, plus or minus two could also refer to seven \"packets of information\". \nIn 1974, [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch]] proposed their [[Baddeley's model of working memory|model of working memory]], which consists of the central executive, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and phonological loop as a method of encoding. In 2000, Baddeley added the episodic buffer.<ref name=\"text\"/> Simultaneously [[Endel Tulving]] (1983) proposed the idea of encoding specificity whereby context was again noted as an influence on encoding.\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{memory}}\n{{Mental processes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Encoding (Memory)}}\n[[Category:Memory processes]]\n", "name_user": "HadleyJoAnn", "label": "safe", "comment": "I fixed a few grammatical errors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding_(memory)"}

It took riders through animated scenes of a comical factory producing fizzy pop. The ride was designed and built by the [[Keith Sparks|Sparks Group]] for attraction producer [[John Wardley]]. The original ride closed, to be redesigned in 2006 with a sponsorship by [[Imperial Leather]] toiletries, with the majority of the animations removed. The new Bubbleworks then itself closed in September 2016 and was then replaced by ''[[The Gruffalo River Ride Adventure]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prof. Burp's BubbleWorks===\n[[File:BubbleWorks_original_station.png|thumb|left|270px|Prof. Burp's Bubble Works station under its original lighting and scenic design 1990\u20132005.]]\nThe ride was created as part of the second phase to regenerate [[Chessington Zoo]] into a popular theme park.<ref name=\"johnwardley\"/> The Transylvania area in [[Chessington World of Adventures]] was created in 1990,<ref name=\"themeukhistory\"/> opening with the [[Vampire (roller coaster)|Vampire]] and Prof. Burp's Bubble Works as its main attractions.\n\nPark development director for Tussauds, [[John Wardley]], developed the concept of a magical factory following the making of Professor Burp's fizzy pop from juicing to bottling.<ref name=\"johnwardley\"/> He collaborated with cartoon company Siriol Animation to create the characters and scenes. Keith Sparks' production company designed and built the attraction.<ref name=\"darkridesdocumentary\"/><ref name=\"johnwardley\"/> The musical soundtrack was produced by Welsh composer Graham Smart, consisting of a 13-track score that played in synchronisation throughout the ride.<ref name=\"darkridesdocumentary\"/> The iconic tunnel fountains in the finale of the ride were developed by the Sparks Group and were unique to the Bubbleworks at the time.\n\nThe dark ride went on to be highly successful for the park and was, in its first seasons years, voted third best dark ride in the world by the [[National Amusement Park Historical Association]].<ref name=\"johnwardley\"/> It spawned many similar water dark rides around Europe. Following the BubbleWorks, Keith Sparks and John Wardley teamed up again to produce ''[[Duel (ride)|The Haunted House]]'' at Alton Towers in 1992.<ref name=\"johnwardley\"/> John Wardley later reflected on the attraction as being his \"proudest moment at Chessington\".<ref name=\"Wardley Q&A\"/>\n\nThe ride also made use of themed merchandising, something which has since become commonplace in UK theme parks. Riders had the option to exit into a gift shop, originally selling BubbleWorks souvenirs, including Professor Burp-branded fizzy pop drinks, figurines of the Bubblehead characters, cassette tapes of the ride music, novelty Professor Burp hats and postcards.<ref name=\"darkridesdocumentary\"/> In later years, the ride's exit path was permanently routed through the gift shop. It had a famous saying- Juice + Gas = POP! which is what Professor Burp would always say in his office at the start of the ride!!!\n\n===2006 Refurbishment===\n[[File:Bubbleworks Exterior.JPG|thumb|right|Exterior of the Imperial Leather Bubbleworks, as it appeared following the attraction's redesign in 2006.]]\nProf. Burp's BubbleWorks operated for fifteen years, before being replaced a new sponsored version by Tussauds Studios at the end of 2005, without the involvement of the ride's original design team. The ride's theme was changed to a soap factory to suit sponsor [[PZ Cussons|Imperial Leather]]. Several of the sets and props were recycled, extensively modified and repainted by Tussauds.

It took riders through animated scenes of a comical factory producing fizzy pop. The ride was designed and built by the [[Keith Sparks|Sparks Group]] for attraction producer [[John Wardley]]. The original ride closed, to be redesigned in 2006 with a sponsorship by [[Imperial Leather]] toiletries, with the majority of the animations removed. The new Bubbleworks then itself closed in September 2016 and was then replaced by ''[[The Gruffalo River Ride Adventure]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prof. Burp's BubbleWorks===\n[[File:BubbleWorks_original_station.png|thumb|left|270px|Prof. Burp's Bubble Works station under its original lighting and scenic design 1990\u20132005.]]\nThe ride was created as part of the second phase to regenerate [[Chessington Zoo]] into a popular theme park.<ref name=\"johnwardley\"/> The Transylvania area in [[Chessington World of Adventures]] was created in 1990,<ref name=\"themeukhistory\"/> opening with the [[Vampire (roller coaster)|Vampire]] and Prof. Burp's Bubble Works as its main attractions.\n\nPark development director for Tussauds, [[John Wardley]], developed the concept of a magical factory following the making of Professor Burp's fizzy pop from juicing to bottling.<ref name=\"johnwardley\"/> He collaborated with cartoon company Siriol Animation to create the characters and scenes. Keith Sparks' production company designed and built the attraction.<ref name=\"darkridesdocumentary\"/><ref name=\"johnwardley\"/> The musical soundtrack was produced by Welsh composer Graham Smart, consisting of a 13-track score that played in synchronisation throughout the ride.<ref name=\"darkridesdocumentary\"/> The iconic tunnel fountains in the finale of the ride were developed by the Sparks Group and were unique to the Bubbleworks at the time.\n\nThe dark ride went on to be highly successful for the park and was, in its first seasons years, voted third best dark ride in the world by the [[National Amusement Park Historical Association]].<ref name=\"johnwardley\"/> It spawned many similar water dark rides around Europe. Following the BubbleWorks, Keith Sparks and John Wardley teamed up again to produce ''[[Duel (ride)|The Haunted House]]'' at Alton Towers in 1992.<ref name=\"johnwardley\"/> John Wardley later reflected on the attraction as being his \"proudest moment at Chessington\".<ref name=\"Wardley Q&A\"/>\n\nThe ride also made use of themed merchandising, something which has since become commonplace in UK theme parks. Riders had the option to exit into a gift shop, originally selling BubbleWorks souvenirs, including Professor Burp-branded fizzy pop drinks, figurines of the Bubblehead characters, cassette tapes of the ride music, novelty Professor Burp hats and postcards.<ref name=\"darkridesdocumentary\"/> In later years, the ride's exit path was permanently routed through the gift shop.\n\n===2006 Refurbishment===\n[[File:Bubbleworks Exterior.JPG|thumb|right|Exterior of the Imperial Leather Bubbleworks, as it appeared following the attraction's redesign in 2006.]]\nProf. Burp's BubbleWorks operated for fifteen years, before being replaced a new sponsored version by Tussauds Studios at the end of 2005, without the involvement of the ride's original design team. The ride's theme was changed to a soap factory to suit sponsor [[PZ Cussons|Imperial Leather]]. Several of the sets and props were recycled, extensively modified and repainted by Tussauds. Additionally, almost all the animations were removed or made static.\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"The Bubble Works, I think probably that was one of the happiest experiences I had.
