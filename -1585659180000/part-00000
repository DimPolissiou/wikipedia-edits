In the same victory against the Browns, the Jets became the first team in NFL history to win back-to-back road games in overtime. The Jets were the last NFL team to be undefeated on the road, before suffering a 45\u20133 loss at the [[New England Patriots]] in Week 13. The Jets met the Patriots again five weeks later in the AFC Divisional Round back in Foxborough where New York upset New England 28\u201321. The following week, the Jets lost 24\u201319 against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship, ending their hopes of returning to the Super Bowl for the first time in [[1968 New York Jets season|43 years]] and ending what would've been a [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella run]]. The Jets would've also been the first AFC East team other than the Patriots to make a Super Bowl for the first time since [[Super Bowl XXVIII|1994]] and they also failed to join the [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2005 Steelers]], [[2007 New York Giants season|2007 New York Giants]], and [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|2010 Green Bay Packers]] as the only NFL teams to win at least 3 straight playoff games on the road.\n\n{{As of|2018|06|alt=As of the [[2019 New York Jets season|2019 season]]}}, this remains the last time the New York Jets qualified for the postseason, and the last time until [[2016 NFL season|2016]] an AFC East team other than the Patriots made the playoffs.\n\n==Offseason==\n\n===Acquisitions===\n*WR [[Larry Taylor (gridiron football)|Larry Taylor]], P [[T.

The play was controversially upheld, despite the fact that the receiver appeared to be down by contact.  With no challenges left, [[Mark Sanchez]] threw a ball to [[Dustin Keller]] that was ripped out of his hands and ruled an interception in the 4th quarter. The replay showed that Keller made the catch and was also down before losing possession, but with no challenges left the Jets were left with nothing.

The play was controversially upheld, despite the fact that the receiver appeared to be down by contact.  With no challenges left, [[Mark Sanchez]] threw a ball to [[Dustin Keller]] that was ripped out of his hands and ruled an interception in the 4th quarter. The replay showed that Keller made the catch and was also down before losing possession, but with no challenges left the Jets were left with nothing.
