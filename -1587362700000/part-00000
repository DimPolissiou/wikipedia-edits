For example, Higobashi Station on the Yotsubashi Line is also known as Y12. This combination is heard in bilingual Japanese-English automated next-station announcements on board all trains, which also provide information on local businesses near the station.

A proposal to [[corporatization|corporatize]] the Osaka subway was sent to the city government in February 2013 and was given final approval in 2017. The rationale behind corporatization is that it would bring private investors to Osaka and could help revive Osaka's economy.

(News outlets have been seen to use \u5927\u962a\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed, presumably to better flow with article text.) Individual lines are represented by a public-facing name (e.g. \u201cMid\u014dsuji Line\u201d for Line No. 1) and a specific color, as well as a single Latin letter, which is paired with a different number at each station for easy identification (see below). Icons for each line (featured in station wayfinding signage) are represented by a solid [[roundel]] in the line color, superimposed with the line's letter-designation in [[Parisine]].\n\n[[File:OMTB_logomark.svg|left|thumb|150px|''Mio-Den'']]\n\nAn older branding (also used on the [[tram]] network run by the city until 1969) is the \"Mio-Den\" mark, which depicts an old-fashioned {{nihongo|depth-marker, [[File:Emblem_of_Osaka,_Osaka.svg|16px]]|\u6faa\u6a19|mio-tsukushi}}, the logo for [[Osaka]] City, over the [[kanji]] for {{nihongo|electricity|\u96fb|den}}, short for {{nihongo|\u201celectric train\u201d|\u96fb\u8eca|densha}}. This mark is still present on newer trainsets and staff uniforms as a connection to the subway network's roots.\n\n[[File:Osaka Metro former logo.svg|left|thumb|150px|''Maruko'']]\n\nWhen it was run by the [[Osaka Municipal Transportation Bureau]], the subway used a logo known as the {{nihongo|\u201cCircle-Ko\u201d|\u30de\u30eb\u30b3|Maru-Ko}} symbol, which is a katakana {{nihongo|\u201cko\u201d|\u30b3}} for {{nihongo|\u201ctransport\u201d|\u4ea4\u901a|k\u014dts\u016b}} superimposed over a circular capital \u201cO\u201d for \u201cOsaka\u201d (see infobox, above).

The lone exception is the [[Sakaisuji Line]], which operates through trains to existing [[Hankyu Railway]] lines and is the only line to operate through services to existing railway lines that are not isolated from the [[suburban rail|national rail network]] (which is the case with the Mid\u014dsuji and Ch\u016b\u014d Lines).\n\nNearly all stations have a [[letter number combination]], the letter identifying the line served by the station and the number indicating the relative location of the station on the line. For example, Higobashi Station on the Yotsubashi Line is also known as Y12. This combination is heard in bilingual Japanese-English automated next-station announcements on board all trains, which also provide information on local businesses near the station.

(News outlets have been seen to use \u5927\u962a\u30e1\u30c8\u30ed, presumably to better flow with article text.) Individual lines are represented by a public-facing name (e.g. \u201cMid\u014dsuji Line\u201d for Line No. 1) and a specific color, as well as a single Latin letter, which is paired with a different number at each station for easy identification (see below). Icons for each line (featured in station wayfinding signage) are represented by a solid [[roundel]] in the line color, superimposed with the line's letter-designation in [[Parisine]].\n\n[[File:OMTB_logomark.svg|left|thumb|150px|''Mio-Den'']]\n\nAn older branding (also used on the [[tram]] network run by the city until 1969) is the \"Mio-Den\" mark, which depicts an old-fashioned {{nihongo|depth-marker, [[File:Emblem_of_Osaka,_Osaka.svg|16px]]|\u6faa\u6a19|mio-tsukushi}}, the logo for [[Osaka]] City, over the [[kanji]] for {{nihongo|electricity|\u96fb|den}}, short for {{nihongo|\u201celectric train\u201d|\u96fb\u8eca|densha}}. This mark is still present on newer trainsets and staff uniforms as a connection to the subway network's roots.\n\n[[File:Osaka_Metro_Logo.svg|left|thumb|150px|''Maruko'']]\n\nWhen it was run by the [[Osaka Municipal Transportation Bureau]], the subway used a logo known as the {{nihongo|\u201cCircle-Ko\u201d|\u30de\u30eb\u30b3|Maru-Ko}} symbol, which is a katakana {{nihongo|\u201cko\u201d|\u30b3}} for {{nihongo|\u201ctransport\u201d|\u4ea4\u901a|k\u014dts\u016b}} superimposed over a circular capital \u201cO\u201d for \u201cOsaka\u201d (see infobox, above).

Provisions were put in place for such an extension when the existing road tunnel between Cosmosquare and Yume-shima was built, but the current state of the artificial island (with only industrial facilities and a lone convenience store for workers) meant it would have been unlikely to proceed had Osaka lost its bid.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Its main islands include [[Tablas Island|Tablas]], the largest, which covers nine municipalities, [[Sibuyan Island|Sibuyan]] with its three towns, as well as the smaller island municipalities of [[Corcuera, Romblon|Corcuera]], [[Banton, Romblon|Banton]], [[Concepcion, Romblon|Concepcion]], [[San Jose, Romblon|San Jose]], and [[Romblon, Romblon|Romblon]], the provincial capital. The province lies south of [[Marinduque]] and [[Quezon]], east of [[Oriental Mindoro]], north of [[Aklan Province|Aklan]] and [[Capiz Province|Capiz]], and west of [[Masbate]]. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a total population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}}.{{PH census|current|04B}}\n\nRomblon has been inhabited by aboriginal Filipinos prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1569. Archaeological artifacts recovered by the [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] in 1936 indicate that the aborigines of Romblon already have a rich and advanced culture. Under Spanish colonial rule, Romblon was initially administered under the newly established province of [[Iloilo|Arevalo]], until 1716, when it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the newly created province of [[Capiz]]. With arrival of the Americans in 1901, Romblon was declared a province and placed under civilian rule. It lost its provincial status for a short while between 1907 and 1945, but regained it in 1946, just after [[World War II]].\n\nThe inhabitants of Romblon are divided into three ethnolinguistic groups: [[Romblomanon language|Romblomanon]], [[Onhan language|Onhan]] and [[Asi language|Asi]]. These groups occupy specific islands in the province and have their own language and customs. Romblomanon is mainly spoken in the town of Romblon, in all of three towns of Sibuyan Island, and the town of [[San Agustin, Romblon|San Agustin]] in Tablas Island. Onhan is mainly spoken in the municipalities in the southern part of Tablas Island ([[Alcantara, Romblon|Alcantara]], [[Looc, Romblon|Looc]], [[Ferrol, Romblon|Ferrol]], [[Santa Fe, Romblon|Santa Fe]], [[San Andres, Romblon|San Andres]], and [[Santa Maria, Romblon|Santa Maria]]) as well as in the island municipality of San Jose. The northwestern part of Tablas Island (in [[Odiongan, Romblon|Odiongan]] and [[Calatrava, Romblon|Calatrava]], as well as the islands municipalities of Corcuera, Banton, and Concepcion, speak the Asi language.\n\nCurrently, the province relies on [[agriculture]], particularly [[rice]] and [[copra]] farming as well as [[fishing]], for its livelihood. It also has a lucrative [[marble]] industry due to an abundance of Italian-quality marble, hence, its moniker as the \"Marble Capital of the Philippines.\" In recent years, the province has also become an [[ecotourism]] destination, with several white sand beaches, diving spots, mountains and rainforests that tourists visit annually.\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to legend, the name \"Romblon\" was derived from the Romblomanon word ''Nagalumyom'', which pertains to a chicken in the act of [[broodiness|sitting on its eggs]] on a nest.<ref name=\"Prado\">Local historian Francis Ray Prado details the legend, saying that when the Spanish, led by [[conquistador]] [[Martin de Goiti]], arrived in Romblon in 1569, they wandered along the island's beaches searching for food and water. One of the men encountered a hut with a hen's nest on top of a post near its window. The man asked the house's occupant, a young woman, if he could have the hen for free, but the woman, unable to understand Spanish, answered, \"''Nagalumyom!''\" which in the local language means \"the hen was brooding eggs.\" {{cite book |title=The History of Carmen Including Historical and Cultural Background of North-eastern Barangays of the Municipality of San Agustin, Romblon |author=Prado, Francis Ray |year=2005 |page=15 |publisher=Private publication }}</ref> This eventually evolved to ''Lomlom'', and later on to ''Donblon'', the name reported by Spanish [[chronicler]] Miguel de Loarca in his book ''Relacion de las Islas Filipinas'' in  1582, before finally evolving to Romblon.<ref name=\"Loarca\">{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16501/16501-h/16501-h.htm |title=Relacion de las Islas Filipinas by Miguel de Loarca |work=The Philippine Islands, 1493\u20131803 Volume V., 1582\u20131583 |author1=Blair, Emma  |author2=Robertson, James Alexander  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=9 August 2005 |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, local historians Roland Madeja and Evelyn Reyes relate the origin of the name \"Romblon\" to the shape of Romblon Island.

Vegetable production is mostly for home consumption and grown in small scale.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\n[[File:Fishing in Romblon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Fisherfolk in Romblon unload the day's catch from their nets.]]\n\n[[Livestock]] development and [[poultry]] production is a viable small scale enterprise for farmers in the province. The provincial government maintains breeding facilities in strategic locations province-wide to encourage farmers to engage in livestock and poultry production to augment their income. Livestock and poultry management training and seminars is provided to interested clients.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\nDue to the geographical condition of the province, crops and livestock production is generally deficient as compared to the food requirements of Romblon population. To meet the rice requirements, Romblon relies on imports from the neighboring provinces while vegetables, poultry meat, vegetables and fruits are supplied mostly by Luzon.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\n===Marine resources===\n[[Fishing]] industry is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides. The fishing grounds of Romblon are a migratory path of fish from [[Sulu Sea|Sulu]] and [[Visayan Sea]]s passing [[Tablas Strait]], [[Sibuyan Sea]] and Romblon Pass. The waters also abound with [[demersal fish]] due to the coral reefs surrounding the islands.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\nBecause the province has a great potential for aqua-marine development, the province implemented a coastal and resource management program. Each municipality established a [[marine protected area|fish sanctuary]] and passed laws on fishery. The use of [[air compressors]] in the [[territorial waters|municipal waters]] was regulated and banned altogether in some municipalities.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\n===Mineral resources===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    =\n | width     = 180\n | image1    = romblon island 089col.jpg\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Marble wares from Romblon\n | image2    = Romblon Marble plant workers.jpg\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Marble plant workers working in a quarry.\n | align     = right\n}}\n\nMarble is the most significant mineral deposit of Romblon and is the most renowned product of the province. Based on statistics, Romblon is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to [[Bulacan (province)|Bulacan]]. Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black. The [[Mines and Geosciences Bureau]] has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble. At current rates of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\nMarble quarrying and processing are major activities in Romblon. Among the most common marble products are categorized into the following: novelty items (gifts, ashtray, table bars), furniture (dining tables, baptismal fonts) and construction materials (tiles, balusters, marble chips). Other mineral resources with considerable quantity include [[nickel]] ore and [[gold]] mostly to be found in Sibuyan Island. [[Gold panning]] and [[Artisanal mining|small-scale mining]] is a lucrative undertaking in Magdiwang.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Tambak Beach.JPG|thumb|Tambak Beach in Banton]]\n[[File:Tabunan Beach with Kayak.jpg|thumb|Tabunan Beach in Banton]]\n[[File:Banton Burial Cloth.JPG|thumb|The Banton Cloth, the oldest existing example of warp [[ikat]] in Southeast Asia, displayed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]].]]\n\n===Natural attractions===\nBeing an archipelago, Romblon has numerous beaches and dive sites.

Its main islands include [[Tablas Island|Tablas]], the largest, which covers nine municipalities, [[Sibuyan Island|Sibuyan]] with its three towns, as well as the smaller island municipalities of [[Corcuera, Romblon|Corcuera]], [[Banton, Romblon|Banton]], [[Concepcion, Romblon|Concepcion]], [[San Jose, Romblon|San Jose]], and [[Romblon, Romblon|Romblon]], the provincial capital. The province lies south of [[Marinduque]] and [[Quezon]], east of [[Oriental Mindoro]], north of [[Aklan Province|Aklan]] and [[Capiz Province|Capiz]], and west of [[Masbate]]. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a total population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}}.{{PH census|current|04B}}\n\nRomblon has been inhabited by aboriginal Filipinos prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1569. Archaeological artifacts recovered by the [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] in 1936 indicate that the aborigines of Romblon already have a rich and advanced culture. Under Spanish colonial rule, Romblon was initially administered under the newly established province of [[Iloilo|Arevalo]], until 1716, when it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the newly created province of [[Capiz]]. With arrival of the Americans in 1901, Romblon was declared a province and placed under civilian rule. It lost its provincial status for a short while between 1907 and 1945, but regained it in 1946, just after [[World War II]].\n\nThe inhabitants of Romblon are divided into three ethnolinguistic groups: [[Romblomanon language|Romblomanon]], [[Onhan language|Onhan]] and [[Asi language|Asi]]. These groups occupy specific islands in the province and have their own language and customs. Romblomanon is mainly spoken in the town of Romblon, in all of three towns of Sibuyan Island, and the town of [[San Agustin, Romblon|San Agustin]] in Tablas Island. Onhan is mainly spoken in the municipalities in the southern part of Tablas Island ([[Alcantara, Romblon|Alcantara]], [[Looc, Romblon|Looc]], [[Ferrol, Romblon|Ferrol]], [[Santa Fe, Romblon|Santa Fe]], [[San Andres, Romblon|San Andres]], and [[Santa Maria, Romblon|Santa Maria]]) as well as in the island municipality of San Jose. The northwestern part of Tablas Island (in [[Odiongan, Romblon|Odiongan]] and [[Calatrava, Romblon|Calatrava]], as well as the islands municipalities of Corcuera, Banton, and Concepcion, speak the Asi language.\n\nCurrently, the province relies on [[agriculture]], particularly [[rice]] and [[copra]] farming as well as [[fishing]], for its livelihood. It also has a lucrative [[marble]] industry due to an abundance of Italian-quality marble, hence, its moniker as the \"Marble Capital of the Philippines.\" In recent years, the province has also become an [[ecotourism]] destination, with several white sand beaches, diving spots, mountains and rainforests that tourists visit annually.\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to legend, the name \"Romblon\" was derived from the Romblomanon word ''Nagalumyom'', which pertains to a chicken in the act of [[broodiness|sitting on its eggs]] on a nest.<ref name=\"Prado\">Local historian Francis Ray Prado details the legend, saying that when the Spanish, led by [[conquistador]] [[Martin de Goiti]], arrived in Romblon in 1569, they wandered along the island's beaches searching for food and water. One of the men encountered a hut with a hen's nest on top of a post near its window. The man asked the house's occupant, a young woman, if he could have the hen for free, but the woman, unable to understand Spanish, answered, \"''Nagalumyom!''\" which in the local language means \"the hen was brooding eggs.\" {{cite book |title=The History of Carmen Including Historical and Cultural Background of North-eastern Barangays of the Municipality of San Agustin, Romblon |author=Prado, Francis Ray |year=2005 |page=15 |publisher=Private publication }}</ref> This eventually evolved to ''Lomlom'', and later on to ''Donblon'', the name reported by Spanish [[chronicler]] Miguel de Loarca in his book ''Relacion de las Islas Filipinas'' in  1582, before finally evolving to Romblon.<ref name=\"Loarca\">{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16501/16501-h/16501-h.htm |title=Relacion de las Islas Filipinas by Miguel de Loarca |work=The Philippine Islands, 1493\u20131803 Volume V., 1582\u20131583 |author1=Blair, Emma  |author2=Robertson, James Alexander  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=9 August 2005 |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, local historians Roland Madeja and Evelyn Reyes relate the origin of the name \"Romblon\" to the shape of Romblon Island.

All of the languages of the Philippines, except Samalan, are classified as Philippine languages under the [[Western Malayo-Polynesian languages|Western Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of Austronesian.

Romblomanon belongs to the Central Visayan subgroup, which spans from [[Waray language|Waray-Waray]] in [[Samar]] and [[Leyte]], through [[Masbatenyo language|Masbatenyo]] and [[Bisakol languages|Bisakol]], and as far west as [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Capiznon]] on [[Panay]]. It is spoken in Romblon and Sibuyan Islands, as well as in San Agustin town in Tablas Island.<ref name=Language/><ref name=Lobel/>\n\nOnhan, on the other hand, belongs to the Western Visayan subgroup, which includes [[Kinaray-a]] and [[Aklanon language|Aklanon]] as well as several minor languages spoken on Mindoro, Palawan, and some small islands in between. Its speakers are mainly from the southern portion of Tablas Island, in the municipalities of San Andres, Santa Maria, Alcantara, Ferrol, Looc, and Santa Fe, as well as in the municipality of San Jose in Carabao Island.<ref name=Language/> Finally, Asi is not classified under any specific subgroup of Visayan, and instead makes up its own immediate branch of Visayan.<ref name=Language/><ref name=Lobel/> David Paul Zorc, a [[linguist]] from the [[Australian National University]] whose expertise is on Philippine languages, notes that Asi speakers may have been the first Visayan speakers in the region. He also suggests that Asi may have a [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] [[substratum]] and that many of its words may have been influenced by the later influx of other languages such as Romblomanon.<ref name=\"Zorc\">Zorc, R.

[[Coconut]] is the most cultivated crop with a total planted area of {{convert|58,270.44|ha|sqmi}}. San Agustin has the most extensive area with coconut plants followed by Romblon and Cajidiocan. [[Rice]] is the next crop, cultivated particularly in Odiongan, Looc, Cajidiocan and Santa Fe. Other crops grown include root crops, vegetables and fruits. Odiongan, Banton and Magdiwang have the greatest areas planted with root crops and correspondingly, have the highest volume of production. Vegetable production is mostly for home consumption and grown in small scale.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\n[[File:Fishing in Romblon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Fisherfolk in Romblon unload the day's catch from their nets.]]\n\n[[Livestock]] development and [[poultry]] production is a viable small scale enterprise for farmers in the province. The provincial government maintains breeding facilities in strategic locations province-wide to encourage farmers to engage in livestock and poultry production to augment their income. Livestock and poultry management training and seminars is provided to interested clients.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\nDue to the geographical condition of the province, crops and livestock production is generally deficient as compared to the food requirements of Romblon population. To meet the rice requirements, Romblon relies on imports from the neighboring provinces while vegetables, poultry meat, vegetables and fruits are supplied mostly by Luzon.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\n===Marine resources===\n[[Fishing]] industry is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides. The fishing grounds of Romblon are a migratory path of fish from [[Sulu Sea|Sulu]] and [[Visayan Sea]]s passing [[Tablas Strait]], [[Sibuyan Sea]] and Romblon Pass. The waters also abound with [[demersal fish]] due to the coral reefs surrounding the islands.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\nBecause the province has a great potential for aqua-marine development, the province implemented a coastal and resource management program. Each municipality established a [[marine protected area|fish sanctuary]] and passed laws on fishery. The use of [[air compressors]] in the [[territorial waters|municipal waters]] was regulated and banned altogether in some municipalities.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\n===Mineral resources===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    =\n | width     = 180\n | image1    = romblon island 089col.jpg\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Marble wares from Romblon\n | image2    = Romblon Marble plant workers.jpg\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Marble plant workers working in a quarry.\n | align     = right\n}}\n\nMarble is the most significant mineral deposit of Romblon and is the most renowned product of the province. Based on statistics, Romblon is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to [[Bulacan (province)|Bulacan]]. Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black. The [[Mines and Geosciences Bureau]] has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble. At current rates of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.<ref name=\"PSA\"/><ref name=\"MDG\"/>\n\nMarble quarrying and processing are major activities in Romblon.

Philippines]] in the [[Calabarzon]] [[Regions of the Philippines|region]] located in the south of [[Luzon]] island. The province was named after [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the second [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|President]] of the Philippines and the first to be freely elected. [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]] is the provincial capital, seat of the provincial government and the most populous city of the province, but is governed independently as a highly urbanized city. To distinguish the province from [[Quezon City]], it is sometimes called '''Quezon Province'''.\n\nQuezon is southeast of [[Metro Manila]] and is bordered by the provinces of [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]] to the north, [[Bulacan]], [[Rizal]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] and [[Batangas]] to the west and the provinces of [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Camarines Sur]] to the east. Part of Quezon lies on an [[isthmus]] connecting the [[Bicol Peninsula]] to the main part of Luzon. The province also includes the [[Polillo Islands]] in the [[Philippine Sea]]. Some marine parts of the [[Verde Island Passage]], the center of the center of world's marine biodiversity, are also in the province.\n\nA major tourism draw to the province is [[Mount Banahaw]]. The mountain is surrounded by spiritual mysticism with many [[Religion in the Philippines#Anitism|Anitist]] adherents, Christian cults, and Christian organizations staying on the mountain.  The mountain was also one of the most sacred sites for pre-colonial [[Tagalog people]] before the arrival of the Spanish. Numerous [[pilgrim]]s visit the mountain especially during [[Holy Week]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Precolonial Period ===\nArchaeological excavations in the province attest to its rich precolonial past. Archaeological materials including burial jars, human bones, shell midden and pot shreds have been discovered at different sites in Bondoc Peninsula including the towns of San Narciso, San Andres, Mulanay and Catanauan. The most recent excavations were conducted in [[Catanauan]] by the Catanauan Archeological and Heritage Project.\n\nAccording to the preliminary report released by the Catanauan Archaeological and Heritage Project, several excavations were conducted in the 1930s. One of the excavations was conducted in San Narciso where archaeologists found burial jars. The site, inspected by Ricardo Galang, resulted in the discovery of burial jars near the coast. Galang also went to San Andres where excavations yielded 14th and 15th century ceramics as well as shell bracelets and beads. According to the journal as well, at a site named Tala, archaeologists discovered a glazed Chinese jar containing bone fragments from the early Ming dynasty. Looking at other archaeological sites located in adjacent areas like Marinduque and Masbate, it can be inferred that these excavations date back to the metal period of the archipelago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paz, Victor.

At the early period of Spanish colonization, the province of Aurora was called El Principe, Infanta was called Binangonan de Lampon and southern Quezon was called Kalilayan.

Depredation and plunder by the [[Moro people|Moros]] from Jolo and Brunei were rampant during the 1600s. Slavery is one reason for the proliferation of these raids. A padron for Calilaya was ordered after Tayabas suffered severely from Moro raids. It is said that 187 people were either captured or killed while 400 people fled. Fear from these raids are the primary reason as to the permanent movement of settlements along the coast further inland as well as a general decline in population. Frequent invasions by the moros disrupted the food production in the province, affecting the nutrition of its inhabitants. Maternal malnutrition was even cited as one of the primary causes of infant mortality at that time. By 1701, the previously densely settled coastal areas of the province, was described as consisting of rancherias whose inhabitants depended on wild products.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conquest and Pestilence in the Early Spanish Philippines|last=Newson|first=Linda|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2009|isbn=9780824832728|location=Hawaii|pages=147}}</ref>\n\nIn 1705, the Military Comandancia of Nueva Ecija was created and was governed by Governor General Fausto Cruzat.

Bartolome Galan in 1823, he describes the economy of the province. According to his report, Tayabas had poor soil and the terrain is hilly which meant that conditions were not that suitable for agriculture compared to other places. The people grew upland rice, wheat, beans and vegetables. Surplus rice was sold in San Pablo and Majayjay during Mondays, the market day of those towns. Cattle breeding was rampant in towns like Tayabas, Pagbilao, Tiaong, and Sariaya. Also, unlike other provinces, haciendas were not so many in Tayabas. Instead, residents owned most of their own land.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|title=Reading Southeast Asia|last=Shiraishi|first=Takashi|publisher=Cornell University|year=2018|isbn=|location=New York|pages=128\u2013130}}</ref>\n\nThe people of Tayabas, as in other areas, are actively trading with Manila. Santa Cruz, Laguna was the entrepot for all goods going to the capital. The people from Lucban made products of buri and pandan leaves like hats, sleeping mata and the like which they traded. They, along with the people of Mauban also went to Polillo, at that time part of Nueva Ecija, to buy sea slugs, shells and beeswax. Being a rich agricultural area, the town of Tayabas traded rice, coconuts, and panocha with nearby towns of Majayjay, Lucban, Sariaya, Pagbilao,  Mauban, Gumaca, and Atimonan. In turn, they traded fish from Pagbilao, rice from Sariaya, and high quality abaca products from Mauban and Atimonan. Lucban, as well as Tayabas, benefitted greatly from the high commercial activity of Chinese and Chinese mestizos in the pueblos.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nGumaca, being a town with little arable land depended heavily on the sea. They collected sea slugs, and tortoise shell from Alabat and traded with the [[mountain people]] there for beeswax in exchange for clothing. They even sometimes ventured to Burias Island in the Ragay Gulf in search for these goods. These products were then sent to Tayabas for shipment to Manila. Gumaca also traded items from nearby pueblos like vinegar and clothing for gold and abaca from Naga in the Bicol region.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIt was also around this time that the Confradia de San Jose was active in the province, caused by the growing inequality between the poor and the upper classes. This organization was directed mostly on the poor and neither admitted Spaniards nor mestizos.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn 1853 the new military district of Tayabas was carved from Nueva Ecija and included present-day Southern Quezon as well as present-day Aurora. In 1858, Binangonan de Lampon and the Polilio Islands were separated from Nueva Ecija to form part of Infanta.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to the CBCP, the two Franciscan friars named Fray Juan de Plasencia and Fray Diego de Oropesa were the ones responsible for bringing Christianity to the area.

The most important event in the history of the province was the [[Confradia Revolt]] in 1841, which was led by the famous [[Lucban, Quezon|Lucbano]], Apolinario de la Cruz, popularly known as [[Hermano Pule]]. The province, under General [[Miguel Malvar]], was also among the earliest to join the [[Philippine Revolution]]. The [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Revolutionary Government]] took control over the province on August 15, 1898.\n\n=== American period and World War II ===\nThe Americans then came and [[Annexation|annexed]] the Philippines. A [[civil government]] was established in the province on March 12, 1901, and [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]] was made the provincial capital.\n\nDuring the pacification of the archipelago by the Americans, insurrections were a commonplace in what was then Tayabas. Insurgents from neighboring provinces of Laguna and Batangas often use Tayabas as their base of operations as well as their source of supplies. An insurgent government, with connections to Gen. Malvar and Pedro Caballes was even said to be based in Infanta. This has led the American in charge, Brigadier-General J.F. Bell to decide to return to Tayabas with a larger contingent. Bell acknowledged the importance of the ports of Tayabas as sources of supplies to the insurrection such that he believed that closing all the ports in the province might convince the leaders of the resistance to surrender.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Masterpiece of Counterguerrilla Warfare: BG J.

These barangays are Kagtalaba, Plaridel, Kabuluan, Don Tomas, Guitol, Tabugon, Maualawin, Patag Ibaba and Patag Iraya.

The Chief delineated the border as follows:<blockquote>\"Starting from the peak of Mt.

First is that Act 2711 already delineated the boundaries of the province. Second is that the Chief of the Executive Bureau had no power nor authority to change the boundaries of the province. Regarding the first issue, the court stated that it is true that Act 2711 delineated the boundary but it did not delineate the entirety of the boundary. The point on the eastern shore of Basiad Bay was never specifically located, thus, needing further delineation. On the second issue, the court stated that the Chief did not alter the borders in any way. The Chief worked with the requirement that the point be on the eastern shore of Basiad Bay. He was also acting on the consideration of Act 2809, the Act establishing Camarines Norte, which states that Camarines Norte be established with the borders it had before merging with Camarines Sur. The court then ruled in favor of Camarines Norte and ordered the provincial government of Quezon to transfer all its authority and jurisdiction to the former.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBy 2001, the Provincial Government of Quezon, this time represented by Governor Eduardo Rodriguez, the Provincial Government of Camarines Norte, as represented by Governor Roy Padilla, went back to court. Even with the judgment on the 1989 case was executory by 1990, the provincial government of Quezon did not abide by the court's ruling. In 1991, a DENR technical team conducted a survey of the area and erected a monument marker to delineate the boundary of the area. However, by October 1991, Quezon Governor Eduardo Rodriguez and Calauag Mayor Julio Lim caused the removal of the marker. Throughout the proceedings, several government agencies including the Department of Budget and Management, Comelec, as well as the Philippine Statistics Authority recognized the jurisdiction of the town of [[Santa Elena, Camarines Norte]] over the 9 barangays. In 2000, Judge Regino held Governor Rodriguez and Mayor Lim guilty of contempt, with a maximum imprisonment of 6 months as well as a fine of 1,000 pesos for the erection of a new boundary marker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2001/oct2001/80796.htm|title=Province of Camarines Norte vs Province of Quezon : 80796 : October 11, 2001 : J.

Because of this, majority of towns in the province have access to the sea. The province is bounded by the provinces of Aurora, Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, Batangas, Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte. It is bounded to the east by the Pacific Ocean and to the south by Tayabas Bay. The province is said to be characterized by a rugged terrain with patches of plains, valleys and swamps.\n\nThe major islands of Quezon are [[Alabat Island]] and [[Polillo Islands]].

Most of the province falls under Type IV Climate which means that rains are evenly distributed throughout the year. Polillo, Infanta and parts of Calauag fall under Type II climate which means that there are no dry seasons but there is a pronounced wet season from November to April. Parts of the western towns of Tiaong, San Antonio, Dolores and Candelaria as well as the tip of Bondoc Peninsula including parts of Mulanay, San Francisco, San Narciso and San Andres fall under Type III climate. This means that there is a relatively dry season from November to April.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Although these are the patterns observed, it is important to note that with climate change, these patterns have become more erratic. Typhoons have become stronger through the years, causing problems such as power outages, road blockages, landslides, flashfloods and crop damages.{{clear left}}\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nQuezon comprises 39 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]] and one component city ([[Tayabas City|Tayabas]]), which are organized into [[Legislative districts of Quezon|four legislative districts]] and further subdivided into 1,209 [[barangay]]s.\n\nThe capital, [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena City]], is independent from the administrative and fiscal supervision of the province, but is eligible to vote for provincial officials.\n\n[[File:Ph fil quezon.png|thumb|upright=1.1|{{center|'''Political map of Quezon'''}}]]\n\n{{clear right}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#BFF5FF|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and highly urbanized city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

In 1939, the province ranked 5th among all provinces including Manila in terms of the concentration of Philippine Chinese.

Other terms used to call them include \"Umag\", \"Ata\", \"Atid\", and \"Itim\". The Aeta used to clear coconut plantations and other odd jobs in exchange for food or clothing. These people, though seem as uncivilized by some, have a very rich culture. Some forms of their art include body scarification. The Aeta cause wound on their skin in various parts of their body including back, arms, legs, hands, calves and abdomen. They then irritate them during healing using fire, lime and other materials to form scars. They also bore holes on their septum and then proceed to decorate it with a sliver of bamboo. The Aeta also have various musical instruments like the nose flute and the gurimbaw, a stringed instrument made of coconuts, fibers from lukmong vines and bamboo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:81/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v1/v1.pdf|title=Untitled}}</ref>\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThere are five indigenous languages in Quezon province. There are the dominant ''Tagalog language'', the ''Manide language'' in the east and a small portion in the north, the ''Agta Dumagat Umiray'' language in the north and a small area in the center, the already-extinct ''Katabaga language'' which used to be in the south, and the endangered Alabat Agta in Alabat island. The province primarily speaks Tagalog dialect called ''Tayabas Tagalog'' that resembles a dominant part of [[Batangas Tagalog]] with a heavy mixture of [[Bikol languages|Bicolano]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] words. Its presence is stronger in towns in [[Aurora (Province)|Aurora]], First, Third (Bondoc Peninsula) and Fourth Districts of the Province.\n\nIn 2010, [[UNESCO]] released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages is the ''[[Alabat Island]] Agta'' language. The language was classified as ''Critically Endangered'', meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218184822/http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|archivedate=18 December 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\nMajority of Quezon's inhabitants practice Roman Catholicism and other Christian denominations like [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]]. Most non-Christians practice [[Islam]], [[Dambana|Anitism]], [[animism]], or [[atheism]].\n\n== Economy ==\nFarming and fishing are the main sources of livelihood in the province. Commercial, industrial, and banking activities are mostly concentrated in the south-central part of the province.\n\n=== Agro-industry ===\nQuezon is the country's leading producer of [[coconut]] products such as [[desiccated coconut]], [[virgin coconut oil]], [[Coconut water|coconut juice]], [[coconut oil]]<ref name=\"BalitaPH\" /> and [[copra]]. A large part of the province is covered in coconut plantations. Several large companies geared toward processing coconuts have factories in the province. This includes companies in Candelaria including Peter Paul Philippine Corporation, Primex Coco Products Inc., Pacific Royal Basic Foods, SuperStar Corporation, and Tongsan Industrial Development Corporation which are focused on processing desiccated coconut and other specialty coconut products.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Other companies in Lucena like Tantuco Enterprises, and JNJ Oil Industries on the other hand are focused on producing coconut oil and other coconut oil based products like margarine, and lard.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Because of the coconut industry, copra traders from provinces like Marinduque, Romblon, and Masbate regularly visit the province.\n\nHowever, the coconut industry is faced with several threats from cocolisap to the coconut lumber trade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/867149/almost-p200k-worth-of-illegally-cut-coconut-lumber-seized-in-quezon|title=Almost P200K worth of illegally cut coconut lumber seized in Quezon|last=Jr.|first=Delfin T.

Quezon accounts for 33% or around 132,239 MT of fish produced in the region. Several fish port complexes exist in the province, including ports in Atimonan, Lucena, Infanta, and Guinayangan. These ports serve as hubs for the trade of fish and other aquatic resources like round scad, anchovies, tuna, and groupers. The province has three fishing districts. The first is found in the northeast encompassing [[Lamon Bay]]. The southeast portion includes the [[Ragay Gulf]] while the south central portion covers [[Tayabas Bay]]. Aside from fishing, aquaculture is also important in the coastal municipalities of the province. Bangus and prawns are among the most cultured species.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Forestry ===\nDue to its proximity to the southern fringes of the Sierra Mountain range. Northern quezon has been a hotspot for illegal logging. Frequent raids in towns like Mauban often yield hardwood timber like Narra and Kamagong.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/regions/488722/cops-seize-p4-5m-worth-of-illegally-cut-logs-in-quezon-province/story/|title=Cops Seize P4.5M worth of illegally cut logs in Quezon Province|last=Locsin|first=Joel|date=May 2015|work=GMA News|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Commerce and Banking ===\nThe capital city of Lucena is considered to be the economic center of the province. There are currently three malls in the province. Two of them are located in Lucena namely SM City Lucena and Pacific Mall Lucena. Citymall, located in Tiaong, is the third mall in the province. Major banks like [[BDO Unibank|BDO]], [[Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company|Metrobank]], [[Land Bank of the Philippines|Land Bank]], [[Bank of the Philippine Islands|BPI]], [[Philippine National Bank|PNB]], [[Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation|RCBC]] [[United Coconut Planters Bank|UCPB]], among other Manila-based banks are present in the western part of the province. BDO however made a move to establish a regional head office at [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]] due to the growing demand and economic importance of the province itself. On the other hand, namely [[QCRB]], Rural Bank of Atimonan and Card Bank rural banks serve the far-flung towns.\n\nSeveral rural banks were also established in Quezon namely Rural Bank of Dolores, Rural Bank of General Lopez, Rural Bank of Lucban, Rural Bank of General Luna, and Rural Bank of Sampaloc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsp.gov.ph/banking/directory.asp?BankName=Quezon&InstitutionTypeID=&submit=Find|title=BSP - Banks in Quezon|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bsp.gov.ph|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n==== Road ====\n[[File:Sariaya,QuezonArch,bridgejf9708 08.JPG|thumb|Manila South Road, part of Pan-Philippine Highway (N1/AH26), in Sariaya.]]\nQuezon has a total of {{convert|931|km|mi}} of national roads, mostly paved with concrete.<ref>Kilometer count tabulated from data for the 4 district engineering offices in Quezon in the [http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/atlas/2015%20DPWH%20Road%20Data/Road%20Data%202015/region_iv_a.htm 2015 Road Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407234338/http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/atlas/2015%20DPWH%20Road%20Data/Road%20Data%202015/region_iv_a.htm |date=2017-04-07 }} by the [[Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines)|Department of Public Works and Highways]]</ref> [[Pan-Philippine Highway]] (N1/AH26), which comprises most of Manila South Road, and Quirino Highway (N68), the Quezon leg of [[Andaya Highway]] form the highway backbone network, and the secondary and tertiary roads interconnect most cities and municipalities, except for Infanta, Real, and General Nakar, whose highways used to access those municipalities interconnect with the national highway network in [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] and [[Rizal]] or [[Manila East Road]] and [[Marikina\u2013Infanta Highway|Marcos Highway.]] The provincial government maintains provincial roads which supplements the national roads.\n\nIn order to spur development in the province, several proposals have been made to expand the expressway network to Quezon.

Philippines]] in the [[Calabarzon]] [[Regions of the Philippines|region]] located in the south of [[Luzon]] island. The province was named after [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the second [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|President]] of the Philippines and the first to be freely elected. [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]] is the provincial capital, seat of the provincial government and the most populous city of the province, but is governed independently as a highly urbanized city. To distinguish the province from [[Quezon City]], it is sometimes called '''Quezon Province'''.\n\nQuezon is southeast of [[Metro Manila]] and is bordered by the provinces of [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]] to the north, [[Bulacan]], [[Rizal]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] and [[Batangas]] to the west and the provinces of [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Camarines Sur]] to the east. Part of Quezon lies on an [[isthmus]] connecting the [[Bicol Peninsula]] to the main part of Luzon. The province also includes the [[Polillo Islands]] in the [[Philippine Sea]]. Some marine parts of the [[Verde Island Passage]], the center of the center of world's marine biodiversity, are also in the province.\n\nA major tourism draw to the province is [[Mount Banahaw]]. The mountain is surrounded by spiritual mysticism with many [[Religion in the Philippines#Anitism|Anitist]] adherents, Christian cults, and Christian organizations staying on the mountain.  The mountain was also one of the most sacred sites for pre-colonial [[Tagalog people]] before the arrival of the Spanish. Numerous [[pilgrim]]s visit the mountain especially during [[Holy Week]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Precolonial Period ===\nArchaeological excavations in the province attest to its rich precolonial past. Archaeological materials including burial jars, human bones, shell midden and pot shreds have been discovered at different sites in Bondoc Peninsula including the towns of San Narciso, San Andres, Mulanay and Catanauan. The most recent excavations were conducted in [[Catanauan]] by the Catanauan Archeological and Heritage Project.\n\nAccording to the preliminary report released by the Catanauan Archaeological and Heritage Project, several excavations were conducted in the 1930s. One of the excavations was conducted in San Narciso where archaeologists found burial jars. The site, inspected by Ricardo Galang, resulted in the discovery of burial jars near the coast. Galang also went to San Andres where excavations yielded 14th and 15th century ceramics as well as shell bracelets and beads. According to the journal as well, at a site named Tala, archaeologists discovered a glazed Chinese jar containing bone fragments from the early Ming dynasty. Looking at other archaeological sites located in adjacent areas like Marinduque and Masbate, it can be inferred that these excavations date back to the metal period of the archipelago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paz, Victor.

At the early period of Spanish colonization, the province of Aurora was called El Principe, Infanta was called Binangonan de Lampon and southern Quezon was called Kalilayan.

Depredation and plunder by the [[Moro people|Moros]] from Jolo and Brunei were rampant during the 1600s. Slavery is one reason for the proliferation of these raids. A padron for Calilaya was ordered after Tayabas suffered severely from Moro raids. It is said that 187 people were either captured or killed while 400 people fled. Fear from these raids are the primary reason as to the permanent movement of settlements along the coast further inland as well as a general decline in population. Frequent invasions by the moros disrupted the food production in the province, affecting the nutrition of its inhabitants. Maternal malnutrition was even cited as one of the primary causes of infant mortality at that time. By 1701, the previously densely settled coastal areas of the province, was described as consisting of rancherias whose inhabitants depended on wild products.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conquest and Pestilence in the Early Spanish Philippines|last=Newson|first=Linda|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2009|isbn=9780824832728|location=Hawaii|pages=147}}</ref>\n\nIn 1705, the Military Comandancia of Nueva Ecija was created and was governed by Governor General Fausto Cruzat.

Bartolome Galan in 1823, he describes the economy of the province. According to his report, Tayabas had poor soil and the terrain is hilly which meant that conditions were not that suitable for agriculture compared to other places. The people grew upland rice, wheat, beans and vegetables. Surplus rice was sold in San Pablo and Majayjay during Mondays, the market day of those towns. Cattle breeding was rampant in towns like Tayabas, Pagbilao, Tiaong, and Sariaya. Also, unlike other provinces, haciendas were not so many in Tayabas. Instead, residents owned most of their own land.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|title=Reading Southeast Asia|last=Shiraishi|first=Takashi|publisher=Cornell University|year=2018|isbn=|location=New York|pages=128\u2013130}}</ref>\n\nThe people of Tayabas, as in other areas, are actively trading with Manila. Santa Cruz, Laguna was the entrepot for all goods going to the capital. The people from Lucban made products of buri and pandan leaves like hats, sleeping mata and the like which they traded. They, along with the people of Mauban also went to Polillo, at that time part of Nueva Ecija, to buy sea slugs, shells and beeswax. Being a rich agricultural area, the town of Tayabas traded rice, coconuts, and panocha with nearby towns of Majayjay, Lucban, Sariaya, Pagbilao,  Mauban, Gumaca, and Atimonan. In turn, they traded fish from Pagbilao, rice from Sariaya, and high quality abaca products from Mauban and Atimonan. Lucban, as well as Tayabas, benefitted greatly from the high commercial activity of Chinese and Chinese mestizos in the pueblos.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nGumaca, being a town with little arable land depended heavily on the sea. They collected sea slugs, and tortoise shell from Alabat and traded with the [[mountain people]] there for beeswax in exchange for clothing. They even sometimes ventured to Burias Island in the Ragay Gulf in search for these goods. These products were then sent to Tayabas for shipment to Manila. Gumaca also traded items from nearby pueblos like vinegar and clothing for gold and abaca from Naga in the Bicol region.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIt was also around this time that the Confradia de San Jose was active in the province, caused by the growing inequality between the poor and the upper classes. This organization was directed mostly on the poor and neither admitted Spaniards nor mestizos.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn 1853 the new military district of Tayabas was carved from Nueva Ecija and included present-day Southern Quezon as well as present-day Aurora. In 1858, Binangonan de Lampon and the Polilio Islands were separated from Nueva Ecija to form part of Infanta.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to the CBCP, the two Franciscan friars named Fray Juan de Plasencia and Fray Diego de Oropesa were the ones responsible for bringing Christianity to the area.

The most important event in the history of the province was the [[Confradia Revolt]] in 1841, which was led by the famous [[Lucban, Quezon|Lucbano]], Apolinario de la Cruz, popularly known as [[Hermano Pule]]. The province, under General [[Miguel Malvar]], was also among the earliest to join the [[Philippine Revolution]]. The [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Revolutionary Government]] took control over the province on August 15, 1898.\n\n=== American period and World War II ===\nThe Americans then came and [[Annexation|annexed]] the Philippines. A [[civil government]] was established in the province on March 12, 1901, and [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]] was made the provincial capital.\n\nDuring the pacification of the archipelago by the Americans, insurrections were a commonplace in what was then Tayabas. Insurgents from neighboring provinces of Laguna and Batangas often use Tayabas as their base of operations as well as their source of supplies. An insurgent government, with connections to Gen. Malvar and Pedro Caballes was even said to be based in Infanta. This has led the American in charge, Brigadier-General J.F. Bell to decide to return to Tayabas with a larger contingent. Bell acknowledged the importance of the ports of Tayabas as sources of supplies to the insurrection such that he believed that closing all the ports in the province might convince the leaders of the resistance to surrender.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Masterpiece of Counterguerrilla Warfare: BG J.

These barangays are Kagtalaba, Plaridel, Kabuluan, Don Tomas, Guitol, Tabugon, Maualawin, Patag Ibaba and Patag Iraya.

The Chief delineated the border as follows:<blockquote>\"Starting from the peak of Mt.

Cadig; ''thence a straight line is drawn to the point of intersection of the inter-provincial road between Camarines Norte and Tayabas with the Tabugon River; thence, following the course of the river to its mouth at Basiad Bay.\"''<ref name=\":7\" /></blockquote>In the legal dispute, Quezon raised two points of contention. First is that Act 2711 already delineated the boundaries of the province. Second is that the Chief of the Executive Bureau had no power nor authority to change the boundaries of the province. Regarding the first issue, the court stated that it is true that Act 2711 delineated the boundary but it did not delineate the entirety of the boundary. The point on the eastern shore of Basiad Bay was never specifically located, thus, needing further delineation. On the second issue, the court stated that the Chief did not alter the borders in any way. The Chief worked with the requirement that the point be on the eastern shore of Basiad Bay. He was also acting on the consideration of Act 2809, the Act establishing Camarines Norte, which states that Camarines Norte be established with the borders it had before merging with Camarines Sur. The court then ruled in favor of Camarines Norte and ordered the provincial government of Quezon to transfer all its authority and jurisdiction to the former.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBy 2001, the Provincial Government of Quezon, this time represented by Governor Eduardo Rodriguez, the Provincial Government of Camarines Norte, as represented by Governor Roy Padilla, went back to court. Even with the judgment on the 1989 case was executory by 1990, the provincial government of Quezon did not abide by the court's ruling. In 1991, a DENR technical team conducted a survey of the area and erected a monument marker to delineate the boundary of the area. However, by October 1991, Quezon Governor Eduardo Rodriguez and Calauag Mayor Julio Lim caused the removal of the marker. Throughout the proceedings, several government agencies including the Department of Budget and Management, Comelec, as well as the Philippine Statistics Authority recognized the jurisdiction of the town of [[Santa Elena, Camarines Norte]] over the 9 barangays. In 2000, Judge Regino held Governor Rodriguez and Mayor Lim guilty of contempt, with a maximum imprisonment of 6 months as well as a fine of 1,000 pesos for the erection of a new boundary marker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2001/oct2001/80796.htm|title=Province of Camarines Norte vs Province of Quezon : 80796 : October 11, 2001 : J.

Quezon del Sur, with its capital at [[Gumaca]], would have been composed of the third and fourth congressional districts ([[Agdangan]], [[Buenavista, Quezon|Buenavista]], [[Catanauan]], [[General Luna, Quezon|General Luna]], [[Macalelon]], [[Mulanay]], [[Padre Burgos, Quezon|Padre Burgos]], [[Pitogo, Quezon|Pitogo]], [[San Andres, Quezon|San Andres]], [[San Francisco, Quezon|San Francisco]], [[San Narciso, Quezon|San Narciso]], [[Unisan, Quezon|Unisan]], [[Alabat, Quezon|Alabat]], [[Atimonan]], [[Calauag]], [[Guinayangan]], [[Gumaca]], [[Lopez, Quezon|Lopez]], [[Perez, Quezon|Perez]], [[Plaridel, Quezon|Plaridel]], [[Quezon, Quezon|Quezon]] and [[Tagkawayan]]). The act lapsed into law without the signature of President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on September 7, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 9495: An Act Creating the Province of Quezon del Sur|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2007/ra_9495_2007.html|publisher=The LAWPHiL Project|accessdate=22 November 2013|date=September 7, 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225033507/http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2007/ra_9495_2007.html|archivedate=25 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs required by law, the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|COMELEC]] held a [[2008 Quezon del Sur creation plebiscite|plebiscite on December 13, 2008]], 60 days after ''Republic Act No. 9495'' took effect. The majority of the votes cast overwhelmingly rejected the division, therefore the split did not push through.\n\n==== Proposal to add the Legislative Districts of Quezon ====\nIn 2015, news reported that the Provincial Development Council is pushing to increase the legislative districts in Quezon from 4 to 7. This will allow the people of Quezon to have greater representation in congress.

Because of this, majority of towns in the province have access to the sea. The province is bounded by the provinces of Aurora, Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, Batangas, Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte. It is bounded to the east by the Pacific Ocean and to the south by Tayabas Bay. The province is said to be characterized by a rugged terrain with patches of plains, valleys and swamps.\n\nThe major islands of Quezon are [[Alabat Island]] and [[Polillo Islands]].

Most of the province falls under Type IV Climate which means that rains are evenly distributed throughout the year. Polillo, Infanta and parts of Calauag fall under Type II climate which means that there are no dry seasons but there is a pronounced wet season from November to April. Parts of the western towns of Tiaong, San Antonio, Dolores and Candelaria as well as the tip of Bondoc Peninsula including parts of Mulanay, San Francisco, San Narciso and San Andres fall under Type III climate. This means that there is a relatively dry season from November to April.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Although these are the patterns observed, it is important to note that with climate change, these patterns have become more erratic. Typhoons have become stronger through the years, causing problems such as power outages, road blockages, landslides, flashfloods and crop damages.{{clear left}}\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nQuezon comprises 39 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]] and one component city ([[Tayabas City|Tayabas]]), which are organized into [[Legislative districts of Quezon|four legislative districts]] and further subdivided into 1,209 [[barangay]]s.\n\nThe capital, [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena City]], is independent from the administrative and fiscal supervision of the province, but is eligible to vote for provincial officials.\n\n[[File:Ph fil quezon.png|thumb|upright=1.1|{{center|'''Political map of Quezon'''}}]]\n\n{{clear right}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#BFF5FF|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and highly urbanized city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

In 1939, the province ranked 5th among all provinces including Manila in terms of the concentration of Philippine Chinese.

Other terms used to call them include \"Umag\", \"Ata\", \"Atid\", and \"Itim\". The Aeta used to clear coconut plantations and other odd jobs in exchange for food or clothing. These people, though seem as uncivilized by some, have a very rich culture. Some forms of their art include body scarification. The Aeta cause wound on their skin in various parts of their body including back, arms, legs, hands, calves and abdomen. They then irritate them during healing using fire, lime and other materials to form scars. They also bore holes on their septum and then proceed to decorate it with a sliver of bamboo. The Aeta also have various musical instruments like the nose flute and the gurimbaw, a stringed instrument made of coconuts, fibers from lukmong vines and bamboo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:81/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v1/v1.pdf|title=Untitled}}</ref>\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThere are five indigenous languages in Quezon province. There are the dominant ''Tagalog language'', the ''Manide language'' in the east and a small portion in the north, the ''Agta Dumagat Umiray'' language in the north and a small area in the center, the already-extinct ''Katabaga language'' which used to be in the south, and the endangered Alabat Agta in Alabat island. The province primarily speaks Tagalog dialect called ''Tayabas Tagalog'' that resembles a dominant part of [[Batangas Tagalog]] with a heavy mixture of [[Bikol languages|Bicolano]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] words. Its presence is stronger in towns in [[Aurora (Province)|Aurora]], First, Third (Bondoc Peninsula) and Fourth Districts of the Province.\n\nIn 2010, [[UNESCO]] released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages is the ''[[Alabat Island]] Agta'' language. The language was classified as ''Critically Endangered'', meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218184822/http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|archivedate=18 December 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\nMajority of Quezon's inhabitants practice Roman Catholicism and other Christian denominations like [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]]. Most non-Christians practice [[Islam]], [[Dambana|Anitism]], [[animism]], or [[atheism]].\n\n== Economy ==\nFarming and fishing are the main sources of livelihood in the province. Commercial, industrial, and banking activities are mostly concentrated in the south-central part of the province.\n\n=== Agro-industry ===\nQuezon is the country's leading producer of [[coconut]] products such as [[desiccated coconut]], [[virgin coconut oil]], [[Coconut water|coconut juice]], [[coconut oil]]<ref name=\"BalitaPH\" /> and [[copra]]. A large part of the province is covered in coconut plantations. Several large companies geared toward processing coconuts have factories in the province. This includes companies in Candelaria including Peter Paul Philippine Corporation, Primex Coco Products Inc., Pacific Royal Basic Foods, SuperStar Corporation, and Tongsan Industrial Development Corporation which are focused on processing desiccated coconut and other specialty coconut products.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Other companies in Lucena like Tantuco Enterprises, and JNJ Oil Industries on the other hand are focused on producing coconut oil and other coconut oil based products like margarine, and lard.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Because of the coconut industry, copra traders from provinces like Marinduque, Romblon, and Masbate regularly visit the province.\n\nHowever, the coconut industry is faced with several threats from cocolisap to the coconut lumber trade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/867149/almost-p200k-worth-of-illegally-cut-coconut-lumber-seized-in-quezon|title=Almost P200K worth of illegally cut coconut lumber seized in Quezon|last=Jr.|first=Delfin T.

Quezon accounts for 33% or around 132,239 MT of fish produced in the region. Several fish port complexes exist in the province, including ports in Atimonan, Lucena, Infanta, and Guinayangan. These ports serve as hubs for the trade of fish and other aquatic resources like round scad, anchovies, tuna, and groupers. The province has three fishing districts. The first is found in the northeast encompassing [[Lamon Bay]]. The southeast portion includes the [[Ragay Gulf]] while the south central portion covers [[Tayabas Bay]]. Aside from fishing, aquaculture is also important in the coastal municipalities of the province. Bangus and prawns are among the most cultured species.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Forestry ===\nDue to its proximity to the southern fringes of the Sierra Mountain range. Northern quezon has been a hotspot for illegal logging. Frequent raids in towns like Mauban often yield hardwood timber like Narra and Kamagong.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/regions/488722/cops-seize-p4-5m-worth-of-illegally-cut-logs-in-quezon-province/story/|title=Cops Seize P4.5M worth of illegally cut logs in Quezon Province|last=Locsin|first=Joel|date=May 2015|work=GMA News|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Commerce and Banking ===\nThe capital city of Lucena is considered to be the economic center of the province. There are currently three malls in the province. Two of them are located in Lucena namely SM City Lucena and Pacific Mall Lucena. Citymall, located in Tiaong, is the third mall in the province. Major banks like [[BDO Unibank|BDO]], [[Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company|Metrobank]], [[Land Bank of the Philippines|Land Bank]], [[Bank of the Philippine Islands|BPI]], [[Philippine National Bank|PNB]], [[Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation|RCBC]] [[United Coconut Planters Bank|UCPB]], among other Manila-based banks are present in the western part of the province. BDO however made a move to establish a regional head office at [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]] due to the growing demand and economic importance of the province itself. On the other hand, namely [[QCRB]], Rural Bank of Atimonan and Card Bank rural banks serve the far-flung towns.\n\nSeveral rural banks were also established in Quezon namely Rural Bank of Dolores, Rural Bank of General Lopez, Rural Bank of Lucban, Rural Bank of General Luna, and Rural Bank of Sampaloc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsp.gov.ph/banking/directory.asp?BankName=Quezon&InstitutionTypeID=&submit=Find|title=BSP - Banks in Quezon|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bsp.gov.ph|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n==== Road ====\n[[File:Sariaya,QuezonArch,bridgejf9708 08.JPG|thumb|Manila South Road, part of Pan-Philippine Highway (N1/AH26), in Sariaya.]]\nQuezon has a total of {{convert|931|km|mi}} of national roads, mostly paved with concrete.<ref>Kilometer count tabulated from data for the 4 district engineering offices in Quezon in the [http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/atlas/2015%20DPWH%20Road%20Data/Road%20Data%202015/region_iv_a.htm 2015 Road Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407234338/http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/atlas/2015%20DPWH%20Road%20Data/Road%20Data%202015/region_iv_a.htm |date=2017-04-07 }} by the [[Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines)|Department of Public Works and Highways]]</ref> [[Pan-Philippine Highway]] (N1/AH26), which comprises most of Manila South Road, and Quirino Highway (N68), the Quezon leg of [[Andaya Highway]] form the highway backbone network, and the secondary and tertiary roads interconnect most cities and municipalities, except for Infanta, Real, and General Nakar, whose highways used to access those municipalities interconnect with the national highway network in [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] and [[Rizal]] or [[Manila East Road]] and [[Marikina\u2013Infanta Highway|Marcos Highway.]] The provincial government maintains provincial roads which supplements the national roads.\n\nIn order to spur development in the province, several proposals have been made to expand the expressway network to Quezon.

Consisting of five ''Blocs'' (A - E), it was to be \"a small town within a city\" able to provide its residents with onsite facilities, including a theatre hall, a swimming pool, as well as other commercial services such as a restaurants and hairdressers.<ref>[http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/web2sn03755.en09.pdf R\u00c9SIDENCE PALACE Project Factsheet], Council of the European Union</ref>  The R\u00e9sidence Palace aimed to address the dual shortage of suitable property and domestic workers for the upper classes following the [[Rape of Belgium|destruction]] brought about during the war.

In 1988, the eastern part of the R\u00e9sidence Palace, ''Blocs'' ''D'' and ''E'' were demolished to make way for the construction of the [[Justus Lipsius building]] as the seat of the [[Council of the European Union]].  In 2002, the [[European Council]], the organisation gathering the EU's [[Head of state|Heads of State]]/[[Head of government|Government]] together, also began using the Justus Lipsius building as their Brussels venue. This followed an advanced implementation of a decision by European leaders during ratification of the [[Treaty of Nice|Nice Treaty]] to do so at such a time as the total membership of the European Union [[Enlargement of the European Union|surpassed 18 member states]]. Prior to this, the venue for European Council summits was in the member state that held the rotating [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]].  The resulting growing international media presence in the area led the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian Federal Government]] to develop Blocs ''C'' and ''B'' as the site of its new [[International Press Center (Brussels)|International Press Centre]].

Consisting of five ''Blocs'' (A - E), it was to be \"a small town within a city\" able to provide its residents with onsite facilities, including a theatre hall, a swimming pool, as well as other commercial services such as a restaurants and hairdressers.<ref>[http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/web2sn03755.en09.pdf R\u00c9SIDENCE PALACE Project Factsheet], Council of the European Union</ref>  The R\u00e9sidence Palace aimed to address the dual shortage of suitable property and domestic workers for the upper classes following the [[Rape of Belgium|destruction]] brought about during the war.  The foundation stone of the [[Art Deco]] building was laid on 30 May 1923 with the first residents moving in 1927.\n\nThe development, however, only had a short commercial success.

In 1988, the eastern part of the R\u00e9sidence Palace, ''Blocs'' ''D'' and ''E'' were demolished to make way for the construction of the [[Justus Lipsius building]] as the seat of the [[Council of the European Union]].  In 2002, the [[European Council]], the organisation gathering the EU's [[Head of state|Heads of State]]/[[Head of government|Government]] together, also began using the Justus Lipsius building as their Brussels venue. This followed an advanced implementation of a decision by European leaders during ratification of the [[Treaty of Nice|Nice Treaty]] to do so at such a time as the total membership of the European Union [[Enlargement of the European Union|surpassed 18 member states]]. Prior to this, the venue for European Council summits was in the member state that held the rotating [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]].  The resulting growing international media presence in the area led the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian Federal Government]] to develop Blocs ''C'' and ''B'' as the site of its new [[International Press Center (Brussels)|International Press Centre]]. A swimming pool and theatre were also maintained.\n\nHowever, in 2004 leaders decided the logistical problems created by the outdated facilities warranted the construction of a new purpose built seat able to cope with the nearly 6,000 meetings, working groups, and summits per year. This being despite a number of renovations to the Justus Lipsius building, including the conversion of an underground carpark into additional meeting rooms.

Heavy gradients in the [[Western Ghats]] necessitated the introduction of electric traction on the GIPR to [[Igatpuri]] on the North East line and [[Pune]] on the South East line. On 5 January 1928 1500 V DC traction was introduced on the suburban section of the [[Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway]] between [[Colaba]] and [[Borivili]], and between [[Madras]] Beach and [[Tambaram]] of the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway]] on 11 May 1931, to meet growing traffic needs.<ref name=\"ELECT\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.core.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,302,532 |title=Brief on Railway Electrification |access-date=1 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926072829/http://www.core.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,302,532 |archive-date=26 September 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The 3000 V DC electrification of the [[Howrah]]-[[Burdwan]] section of the [[Eastern Railway Zone (India)|Eastern Railway]] was completed in 1958.

Indian Railways decided in 1957 to adopt 25 kV AC as its standard, with SNCF their consultant in the early stages. The first 25 kV AC section was Raj Kharswan\u2013Dongoaposi on the [[South Eastern Railway Zone, India|South Eastern Railway]] in 1960. The first 25 kV AC [[electric multiple unit|EMUs]], for [[Kolkata]] suburban service, began service in September 1962. For continuity, the Howrah\u2013Burdwan section of the Eastern Railway and the Madras Beach\u2013Tambaram section of the Southern Railway were converted to 25 kV AC by 1968. Because of limitations in the DC traction system, a decision was made to convert the electric traction system of the Mumbai suburban rail network of WR and CR from 1.5kV DC to 25 kV AC in 1996\u201397. The conversion from DC to AC traction was completed in 2012 by Western Railway, and in 2016 by Central Railway. Since then, the entire electrified mainline rail network in India uses 25 kV AC, and DC traction is used only for metros and trams.<ref name=\"ELECT\"/>\n\n[[File:Railway Electrification Rate for Leading & Laggard State\u2019s of India 2018.png|thumb|left|Railway electrification rate for leading and laggard states of India]]\n[[File:Railway-Electrification-Trend-&-Roadmap-for-India-till-FY-2022.png|thumb|right|Railway electrification trend and road map for India until FY 2022]]\n\nIndian Railways announced on 31 March 2017 that the country's entire rail network would be electrified by 2022.<ref name=\"indianexpress.com\"/><ref name=\"enincon1\">{{cite web|url=https://enincon.com/report/railway-electrification-market-opportunities-in-india-2018/|title=Railway Electrification Market in India 2018|date=20 February 2018|publisher=Enincon|access-date=20 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230336/https://enincon.com/report/railway-electrification-market-opportunities-in-india-2018/|archive-date=20 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThough not a nascent concept, the electrification in India now has been committed with a fresh investment of {{INRConvert|35000|c}} to electrify the entire network and eliminate the cost of fuel under transportation which will amount to a massive savings of {{INRConvert|10500|c}} overall.

The fourth letter denoted the locomotive's chronological model number, but in 2002, a new classification was adopted in which the fourth letter in newer diesel locomotives indicate [[horsepower]] range.\n\nA locomotive may have a fifth letter in its name, denoting a technical variant, subclass, or sub-type (a variation in the basic model (or series) or a different motor or manufacturer). In the new diesel-locomotive classification, the fifth letter refines the horsepower in 100-hp increments: A for 100&nbsp;hp, B for 200&nbsp;hp, C for 300&nbsp;hp and so on. In this classification, a WDM-3A is a 3100&nbsp;hp, a WDM-3D a 3400&nbsp;hp and a WDM-3F a 3600&nbsp;hp locomotive.{{efn|This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives, which retained their original class names (such as M class or [[Indian locomotive class WP|WP class]]).}} Diesel locomotives are fitted with auxiliary power units, which save almost 88 percent of fuel during idle time when a train is not running.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Technology allows Railways to save Rs 20 Lakhs Diesel per Engine|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/09/new-technology-allows-railways-to-save-rs-20-lakhs-diesel-per-engine/|accessdate=6 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908145226/http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/09/new-technology-allows-railways-to-save-rs-20-lakhs-diesel-per-engine/|archive-date=8 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Goods wagons ===\n{{see also|Wagon numbering system in India|label 2=Wagon numbering system}}\nAs of March 2017, IR fleet consisted of 277,987 [[goods wagon]]s.

For continuity, the Howrah\u2013Burdwan section of the Eastern Railway and the Madras Beach\u2013Tambaram section of the Southern Railway were converted to 25 kV AC by 1968. Because of limitations in the DC traction system, a decision was made to convert the electric traction system of the Mumbai suburban rail network of WR and CR from 1.5kV DC to 25 kV AC in 1996\u201397. The conversion from DC to AC traction was completed in 2012 by Western Railway, and in 2016 by Central Railway.
