In 1960 he founded the ''avant garde'' literary journal ''[[Tel Quel]]'' (along with writer and art critic [[Marcelin Pleynet]]), which was published by Le Seuil and ran until 1982. Sollers then created the journal ''[[L'Infini]]'', published first by [[Denoel]], then by [[Gallimard]] with Sollers remaining as sole editor.\n\nSollers was at the heart of the period of intellectual unrest in the Paris of the 1960s and 1970s. He contributed to the publication of critics and thinkers such [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Roland Barthes]]. Some of them were later described in his novel, ''[[Femmes]]'' (1983) alongside other figures of French intellectualism active before and after [[May 1968 French civil unrest|May 1968]].\n\nHis writings and approach to language were examined and praised by French critic [[Roland Barthes]] in his book ''[[Writer Sollers]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Writer_Sollers.html?id=7-5cAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Writer Sollers|last=Barthes|first=Roland|date=1987|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9780485113372|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSollers married [[Julia Kristeva]] in 1967.\n\n==Biography==\nSollers was born as Philippe Joyaux In [[Talence]], where his family ran the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Joyaux Fr\u00e8res'', the iron factory ''Recalt'' producing material for kitchens, metal constructions and machines for the [[SNCASO]] under the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II]].<ref>[http://www.actuacity.com/talence_33400/monuments/page2 Usine de ferblanterie Recalt ; usine de chaudronnerie Boyer S.A.], Actuacity</ref> His parents were Octave Joyaux and Marcelle Molini\u00e9. He moved to Paris in 1955, studied at the [[Lyc\u00e9e priv\u00e9 Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]] of [[Versailles]] and at the [[ESSEC Business School]].<ref>Anna Topaloff, \" ESSEC, la business school qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 tout \", ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'', juillet 2015, pages 54\u201358.</ref>\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Philippe Sollers 1992.jpg|thumb|Philippe Sollers 1992]]\nFollowing his first novel ''A Strange Solitude'' (1958), hailed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]] and [[Louis Aragon]], Sollers began, with ''The Park'' (1961) the experiments in narrative form that would lead to ''Event'' (''Drame'', 1965) and ''Nombres'' (1968). [[Jacques Derrida]] analyzed these novels in his book ''Dissemination''. Sollers then attempted to counter the high seriousness of ''Nombres'' in ''Lois'' (1972), which featured greater linguistic vitality through the use of wordplay and a less formal style. The direction taken by ''Lois'' was developed through the heightened rhythmic intensity of non-punctuated texts such as ''Paradis'' (1981).\n[[File:Philippe Sollers \u00e0 Bordeaux dans le parc de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 familiale en 1937 avec sa m\u00e8re et sa soeur Annie.jpg|thumb|left|Philippe Sollers in Bordeaux in the homestead park in 1937 with his mother and his sister Annie.]]\nSollers's other novels include ''Women'' (1983), ''Portrait du joueur'' (1984), ''Le coeur absolu'' (1986), ''Watteau in Venice'' (1991), ''Studio'' (1997), ''Passion fixe'' (2000), ''L'\u00e9toile des amants'' (2002), which have all introduced a degree of realism to his fiction to the extent that they make more recognizable use of plot, character and thematic development. They offer the reader a clear fictional study of the society in which he or she lives by reinterpreting, among other things, the role of politics, media, sex, religion, and the arts.\n\nIn all these novels Sollers's interest in Chinese civilization plays an important part. From the late 1960s on, he studied Chinese and employed ideograms increasingly in his writings. He especially exemplifies this view in the subtitle of ''Lois'', a Chinese ideogram representing both \"France\" and \"Law.\"\n\nHis writings bear a particular focus on musicality. Vocalisation, or his preference for the spoken word, is seen a priority for Sollers. The combination of music, voice and theatre is especially found in opera. The kind of opera associated with Sollers should properly be called opera bouffe because of its sense of humour and love of irony: opera bouffe is a comical farcical type of opera from which the genius of [[Mozart]] sprang. In many ways Sollers is doing the work of the opera bouffe or ''drama giocoso'' in his novels since ''Women'' (1983). Since ''Lois'', the writing is musical: the references to the music in these books are innumerable. In ''Women'': \"Whoever understands nothing about music, understands nothing about metaphysics.\"<ref>Philippe Sollers, ''Women'', translated by Barbara Bray, Columbia, 1990 {{ISBN|9780704327917}}</ref>\n\nThe focus on the spoken language also draws Sollers toward [[James Joyce]].  Sollers is so fascinated by Joyce's style that he and Stephen Heath collaborated to translate Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' into French. In January 1975, Sollers gave a lecture to an international symposium on Joyce, claiming ''Finnegans Wake'' as \"the most formidable anti-fascist book produced between the two wars\".<ref>''The Reception of James Joyce in Europe'', A&C Black, 2009 ({{ISBN|9781847146014}})</ref> However, Joyce is much more than poetry for Sollers. Since both were educated by [[Jesuits]], Joyce and Sollers have strong ties to [[Catholicism]]. As Sollers indicated in ''Paradis'', Joycean Christianity, like Sollers' Catholicism, involves both the comic and the pathetic.\n\nThe novel ''Paradis'' has a particular flavour because the narrator is similar to a troubadour singing the story of postmodern times. The self seems to disappear as word games, puns, neologisms and misspellings create a text that is hallucinatory and humorous in its juxtaposition of seemingly incongruous words and phrases. There are constant references to orchestras and symphonies, thus suggesting that there is an innate structure to what appears at first glance to be a chaotic text. The text's life is much like the sexuality of the writer. There is a rhythm, very much like radar or sonar, according to which the text responds to its need to enjoy itself and also to reproduce itself. The physical drives and desires of the human body lead it toward variations of paradise.\n\nHis novels ''Femmes'' (1983) and ''Portrait de joueur'' (1984) have achieved a certain popularity. The first was translated into English as ''Women'' by Barbara Bray and published by Columbia University Press (1990). [[Philip Roth]]'s comment on the cover of ''Women'' says that Sollers is a \"master of good-natured malice, a kind of happy, lively, benign [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]].\"<ref>Philip Roth, \"Anybody out for a good time should read Philippe Sollers\", in Comments on ''Women'', Columbia University Press, 1990 ({{ISBN|0704327910}})</ref>\n\nOne of the reasons for the popularity of these books by Sollers is the sense of humour he exhibits with his narrative voice about the culture in which the voice thrives.\n\nIn his writing, Sollers has a place of predilection, a place that unites together the whole of his personal pantheon: [[Venice]]; [[Lorenzo Da Ponte|Da Ponte]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Tiziano]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Monteverdi]] and then [[Casanova]] \"the man whose name is synonymous with Venice\",<ref>Philippe Sollers, \"Casanova l'admirable\", Gallimard, 2000 ({{ISBN|9782070408917}})</ref> [[Vivant Denon]] and the [[Countess Albrizzi]]. In intimate experiences, expression, erudition, Sollers reveals the splendours of the Serenissima in a very personal ''Dictionnaire amoureux de Venise'' (2004).\n\nIn 2000 Sollers published ''[[Passion fixe]]'', a love story both immoral and moral.\n\nIn 2006 he published ''Une vie divine''. The narrator, a professor of philosophy, is entrusted with the task of discovering a world philosophy that would not exclude the religious dimension of humanity. Through his research and discussions with the two women in his life (one intellectual and the other frivolous) he discovers that only one thinker is strong enough to found a project of world philosophy: [[Nietzsche]]. In this novel, Philippe Sollers rises against contemporary nihilism \u2013 literature which he sees as locked into misfortune and melancholy \u2013 with which he contrasts promises of life and happiness. A political and philosophical novel, ''Une vie divine'' is both serious and humorous writing about the possibility of happiness, Nietzsche versus [[Schopenhauer]]. Its praises of joy alternate with sadness and ambient defeatism.\n\nIn 2016, Sollers published the novel ''Mouvement'' centring on [[Hegel]]'s philosophy and biography, with a radical rethinking of time and history.\n\nSollers also sees himself and his novels in an 18th-century lineage with philosophers of the [[French Enlightenment]] such as [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], and therefore does not break with all tradition.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Essays===\n* \"Complots \u2013 Gallimard, 2016\n* \"Portraits de femmes\" \u2013 Flammarion, 2013\n* \"Fugues\" \u2013 Gallimard, 2012\n* \"Discours

French writer and critic. In 1960 he founded the ''avant garde'' literary journal ''[[Tel Quel]]'' (along with writer and art critic [[Marcelin Pleynet]]), which was published by Le Seuil and ran until 1982. Sollers then created the journal ''[[L'Infini]]'', published first by [[Denoel]], then by [[Gallimard]] with Sollers remaining as sole editor.\n\nSollers was at the heart of the period of intellectual unrest in the Paris of the 1960s and 1970s. He contributed to the publication of critics and thinkers such [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Roland Barthes]]. Some of them were later described in his novel, ''[[Femmes]]'' (1983) alongside other figures of French intellectualism active before and after [[May 1968 French civil unrest|May 1968]].\n\nHis writings and approach to language were examined and praised by French critic [[Roland Barthes]] in his book ''[[Writer Sollers]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Writer_Sollers.html?id=7-5cAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Writer Sollers|last=Barthes|first=Roland|date=1987|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9780485113372|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSollers married [[Julia Kristeva]] in 1967.\n\n==Biography==\nSollers was born as Philippe Joyaux In [[Talence]], where his family ran the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Joyaux Fr\u00e8res'', the iron factory ''Recalt'' producing material for kitchens, metal constructions and machines for the [[SNCASO]] under the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II]].<ref>[http://www.actuacity.com/talence_33400/monuments/page2 Usine de ferblanterie Recalt ; usine de chaudronnerie Boyer S.A.], Actuacity</ref> His parents were Octave Joyaux and Marcelle Molini\u00e9. He moved to Paris in 1955, studied at the [[Lyc\u00e9e priv\u00e9 Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]] of [[Versailles]] and at the [[ESSEC Business School]].<ref>Anna Topaloff, \" ESSEC, la business school qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 tout \", ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'', juillet 2015, pages 54\u201358.</ref>\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Philippe Sollers 1992.jpg|thumb|Philippe Sollers 1992]]\nFollowing his first novel ''A Strange Solitude'' (1958), hailed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]] and [[Louis Aragon]], Sollers began, with ''The Park'' (1961) the experiments in narrative form that would lead to ''Event'' (''Drame'', 1965) and ''Nombres'' (1968). [[Jacques Derrida]] analyzed these novels in his book ''Dissemination''. Sollers then attempted to counter the high seriousness of ''Nombres'' in ''Lois'' (1972), which featured greater linguistic vitality through the use of wordplay and a less formal style. The direction taken by ''Lois'' was developed through the heightened rhythmic intensity of non-punctuated texts such as ''Paradis'' (1981).\n[[File:Philippe Sollers \u00e0 Bordeaux dans le parc de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 familiale en 1937 avec sa m\u00e8re et sa soeur Annie.jpg|thumb|left|Philippe Sollers in Bordeaux in the homestead park in 1937 with his mother and his sister Annie.]]\nSollers's other novels include ''Women'' (1983), ''Portrait du joueur'' (1984), ''Le coeur absolu'' (1986), ''Watteau in Venice'' (1991), ''Studio'' (1997), ''Passion fixe'' (2000), ''L'\u00e9toile des amants'' (2002), which have all introduced a degree of realism to his fiction to the extent that they make more recognizable use of plot, character and thematic development. They offer the reader a clear fictional study of the society in which he or she lives by reinterpreting, among other things, the role of politics, media, sex, religion, and the arts.\n\nIn all these novels Sollers's interest in Chinese civilization plays an important part. From the late 1960s on, he studied Chinese and employed ideograms increasingly in his writings. He especially exemplifies this view in the subtitle of ''Lois'', a Chinese ideogram representing both \"France\" and \"Law.\"\n\nHis writings bear a particular focus on musicality. Vocalisation, or his preference for the spoken word, is seen a priority for Sollers. The combination of music, voice and theatre is especially found in opera. The kind of opera associated with Sollers should properly be called opera bouffe because of its sense of humour and love of irony: opera bouffe is a comical farcical type of opera from which the genius of [[Mozart]] sprang. In many ways Sollers is doing the work of the opera bouffe or ''drama giocoso'' in his novels since ''Women'' (1983). Since ''Lois'', the writing is musical: the references to the music in these books are innumerable. In ''Women'': \"Whoever understands nothing about music, understands nothing about metaphysics.\"<ref>Philippe Sollers, ''Women'', translated by Barbara Bray, Columbia, 1990 {{ISBN|9780704327917}}</ref>\n\nThe focus on the spoken language also draws Sollers toward [[James Joyce]].  Sollers is so fascinated by Joyce's style that he and Stephen Heath collaborated to translate Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' into French. In January 1975, Sollers gave a lecture to an international symposium on Joyce, claiming ''Finnegans Wake'' as \"the most formidable anti-fascist book produced between the two wars\".<ref>''The Reception of James Joyce in Europe'', A&C Black, 2009 ({{ISBN|9781847146014}})</ref> However, Joyce is much more than poetry for Sollers. Since both were educated by [[Jesuits]], Joyce and Sollers have strong ties to [[Catholicism]]. As Sollers indicated in ''Paradis'', Joycean Christianity, like Sollers' Catholicism, involves both the comic and the pathetic.\n\nThe novel ''Paradis'' has a particular flavour because the narrator is similar to a troubadour singing the story of postmodern times. The self seems to disappear as word games, puns, neologisms and misspellings create a text that is hallucinatory and humorous in its juxtaposition of seemingly incongruous words and phrases. There are constant references to orchestras and symphonies, thus suggesting that there is an innate structure to what appears at first glance to be a chaotic text. The text's life is much like the sexuality of the writer. There is a rhythm, very much like radar or sonar, according to which the text responds to its need to enjoy itself and also to reproduce itself. The physical drives and desires of the human body lead it toward variations of paradise.\n\nHis novels ''Femmes'' (1983) and ''Portrait de joueur'' (1984) have achieved a certain popularity. The first was translated into English as ''Women'' by Barbara Bray and published by Columbia University Press (1990). [[Philip Roth]]'s comment on the cover of ''Women'' says that Sollers is a \"master of good-natured malice, a kind of happy, lively, benign [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]].\"<ref>Philip Roth, \"Anybody out for a good time should read Philippe Sollers\", in Comments on ''Women'', Columbia University Press, 1990 ({{ISBN|0704327910}})</ref>\n\nOne of the reasons for the popularity of these books by Sollers is the sense of humour he exhibits with his narrative voice about the culture in which the voice thrives.\n\nIn his writing, Sollers has a place of predilection, a place that unites together the whole of his personal pantheon: [[Venice]]; [[Lorenzo Da Ponte|Da Ponte]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Tiziano]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Monteverdi]] and then [[Casanova]] \"the man whose name is synonymous with Venice\",<ref>Philippe Sollers, \"Casanova l'admirable\", Gallimard, 2000 ({{ISBN|9782070408917}})</ref> [[Vivant Denon]] and the [[Countess Albrizzi]]. In intimate experiences, expression, erudition, Sollers reveals the splendours of the Serenissima in a very personal ''Dictionnaire amoureux de Venise'' (2004).\n\nIn 2000 Sollers published ''[[Passion fixe]]'', a love story both immoral and moral.\n\nIn 2006 he published ''Une vie divine''. The narrator, a professor of philosophy, is entrusted with the task of discovering a world philosophy that would not exclude the religious dimension of humanity. Through his research and discussions with the two women in his life (one intellectual and the other frivolous) he discovers that only one thinker is strong enough to found a project of world philosophy: [[Nietzsche]]. In this novel, Philippe Sollers rises against contemporary nihilism \u2013 literature which he sees as locked into misfortune and melancholy \u2013 with which he contrasts promises of life and happiness. A political and philosophical novel, ''Une vie divine'' is both serious and humorous writing about the possibility of happiness, Nietzsche versus [[Schopenhauer]]. Its praises of joy alternate with sadness and ambient defeatism.\n\nIn 2016, Sollers published the novel ''Mouvement'' centring on [[Hegel]]'s philosophy and biography, with a radical rethinking of time and history.\n\nSollers also sees himself and his novels in an 18th-century lineage with philosophers of the [[French Enlightenment|French Enlightnement]] such as [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], and therefore does not break with all tradition.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Essays===\n* \"Complots \u2013 Gallimard, 2016\n* \"Portraits de femmes\" \u2013 Flammarion, 2013\n* \"Fugues\" \u2013

He also wrote for ''[[Architectural Digest]]''.\n\nHe was survived by three sons: Alexander, a noted historian; Aristodemos, who works in intelligence; and Constantine, also a journalist.\n\n==Works==\n(partial list)\n*''The Multiversity: A Personal Report on What Happens to Today's Students at American Universities''\n*''We Are the People Our Parents Warned Us Against''\n*''Mississippi Notebook''\n*''Two, Three, Many More'' (novel)\n*''Organized Crimes'' (novel)\n*''Citizen Cohn'' (1988)\n*''Capitalist Fools: Tales of American Business, from Carnegie to Forbes to the Milken Gang''\n*''Hoax: Why Americans Are Suckered by White House Lies''\n*''Geneva'' (play)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=News&prodId=BIC1&action=e&windowstate=normal&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CA94882390&mode=view&userGroupName=fairfax_main&jsid=7ba6a0cb9ff550f70999212f98a7e713|title=Biography in Context \u2013 Document: \"Turning a black businesswoman into a token in a debut effort\"|website=ic.galegroup.com|url-access=registration|accessdate=February 3, 2018}}</ref>\n*''Radical: A Portrait of Saul Alinsky'' (Nation Books, July 2010)\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 1988, fictional presidential candidate Jack Tanner named von Hoffman as his pick for [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|Chairman]] of the [[Federal Reserve Board]] in [[Robert Altman]]'s [[HBO]] series ''[[Tanner '88]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book|last=Roberts |first=Chalmers M. <!-- |authorlink=Chalmers M.

He was formally known as Count ''[[Don (honorific)|don]]'' Luchino Visconti di Modrone, and his family is a branch of the [[Visconti of Milan]]. In his early years, he was exposed to art, music and theatre: he studied cello with the Italian cellist and composer [[Lorenzo de Paolis]] (1890\u20131965) and met the composer [[Giacomo Puccini]], the conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the writer [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Visconti joined the [[Italian Communist Party]].\n\nVisconti made no secret of his [[bisexuality]]. His last partner was the [[Austria]]n actor [[Helmut Berger]], who played Martin in Visconti's film ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/damned-1970-2 |title= The Damned |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n.

He died in Rome of another stroke at the age of 69, on 17 March 1976. There is a museum dedicated to the director's work in [[Ischia]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Films===\nHe began his filmmaking career as an assistant director on [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[Toni (1935 film)|Toni]]'' (1935) and ''[[Partie de campagne]]'' (1936) through the intercession of their common friend [[Coco Chanel]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Visconti: Explorations of Beauty and Decay|last=Bacon|first=Henry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780521599603|location=Cambridge|pages=6}}</ref> After a short tour of the United States, where he visited Hollywood, he returned to Italy to be Renoir's assistant again, this time for ''[[Tosca (1941 film)|Tosca]]'' (1941), a production that was interrupted and later completed by German director [[Karl Koch (director)|Karl Koch]].\n\nTogether with [[Roberto Rossellini]], Visconti joined the ''[[Salon (gathering)|salotto]]'' of [[Vittorio Mussolini]] (the son of [[Benito Mussolini|Benito]], who was then the national arbitrator for cinema and other arts). Here he presumably also met [[Federico Fellini]]. With Gianni Puccini, [[Antonio Pietrangeli]] and [[Giuseppe De Santis]], he wrote the screenplay for his first film as director: ''[[Ossessione]]'' (''Obsession'', 1943), one of the first [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]] movies and an unofficial adaptation of the novel ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=Visconti: Explorations of Beauty and Decay|last=Bacon|first=Henry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780521599603|location=Cambridge|pages=14}}</ref>''.''\n\nIn 1948, he wrote and directed ''[[La terra trema]]'' (''The Earth Trembles''), based on the novel ''I Malavoglia'' by [[Giovanni Verga]]. \nVisconti continued working throughout the 1950s, but he veered away from the neorealist path with his 1954 film, ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'', shot in colour. Based on the novella by [[Camillo Boito]], it is set in Austrian-occupied Venice in 1866. In this film, Visconti combines [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[romanticism]] as a way to break away from neorealism. However, as one biographer notes, \"Visconti without [[Italian neorealism|neorealism]] is like [[Fritz Lang|Lang]] without [[expressionism]] and [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] without [[Formalist film theory|formalism]]\".<ref>Nowell-Smith, p. 9.</ref> He describes the film as the \"most Viscontian\" of all Visconti's films. Visconti returned to neorealism once more with ''[[Rocco and His Brothers|Rocco e i suoi fratelli]]'' (''Rocco and His Brothers'', 1960), the story of Southern Italians who migrate to Milan hoping to find financial stability. In 1961, he was a member of the jury at the [[2nd Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1961\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |title=2nd Moscow International Film Festival (1961) |accessdate=4 November 2012 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116210653/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |archivedate=16 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Visconti's films became more personal. ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (''The Leopard'', 1963) is based on [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa|Lampedusa]]'s [[The Leopard|novel of the same name]] about the decline of the Sicilian aristocracy at the time of the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]. It starred American actor [[Burt Lancaster]] in the role of Prince Don Fabrizio. This film was distributed in America and Britain by [[Twentieth-Century Fox]], which deleted important scenes. Visconti repudiated the Twentieth-Century Fox version.\n\nIt was not until ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]'' (1969) that Visconti received a nomination for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Screenplay. The film, one of Visconti's better known works, concerns a German industrialist's family which begins to disintegrate during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] consolidation of power in the 1930s. Its decadence and lavish beauty are characteristic of Visconti's aesthetic.\n\nVisconti's final film was ''[[The Innocent (1976 film)|The Innocent]]'' (1976), in which he returns to his recurring interest in infidelity and betrayal.\n\n===Theatre===\nVisconti was also a celebrated theatre and [[opera]] director. During the years 1946 to 1960 he directed many performances of the [[Rina Morelli]]-[[Paolo Stoppa]] Company with actor [[Vittorio Gassman]] as well as many celebrated productions of operas.\n\nVisconti's love of opera is evident in the 1954 ''Senso'', where the beginning of the film shows scenes from the fourth act of ''[[Il trovatore]]'', which were filmed at the [[Teatro La Fenice]] in Venice. Beginning when he directed a production at Milan's [[Teatro alla Scala]] of ''[[La vestale]]'' in December 1954, his career included a famous revival of ''[[La traviata]]'' at [[La Scala]] in 1955 with [[Maria Callas]] and an equally famous ''[[Anna Bolena]]'' (also at La Scala) in 1957 with Callas. A significant 1958 [[Royal Opera House]] (London) production of Verdi's five-act Italian version of ''[[Don Carlos]]'' (with [[Jon Vickers]]) followed, along with a ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' in [[Spoleto]] in 1958 and a famous black-and-white ''[[Il trovatore]]'' with scenery and costumes by [[Filippo Sanjust]] at the Royal Opera House in 1964. In 1966 Visconti's luscious ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' for the [[Vienna State Opera]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] was critically acclaimed. On the other hand, his austere 1969 ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'' with the singers clothed in geometrical costumes provoked controversy.\n\n===Filmography===\n\n====Feature films====\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

He was formally known as Count ''[[Don (honorific)|don]]'' Luchino Visconti di Modrone, and his family is a branch of the [[Visconti of Milan]]. In his early years, he was exposed to art, music and theatre: he studied cello with the Italian cellist and composer [[Lorenzo de Paolis]] (1890\u20131965) and met the composer [[Giacomo Puccini]], the conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the writer [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Visconti joined the [[Italian Communist Party]].\n\nVisconti made no secret of his [[Bisexuality]]. His last partner was the [[Austria]]n actor [[Helmut Berger]], who played Martin in Visconti's film ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/damned-1970-2 |title= The Damned |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n.

He died in Rome of another stroke at the age of 69, on 17 March 1976. There is a museum dedicated to the director's work in [[Ischia]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Films===\nHe began his filmmaking career as an assistant director on [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[Toni (1935 film)|Toni]]'' (1935) and ''[[Partie de campagne]]'' (1936) through the intercession of their common friend [[Coco Chanel]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Visconti: Explorations of Beauty and Decay|last=Bacon|first=Henry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780521599603|location=Cambridge|pages=6}}</ref> After a short tour of the United States, where he visited Hollywood, he returned to Italy to be Renoir's assistant again, this time for ''[[Tosca (1941 film)|Tosca]]'' (1941), a production that was interrupted and later completed by German director [[Karl Koch (director)|Karl Koch]].\n\nTogether with [[Roberto Rossellini]], Visconti joined the ''[[Salon (gathering)|salotto]]'' of [[Vittorio Mussolini]] (the son of [[Benito Mussolini|Benito]], who was then the national arbitrator for cinema and other arts). Here he presumably also met [[Federico Fellini]]. With Gianni Puccini, [[Antonio Pietrangeli]] and [[Giuseppe De Santis]], he wrote the screenplay for his first film as director: ''[[Ossessione]]'' (''Obsession'', 1943), one of the first [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]] movies and an unofficial adaptation of the novel ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=Visconti: Explorations of Beauty and Decay|last=Bacon|first=Henry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780521599603|location=Cambridge|pages=14}}</ref>''.''\n\nIn 1948, he wrote and directed ''[[La terra trema]]'' (''The Earth Trembles''), based on the novel ''I Malavoglia'' by [[Giovanni Verga]]. \nVisconti continued working throughout the 1950s, but he veered away from the neorealist path with his 1954 film, ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'', shot in colour. Based on the novella by [[Camillo Boito]], it is set in Austrian-occupied Venice in 1866. In this film, Visconti combines [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[romanticism]] as a way to break away from neorealism. However, as one biographer notes, \"Visconti without [[Italian neorealism|neorealism]] is like [[Fritz Lang|Lang]] without [[expressionism]] and [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] without [[Formalist film theory|formalism]]\".<ref>Nowell-Smith, p. 9.</ref> He describes the film as the \"most Viscontian\" of all Visconti's films. Visconti returned to neorealism once more with ''[[Rocco and His Brothers|Rocco e i suoi fratelli]]'' (''Rocco and His Brothers'', 1960), the story of Southern Italians who migrate to Milan hoping to find financial stability. In 1961, he was a member of the jury at the [[2nd Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1961\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |title=2nd Moscow International Film Festival (1961) |accessdate=4 November 2012 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116210653/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |archivedate=16 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Visconti's films became more personal. ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (''The Leopard'', 1963) is based on [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa|Lampedusa]]'s [[The Leopard|novel of the same name]] about the decline of the Sicilian aristocracy at the time of the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]. It starred American actor [[Burt Lancaster]] in the role of Prince Don Fabrizio. This film was distributed in America and Britain by [[Twentieth-Century Fox]], which deleted important scenes. Visconti repudiated the Twentieth-Century Fox version.\n\nIt was not until ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]'' (1969) that Visconti received a nomination for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Screenplay. The film, one of Visconti's better known works, concerns a German industrialist's family which begins to disintegrate during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] consolidation of power in the 1930s. Its decadence and lavish beauty are characteristic of Visconti's aesthetic.\n\nVisconti's final film was ''[[The Innocent (1976 film)|The Innocent]]'' (1976), in which he returns to his recurring interest in infidelity and betrayal.\n\n===Theatre===\nVisconti was also a celebrated theatre and [[opera]] director. During the years 1946 to 1960 he directed many performances of the [[Rina Morelli]]-[[Paolo Stoppa]] Company with actor [[Vittorio Gassman]] as well as many celebrated productions of operas.\n\nVisconti's love of opera is evident in the 1954 ''Senso'', where the beginning of the film shows scenes from the fourth act of ''[[Il trovatore]]'', which were filmed at the [[Teatro La Fenice]] in Venice. Beginning when he directed a production at Milan's [[Teatro alla Scala]] of ''[[La vestale]]'' in December 1954, his career included a famous revival of ''[[La traviata]]'' at [[La Scala]] in 1955 with [[Maria Callas]] and an equally famous ''[[Anna Bolena]]'' (also at La Scala) in 1957 with Callas. A significant 1958 [[Royal Opera House]] (London) production of Verdi's five-act Italian version of ''[[Don Carlos]]'' (with [[Jon Vickers]]) followed, along with a ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' in [[Spoleto]] in 1958 and a famous black-and-white ''[[Il trovatore]]'' with scenery and costumes by [[Filippo Sanjust]] at the Royal Opera House in 1964. In 1966 Visconti's luscious ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' for the [[Vienna State Opera]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] was critically acclaimed. On the other hand, his austere 1969 ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'' with the singers clothed in geometrical costumes provoked controversy.\n\n===Filmography===\n\n====Feature films====\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

It stands on the [[River Trent]], the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] \u2013 on the route of the ancient [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] \u2013 and the [[East Coast Main Line]] railway. The origins of the town are possibly [[Roman Britain|Roman]], as it lies on an important Roman road, the [[Fosse Way]]. The town grew around [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], now ruined, and a large market place, now lined with historic buildings. It was a centre for the wool and cloth trades. In the [[English Civil War]], it was besieged by [[Roundheads|Parliamentary forces]] and [[Relief of Newark|relieved]] by [[Cavaliers|Royalist forces]] under [[Prince Rupert]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:UK NewarkonTrent.jpg|thumb|right|Signpost in Newark-on-Trent]]\n\n===Early history===\nThe place-name Newark is first attested in the [[Cartulary]] of [[Eynsham Abbey]] in Oxfordshire, where it appears as ''Newercha'' in about 1054\u20131057 and ''Niweweorche'' in about 1075\u20131092. It appears as ''Newerche'' in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]]. The name means 'New work', with the apparent meaning of \"New fort\".<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p. 339.</ref>\n\nThe origins of the town are possibly [[Roman Britain|Roman]], due to its position on an important Roman road, the [[Fosse Way]]. In a document which purports to be a charter of AD 664, Newark is mentioned as having been granted to the [[Peterborough Cathedral|Abbey of Peterborough]] by King [[Wulfhere of Mercia]]. An [[Anglo-Saxon pagan]] cemetery, used from the early 5th to early 7th centuries, has been found in Millgate, Newark, close to the Fosse Way and the River Trent. There cremated remains were buried in pottery urns.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Millgate, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire.

After the [[Norman Conquest]] Stow Minster retained the revenues of Newark, but it came under the control of the Norman Bishop [[Remigius de F\u00e9camp]]. After his death, control passed to the Bishops of Lincoln from 1092 until the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. There were [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in Newark at the time of the [[Domesday]] survey, and in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] there is evidence that it had long been a [[borough]] by prescription. The [[Newark wapentake]] in the east of Nottinghamshire was established in the period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] rule (10th\u201311th centuries).\n\n===Medieval to Stuart period===\n[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] was originally a [[Saxon]] fortified [[manor house]] founded by King Edward the Elder. In 1073, [[Robert Bloet]], Bishop of Lincoln, founded an [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] [[motte and bailey|motte-and-bailey]] fortress on the site. The river bridge was built about this time under a charter from [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as was St Leonard's Hospital. The bishop also gained from the king a charter to hold a five-day fair at the castle each year, and under King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] to establish a mint. [[John, King of England|King John]] died of [[dysentery]] in Newark Castle in 1216.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Greig |title=King John: Dysentery and the death that changed history |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37641202 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111204955/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37641202 |archivedate=11 November 2017 |df=dmy-all|date=19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe town became a local centre for the wool and cloth trade \u2013 by the time of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] a major market was established.

The dissolution affected Newark's political landscape, and even more radical changes came in 1547, when the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] exchanged ownership of the town with the Crown. Newark was incorporated under an [[alderman]] and twelve assistants in 1549, and the charter was confirmed and extended by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\n[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] reincorporated the town under a [[mayor]] and aldermen, owing to its increasing commercial prosperity. This charter, except for a temporary surrender under [[James II of England|James II]], continued to govern the corporation until the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].\n\n===The Civil War===\n[[File:Siege piece shilling from Newark-on-Trent.JPG|thumb|right|A makeshift royalist [[Shilling (English coin)|shilling]] (siege piece) made from silver plate during the siege]]\n{{See also|Relief of Newark|Siege money (Newark)}}\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Newark was a mainstay of the Royalist cause, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] having raised his standard in nearby [[Nottingham]]. \"Newark was besieged on three occasions and finally surrendered only when ordered to do so by [[Charles I of England|the King]] after his own surrender.\"<ref>[http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF Newark Civil War Trail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613195933/http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF |date=13 June 2011}}.</ref> It was attacked in February 1643 by two troops of horsemen, but beat them back. The town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers, and raided [[Nottingham]], [[Grantham]], [[Northampton]], [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and other places with mixed success, but enough to cause it to rise to national notice. At the end of 1644 it was besieged by forces from Nottingham, [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Derby]], until relieved in March by [[Prince Rupert]].\n\nParliament commenced a new siege towards the end of January 1645 after more raiding, but this was relieved about a month later by Sir [[Marmaduke Langdale]]. Newark cavalry fought with the king's forces, which were decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Naseby]], near [[Leicester]] in June 1645.\n\nThe final siege began in November 1645, by which time the town's defences had been greatly strengthened. Two major forts had been constructed just outside the town, one called the [[Queen's Sconce]] to the south-west, and another, the King's Sconce, to the north-east, both close to the river, with defensive walls and a water-filled ditch of 2\u00bc miles around the town. The King's May 1646 order to surrender was only accepted under protest by the town's garrison. After that, much of the defences was destroyed, including the Castle, which was left in essentially the state it can be seen today. The Queen's Sconce was left largely untouched and its remains are in [[Sconce and Devon Park]].\n\n===Georgian era and early 19th century===\n[[File:Newark Castle and bridge London Published by J Deeley, 95 Bewick St Soho, 1812 Coloured aquatint.jpg|thumb|[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] c. 1812]]\nAround 1770 the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] around Newark (now the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]) was raised on a long series of arches to ensure it remained clear of the regular floods. A special [[Act of Parliament]] in 1773 allowed the creation of a town hall next to the Market Place. Designed by [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr of York]] and completed in 1776, Newark Town Hall is now a Grade I listed building. In 1775 the [[Duke of Newcastle]], at the time the Lord of the Manor and a major landowner in the area, built a new brick bridge with stone facing to replace a dilapidated one next to the Castle. This is still one of the town's major thoroughfares today.\n\nA noted 18th-century advocate of reform in Newark was the local printer and newspaper owner Daniel Holt (1766\u20131799). He was imprisoned for printing a leaflet advocating parliamentary reform, and for selling a pamphlet by [[Thomas Paine]].<ref>An account of Holt's life by Alan Dorling appears in the ''Nottinghamshire Historian'' journal, spring/summer 2000, pp. 9\u201315, with further detail in the autumn/winter edition of 2003, pp. 8\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn a milieu of parliamentary reform, the Duke of Newcastle evicted over a hundred tenants at Newark whom he believed to support directly or indirectly at the 1829 elections the Liberal/Radical candidate (Wilde), rather than his candidate, (Michael Sadler, a progressive Conservative).<ref>See the report in Cornelius BROWN 1907, ii, 243 following; and the report in the ''Times'' for 7 October 1829.

Baxter, a schoolboy in Newark in 1830\u20131840, contributed to ''The Hungry Forties: Life under the Bread Tax'' (London, 1904), a book about the [[Corn Laws]]: \"Chartists and rioters came from Nottingham into Newark, parading the streets with penny loaves dripped in blood carried on pikes, crying 'Bread or blood'.\"\n\n===19th\u201321st centuries===\nMany new buildings and much industry appeared in the [[Victorian era]]. The new buildings included the Independent Chapel (1822), Holy Trinity (1836\u20131837), Christ Church (1837), Castle Railway Station (1846), the Wesleyan Chapel (1846), the Corn Exchange (1848), the Methodist New Connexion Chapel (1848), W. N.

These changes and associated industrial expansion raised the population from under 7,000 in 1800 to over 15,000 by the end of the 19th century.

It is also prosperous: 77 per cent of people are employed, according to the latest ONS data, compared with a national average of 72 per cent. Earnings are 7 per cent above the average in the surrounding East Midlands.\n\n==Geography==\nNewark lies on the River Trent, with the [[River Devon, Nottinghamshire|River Devon]] also running through the town. Standing at the intersection of the Great North Road and the [[Fosse Way]], Newark originally grew around [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], now ruined, and a large market place now lined with historic buildings.\n\nNewark forms a continuous built-up area with the neighbouring parish of [[Balderton]] to the south-east. To the south, along the [[A46 road]], is [[Farndon, Nottinghamshire|Farndon]], and to the north [[Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire|Winthorpe]].\n\nNewark's growth and development have both been enhanced by having one of few bridges over the River Trent, by the navigability of the river, by the presence of the Great North Road (the A1, etc.), and later by the advance of the railways, bringing a junction between the [[East Coast Main Line]] and the [[Nottingham]] to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] route. \"Newark became a substantial inland port, particularly for the wool trade,\"<ref>Andrew Nicholson, [http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm ''Newark-on-Trent''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030075724/http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm |date=30 October 2009}} at Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway.</ref> though it industrialised to some extent in the Victorian era, and later with an ironworks, engineering, brewing, and a sugar refinery.\n\nThe A1 [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/77611 bypass] was opened in 1964 by the then Minister of Transport, [[Ernest Marples]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1|title=The A1 By-Pass |website=Winthorpe Village, Nottinghamshire |accessdate=5 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028043328/https://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1 |archivedate=28 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The single-carriageway, \u00a334-million A46 opened in October 1990.\n\n==Governance==\n{{main|Newark (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nNewark returned two representatives to the [[Unreformed House of Commons]] from 1673. It was the last borough to be created before the Reform Act. [[William Ewart Gladstone]], later [[Prime Minister]], became its [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in 1832 and was re-elected in 1835, 1837 and 1841 (twice), but possibly due to his support of the [[repeal]] of the [[Corn Laws]] and other issues he stood elsewhere after that time.\n\nRecently, Newark elections have been central to two interesting legal cases. In 1945, a challenge to [[Harold Laski]], the Chairman of the [[National Executive Committee]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led Laski to sue the ''[[Daily Express]]'' when it reported him as saying that Labour might take power through violence if defeated at the polls. Laski vehemently denied saying this, but lost the libel action. In the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Newark returned [[Fiona Jones]] of the Labour Party.

Of the output, 250,000 tonnes are processed and supplied to food and drink manufacturers in the UK and across Europe. At the heart of the Newark factory's operations is a combined heat and power (CHP) plant, with boilers fuelled by natural gas to meet the site's steam and electricity requirements and contribute to the grid enough power for 800 homes. The installation is rated under the government CHP environmental quality-assurance scheme.\n\nAnother employer is [[Ransome & Marles|a bearings factory]] (part of the [[NSK Ltd.|NSK]] group) with some 200 employees.

In a document which purports to be a charter of AD 664, Newark is mentioned as having been granted to the [[Peterborough Cathedral|Abbey of Peterborough]] by King [[Wulfhere of Mercia]]. An [[Anglo-Saxon pagan]] cemetery, used from the early 5th to early 7th centuries, has been found in Millgate, Newark, close to the Fosse Way and the River Trent.

After the [[Norman Conquest]] Stow Minster retained the revenues of Newark, but it came under the control of the Norman Bishop [[Remigius de F\u00e9camp]]. After his death, control passed to the Bishops of Lincoln from 1092 until the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. There were [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in Newark at the time of the [[Domesday]] survey, and in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] there is evidence that it had long been a [[borough]] by prescription.

In 1073, [[Robert Bloet]], Bishop of Lincoln, founded an [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] [[motte and bailey|motte-and-bailey]] fortress on the site. The river bridge was built about this time under a charter from [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as was St Leonard's Hospital. The bishop also gained from the king a charter to hold a five-day fair at the castle each year, and under King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] to establish a mint.

Newark was incorporated under an [[alderman]] and twelve assistants in 1549, and the charter was confirmed and extended by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\n[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] reincorporated the town under a [[mayor]] and aldermen, owing to its increasing commercial prosperity. This charter, except for a temporary surrender under [[James II of England|James II]], continued to govern the corporation until the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].\n\n===The Civil War===\n[[File:Siege piece shilling from Newark-on-Trent.JPG|thumb|right|A makeshift royalist [[Shilling (English coin)|shilling]] (siege piece) made from silver plate during the siege]]\n{{See also|Relief of Newark|Siege money (Newark)}}\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Newark was a mainstay of the Royalist cause, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] having raised his standard in nearby [[Nottingham]]. \"Newark was besieged on three occasions and finally surrendered only when ordered to do so by [[Charles I of England|the King]] after his own surrender.\"<ref>[http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF Newark Civil War Trail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613195933/http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF |date=13 June 2011}}.</ref> It was attacked in February 1643 by two troops of horsemen, but beat them back. The town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers, and raided [[Nottingham]], [[Grantham]], [[Northampton]], [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and other places with mixed success, but enough to cause it to rise to national notice. At the end of 1644 it was besieged by forces from Nottingham, [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Derby]], until relieved in March by [[Prince Rupert]].\n\nParliament commenced a new siege towards the end of January 1645 after more raiding, but this was relieved about a month later by Sir [[Marmaduke Langdale]]. Newark cavalry fought with the king's forces, which were decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Naseby]], near [[Leicester]] in June 1645.\n\nThe final siege began in November 1645, by which time the town's defences had been greatly strengthened. Two major forts had been constructed just outside the town, one called the [[Queen's Sconce]] to the south-west, and another, the King's Sconce, to the north-east, both close to the river, with defensive walls and a water-filled ditch of 2\u00bc miles around the town. The King's May 1646 order to surrender was only accepted under protest by the town's garrison. After that, much of the defences was destroyed, including the Castle, which was left in essentially the state it can be seen today. The Queen's Sconce was left largely untouched and its remains are in [[Sconce and Devon Park]].\n\n===Georgian era and early 19th century===\n[[File:Newark Castle and bridge London Published by J Deeley, 95 Bewick St Soho, 1812 Coloured aquatint.jpg|thumb|[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] c. 1812]]\nAround 1770 the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] around Newark (now the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]) was raised on a long series of arches to ensure it remained clear of the regular floods. A special [[Act of Parliament]] in 1773 allowed the creation of a town hall next to the Market Place. Designed by [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr of York]] and completed in 1776, Newark Town Hall is now a Grade I listed building. In 1775 the [[Duke of Newcastle]], at the time the Lord of the Manor and a major landowner in the area, built a new brick bridge with stone facing to replace a dilapidated one next to the Castle. This is still one of the town's major thoroughfares today.\n\nA noted 18th-century advocate of reform in Newark was the local printer and newspaper owner Daniel Holt (1766\u20131799). He was imprisoned for printing a leaflet advocating parliamentary reform, and for selling a pamphlet by [[Thomas Paine]].<ref>An account of Holt's life by Alan Dorling appears in the ''Nottinghamshire Historian'' journal, spring/summer 2000, pp. 9\u201315, with further detail in the autumn/winter edition of 2003, pp. 8\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn a milieu of parliamentary reform, the Duke of Newcastle evicted over a hundred tenants at Newark whom he believed to support directly or indirectly at the 1829 elections the Liberal/Radical candidate (Wilde), rather than his candidate, (Michael Sadler, a progressive Conservative).<ref>See the report in Cornelius BROWN 1907, ii, 243 following; and the report in the ''Times'' for 7 October 1829. A report in the ''Times'' of 10 September 1832 lists ten of the evicted people by name and address.</ref>\n\nJ. S. Baxter, a schoolboy in Newark in 1830\u20131840, contributed to ''The Hungry Forties: Life under the Bread Tax'' (London, 1904), a book about the [[Corn Laws]]: \"Chartists and rioters came from Nottingham into Newark, parading the streets with penny loaves dripped in blood carried on pikes, crying 'Bread or blood'.\"\n\n===19th\u201321st centuries===\nMany new buildings and much industry appeared in the [[Victorian era]]. The new buildings included the Independent Chapel (1822), Holy Trinity (1836\u20131837), Christ Church (1837), Castle Railway Station (1846), the Wesleyan Chapel (1846), the Corn Exchange (1848), the Methodist New Connexion Chapel (1848), W. N. Nicholson Trent Ironworks (1840s), Northgate Railway Station (1851), North End Wesleyan Chapel (1868), St Leonard's Anglican Church (1873), the Baptist Chapel (1876), the Primitive Methodist Chapel (1878), [[Newark Hospital]] (1881), Ossington Coffee Palace (1882), Gilstrap Free Library (1883), the Market Hall (1884), the Unitarian Chapel (1884), the Fire Station (1889), the Waterworks (1898), and the School of Science and Art (1900). These changes and associated industrial expansion raised the population from under 7,000 in 1800 to over 15,000 by the end of the 19th century.

A special plot was set aside in Newark Cemetery for RAF burials and this is now the war graves plot, where all but ten of the 90 Commonwealth and all of the 397 Polish burials were made. The cemetery also contains 49 scattered burials from the [[First World War]].

It is also prosperous: 77 per cent of people are employed, according to the latest ONS data, compared with a national average of 72 per cent. Earnings are 7 per cent above the average in the surrounding East Midlands.\n\n==Geography==\nNewark lies on the River Trent, with the [[River Devon, Nottinghamshire|River Devon]] also running through the town. Standing at the intersection of the Great North Road and the [[Fosse Way]], Newark originally grew around [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], now ruined, and a large market place now lined with historic buildings.\n\nNewark forms a continuous built-up area with the neighbouring parish of [[Balderton]] to the south-east. To the south, along the [[A46 road]], is [[Farndon, Nottinghamshire|Farndon]], and to the north [[Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire|Winthorpe]].\n\nNewark's growth and development have both been enhanced by having one of few bridges over the River Trent, by the navigability of the river, by the presence of the Great North Road (the A1, etc.), and later by the advance of the railways, bringing a junction between the [[East Coast Main Line]] and the [[Nottingham]] to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] route. \"Newark became a substantial inland port, particularly for the wool trade,\"<ref>Andrew Nicholson, [http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm ''Newark-on-Trent''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030075724/http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm |date=30 October 2009}} at Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway.</ref> though it industrialised to some extent in the Victorian era, and later with an ironworks, engineering, brewing, and a sugar refinery.\n\nThe A1 [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/77611 bypass] was opened in 1964 by the then Minister of Transport, [[Ernest Marples]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1|title=The A1 By-Pass |website=Winthorpe Village, Nottinghamshire |accessdate=5 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028043328/https://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1 |archivedate=28 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The single-carriageway, \u00a334-million A46 opened in October 1990.\n\n==Governance==\n{{main|Newark (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nNewark returned two representatives to the [[Unreformed House of Commons]] from 1673. It was the last borough to be created before the Reform Act. [[William Ewart Gladstone]], later [[Prime Minister]], became its [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in 1832 and was re-elected in 1835, 1837 and 1841 (twice), but possibly due to his support of the [[repeal]] of the [[Corn Laws]] and other issues he stood elsewhere after that time.\n\nRecently, Newark elections have been central to two interesting legal cases. In 1945, a challenge to [[Harold Laski]], the Chairman of the [[National Executive Committee]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led Laski to sue the ''[[Daily Express]]'' when it reported him as saying that Labour might take power through violence if defeated at the polls. Laski vehemently denied saying this, but lost the libel action. In the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Newark returned [[Fiona Jones]] of the Labour Party.

In traversing this plain, they passed, close to the skirt of the hills, a great pool of water, three hundred yards in circumference, fed by a [[sulphur]] spring, about ten feet in diameter, boiling up in one corner. The place was much frequented by [[elk]], which were found in considerable numbers in the adjacent mountains, and their horns, shed in the spring-time, were strewed in every direction around the pond.{{sfn|Birkby|2014|p=120-121}}</blockquote>\n\nAfter the [[Oregon Trail]] expedition brought settlers into the area, the land surrounding the lakes was utilized as a [[cattle ranch]], and was purchased by a sailor named Tommy Atkins.{{sfn|Birkby|2014|p=122}} An [[apocrypha]]l story claiming that Atkins was cured of numerous health ailments after falling into the spring was published in ''[[The Oregonian]]'' in 1914 in a piece detailing the hotel's history.{{sfn|Birkby|2014|p=122}} The lake's spring bubbles nearly a half-million gallons of water each day, and the average temperature of the lake is around 200[[Fahrenheit|\u00b0F]] (93[[Celsius|\u00b0C]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/terryrichard/2011/09/hot_lake_springs_restored_open.html|work=Oregon Live|title=Hot Lake Springs restored, open for business near La Grande after seven-year overhaul|date=September 17, 2011|author=Richard, Terry|accessdate=December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1864\u20131906: Initial construction===\nIn 1864, Samuel Fitzgerald Newhart, a native of [[California]], arrived in the [[Grande Ronde Valley]], and constructed the original wooden structure on the lake, which faced toward the bluff rather than outward toward the lake.<ref name=\"np\"/> The structure was similar to the contents of a modern-day [[shopping mall]], containing a post office, blacksmith, dance hall, barber shop, bath house, and several other businesses.\n\nBy 1884, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] commenced its construction, running near Hot Lake.

The organic phosphate found in phytic acid is largely unavailable to the animals that consume it, but the inorganic phosphate that phytases release can be easily absorbed. [[Ruminant]] animals can use phytic acid as a source of phosphorus because the bacteria that inhabit their gut are well characterized producers of many types of phytases.
