after using a product containing this substance. Subsequent testing identified 5F-ADB to have been present in a total of ten people who had died from unexplained drug overdoses in Japan between September 2014 and December 2014. 5F-ADB is believed to be extremely potent based on the very low levels detected in tissue samples, and appears to be significantly more toxic than earlier synthetic cannabinoid drugs that had previously been sold.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11419-014-0259-0| title = Identification and quantitation of 5-fluoro-ADB, one of the most dangerous synthetic cannabinoids, in the stomach contents and solid tissues of a human cadaver and in some herbal products| journal = Forensic Toxicology| year = 2014| last1 = Hasegawa| first1 = Koutaro| last2 = Wurita| first2 = Amin| last3 = Minakata| first3 = Kayoko| last4 = Gonmori| first4 = Kunio| last5 = Yamagishi| first5 = Itaru| last6 = Nozawa| first6 = Hideki| last7 = Watanabe| first7 = Kanako| last8 = Suzuki| first8 = Osamu| volume=33| pages=112\u2013121}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, 5F-ADB was the most common synthetic cannabinoid to be identified in [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] seizures.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ndews.umd.edu/sites/ndews.umd.edu/files/Emerging-Threat-Report-2018-Annual.pdf | title = Emerging Threat Report: Annual 2018 | publisher = Special Testing and Research Laboratory, Drug Enforcement Administration }}</ref>  5F-ADB was also identified in [[cannabidiol]] (CBD) products from a US-based CBD manufacturer in 2018.<ref>{{ cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.10.019 | pmid = 30442388 | pmc = 6321772 | title = The unexpected identification of the cannabimimetic, 5F-ADB, and dextromethorphan in commercially available cannabidiol e-liquids | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 294 | pages = e25\u2013e27 | date = 1 November 2018 | first1 = Justin L. | last1 = Poklis | first2 = Haley A. | last2 = Mulder | first3 = Michelle R. | last3 = Peace }}</ref>\n\n==Legal status==\nIn the United States, 5F-ADB is a [[Controlled_Substances_Act#Schedule_I_controlled_substances|schedule I controlled substance]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2016/fr1221.htm | title = Schedules of Controlled Substances: Temporary Placement of Six Synthetic Cannabinoids (5F-ADB, 5F-AMB, 5F-APINACA, ADB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA and MDMB-FUBINACA) Into Schedule I | publisher = [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]}}</ref>\n\n5F-ADB was added to the Japanese banned drug list in December 2014.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[5F-AB-PINACA]]\n* [[5F-AMB]]\n* [[5F-APINACA]]\n* [[AB-CHMINACA]]\n* [[AB-FUBINACA]]\n* [[AB-CHFUPYCA]]\n* [[AB-PINACA]]\n* [[ADB-CHMINACA]]\n* [[ADB-FUBINACA]]\n* [[ADB-PINACA]]\n* [[ADBICA]]\n* [[APICA (synthetic cannabinoid drug)|APICA]]\n* [[APINACA]]\n* [[MDMB-CHMICA]]\n* [[MDMB-FUBINACA]]\n* [[PX-3]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cannabinoids}}\n\n\n[[Category:Cannabinoids]]\n[[Category:Designer drugs]]\n[[Category:Organofluorides]]\n[[Category:Indazolecarboxamides]]\n[[Category:Tert-butyl compounds]]\n", "name_user": "Fswitzer4", "label": "safe", "comment": "added FDA UNII to drug box", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5F-ADB"}
