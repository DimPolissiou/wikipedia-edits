Unlike most other grains, the outer hull of the popcorn kernel is both strong and impervious to moisture and the starch inside consists almost entirely of a hard type.<ref name=\"Lusas_388\">Lusas & Rooney, p. 388.</ref>\n\nAs the oil and water within the kernel are heated, they turn the moisture in the kernel into pressurized steam. Under these conditions, the starch inside the kernel [[starch gelatinization|gelatinizes]], softens, and becomes pliable. The internal pressure of the entrapped steam continues to increase until the breaking point of the hull is reached: a pressure of approximately {{convert|135|psi|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Lusas_388\" /> and a temperature of {{convert|180|C|abbr=on}}. The hull thereupon ruptures rapidly and explodes, causing a sudden drop in pressure inside the kernel and a corresponding rapid expansion of the steam, which expands the starch and [[protein]]s of the endosperm into airy [[foam]]. As the foam rapidly cools, the starch and protein [[polymer]]s set into the familiar crispy puff.<ref name=\"Lusas_388\" /> Special varieties are grown to give improved popping yield. Though the kernels of some wild types will pop, the cultivated strain is ''Zea mays everta,'' which is a special kind of [[flint corn]].\n\n== Cooking methods ==\n[[File:Popcornmaker.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An in-home hot-air popcorn maker]]\n<!-- [[File:J84878 Taiyuan 20140717-175938.61 popper.jpg|thumb|Popcorn street vendor, D\u014dng G\u01ceng L\u00f9 road, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China (\u4e1c\u5c97\u8def, \u592a\u539f, \u5c71\u897f, \u4e2d\u56fd). The popping kettle is visible in black at the center of the picture.]]-->\n\nPopcorn can be cooked with butter or oil. Although small quantities can be popped in a stove-top [[kettle]] or pot in a home kitchen, commercial sale of freshly popped popcorn employs specially designed popcorn machines, which were invented in [[Chicago, Illinois]], by [[Charles Cretors]] in 1885. Cretors successfully introduced his invention at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition]] in 1893. At this same world's fair, F.W. Rueckheim introduced a [[molasses]]-flavored \"Candied Popcorn\", the first [[caramel corn]]; his brother, Louis Ruekheim, slightly altered the recipe and introduced it as [[Cracker Jack]] popcorn in 1896.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crackerjack.com/history.php |title=Brief History |publisher=[[Frito-Lay]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204162425/http://www.crackerjack.com/history.php |archivedate=4 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nCretors's invention introduced the first patented [[steam engine|steam-driven]] popcorn machine that popped corn in oil. Previously, vendors popped corn by holding a wire basket over an open flame. At best, the result was a hot, dry, unevenly cooked snack. Cretors's machine popped corn in a mixture of one-third [[clarified butter]], two-thirds [[lard]], and [[salt]]. This mixture can withstand the {{convert|450|F|C}} temperature needed to pop corn and it produces little smoke. A fire under a [[boiler]] created steam that drove a small engine; that engine drove the gears, shaft, and agitator that stirred the corn and powered a small automated clown puppet-like figure, \"the Toasty Roasty Man\", an attention-getting amusement intended to attract business. A wire connected to the top of the cooking pan allowed the operator to disengage the drive mechanism, lift the cover, and dump popped corn into the storage bin beneath. Exhaust from the steam engine was piped to a hollow pan below the corn storage bin and kept freshly popped corn uniformly warm. Excess steam was also used to operate a small, shrill whistle to attract attention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wyandotpopcornmus.com/cretors_history.html |title=C. Cretors and Company |publisher=Wyandot Popcorn Museum |accessdate=21 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226173540/http://wyandotpopcornmus.com/cretors_history.html |archive-date=26 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA different method of popcorn-making involves the \"[[popcorn hammer]]\", a large [[cast-iron]] canister that is sealed with a heavy lid and slowly turned over a fire in [[rotisserie]] fashion.\n\n=== Expansion and yield ===\nPopping results are sensitive to the rate at which the kernels are heated. If heated too quickly, the steam in the outer layers of the kernel can reach high pressures and rupture the hull before the starch in the center of the kernel can fully gelatinize, leading to partially popped kernels with hard centers. Heating too slowly leads to entirely unpopped kernels: the tip of the kernel, where it attached to the cob, is not entirely moisture-proof, and when heated slowly, the steam can leak out of the tip fast enough to keep the pressure from rising sufficiently to break the hull and cause the pop.<ref name=\"Lusas_388_389\">Lusas & Rooney, pp. 388\u2013389.</ref>\n\nProducers and sellers of popcorn consider two major factors in evaluating the quality of popcorn: what percentage of the kernels will pop, and how much each popped kernel expands. Expansion is an important factor to both the consumer and vendor. For the consumer, larger pieces of popcorn tend to be more tender and are associated with higher quality. For the grower, distributor and vendor, expansion is closely correlated with profit: vendors such as theaters buy popcorn by weight and sell it by volume. For these reasons, higher-expansion popcorn fetches a higher profit per unit weight.\n\nPopcorn will pop when freshly harvested, but not well; its high moisture content leads to poor expansion and chewy pieces of popcorn. Kernels with a high moisture content are also susceptible to mold when stored. For these reasons, popcorn growers and distributors dry the kernels until they reach the moisture level at which they expand the most. This differs by variety and conditions, but is generally in the range of 14\u201315% moisture by weight. If the kernels are over-dried, the expansion rate will suffer and the percentage of kernels that pop will decline.\n\nWhen the popcorn has finished popping, sometimes unpopped kernels remain. Known in the popcorn industry as \"old maids\",<ref name=\"OldMaids\">{{cite web |url=http://www.popcorn.org/AboutUs/PopcornPoppinMonth/PoppingTips/tabid/125/Default.aspx |title=Popping Tips (\"Saving 'Old Maids'\" tab) |publisher=The Popcorn Board |accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref> these kernels fail to pop because they do not have enough moisture to create enough steam for an explosion. Re-hydrating prior to popping usually results in eliminating the unpopped kernels.\n\nPopcorn varieties are broadly categorized by the shape of the kernels, the color of the kernels, or the shape of the popped corn. While the kernels may come in a variety of colors, the popped corn is always off-yellow or white as it is only the hull (or pericarp) that is colored. \"Rice\" type popcorn have a long kernel pointed at both ends; \"pearl\" type kernels are rounded at the top. Commercial popcorn production has moved mostly to pearl types.<ref name=\"Hallauer_213\">Hallauer, p. 213.</ref> Historically, pearl popcorn were usually yellow and rice popcorn usually white. Today both shapes are available in both colors, as well as others including black, red, [[mauve]],  purple, and [[variegation|variegated]]. Mauve and purple popcorn usually have smaller and nutty kernels. Commercial production is dominated by white and yellow.<ref name=\"Hallauer_214\">Hallauer, p. 214.</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Mushroom and butterfly popcorn.jpg|thumb|right|\"Mushroom\"-shaped popcorn, left, is less fragile and less tender than \"butterfly\"-shaped, right.]]\n\nIn the popcorn industry, a popped kernel of corn is known as a \"flake\". Two shapes of flakes are commercially important. \"Butterfly\" (or \"snowflake\")<ref>Cobb, Vicki. ''Junk Food''. Minneapolis: Millbrook, 2006. 11. Print.</ref> flakes are irregular in shape and have a number of protruding \"wings\". \"Mushroom\" flakes are largely ball-shaped, with few wings. Butterfly flakes are regarded as having better [[mouthfeel]], with greater tenderness and less noticeable hulls.

Unlike most other grains, the outer hull of the popcorn kernel is both strong and impervious to moisture and the starch inside consists almost entirely of a hard type.<ref name=\"Lusas_388\">Lusas & Rooney, p. 388.</ref>\n\nAs the oil and water within the kernel are heated, they turn the moisture in the kernel into pressurized steam. Under these conditions, the starch inside the kernel [[starch gelatinization|gelatinizes]], softens, and becomes pliable. The internal pressure of the entrapped steam continues to increase until the breaking point of the hull is reached: a pressure of approximately {{convert|135|psi|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Lusas_388\" /> and a temperature of {{convert|180|C|abbr=on}}. The hull thereupon ruptures rapidly and explodes, causing a sudden drop in pressure inside the kernel and a corresponding rapid expansion of the steam, which expands the starch and [[protein]]s of the endosperm into airy [[foam]]. As the foam rapidly cools, the starch and protein [[polymer]]s set into the familiar crispy puff.<ref name=\"Lusas_388\" /> Special varieties are grown to give improved popping yield. Though the kernels of some wild types will pop, the cultivated strain is ''Zea mays everta,'' which is a special kind of [[flint corn]].\n\n== Cooking methods ==\n[[File:Popcornmaker.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An in-home hot-air popcorn maker]]\n<!-- [[File:J84878 Taiyuan 20140717-175938.61 popper.jpg|thumb|Popcorn street vendor, D\u014dng G\u01ceng L\u00f9 road, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China (\u4e1c\u5c97\u8def, \u592a\u539f, \u5c71\u897f, \u4e2d\u56fd).

Although small quantities can be popped in a stove-top [[kettle]] or pot in a home kitchen, commercial sale of freshly popped popcorn employs specially designed popcorn machines, which were invented in [[Chicago, Illinois]], by [[Charles Cretors]] in 1885. Cretors successfully introduced his invention at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian Exposition]] in 1893. At this same world's fair, F.W. Rueckheim introduced a [[molasses]]-flavored \"Candied Popcorn\", the first [[caramel corn]]; his brother, Louis Ruekheim, slightly altered the recipe and introduced it as [[Cracker Jack]] popcorn in 1896.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crackerjack.com/history.php |title=Brief History |publisher=[[Frito-Lay]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204162425/http://www.crackerjack.com/history.php |archivedate=4 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nCretors's invention introduced the first patented [[steam engine|steam-driven]] popcorn machine that popped corn in oil. Previously, vendors popped corn by holding a wire basket over an open flame. At best, the result was a hot, dry, unevenly cooked snack. Cretors's machine popped corn in a mixture of one-third [[clarified butter]], two-thirds [[lard]], and [[salt]]. This mixture can withstand the {{convert|450|F|C}} temperature needed to pop corn and it produces little smoke. A fire under a [[boiler]] created steam that drove a small engine; that engine drove the gears, shaft, and agitator that stirred the corn and powered a small automated clown puppet-like figure, \"the Toasty Roasty Man\", an attention-getting amusement intended to attract business. A wire connected to the top of the cooking pan allowed the operator to disengage the drive mechanism, lift the cover, and dump popped corn into the storage bin beneath. Exhaust from the steam engine was piped to a hollow pan below the corn storage bin and kept freshly popped corn uniformly warm. Excess steam was also used to operate a small, shrill whistle to attract attention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wyandotpopcornmus.com/cretors_history.html |title=C.

If heated too quickly, the steam in the outer layers of the kernel can reach high pressures and rupture the hull before the starch in the center of the kernel can fully gelatinize, leading to partially popped kernels with hard centers. Heating too slowly leads to entirely unpopped kernels: the tip of the kernel, where it attached to the cob, is not entirely moisture-proof, and when heated slowly, the steam can leak out of the tip fast enough to keep the pressure from rising sufficiently to break the hull and cause the pop.<ref name=\"Lusas_388_389\">Lusas & Rooney, pp. 388\u2013389.</ref>\n\nProducers and sellers of popcorn consider two major factors in evaluating the quality of popcorn: what percentage of the kernels will pop, and how much each popped kernel expands. Expansion is an important factor to both the consumer and vendor. For the consumer, larger pieces of popcorn tend to be more tender and are associated with higher quality. For the grower, distributor and vendor, expansion is closely correlated with profit: vendors such as theaters buy popcorn by weight and sell it by volume. For these reasons, higher-expansion popcorn fetches a higher profit per unit weight.\n\nPopcorn will pop when freshly harvested, but not well; its high moisture content leads to poor expansion and chewy pieces of popcorn. Kernels with a high moisture content are also susceptible to mold when stored. For these reasons, popcorn growers and distributors dry the kernels until they reach the moisture level at which they expand the most. This differs by variety and conditions, but is generally in the range of 14\u201315% moisture by weight. If the kernels are over-dried, the expansion rate will suffer and the percentage of kernels that pop will decline.\n\nWhen the popcorn has finished popping, sometimes unpopped kernels remain. Known in the popcorn industry as \"old maids\",<ref name=\"OldMaids\">{{cite web |url=http://www.popcorn.org/AboutUs/PopcornPoppinMonth/PoppingTips/tabid/125/Default.aspx |title=Popping Tips (\"Saving 'Old Maids'\" tab) |publisher=The Popcorn Board |accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref> these kernels fail to pop because they do not have enough moisture to create enough steam for an explosion. Re-hydrating prior to popping usually results in eliminating the unpopped kernels.\n\nPopcorn varieties are broadly categorized by the shape of the kernels, the color of the kernels, or the shape of the popped corn. While the kernels may come in a variety of colors, the popped corn is always off-yellow or white as it is only the hull (or pericarp) that is colored. \"Rice\" type popcorn have a long kernel pointed at both ends; \"pearl\" type kernels are rounded at the top. Commercial popcorn production has moved mostly to pearl types.<ref name=\"Hallauer_213\">Hallauer, p. 213.</ref> Historically, pearl popcorn were usually yellow and rice popcorn usually white. Today both shapes are available in both colors, as well as others including black, red, [[mauve]],  purple, and [[variegation|variegated]]. Mauve and purple popcorn usually have smaller and nutty kernels.

Two shapes of flakes are commercially important. \"Butterfly\" (or \"snowflake\")<ref>Cobb, Vicki. ''Junk Food''. Minneapolis: Millbrook, 2006. 11. Print.</ref> flakes are irregular in shape and have a number of protruding \"wings\". \"Mushroom\" flakes are largely ball-shaped, with few wings. Butterfly flakes are regarded as having better [[mouthfeel]], with greater tenderness and less noticeable hulls. Mushroom flakes are less fragile than butterfly flakes and are therefore often used for packaged popcorn or [[confectionery]], such as [[caramel corn]].<ref name=\"Hallauer_214\" /> The kernels from a single cob of popcorn may form both butterfly and mushroom flakes; hybrids that produce 100% butterfly flakes or 100% mushroom flakes exist, the latter developed only as recently as 1998.<ref name=\"Hallauer_214\" /> Growing conditions and popping environment can also affect the butterfly-to-mushroom ratio.\n\nWhen referring to multiple pieces of popcorn collectively, it is acceptable to use the term \"popcorn\". When referring to a singular piece of popcorn, the accepted term is \"kernel\".\n\n== Consumption ==\n[[File:Popcorn (pipoca).jpg|thumb|left|Popcorn grown in Mozambique and sold in the marketplace]]\n[[File:Movie Theater Popcorn in Bucket.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Movie theater popcorn in a bucket in the United States]]\nPopcorn is a popular [[snack food]] at sporting events and in [[movie theater]]s, where it has been served since the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-do-we-eat-popcorn-at-the-movies-475063/ |title=Why Do We Eat Popcorn at the Movies?|publisher=[[Smithsonian Mag]] |date=3 October 2013}}</ref> Cinemas have come under fire due to their high markup on popcorn; Stuart Hanson, a film historian at De Montfort University in Leicester, once said, \"One of the great jokes in the industry is that popcorn is second only to cocaine or heroin in terms of profit.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/why-a-trip-to-the-cinema-can-cost-up-to-100/|title=Why a trip to the cinema can cost up to \u00a3100|last=Dodds|first=Laurence|date=25 April 2016|work=The Telegraph|access-date=25 November 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nTraditions differ as to whether popcorn is consumed as a hearty snack food with salt (predominating in the United States) or as a sweet snack food with caramelized sugar (predominating in Germany).\n\nPopcorn smell has an unusually attractive quality for human beings.

With sales in excess of 20 million copies, it is one of fewer than 30 retail singles to have [[list of best-selling singles worldwide|sold at least 10 million]] copies worldwide.\n\nFollowing [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s 1984 \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" project in the UK, an idea for the creation of an American benefit single for African famine relief came from activist [[Harry Belafonte]], who, along with fundraiser [[Ken Kragen]], was instrumental in bringing the vision to reality. Several musicians were contacted by the pair, before Jackson and Lionel Richie were assigned the task of writing the song. The duo completed the writing of \"We Are the World\" seven weeks after the release of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", and one night before the song's first recording session, on January 21, 1985. The historic event brought together some of the most well-known artists in the music industry at the time.\n\nThe song was released on March 7, 1985, as the first single from the album. A worldwide commercial success, topping music charts throughout the world and becoming the fastest-selling U.S. pop single in history. The first ever single to be [[music recording sales certification|certified]] multi-platinum, \"We Are the World\" received a Quadruple Platinum certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\nAwarded numerous honors\u2014including three [[Grammy Award]]s, one [[American Music Award]], and a [[People's Choice Award]]\u2014the song was promoted with a critically received music video, a VHS, a special edition magazine, a [[simulcast]], and several books, posters, and shirts. The promotion and merchandise aided the success of \"We Are the World\" and raised over $63&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|63|1986|r=0}}}} million today) for humanitarian aid in [[Africa]] and the US.\n\nFollowing the devastation caused by the [[moment magnitude scale|magnitude 7.0 M]] [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake in Haiti]] on January 12, 2010, a remake of the song by another all-star cast of singers was recorded on February 1, 2010.

For a week, the two spent every night working on lyrics and melodies in Jackson's bedroom. They knew that they wanted a song that would be easy to sing and memorable. The pair wanted to create an [[anthem]]. Jackson's older sister [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]] watched the two work on the song, and later contended that Richie only wrote a few lines for the track.<ref name=\"tara 342\">Taraborrelli, p. 342</ref> She stated that her younger brother wrote 99% of the lyrics, \"but he's never felt it necessary to say that\".<ref name=\"tara 342\"/> La Toya further commented on the song's creation in an interview with the U.S. celebrity news magazine ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''. \"I'd go into the room while they were writing and it would be very quiet, which is odd, since Michael's usually very cheery when he works.

The studio, on [[Beverly Boulevard]] in California, was filled with musicians, technicians, video crews, [[retinue]]s, assistants, and organizers as the four musicians entered. To begin the night, a \"vocal guide\" of \"We Are the World\" was recorded by Richie and Jackson and duplicated on tape for each of the invited performers. The guide was recorded on the sixth [[take]], as Quincy Jones felt that there was too much \"thought\" in the previous versions.<ref name=\"breskin 2\">Breskin, p. 2</ref>\n\nFollowing their work on the vocal guide, Jackson and Jones began thinking of alternatives for the line \"There's a chance we're taking, we're taking our own lives\": the pair was concerned that the latter part of the line would be considered a reference to suicide. As the group listened to a playback of the chorus, Richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to \"We're 'saving' our own lives\", which his fellow musicians agreed with. Producer Jones also suggested altering the former part of the line. \"One thing we don't want to do, especially with this group, is look like we're patting ourselves on the back. So it's really, 'There's a ''choice'' we're making.'\"<ref name=\"breskin 3\">Breskin, p. 3</ref> Around 1:30&nbsp;am, the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of melodic vocalizations, including the sound \"sha-lum sha-lin-gay\".<ref name=\"breskin 3\"/> Jones told the group that they were not to add anything else to the tape. \"If we get too good, someone's gonna start playing it on the radio,\" he announced.<ref name=\"breskin 3\"/>\n\nOn January 24, 1985, after a day of rest, Jones shipped Richie and Jackson's vocal guide to all of the artists who would be involved in \"We Are the World\"{{'}}s recording.

It was written by [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Lionel Richie]] and produced by [[Quincy Jones]] and [[Michael Omartian]] for the album ''[[We Are the World (album)|We Are the World]]''. With sales in excess of 20 million copies, it is one of fewer than 30 retail singles to have [[list of best-selling singles worldwide|sold at least 10 million]] copies worldwide.\n\nFollowing [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s 1984 \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" project in the UK, an idea for the creation of an American benefit single for African famine relief came from activist [[Harry Belafonte]], who, along with fundraiser [[Ken Kragen]], was instrumental in bringing the vision to reality. Several musicians were contacted by the pair, before Jackson and Lionel Richie were assigned the task of writing the song. The duo completed the writing of \"We Are the World\" seven weeks after the release of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", and one night before the song's first recording session, on January 21, 1985. The historic event brought together some of the most well-known artists in the music industry at the time.\n\nThe song was released on March 7, 1985, as the first single from the album. A worldwide commercial success, topping music charts throughout the world and becoming the fastest-selling U.S. pop single in history. The first ever single to be [[music recording sales certification|certified]] multi-platinum, \"We Are the World\" received a Quadruple Platinum certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\nAwarded numerous honors\u2014including three [[Grammy Award]]s, one [[American Music Award]], and a [[People's Choice Award]]\u2014the song was promoted with a critically received music video, a VHS, a special edition magazine, a [[simulcast]], and several books, posters, and shirts. The promotion and merchandise aided the success of \"We Are the World\" and raised over $63&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|63|1986|r=0}}}} million today) for humanitarian aid in [[Africa]] and the US.\n\nFollowing the devastation caused by the [[moment magnitude scale|magnitude 7.0 M]] [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake in Haiti]] on January 12, 2010, a remake of the song by another all-star cast of singers was recorded on February 1, 2010. Entitled \"[[We Are the World 25 for Haiti]]\", it was released as a single on February 12, 2010, and proceeds from the record aided survivors in the impoverished country.\n\nIn March 2020, Ritchie suggested that a third remake should be made to communicate a message of global solidarity in the face of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]] and raise funds for aid efforts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smoothradio.com/artists/lionel-richie/we-are-the-world-2020-coronavirus/|title=Lionel Richie plans new 'We Are the World' charity single to fundraise against coronavirus|last=O'Connor|first=Rory|date=24 March 2020|work=[[Smooth Radio]]|accessdate=24 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Background and writing ==\n[[File:Michael Jackson 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Michael Jackson, an African-American musician in his mid-20s wearing a sequined army style jacket and black sunglasses.

He planned to have the proceeds donated to a new organization called United Support of Artists for Africa (USA for Africa). The non-profit foundation would then feed and relieve starving people in Africa, specifically [[Ethiopia]], where around one million people died during the country's [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia|1983\u20131985 famine]].<ref name=\"tara 341\">Taraborrelli, p. 341</ref><ref name=\"Ethiopia Faces Famine Again, Requests Massive Food Relief\">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73844842.html?dids=73844842:73844842&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+14%2C+1987&author=Blaine+Harden&pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=Ethiopia+Faces+Famine+Again%2C+Requests+Massive+Food+Relief&pqatl=google|title=Ethiopia Faces Famine Again, Requests Massive Food Relief|last=Harden|first=Blaine|date=September 14, 1987|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}</ref> The idea followed [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" project in the UK, which Belafonte had heard about.{{refn|\"We Are the World\" would later be cited as the American response to Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas\".<ref name=\"The pop life; artists join in effort for famine relief\"/>|group=\"nb\"}}<ref name=\"A hit with a heart: 'We Are the World' buoyed by brisk sales and curiosity\">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/25092058.html?dids=25092058:25092058&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+17%2C+1985&author=Jonathan+Taylor+and+Gary+Graff+Los+Angeles+Daily+News%2C+Chicago+Tribune+and+Knight-Ridder+Newspapers&pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=A+HIT+WITH+A+HEART%3A+'WE+ARE+THE+WORLD'+BUOYED+BY+BRISK+SALES+AND+CURIOSITY&pqatl=google|title=A hit with a heart: 'We Are the World' buoyed by brisk sales and curiosity|last=Taylor|first=Jonathan|date=March 17, 1985|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}</ref> He also planned money to be set aside to help eliminate [[Hunger in the United States|hunger in the United States of America]].

Kragen and the two musicians agreed to help with Belafonte's mission, and in turn, enlisted the cooperation of [[Stevie Wonder]], to add more \"name value\" to their project.<ref name=\"tara 341\"/> [[Quincy Jones]] was drafted to co-produce the song, taking time out from his work on the film ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]''.<ref name=\"tara 341\"/><ref name=\"tara 342\"/> Jones also telephoned [[Michael Jackson]], who had just released the commercially successful ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' album and had concluded [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons tour)|a tour]] with [[The Jacksons|his brothers]].<ref name=\"tara 341\"/>\n\n[[File:Quincy Jones 2008.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Quincy Jones, a plump bald African American man with a grey mustache and wry smile.

As Wonder had limited time to work on the project, due to writing songs from the film ''[[The Woman in Red (soundtrack)|The Woman in Red]]'', Jackson and Richie proceeded to write \"We Are the World\" themselves.<ref name=\"Campbell 109\"/> They began creating the song at Hayvenhurst, the [[Jackson family]] home in [[Encino, Los Angeles, California|Encino]]. For a week, the two spent every night working on lyrics and melodies in Jackson's bedroom. They knew that they wanted a song that would be easy to sing and memorable. The pair wanted to create an [[anthem]]. Jackson's older sister [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]] watched the two work on the song, and later contended that Richie only wrote a few lines for the track.<ref name=\"tara 342\">Taraborrelli, p. 342</ref> She stated that her younger brother wrote 99% of the lyrics, \"but he's never felt it necessary to say that\".<ref name=\"tara 342\"/> La Toya further commented on the song's creation in an interview with the U.S. celebrity news magazine ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''. \"I'd go into the room while they were writing and it would be very quiet, which is odd, since Michael's usually very cheery when he works. It was very emotional for them.\"<ref name=\"Campbell 109\"/>\n\n[[File:geldofsigning.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bob Geldof]]]]\nRichie had recorded two melodies for \"We Are the World\", which Jackson took, adding music and words to the song in the same day. Jackson stated, \"I love working quickly. I went ahead without even Lionel knowing, I couldn't wait. I went in and came out the same night with the song completed\u2014drums, piano, strings, and words to the chorus.\"<ref name=\"Campbell 110\">Campbell, p. 110</ref> Jackson then presented his demo to Richie and Jones, who were both shocked; they did not expect the pop star to see the structure of the song so quickly. The next meetings between Jackson and Richie were unfruitful; the pair did not produce any additional vocals and got no work done. It was not until the night of January 21, 1985, that Richie and Jackson completed the lyrics and melody of \"We Are the World\" within two and a half hours, one night before the song's first recording session.<ref name=\"Campbell 110\"/>\n\n== Recording sessions ==\n[[File:We Are The World Cyndi-Glenn Francis.jpg|thumb|Cyndi Lauper, studio badge, and the sweatshirt given to all attendees at A&M Studios in Hollywood California on January 28, 1985]]\n\nThe first night of recording, January 22, 1985, had tight security on hand, as Richie, Jackson, Wonder, and Jones started work on \"We Are the World\" at Kenny Rogers' Lion Share Recording Studio. The studio, on [[Beverly Boulevard]] in California, was filled with musicians, technicians, video crews, [[retinue]]s, assistants, and organizers as the four musicians entered. To begin the night, a \"vocal guide\" of \"We Are the World\" was recorded by Richie and Jackson and duplicated on tape for each of the invited performers. The guide was recorded on the sixth [[take]], as Quincy Jones felt that there was too much \"thought\" in the previous versions.<ref name=\"breskin 2\">Breskin, p. 2</ref>\n\nFollowing their work on the vocal guide, Jackson and Jones began thinking of alternatives for the line \"There's a chance we're taking, we're taking our own lives\": the pair was concerned that the latter part of the line would be considered a reference to suicide. As the group listened to a playback of the chorus, Richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to \"We're 'saving' our own lives\", which his fellow musicians agreed with. Producer Jones also suggested altering the former part of the line. \"One thing we don't want to do, especially with this group, is look like we're patting ourselves on the back. So it's really, 'There's a ''choice'' we're making.'\"<ref name=\"breskin 3\">Breskin, p. 3</ref> Around 1:30&nbsp;am, the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of melodic vocalizations, including the sound \"sha-lum sha-lin-gay\".<ref name=\"breskin 3\"/> Jones told the group that they were not to add anything else to the tape. \"If we get too good, someone's gonna start playing it on the radio,\" he announced.<ref name=\"breskin 3\"/>\n\nOn January 24, 1985, after a day of rest, Jones shipped Richie and Jackson's vocal guide to all of the artists who would be involved in \"We Are the World\"{{'}}s recording. Enclosed in the package was a letter from Jones, addressed to \"My Fellow Artists\":<ref name=\"breskin 3\"/>\n{{quote|\nThe cassettes are numbered, and I can't express how important it is not to let this material out of your hands.

There, Kragen and his team discussed where the recording sessions with the supergroup of musicians should take place. He stated, \"The single most damaging piece of information is where we're doing this. If that shows up anywhere, we've got a chaotic situation that could totally destroy the project. The moment a Prince, a Michael Jackson, a [[Bob Dylan]]\u2014I guarantee you!\u2014drives up and sees a mob around that studio, he will never come in.\"<ref name=\"breskin 3\"/> On the same night, Quincy Jones' associate producer and vocal arranger, [[Tom Bahler]], was given the task of matching each solo line with the right voice.

After saving it from a pack of [[leopard seals]] on an abandoned ship, and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into their new member, Private, (before the events of the [[Madagascar (2005 film)|first film]]).\n\nTen years later (after the events of the [[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted|previous film]]), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]] in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called \"Cheezy Dibbles\" in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is constantly described as being the \"secretary/mascot\".\n\nSuddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to [[Venice]], [[Italy]] by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their cuteness had him shunned from every zoo and aquarium across the globe. Rico swallows Dave's collection of [[snowglobes]] along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen.\n\nWhen cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an [[Arctic]] elite undercover inter-species task force agency called \"The North Wind\" consisting of their leader, a [[wolf]] whose name is classified in which Skipper mistakenly calls him \"Classified\" throughout this film, a [[harp seal]] demolitionist named Short Fuse, a [[polar bear]] named Corporal, and an intelligent [[snowy owl]] named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.\n\nAt their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends them to their most remote base (which happens to be on [[Madagascar]]) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the [[Sahara Desert]] before making their way to [[Shanghai, China]], which they mistake for [[Dublin, Ireland]]. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to the same current location and make their way to the zoo. Skipper disguises Private as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, but Private is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island base, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. \n\nMeanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to use the medusa serum to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge. Skipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to [[tactical formation|regroup]] due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at [[New York City|New York]] with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off Dave and his henchman, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.\n\nPrivate is left partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their new adventures.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole, much to the latter's amusement.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:John Malkovich & Benedict Cumberbatch, Penguins of Madagascar, SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Malkovich]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] talking at the ''Penguins of Madagascar'' panel at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\n* [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper, the leader of the [[penguin]]s.<ref name=USATPeek>{{cite news|last1=Truitt|first1=Brian|title=Sneak Peek: 'Penguins of Madagascar'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/08/penguins-of-madagascar-first-look/9727597/|accessdate=June 9, 2014|work=USA Today|date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski, the brains of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as Private, the rookie of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as Rico,<ref name=VarietyReview>{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-penguins-of-madagascar-1201353894/|accessdate=November 12, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> the loose cannon of the penguins.\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Classified, a British [[wolf]] and team leader of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapCumberMalko /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins-of-madagascar |title=Benedict Cumberbatch to voice wolf in new Madagascar movie |first=Ben |last=Beaumont-Thomas |date=June 11, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7290373/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins |title=Here are some of Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s most oddly sexy lines from Penguins of Madagascar |first=Emily Todd |last=VanDerWerff |date=November 26, 2014 |website=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/penguins-of-madagascar-actor-benedict-cumberbatch-thinks-he-worked-on-a-disney-film-105013.html |title=Benedict Cumberbatch Thinks 'Penguins of Madagascar' is A Disney Film |date=October 24, 2014 |website=Cartoon Brew}}</ref>\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Short Fuse, a Belgian explosive and demolitions expert [[harp seal]] and a member of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapDateSwitch>{{cite web|last=Cunningham|first=Todd|title=DreamWorks Animation Switches Release Dates on \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 and \u2018Home\u2019|url=https://www.thewrap.com/dreamworks-animation-switches-release-dates-on-penguins-of-madagascar-and-home/|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=May 21, 2014|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Annet Mahendru]] as Eva, a Russian [[snowy owl]], Kowalski's love interest, and the north wind's intelligence analyst.<ref name=\"USATPeek\" />\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Corporal, a Norwegian [[polar bear]] and a member of the North Wind who serves as the muscle.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Dave, a villainous and disgruntled [[octopus]] who has the human disguise of Dr. Octavius Brine.<ref name=\"WrapCumberMalko\" /><ref name=\"USATPeek\" /><ref name=\"EWTralierSpies\">{{cite news|last1=McHenry|first1=Jackson|title='The Penguins of Madagascar' trailer: Spies and Benedict Cumberbatch -- VIDEO|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/06/11/penguins-madagascar-benedict-cumberbatch/|accessdate=June 13, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Werner Herzog]] as a documentary filmmaker.<ref name=SlashFilmRecap>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title=Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 Footage Recap and Panel Highlights [Comic Con 2014]|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/penguins-of-madagascar-footage-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=July 25, 2014|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] as King Julien XIII, a [[ring-tailed lemur]].\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Mort, a [[Goodman's mouse lemur]].\n\n==Production==\nA [[direct-to-video]] film featuring the penguins had been in the works since 2005 when the first ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' film was released, with a release date initially planned for 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=D'Works will rely on animal instinct|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929100|accessdate=October 27, 2011|newspaper=Variety|date=September 14, 2005}}</ref> The studio announced in March 2011 that the penguin characters would be given their own feature film to be directed by [[Simon J.

After saving it from a pack of [[leopard seals]] on an abandoned ship, and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into their new member, Private, (before the events of the [[Madagascar (2005 film)|first film]]).\n\nTen years later (after the events of the [[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted|previous film]]), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]] in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called \"Cheezy Dibbles\" in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is constantly described as being the \"secretary/mascot\".\n\nSuddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to [[Venice]], [[Italy]] by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their cuteness had him shunned from every zoo and aquarium across the globe. Rico swallows Dave's collection of [[snowglobes]] along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen.\n\nWhen cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an [[Arctic]] elite undercover inter-species task force agency called \"The North Wind\" consisting of their leader, a [[wolf]] whose name is classified in which Skipper mistakenly calls him \"Classified\" throughout this film, a [[harp seal]] demolitionist named Short Fuse, a [[polar bear]] named Corporal, and an intelligent [[snowy owl]] named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.\n\nAt their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends them to their most remote base (which happens to be on [[Madagascar]]) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the [[Sahara Desert]] before making their way to [[Shanghai, China]], which they mistake for [[Dublin, Ireland]]. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to the same current location and make their way to the zoo. Skipper disguises Private as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, but Private is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island base, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. \n\nMeanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to use the medusa serum to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge. Skipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to [[tactical formation|regroup]] due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at [[New York City|New York]] with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off Dave and his henchman, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.\n\nPrivate is left partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their new adventures.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole, much to the latter's amusement.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:John Malkovich & Benedict Cumberbatch, Penguins of Madagascar, SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Malkovich]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] talking at the ''Penguins of Madagascar'' panel at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\n* [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper, the leader of the [[penguin]]s.<ref name=USATPeek>{{cite news|last1=Truitt|first1=Brian|title=Sneak Peek: 'Penguins of Madagascar'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/08/penguins-of-madagascar-first-look/9727597/|accessdate=June 9, 2014|work=USA Today|date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski, the brains of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as Private, the rookie of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as Rico,<ref name=VarietyReview>{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-penguins-of-madagascar-1201353894/|accessdate=November 12, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> the loose cannon of the penguins.\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Classified, a British [[wolf]] and team leader of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapCumberMalko /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins-of-madagascar |title=Benedict Cumberbatch to voice wolf in new Madagascar movie |first=Ben |last=Beaumont-Thomas |date=June 11, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7290373/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins |title=Here are some of Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s most oddly sexy lines from Penguins of Madagascar |first=Emily Todd |last=VanDerWerff |date=November 26, 2014 |website=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/penguins-of-madagascar-actor-benedict-cumberbatch-thinks-he-worked-on-a-disney-film-105013.html |title=Benedict Cumberbatch Thinks 'Penguins of Madagascar' is A Disney Film |date=October 24, 2014 |website=Cartoon Brew}}</ref>\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Short Fuse, a Belgian explosive and demolitions expert [[harp seal]] and a member of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapDateSwitch>{{cite web|last=Cunningham|first=Todd|title=DreamWorks Animation Switches Release Dates on \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 and \u2018Home\u2019|url=https://www.thewrap.com/dreamworks-animation-switches-release-dates-on-penguins-of-madagascar-and-home/|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=May 21, 2014|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Annet Mahendru]] as Eva, a Russian [[snowy owl]], Kowalski's love interest, and the north wind's intelligence analyst.<ref name=\"USATPeek\" />\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Corporal, a Norwegian [[polar bear]] and a member of the North Wind who serves as the muscle.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Dave, a villainous and disgruntled [[octopus]] who has the human disguise of Dr. Octavius Brine.<ref name=\"WrapCumberMalko\" /><ref name=\"USATPeek\" /><ref name=\"EWTralierSpies\">{{cite news|last1=McHenry|first1=Jackson|title='The Penguins of Madagascar' trailer: Spies and Benedict Cumberbatch -- VIDEO|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/06/11/penguins-madagascar-benedict-cumberbatch/|accessdate=June 13, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Werner Herzog]] as a documentary filmmaker.<ref name=SlashFilmRecap>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title=Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 Footage Recap and Panel Highlights [Comic Con 2014]|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/penguins-of-madagascar-footage-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=July 25, 2014|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] as King Julien XIII, a [[ring-tailed lemur]].\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Mort, a [[Goodman's mouse lemur]].\n\n==Production==\nA [[direct-to-video]] film featuring the penguins had been in the works since 2005 when the first ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' film was released, with a release date initially planned for 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=D'Works will rely on animal instinct|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929100|accessdate=October 27, 2011|newspaper=Variety|date=September 14, 2005}}</ref> The studio announced in March 2011 that the penguin characters would be given their own feature film to be directed by [[Simon J.
