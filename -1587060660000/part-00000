Following her death from cancer in 1986, he set up the Margaret Houghton Memorial Fund, a research unit on medical nursing in her memory. His second wife, Shiela, has been his companion for almost thirty years. \nHis two brothers both have followed the evangelical Christian tradition. His older brother, David Houghton was a passionate meteorologist, and outstanding member of the Royal Meteorological Society, who died in 2015 following Parkinson's Disease. <ref> https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wea.2566 </ref>. His sister-in-law, Dr Verna Houghton (nee Firth, died May 2019)) was, among other things, a researcher and lecturer at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford.

This has since been quoted by many [[global warming scepticism|sceptics]], including [[Benny Peiser]] and [[Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Christopher Monckton]], and is listed at the top of the front page of [[Christopher Booker]]'s ''[[The Real Global Warming Disaster]]''.  However, the quotation does not appear in any edition of Houghton's book. Houghton has never said any such thing and believes the opposite.<ref>{{Citation\n | date = 10 February 2010\n | title = Fabricated quote used to discredit climate scientist\n | periodical = [[The Independent]]\n | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/fabricated-quote-used-to-discredit-climate-scientist-1894552.html\n | accessdate = 10 February 2010\n}}\n</ref>\nThe publishers of ''The Real Global Warming Disaster'', The Continuum International Publishing Group, have apologised for the reference to that quotation, confirmed (in addition to Booker's confirmation) that it will not be repeated, and have agreed to place a corrigendum in any further copies of the book. In an article which appeared in ''The Sunday Telegraph'' on 20 February 2010, Christopher Booker purported to correct the misquotation contained in ''The Real Global Warming Disaster'' but this article contained yet further inaccuracies.<ref>{{Citation\n | date = 20 February 2010\n | title = Article by Christopher Booker in ''The Sunday Telegraph'', \"What the weatherman never said\"\n | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/7280369/What-the-weatherman-never-said.html\n | accessdate = 10 February 2010\n| work=The Daily Telegraph\n}}\n</ref> As a result, Houghton referred the matter to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC Reference 101959).

Historically considered part of the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] region,<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> it was ruled by the [[Vengi]] kingdom and the [[Pallava Dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Eastern Ganga]] dynasties during medieval times.<ref name=\"history3\" /> Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] king [[Kulothunga Chola I|Kulothunga I]]. Control over the city fluctuated between the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] and the [[Gajapati Kingdom]] of [[Odisha]]<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> until its conquest by the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 15th century.<ref name=\"history3\" /> In the 16th century it was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe city was ruled by Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Vishaka Varma. Legend has it that [[Radha]] and [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]] were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Vishaka Sakhi is the second most important [[gopi]] of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert gopi messenger. Local residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Vi\u015bakha. This is now inundated under sea water near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]]. Later it was ruled by [[Qutb Shahi]]s, [[Mughal Empire]] (between 1689 and 1724), [[Nizam]] (1724\u20131757) and France (1757\u20131765) before being captured by the British in 1765. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe British captured Visakhapatnam after the 1804 [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] and it remained under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]] until [[Independence of India|India's independence in 1947]] which was a part of the [[Northern Circars]].\n\n=== Buddhist influence ===\n\nHindu texts state that during the fifth century BC, the Visakhapatnam region was part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] territory, which extended to the [[Godavari River]]. Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace [[Buddhism]]. Visakhapatnam is surrounded by ancient Buddhist sites, most of which have been excavated recently and illustrate the legacy of Buddhism in the region.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n==== Pavurallakonda ====\n[[File:Yaksha Sculpture Relief at Pavurallakonda Buddhist Remnant Site near Bheemunipatnam.jpg|thumb|Yaksha Relief at [[Pavurallakonda]] near [[Bheemunipatnam]]|alt=eramic sculptures of guardian Yakshas]]\n[[Pavurallakonda]] (\"pigeon hill\") is a [[hillock]] west of Bhimli, about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam.

The name \"\u015aankaram\" derives from the [[Sangharama]] (temple or monastery). Located {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} south of Visakhapatnam, it is known locally as [[Bojjannakonda]] and is a significant Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh. The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic [[stupa]]s, rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century AD. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill. The vihara was active for about 1,000 years.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\nNearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with a number of images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves. At Ligalametta there are hundreds of rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows, spread across the hill. Among other Buddhist attractions are a relic casket, three [[chaitya]] halls, votive platforms, stupas and [[Vajrayana]] sculptures.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n{{-}}\n\n==== Bavikonda ====\n[[File:Bavikonda stupas.JPG|thumb|[[Bavikonda]] stupas|alt=Bavikonda Buddhist Complex]]\n\nBavikonda is an important Buddhist heritage site located on a hill about 15&nbsp;km, northeast from Visakhapatnam city. Here the Buddhist habitation is noticed on a 16&nbsp;ha flat terraced area. The Hinayana school of Buddhism was practised at the monastery between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. Bavikonda has remains of an entire Buddhist complex, comprising 26 structures belonging to three phases. A piece of bone stored in an urn recovered here is believed to belong to the mortal remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The word ''Bavikonda'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] means \"a hill of wells\". Fitting its name, Bavikonda is a hill with wells for the collection of rainwater. It is located {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site.\nExcavation carried out from 1982 to 1987 revealed a Buddhist establishment including a mahachaitya embedded with relic caskets,{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} a large vihara complex, numerous votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation and rectangular halls and a refectory. Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] coins and pottery dating from the third century BC to the second century AD. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the [[Buddha]]. The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia. It is a reminder of the Buddhist civilisation which once existed in southern India, and also reminiscent of [[Borobudur]] in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|title=bavikonda|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html/|publisher=www.buddhist-tourism.com|accessdate=7 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172341/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Thotlakonda ====\n[[File:Mahastupa in Thotlakonda, Visakhapatnam (2).jpg|thumbnail|left|Third-century BC Buddhist ruins of [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]]|alt=Corner of light-coloured, angular stone ruins]]\nAbout {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam is [[Thotlakonda]], a [[Buddhist]] complex situated on top of a hill. The Buddhist complex on the Mangamaripeta hilltop, locally known as [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]], lies about 16&nbsp;km from Visakhapatnam on Visakhapatnam-Bheemili Beach Road. After its discovery (during an aerial survey), the Government of Andhra Pradesh declared the 48&nbsp;ha site as a protected monument in 1978. Excavations in 1988 to 1992 exposed structural remains and artefacts, classified as Religious, Secular and Civil. These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage and stone pathways. The site covers an area of {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Excavations have revealed three kinds of structural remains: religious, secular and civil. Structures include a mahastupa, sixteen votive [[stupa]]s, a stone-pillared congregation hall, eleven rock-cut cisterns, well-paved stone pathways, an [[Apse|apsidal]] [[chaitya]]-griha, three round chaitgya-grihas, two votive platforms, ten [[vihara]]s and a kitchen complex with three halls and a refectory (dining hall). Apart from the structures, Buddhist treasures excavated include nine [[Satavahana]] and five Roman silver coins, [[terracotta]] tiles, stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels, miniature [[stupa]] models in stone, Buddha [[Pada (foot)|padas]] depicted with [[ashtamangala]] symbols (i.e. the eight auspicious symbols of Swastika, Shrivasta, Nandhyavarta, Vardhamanaka, Bhadrasana, Kalasha, Minyugala and Darpan) and early pottery.<ref>{{cite web |title=thotlakonda |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/thotlakonda-as-heritage-tourism-destination/article7329607.ece?ref=slideshow#im-image-3| publisher= The Hindu|accessdate= 18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nThe territory of Visakhapatnam then came under the Andhra rulers of [[Vengi]], and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] ruled the land. The region was ruled by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga king]]- SuryaVamsa Kshatriyas and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati kings]] of [[Odisha]] from the 10th century to the 16th centuries AD (when the region came under the Visakhapatnam rulers). Based on archaeological evidence, the [[Prabhakar]] and the Eastern Ganga Kings of Odisha built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ruled the area under the Visakhapatnam [[Nizam]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. European merchants from France, Holland and the [[East India Company]] used the natural port to export tobacco, [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], coal, iron ore, ivory, [[muslin]] and other textile products.\n\nLocal legend tells that an [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] king, on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]], rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Vi\u015bakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Shankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |title=Vi\u015bakha traces its name to Buddhist princess |publisher=The Hindu |date=15 July 2002 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913214905/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |archive-date=13 September 2003 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the [[Northern Circars]], a region comprising [[coastal Andhra]] and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the naval [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] near the harbour. After India's independence it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of [[Srikakulam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and Visakhapatnam.\n\nPart of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Passage Exercise (PASSEX) during International Fleet Review 2016 (01).JPG|International Fleet Review 2016\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Boats in Kondakarla ava 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kondakarla Ava]], a bird sanctuary near Visakhapatnam]]\nThe city is situated between the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name=\"location\" /> The city coordinates lies between 17.7041 N and 83.2977 E.<ref name=\"geo\" /><ref name=\"climate\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nVisakhapatnam has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'').<ref name=\"climate\" /> The annual mean temperatures ranges between {{Convert|24.7|\u2013|30.6|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, with the maximum in the month of May and the minimum in January; the minimum temperatures ranges between {{Convert|20|\u2013|27|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.

Historically considered part of the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] region,<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> it was ruled by the [[Vengi]] kingdom and the [[Pallava Dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Eastern Ganga]] dynasties during medieval times.<ref name=\"history3\" /> Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] king [[Kulothunga Chola I|Kulothunga I]].

European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe city was ruled by Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Vishaka Varma. Legend has it that [[Radha]] and [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]] were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Vishaka Sakhi is the second most important [[gopi]] of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert gopi messenger. Local residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Vi\u015bakha. This is now inundated under sea water near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]]. Later it was ruled by [[Qutb Shahi]]s, [[Mughal Empire]] (between 1689 and 1724), [[Nizam]] (1724\u20131757) and France (1757\u20131765) before being captured by the British in 1765. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe British captured Visakhapatnam after the 1804 [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] and it remained under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]] until [[Independence of India|India's independence in 1947]] which was a part of the [[Northern Circars]].\n\n=== Buddhist influence ===\n\nHindu texts state that during the fifth century BC, the Visakhapatnam region was part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] territory, which extended to the [[Godavari River]]. Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace [[Buddhism]]. Visakhapatnam is surrounded by ancient Buddhist sites, most of which have been excavated recently and illustrate the legacy of Buddhism in the region.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n==== Pavurallakonda ====\n[[File:Yaksha Sculpture Relief at Pavurallakonda Buddhist Remnant Site near Bheemunipatnam.jpg|thumb|Yaksha Relief at [[Pavurallakonda]] near [[Bheemunipatnam]]|alt=eramic sculptures of guardian Yakshas]]\n[[Pavurallakonda]] (\"pigeon hill\") is a [[hillock]] west of Bhimli, about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam.

The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century AD. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill. The vihara was active for about 1,000 years.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\nNearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with a number of images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves.

A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the [[Buddha]]. The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia.

The Buddhist complex on the Mangamaripeta hilltop, locally known as [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]], lies about 16&nbsp;km from Visakhapatnam on Visakhapatnam-Bheemili Beach Road. After its discovery (during an aerial survey), the Government of Andhra Pradesh declared the 48&nbsp;ha site as a protected monument in 1978. Excavations in 1988 to 1992 exposed structural remains and artefacts, classified as Religious, Secular and Civil. These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage and stone pathways. The site covers an area of {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Excavations have revealed three kinds of structural remains: religious, secular and civil. Structures include a mahastupa, sixteen votive [[stupa]]s, a stone-pillared congregation hall, eleven rock-cut cisterns, well-paved stone pathways, an [[Apse|apsidal]] [[chaitya]]-griha, three round chaitgya-grihas, two votive platforms, ten [[vihara]]s and a kitchen complex with three halls and a refectory (dining hall). Apart from the structures, Buddhist treasures excavated include nine [[Satavahana]] and five Roman silver coins, [[terracotta]] tiles, stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels, miniature [[stupa]] models in stone, Buddha [[Pada (foot)|padas]] depicted with [[ashtamangala]] symbols (i.e. the eight auspicious symbols of Swastika, Shrivasta, Nandhyavarta, Vardhamanaka, Bhadrasana, Kalasha, Minyugala and Darpan) and early pottery.<ref>{{cite web |title=thotlakonda |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/thotlakonda-as-heritage-tourism-destination/article7329607.ece?ref=slideshow#im-image-3| publisher= The Hindu|accessdate= 18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nThe territory of Visakhapatnam then came under the Andhra rulers of [[Vengi]], and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] ruled the land. The region was ruled by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga king]]- SuryaVamsa Kshatriyas and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati kings]] of [[Odisha]] from the 10th century to the 16th centuries AD (when the region came under the Visakhapatnam rulers). Based on archaeological evidence, the [[Prabhakar]] and the Eastern Ganga Kings of Odisha built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ruled the area under the Visakhapatnam [[Nizam]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. European merchants from France, Holland and the [[East India Company]] used the natural port to export tobacco, [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], coal, iron ore, ivory, [[muslin]] and other textile products.\n\nLocal legend tells that an [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] king, on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]], rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Vi\u015bakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Shankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |title=Vi\u015bakha traces its name to Buddhist princess |publisher=The Hindu |date=15 July 2002 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913214905/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |archive-date=13 September 2003 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the [[Northern Circars]], a region comprising [[coastal Andhra]] and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the naval [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] near the harbour. After India's independence it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of [[Srikakulam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and Visakhapatnam.\n\nPart of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Passage Exercise (PASSEX) during International Fleet Review 2016 (01).JPG|International Fleet Review 2016\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Boats in Kondakarla ava 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kondakarla Ava]], a bird sanctuary near Visakhapatnam]]\nThe city is situated between the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name=\"location\" /> The city coordinates lies between 17.7041 N and 83.2977 E.<ref name=\"geo\" /><ref name=\"climate\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nVisakhapatnam has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'').<ref name=\"climate\" /> The annual mean temperatures ranges between {{Convert|24.7|\u2013|30.6|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, with the maximum in the month of May and the minimum in January; the minimum temperatures ranges between {{Convert|20|\u2013|27|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.

His works span the transition between the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] eras in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") shows an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from [[deafness]]. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression. \n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]] which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his great patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with the composer as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. His problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life are exemplified by his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) and his unsent letter to his \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness he [[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|died in 1827]]. Beethoven's works in all genres remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== Family and early life ===\n[[File:Beethoven house of birth Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's birthplace at Bonngasse&nbsp;20, Bonn, now the [[Beethoven House]] museum]]\nBeethoven was the grandson of [[Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773)|Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1712\u20131773), a musician from the town of [[Mechelen]] in the Austrian [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in what is now the [[Flemish region]] of Belgium) who had moved to [[Bonn]] at the age of 21.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=407}} Ludwig was employed as a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the court of [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]], eventually rising to become, in 1761, [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12\u201317}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740\u20131792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}} Johann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}} Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn. There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his [[baptism]], in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus, (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=53}}\n\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar Anton Karl]] was born on 8 April 1774, and [[Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven|Nikolaus Johann]], (generally known as Johann) the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.{{sfn|Stanley|2000|p=7}}\n\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=57\u20138}}\n\n===1780\u20131792: Bonn ===\n[[File:Christian Gottlob Neefe.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Christian Gottlob Neefe.

In addition, some minor works not listed with opus numbers or in the WoO list have [[Catalogues_of_Beethoven_compositions#Hess_catalogue|Hess catalogue]] numbers.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=210}}|group=n}} Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=65\u201370}} His [[Three Piano Sonatas, WoO 47 (Beethoven)|first three piano sonatas]], WoO 47, sometimes known as \"{{lang|de|[[Kurf\u00fcrst]]}}\" (\"Elector\") for their dedication to the Elector [[Maximilian Friedrich von K\u00f6nigsegg-Rothenfels|Maximilian Friedrich]] (1708\u20131784), were published in 1783.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=69}} In the same year the first printed reference to Beethoven appeared in the ''Magazin der Musik'' \u2013 \"Louis van Beethoven [sic] ... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent.

He gave some support to Beethoven, appointing him Court Organist and paying towards his visit to Vienna of 1792. {{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=50}}\n\nHe was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life. He often visited the cultivated von Breuning family, at whose home he taught piano to some of the children, and where the widowed Frau von Breuning offered him a motherly friendship. Here he also met [[ Franz Gerhard Wegeler|Franz Wegeler]], a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von Breuning daughters). The von Breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline. Another frequenter of the von Breunings was [[Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein|Count Ferdinand von Waldstein]], who became a friend and financial supporter during Beethoven's Bonn period.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 2}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=55}}{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 51\u201352}} Waldstein was to commission in 1791 Beethoven's first work for the stage, the ballet ''Musik zu einem Ritterballett'' (WoO 1).{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p= 121\u2013122}} \n\n[[File:Count von Waldstein.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Count Waldstein: portrait by  [[Anton\u00edn Machek]], c. 1800]]In the period 1785\u201390 there is virtually no record of Beethoven's activity as a composer. This may be attributed to the lukewarm response his initial publications had attracted, and also to ongoing problems in the Beethoven family.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=36\u201337}} His mother died in 1787, shortly after Beethoven\u2019s first visit to Vienna, where he stayed for about two weeks and almost certainly met Mozart.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 2}} In 1789 Beethoven's father was forcibly retired from the service of the Court (as a consequence of his alcoholism) and it was ordered that half of his father's pension be paid directly to Ludwig for support of the family.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=95}} He contributed further to the family's income by teaching (to which Wegeler said he had \"an extraordinary aversion\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=51}}) and by playing [[viola]] in the court orchestra. This familiarized him with a variety of operas, including works by Mozart, [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] and [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=95\u201398}} Here he also befriended [[Anton Reicha]], a composer, [[flute|flautist]] and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, [[Josef Reicha]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=96}} \n\nFrom 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed a number of works (none were published at the time) showing a growing range and maturity. [[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35\u201341}} It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (WoO 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=93\u201394}}. These two ''Emperor Cantatas'' were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by [[Johannes Brahms]] as \"Beethoven through and through\" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=107\u2013111}}\n\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the [[Redoute, Bad Godesberg|Redoute in Godesberg]]. It is likely that arrangements were made at that time for Beethoven to study with the older master.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 41}} Waldstein wrote to him before his departure: \u201cYou are going to Vienna in fulfilment of your long-frustrated wishes [\u2026] With the help of assiduous labour you shall receive Mozart\u2019s spirit from Haydn\u2019s hands.\u201d{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 2}}\n\n===1792\u20131802: Vienna - the early years ===\n[[File:Beethoven Riedel 1801.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Beethoven as a young man, c. 1800, by Carl Traugott Riedel (1769\u20131832)]]Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792, amid rumours of [[First Coalition|war spilling out of France]]; he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 42}}  Over the next few years, Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartian flavour.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 43}}\n\nHe did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction,{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 3}} he sought to master [[counterpoint]]. He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=149}}\n\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.{{sfn|Ronge|2013}} However, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, F\u00fcrst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=59}} His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf |Dittersdorf]] (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}} \n\n[[File:\u00d6lenhainz - Franz Joseph Maximilian von Lobkowitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince Lobkowitz: portrait by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, where he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s.{{refn|It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]].

These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky,{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 59}} and were a financial success; Beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 56}} In 1799 Beethoven participated in (and won) a notorious piano 'duel' at the home of Baron Raimund Wetzlar (a former patron of Mozart) against the virtuoso [[Joseph W\u00f6lfl]]; and in the following year he similarly triumphed against [[Daniel Steibelt]] at the salon of [[Count Moritz von Fries]].{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=79}} Beethoven's eighth [[piano sonata]] the \"[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]\"  (Op. 13), published in 1799 is described by the musicologist [[Barry  Cooper (musicologist)|Barry Cooper]] as \"surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 82}} \n\nBeethoven composed his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first six string quartets (Op. 18)]] between 1798 and 1800 (commissioned by, and dedicated to, Prince Lobkowitz). They were published in 1801. He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime. With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 58}}  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the [[Burgtheater]] on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as \"the most interesting concert in a long time,\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}} \n\n[[File:Josephine Brunsvik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Josephine Brunsvik, pencil miniature (unknown artist), before 1804.]]In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik.

In late 1801, he met a young countess, [[Giulietta Guicciardi|Julie (\"Giulietta\") Guicciardi]], through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing this. He later dedicated his [[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Sonata No. 14]], now commonly known as the ''Moonlight Sonata'', to her.{{sfn|Steblin|2009}}\n\nIn the spring of 1801 he completed ''[[The Creatures of Prometheus]]'', a [[ballet]]. The work received numerous performances in 1801 and 1802, and he rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early popularity.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 98\u2013103}} In the spring of 1802 he completed the [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second Symphony]], intended for performance at a concert that was cancelled. The symphony received its premiere instead at a subscription concert in April 1803 at the [[Theater an der Wien]], where he had been appointed composer in residence. In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]], and the [[oratorio]] ''[[Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)|Christ on the Mount of Olives]]''. Reviews were mixed, but the concert was a financial success; he was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201327}}\n\nHis business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother Kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs. In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations. Beethoven acceded to these requests, as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201315}}\n\n===1802\u20131812: The 'heroic' period ===\n====Deafness====\n[[File:Beethoven Hornemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beethoven in 1803, painted by [[Christian Horneman]]]]Beethoven told the English pianist [[Charles Neate]] (in 1815) that he dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a quarrel with a singer.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=160}} During its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of [[tinnitus]].{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=223\u201324}} As early as 1801, he wrote to Wegeler and another friend Karl Amenda, describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 108}} The cause was probably [[otosclerosis]], perhaps accompanied by degeneration of the [[auditory nerve]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 5}}{{refn|The cause of Beethoven\u2019s deafness has also variously been attributed to , amongst other possibilities, [[lead poisoning]] from Beethoven\u2019s preferred wines{{sfn|Stevens|2013|pp=2854-2858}}, and [[Paget's disease of bone]] {{sfn|Oiseth|2015|pp=139\u201347}}|group=n}} \n\nOn the advice of his doctor, he moved to the small Austrian town of [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]], just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition. There he wrote the document now known as the \u201c[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\u201d, a letter to his brothers which records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and records his resolution to continue living for and through his art. The letter was never actually sent and was discovered in the composer\u2019s papers after his death.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp= 169-172}} The letters to Wegeler and Amenda were not so despairing; in them Beethoven commented also on his ongoing professional and financial success at this period, and his determination, as he expressed it to Wegeler, to \u201cseize Fate by the throat; it shall certainly not crush me completely.\u201d{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 5}} In 1806, Beethoven noted on of his musical sketches \"Let your deafness no longer be a secret \u2013 even in art.\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=162}}.\n\nBeethoven's hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music, but it made playing at concerts\u2014a important source of income at this phase of his life\u2014increasingly difficult.

The idea of creating a symphony based on the career of [[Napoleon]] may have been suggested to Beethoven by [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Count Bernadotte]] in 1798.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 4}} Beethoven, sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, originally gave the symphony the title \"Bonaparte\", but disillusioned by Napoleon [[1804 French constitutional referendum|declaring himself Emperor in 1804]], he scratched Napoleon's name from the manuscript's title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle \"to celebrate the memory of a great man.\"{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 6}} The ''Eroica'' was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony.

T. A. Hoffmann]], in an influential review in the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'', as the  greatest of (what he considered) the three \"[[Romantic music|Romantic]]\" composers, (that is, ahead of Haydn and Mozart); in Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]] his music, wrote Hoffmann, \"sets in motion terror, fear, horror, pain, and awakens the infinite yearning that is the essence of romanticism\".{{sfn|Cassedy|2010|pp=1-6}}\n\nDuring this time Beethoven's income came from publishing his works, from performances of them, and from his patrons, for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period prior to their publication. Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 78\u201379}} Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria ]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]], who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.  They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|pp=300\u201301}} Beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to Rudolf, including some of his major works such as the [[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|''Archduke'' Trio]] Op. 97 (1811) and ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' Op. 123 (1823).\n\nHis position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on ''Leonore'', (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}\n\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher [[Muzio Clementi]] secured the rights for publishing his works in England, and Haydn's former patron [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Prince Esterh\u00e1zy]] commissioned a mass (the [[Mass_in_C_major_(Beethoven)|Mass in C]], Op. 86) for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]]. There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]). But it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the Fantasia Beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians \"badly played, wrong, again!\" The financial outcome is unknown.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=445-448}}\n\n[[File:Rudolf-habsburg-olmuetz.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's patron, [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788\u20131831)|Archduke Rudolf]]; portrait by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder|Johann Baptist von Lampi]]]]In the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven had received an offer from Napoleon's brother [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], then king of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], for a well-paid position as [[Kapellmeister]] at the court in [[Kassel|Cassel]]. To persuade him to stay in Vienna, the Archduke Rudolf, [[Ferdinand, 5th Prince Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau|Prince Kinsky]] and Prince Lobkowitz, after receiving representations from the composer's friends, pledged to pay him a pension of 4000 florins a year.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=457}}  In the event, Archduke Rudolf paid his share of the pension on the agreed date.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 195}} Kinsky, immediately called to military duty, did not contribute and died in November 1812 after falling from his horse.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=48}}.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 48}}  The Austrian currency destabilized and Lobkowitz went bankrupt in 1811, so that to benefit from the agreement Beethoven eventually had recourse to the law, which in 1815 brought him some recompense.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=194}}.\n\nThe imminence of war reaching Vienna itself was felt in early 1809. In April Beethoven had completed writing his [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 5]] in E flat major, Op. 73,{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=48}} which the musicologist [[Alfred Einstein]] has described as \u201cthe apotheosis of the military concept\u201d in Beethoven\u2019s music.{{sfn|Einstein|1958|p=47}} Archduke Rudolf left the capital with the Imperial family in early May, prompting Beethoven\u2019s piano sonata \u2018\u2019[[Piano Sonata No. 26 (Beethoven)|Les Adieux]]\u2019\u2019, (Sonata No. 26, Op. 81a), actually entitled by Beethoven in German \u201cDas Lebewohl\u201d(\u201c The Farewell\u201d), of which the final movement, \u2019\u2019Das Wiedersehen\u201d (\u2018\u2019The Return\u2019\u2019), is dated in the manuscript with the date of Rudolf\u2019s homecoming of 30 January 1810.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=464}}.

[[Egmont (Beethoven)| The result]] (an overture, and nine additional [[entracte]]s and vocal pieces, Op. 84), which appeared in 1810 fitted well with Beethoven's \"heroic\" style and he became interested in Goethe, setting three of his poems as songs (Op. 83) and learning about the poet from a mutual acquaintance, [[Bettina Brentano]] (who also wrote to Goethe at this time about Beethoven). Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 95]], to which the composer gave the subtitle ''Quartetto serioso'', and the Op. 97 [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|Piano Trio in B flat major]] known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph as the ''Archduke Trio''.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 7}}\n\nIn the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever. His doctor [[Johann Baptist Malfatti von Monteregio|Johann Malfatti]] recommended him to take a cure at the [[spa]] of [[Teplice|Teplitz]] (now Teplice in [[Czech Republic|Czechia]]) where he wrote two more overtures and sets of incidental music for dramas, this time by [[August von Kotzebue]] - ''[[King Stephen (Beethoven)|King Stephen]]'' Op. 117 and ''[[The Ruins of Athens]]'' Op. 113. Advised again to visit Teplitz in 1812 he met there with Goethe,  who wrote of the composer \"His talent amazed me; unfortunately he is an utterly untamed personality, who is not altogether wrong in holding the world to be detestable, but surely does not make it any more enjoyable [...] by his attitude.\" Beethoven wote to his publishers [[Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel]] that \"Goethe delights far too much in the court atmosphere, far more than is becoming in a poet.\"{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 7}} But following their meeting he began a setting for choir and orchestra of [[Meeresstille und gl\u00fcckliche Fahrt (Beethoven)| Goethe's ''Meeresstille und gl\u00fcckliche Fahrt'']] ''(Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage)'' (Op. 112), completed in 1815.

Unsympathetic to the sorts of trends in German romanticism that featured the supernatural (as in operas by [[Louis Spohr]], [[Heinrich Marschner]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber]], he also \"resisted the impending Romantic fragmentation of the [...] cyclic forms of the Classical era into small forms and lyric mood pieces\" and turned towards study of Bach, [[George Frederic Handel|Handel]] and [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]].{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=295}} An old connection was renewed in 1817 when Maelzel sought, and obtained, Beethoven's endorsement for his newly developed [[metronome]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=684-686}} During these years the few major works completed include Beethoven's only [[song cycle]], ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'' Op. 98, (1816), and the gigantic [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' Sonata]] (Sonata no 29 in B flat major, Op. 106) (1818).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 659, 717}} It was also in 1818 that he began musical sketches that eventually form part of his final Ninth Symphony.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=322}}\n\nBy early 1818 Beethoven's health had improved, and his nephew Karl, now aged 11, moved in with him in January, (although within a year Karl's mother had won him back in the courts).{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=41}} By now the composer's hearing had again significantly deteriorated, necessitating Beethoven and his interlocutors writing in notebooks to carry out conversations. These 'conversation books' are a rich written resource for this period. They contain discussions about music, business and personal life; they are also a valuable source for his contacts and for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and of his opinions of the art of music.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=164-167}} {{refn|It was suggested by Beethoven's  biographer [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]] that, of 400 conversation books, 264 were destroyed (and others were altered) after his death by his secretary  Schindler, who wished only an idealised biography of the composer to survive.{{sfn|Clive|2001|p=239}} The music historian [[Theodore Albrecht]] has however demonstrated that Thayer's allegations were over the top. \"[It is now] abundantly clear that Schindler never possessed as many as c. 400 conversation books, and that he never destroyed roughly five-eighths of that number.\"{{sfn|Albrecht|2009|p=181}} Schindler did however insert a number of fraudulent entries that bolstered his own profile and his prejudices.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=52}}{{sfn|Nettl|1994|p=103}} Presently 136 books covering the period 1819-1827 are preserved at the [[Staatsbibliothek Berlin]], with another two at the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn.{{sfn|Hammelmann|1965|p=187}}|group=n}} His household management had also improved somewhat; Nanette Streicher, who had assisted in his care during his illness, continued to provide some support, and he finally found a skilled cook.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 260}} A testimonial to the esteem in which Beethoven was held in England was the presentation to him in this year by Thomas Broadwood, the proprietor of the company, of a [[John Broadwood & Sons|Broadwood piano]], for which Beethoven expressed grateful thanks.

The first was the announcement of Archduke Rudolf's promotion to [[Cardinal]]-[[Archbishop]] and Archbishop of [[Olomouc]] (now in Czechia), which triggered the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' Op. 123, intended to be ready for his installation in Olomouc in March 1820. The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed. Beethoven was typically underwhelmed:  when in an April 1820 conversation book a friend mentioned Gebauer,  Beethoven wrote in reply \"Geh!

One consequence of this was that Schlesinger was to secure Beethoven's three last piano sonatas and his final quartets;  part of the attraction to Beethoven was that Schlesinger had publishing facilities in Germany, France and England which could overcome problems of copyright piracy.{{sfn|Conway|2012|pp=185-187}} The first of the three sonatas, for which Beethoven contracted with Schlesinger in 1820 at 30 [[Ducat#Spread of the ducat|ducat]]s per sonata, (further delaying completion of the Mass), was sent to the publisher at the end of that year (the [[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|Sonata in E major, Op. 109]], dedicated to Maximiliane, Antonie Brentano's daughter).{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=27-28}}.\n\nThe start of 1821 saw Beethoven once again in poor health, suffering from [[rheumatism]] and [[jaundice]]. Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Sonata in A flat major Op. 110]] was published in December), and on the Mass.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 776-777, 781-782}} In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including him lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 362 -363}} Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the [[Philharmonic Society]] of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which was working.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 833-834}} Also in November Prince [[Nikolay Borisovich Galitzin|Nikolay Galitzin]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets. Beethoven set the price at the high level of 50 ducats per quartet in a letter dictated to his nephew Karl, who was then living with him.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=815-816}}\n\n===1823\u20131827: The final years===\n[[File:Beethoven Waldmuller 1823.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Beethoven in 1823 by [[Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller]]]]The year 1823 saw the completion of three notable works, all of which had occupied Beethoven for some years, namely the ''Missa Solemnis'', the Ninth Symphony and the ''Diabelli Variations''.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 879}}\n\nBeethoven at last presented the manuscript of the completed ''Missa'' to Rudolph on 19 March (more than a year after the Archduke's enthronement as Archbishop). He was not however in a hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. In the event one of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent the composer a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works and enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and Symphony was first performed, along with sections of the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 9}}{{refn|The first full performance of the ''Missa Solemnis'' had aldready been given in St. Petersburg by Golitsin, who had been a subscriber for the manuscript 'preview' that Beethoven had arranged.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}|group=n}} Beethoven stood by the conductor [[Michael Umlauf]] during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=351}} The ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\" The concert this did not make Beethoven much money, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}\n\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Golitsin, despite failing health. The first of these, the [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127]] was premiered by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] in March 1825. While writing the next,  the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|quartet in A minor, Op. 132]], in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in [[Baden]], he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the [[Lydian mode]].\" {{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} The next quartet to be completed was the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Thirteenth, op. 130]], in B\u266d major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet. Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}} \n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} He also began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again.

As news spread of the severity of Beethoven's condition, many friends, both old and new, came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] and his pupil [[Ferdinand Hiller]]. Many tributes were also sent, including \u00a3100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of wine from Schotts.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=378-379}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} During this period he was almost completely bedridden despite occasional brave efforts to rouse himself.

The \"early\" period is typically seen to last until 1802, the \"middle\" period from 1802 to 1812, and the \"late\" period thereafter. This distinction was first introduced in 1828, just one year after his death, and while often challenged and refined it remains a starting point to understand the development of Beethoven's work.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 11}}\n\n===Bonn===\nBeethoven's early years in Bonn arguably represent a further, preliminary, period. His earliest known composition was from 1782, and a total of 40 pieces by him dating from 1792 or earlier are known today (though mainly from much later sources). Today his best-known works from before 1790 are three piano quartets and three piano sonatas, the quartets being closely modelled on Mozart's sonatas for piano and violin. From 1790 to 1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music (including movements of symphonies and a draft violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.{{refn|{{harvnb|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 12}}, quote: \"... a few rather colourless sonata movements... Less impressive, in these years, is the instrumental music in the sonata style. ... Where Beethoven departed from formula in these works he seems to have straggled helplessly, as in the violin concerto fragment. ... Beethoven at Bonn was a less interesting composer of works in the sonata style than of music in other genres ...\"|group=n}}\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth.

His works span the transition between the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] eras in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") shows an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from [[deafness]]. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression. \n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]] which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his great patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with the composer as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. His problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life are exemplified by his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) and his unsent letter to his \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness he [[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|died in 1827]]. Beethoven's works in all genres remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== Family and early life ===\n[[File:Beethoven house of birth Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's birthplace at Bonngasse&nbsp;20, Bonn, now the [[Beethoven House]] museum]]\nBeethoven was the grandson of [[Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773)|Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1712\u20131773), a musician from the town of [[Mechelen]] in the Austrian [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in what is now the [[Flemish region]] of Belgium) who had moved to [[Bonn]] at the age of 21.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=407}} Ludwig was employed as a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the court of [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]], eventually rising to become, in 1761, [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12\u201317}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740\u20131792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}} Johann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}} Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn. There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his [[baptism]], in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus, (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=53}}\n\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar Anton Karl]] was born on 8 April 1774, and [[Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven|Nikolaus Johann]], (generally known as Johann) the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.{{sfn|Stanley|2000|p=7}}\n\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=57\u20138}}\n\n===1780\u20131792: Bonn ===\n[[File:Christian Gottlob Neefe.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Christian Gottlob Neefe.

Here he also met [[ Franz Gerhard Wegeler|Franz Wegeler]], a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von Breuning daughters). The von Breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline.

[[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35\u201341}} It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (WoO 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=93\u201394}}. These two ''Emperor Cantatas'' were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by [[Johannes Brahms]] as \"Beethoven through and through\" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=107\u2013111}}\n\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the [[Redoute, Bad Godesberg|Redoute in Godesberg]].

He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=149}}\n\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.{{sfn|Ronge|2013}} However, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, F\u00fcrst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=59}} His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf |Dittersdorf]] (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}} \n\n[[File:\u00d6lenhainz - Franz Joseph Maximilian von Lobkowitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince Lobkowitz: portrait by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, where he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s.{{refn|It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]].

They were published in 1801. He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime. With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 58}}  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the [[Burgtheater]] on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as \"the most interesting concert in a long time,\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}} \n\n[[File:Josephine Brunsvik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Josephine Brunsvik, pencil miniature (unknown artist), before 1804.]]In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik.

The young [[Carl Czerny]], who later became a renowned music teacher himself, studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. In late 1801, he met a young countess, [[Giulietta Guicciardi|Julie (\"Giulietta\") Guicciardi]], through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing this.

In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]], and the [[oratorio]] ''[[Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)|Christ on the Mount of Olives]]''. Reviews were mixed, but the concert was a financial success; he was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201327}}\n\nHis business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother Kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs. In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations. Beethoven acceded to these requests, as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201315}}\n\n===1802\u20131812: The 'heroic' period ===\n====Deafness====\n[[File:Beethoven Hornemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beethoven in 1803, painted by [[Christian Horneman]]]]Beethoven told the English pianist [[Charles Neate]] (in 1815) that he dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a quarrel with a singer.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=160}} During its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of [[tinnitus]].{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=223\u201324}} As early as 1801, he wrote to Wegeler and another friend Karl Amenda, describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 108}} The cause was probably [[otosclerosis]], perhaps accompanied by degeneration of the [[auditory nerve]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 5}}{{refn|The cause of Beethoven\u2019s deafness has also variously been attributed to , amongst other possibilities, [[lead poisoning]] from Beethoven\u2019s preferred wines{{sfn|Stevens|2013|pp=2854-2858}}, and [[Paget's disease of bone]] {{sfn|Oiseth|2015|pp=139\u201347}}|group=n}} \n\nOn the advice of his doctor, he moved to the small Austrian town of [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]], just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition.

Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 78\u201379}} Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria ]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]], who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.  They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|pp=300\u201301}} Beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to Rudolf, including some of his major works such as the [[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|''Archduke'' Trio]] Op. 97 (1811) and ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' Op. 123 (1823).\n\nHis position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on ''Leonore'', (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}\n\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition.

A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]]. There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]).

The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed.

One consequence of this was that Schlesinger was to secure Beethoven's three last piano sonatas and his final quartets;  part of the attraction to Beethoven was that Schlesinger had publishing facilities in Germany, France and England which could overcome problems of copyright piracy.{{sfn|Conway|2012|pp=185-187}} The first of the three sonatas, for which Beethoven contracted with Schlesinger in 1820 at 30 [[Ducat#Spread of the ducat|ducat]]s per sonata, (further delaying completion of the Mass), was sent to the publisher at the end of that year (the [[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|Sonata in E major, Op. 109]], dedicated to Maximiliane, Antonie Brentano's daughter).{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=27-28}}.\n\nThe start of 1821 saw Beethoven once again in poor health, suffering from [[rheumatism]] and [[jaundice]]. Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Sonata in A flat major Op. 110]] was published in December), and on the Mass.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 776-777, 781-782}} In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including him lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 362 -363}} Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the [[Philharmonic Society]] of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which was working.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 833-834}} Also in November Prince [[Nikolay Borisovich Galitzin|Nikolay Galitzin]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets.

He was not however in a hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. In the event one of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent the composer a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works and enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and Symphony was first performed, along with sections of the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 9}}{{refn|The first full performance of the ''Missa Solemnis'' had aldready been given in St. Petersburg by Golitsin, who had been a subscriber for the manuscript 'preview' that Beethoven had arranged.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}|group=n}} Beethoven stood by the conductor [[Michael Umlauf]] during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=351}} The ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\" The concert this did not make Beethoven much money, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}\n\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Golitsin, despite failing health. The first of these, the [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127]] was premiered by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] in March 1825. While writing the next,  the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|quartet in A minor, Op. 132]], in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in [[Baden]], he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the [[Lydian mode]].\" {{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} The next quartet to be completed was the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Thirteenth, op. 130]], in B\u266d major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet. Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}} \n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} He also began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again.

From 1790 to 1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music (including movements of symphonies and a draft violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.{{refn|{{harvnb|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 12}}, quote: \"... a few rather colourless sonata movements...

Where Beethoven departed from formula in these works he seems to have straggled helplessly, as in the violin concerto fragment. ... Beethoven at Bonn was a less interesting composer of works in the sonata style than of music in other genres ...\"|group=n}}\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period.<ref name=\"Steinberg2006\">{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Michael P.|authorlink=Michael P.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]). A statue to Mozart had been unveiled in [[Salzburg]], Austria, in 1842. Vienna did not honour Beethoven with a statue until 1880.{{sfn|Comini|2008|p=316}} \n\nThere is a museum, the [[Beethoven House]], the place of his birth, in central Bonn.

The room contains urns X1, X2, X3, ... each of which contains a known mix of balls, each ball labeled y1, y2, y3, ... .  The genie chooses an urn in that room and randomly draws a ball from that urn.  They then put the ball onto a conveyor belt, where the observer can observe the sequence of the balls but not the sequence of urns from which they were drawn. The genie has some procedure to choose urns; the choice of the urn for the ''n''-th ball depends only upon a random number and the choice of the urn for the (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)-th ball.  The choice of urn does not directly depend on the urns chosen before this single previous urn; therefore, this is called a [[Markov process]]. It can be described by the upper part of Figure 1.\n\nThe Markov process itself cannot be observed, only the sequence of labeled balls, thus this arrangement is called a \"hidden Markov process\". This is illustrated by the lower part of the diagram shown in Figure 1, where one can see that balls y1, y2, y3, y4 can be drawn at each state. Even if the observer knows the composition of the urns and has just observed a sequence of three balls, ''e.g.'' y1, y2 and y3 on the conveyor belt, the observer still cannot be ''sure'' which urn (''i.e.'', at which state) the genie has drawn the third ball from. However, the observer can work out other information, such as the likelihood that the third ball came from each of the urns.\n\n=== Weather guessing game ===\n{{HMM example}}\n\n''A similar example is further elaborated in the [[Viterbi algorithm#Example|Viterbi algorithm]] page.''\n\n== Structural architecture ==\nThe diagram below shows the general architecture of an instantiated HMM. Each oval shape represents a random variable that can adopt any of a number of values. The random variable ''x''(''t'') is the hidden state at time {{mvar|t}} (with the model from the above diagram, ''x''(''t'')&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;{&nbsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;}). The random variable ''y''(''t'') is the observation at time {{mvar|t}} (with ''y''(''t'')&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;{&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;}). The arrows in the diagram (often called a [[Trellis (graph)|trellis diagram]]) denote conditional dependencies.\n\nFrom the diagram, it is clear that the [[conditional probability distribution]] of the hidden variable ''x''(''t'') at time {{mvar|t}}, given the values of the hidden variable {{mvar|x}} at all times, depends ''only'' on the value of the hidden variable ''x''(''t''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1); the values at time ''t''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 and before have no influence. This is called the [[Markov property]]. Similarly, the value of the observed variable ''y''(''t'') only depends on the value of the hidden variable ''x''(''t'') (both at time {{mvar|t}}).\n\nIn the standard type of hidden Markov model considered here, the state space of the hidden variables is discrete, while the observations themselves can either be discrete (typically generated from a [[categorical distribution]]) or continuous (typically from a [[Gaussian distribution]]).  The parameters of a hidden Markov model are of two types, ''transition probabilities'' and ''emission probabilities'' (also known as ''output probabilities'').  The transition probabilities control the way the hidden state at time {{mvar|t}} is chosen given the hidden state at time <math>t-1</math>.\n\nThe hidden state space is assumed to consist of one of {{mvar|N}} possible values, modelled as a categorical distribution. (See the section below on extensions for other possibilities.) This means that for each of the {{mvar|N}} possible states that a hidden variable at time {{mvar|t}} can be in, there is a transition probability from this state to each of the {{mvar|N}} possible states of the hidden variable at time <math>t+1</math>, for a total of <math>N^2</math> transition probabilities. Note that the set of transition probabilities for transitions from any given state must sum to 1. Thus, the <math>N \\times N</math> matrix of transition probabilities is a [[Stochastic matrix|Markov matrix]]. Because any one transition probability can be determined once the others are known, there are a total of <math>N(N-1)</math> transition parameters.\n\nIn addition, for each of the {{mvar|N}} possible states, there is a set of emission probabilities governing the distribution of the observed variable at a particular time given the state of the hidden variable at that time.  The size of this set depends on the nature of the observed variable.  For example, if the observed variable is discrete with {{mvar|M}} possible values, governed by a [[categorical distribution]], there will be <math>M-1</math> separate parameters, for a total of <math>N(M-1)</math> emission parameters over all hidden states.  On the other hand, if the observed variable is an {{mvar|M}}-dimensional vector distributed according to an arbitrary [[multivariate Gaussian distribution]], there will be {{mvar|M}} parameters controlling the [[mean]]s and <math>\\frac {M(M+1)} 2</math> parameters controlling the [[covariance matrix]], for a total of <math>N \\left(M + \\frac{M(M+1)}{2}\\right) = \\frac {NM(M+3)} 2 = O(NM^2)</math> emission parameters. (In such a case, unless the value of {{mvar|M}} is small, it may be more practical to restrict the nature of the covariances between individual elements of the observation vector, e.g. by assuming that the elements are independent of each other, or less restrictively, are independent of all but a fixed number of adjacent elements.)\n\n[[File:hmm temporal bayesian net.svg|500px|center|Temporal evolution of a hidden Markov model]]\n\n== Inference ==\n[[File:HMMsequence.svg|thumb|400px|The state transition and output probabilities of an HMM are indicated by the line opacity in the upper part of the diagram. Given that we have observed the output sequence in the lower part of the diagram, we may be interested in the most likely sequence of states that could have produced it. Based on the arrows that are present in the diagram, the following state sequences are candidates:<br />\n5 3 2 5 3 2<br />\n4 3 2 5 3 2<br />\n3 1 2 5 3 2<br />\nWe can find the most likely sequence by evaluating the joint probability of both the state sequence and the observations for each case (simply by multiplying the probability values, which here correspond to the opacities of the arrows involved). In general, this type of problem (i.e. finding the most likely explanation for an observation sequence) can be solved efficiently using the [[Viterbi algorithm]].]]\n\nSeveral [[inference]] problems are associated with hidden Markov models, as outlined below.\n\n=== Probability of an observed sequence ===\nThe task is to compute in a best way, given the parameters of the model, the probability of a particular output sequence.  This requires summation over all possible state sequences:\n\nThe probability of observing a sequence\n: <math>Y=y(0), y(1),\\dots,y(L-1)\\,</math>\nof length ''L'' is given by\n:<math>P(Y)=\\sum_{X}P(Y\\mid X)P(X),\\,</math>\nwhere the sum runs over all possible hidden-node sequences\n: <math>X=x(0), x(1), \\dots, x(L-1).\\,</math>\n\nApplying the principle of [[dynamic programming]], this problem, too, can be handled efficiently using the [[forward algorithm]].\n\n=== Probability of the latent variables ===\nA number of related tasks ask about the probability of one or more of the latent variables, given the model's parameters and a sequence of observations <math>y(1),\\dots,y(t).</math>\n\n==== Filtering ====\nThe task is to compute, given the model's parameters and a sequence of observations, the distribution over hidden states of the last latent variable at the end of the sequence, i.e. to compute <math>P(x(t)\\ |\\ y(1),\\dots,y(t))</math>.  This task is normally used when the sequence of latent variables is thought of as the underlying states that a process moves through at a sequence of points of time, with corresponding observations at each point in time.  Then, it is natural to ask about the state of the process at the end.\n\nThis problem can be handled efficiently using the [[forward algorithm]].\n\n==== Smoothing ====\nThis is similar to filtering but asks about the distribution of a latent variable somewhere in the middle of a sequence, i.e. to compute <math>P(x(k)\\ |\\ y(1), \\dots, y(t))</math> for some <math>k < t</math>.  From the perspective described above, this can be thought of as the probability distribution over hidden states for a point in time ''k'' in the past, relative to time ''t''.\n\nThe [[forward-backward algorithm]] is a good method for computing the smoothed values for all hidden state variables.\n\n==== Most likely explanation ====\nThe task, unlike the previous two, asks about the [[joint probability]] of the ''entire'' sequence of hidden states that generated a particular sequence of observations (see illustration on the right).  This task is generally applicable when HMM's are applied to different sorts of problems from those for which the tasks of filtering and smoothing are applicable.  An example is [[part-of-speech tagging]], where the hidden states represent the underlying [[part of speech|parts of speech]] corresponding to an observed sequence of words.  In this case, what is of interest is the entire sequence of parts of speech, rather than simply the part of speech for a single word, as filtering or smoothing would compute.\n\nThis task requires finding a maximum over all possible state sequences, and can be solved efficiently by the [[Viterbi algorithm]].\n\n=== Statistical significance ===\nFor some of the above problems, it may also be interesting to ask about [[statistical significance]].  What is the probability that a sequence drawn from some [[null distribution]] will have an HMM probability (in the case of the forward algorithm) or a maximum state sequence probability (in the case of the Viterbi algorithm) at least as large as that of a particular output sequence?<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Newberg |first1=L. |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-10-212 |title=Error statistics of hidden Markov model and hidden Boltzmann model results |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=10 |pages=212 |year=2009 |pmid=19589158 |pmc=2722652}} {{open access}}</ref>  When an HMM is used to evaluate the relevance of a hypothesis for a particular output sequence, the statistical significance indicates the [[false positive rate]] associated with failing to reject the hypothesis for the output sequence.\n\n== Learning ==\n\nThe parameter learning task in HMMs is to find, given an output sequence or a set of such sequences, the best set of state transition and emission probabilities. The task is usually to derive the [[maximum likelihood]] estimate of the parameters of the HMM given the set of output sequences. No tractable algorithm is known for solving this problem exactly, but a local maximum likelihood can be derived efficiently using the [[Baum\u2013Welch algorithm]] or the Baldi\u2013Chauvin algorithm.  The [[Baum\u2013Welch algorithm]] is a special case of the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]. If the HMMs are used for time series prediction, more sophisticated Bayesian inference methods, like [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) sampling are proven to be favorable over finding a single maximum likelihood model both in terms of accuracy and stability.<ref>Sipos, I.

Since then, they have become ubiquitous in the field of [[bioinformatics]].<ref name=durbin>{{Durbin 1998}}</ref>\n\n== Extensions ==\nIn the hidden Markov models considered above, the state space of the hidden variables is discrete, while the observations themselves can either be discrete (typically generated from a [[categorical distribution]]) or continuous (typically from a [[Gaussian distribution]]). Hidden Markov models can also be generalized to allow continuous state spaces. Examples of such models are those where the Markov process over hidden variables is a [[linear dynamical system]], with a linear relationship among related variables and where all hidden and observed variables follow a [[Gaussian distribution]]. In simple cases, such as the linear dynamical system just mentioned, exact inference is tractable (in this case, using the [[Kalman filter]]); however, in general, exact inference in HMMs with continuous latent variables is infeasible, and approximate methods must be used, such as the [[extended Kalman filter]] or the [[particle filter]].\n\nHidden Markov models are [[generative model]]s, in which the [[joint distribution]] of observations and hidden states, or equivalently both the [[prior distribution]] of hidden states (the ''transition probabilities'') and [[conditional distribution]] of observations given states (the ''emission probabilities''), is modeled.  The above algorithms implicitly assume a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] prior distribution over the transition probabilities. However, it is also possible to create hidden Markov models with other types of prior distributions. An obvious candidate, given the categorical distribution of the transition probabilities, is the [[Dirichlet distribution]], which is the [[conjugate prior]] distribution of the categorical distribution.  Typically, a symmetric Dirichlet distribution is chosen, reflecting ignorance about which states are inherently more likely than others.  The single parameter of this distribution (termed the ''concentration parameter'') controls the relative density or sparseness of the resulting transition matrix.  A choice of 1 yields a uniform distribution.  Values greater than 1 produce a dense matrix, in which the transition probabilities between pairs of states are likely to be nearly equal.  Values less than 1 result in a sparse matrix in which, for each given source state, only a small number of destination states have non-negligible transition probabilities.  It is also possible to use a two-level prior Dirichlet distribution, in which one Dirichlet distribution (the upper distribution) governs the parameters of another Dirichlet distribution (the lower distribution), which in turn governs the transition probabilities.  The upper distribution governs the overall distribution of states, determining how likely each state is to occur; its concentration parameter determines the density or sparseness of states.  Such a two-level prior distribution, where both concentration parameters are set to produce sparse distributions, might be useful for example in [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] [[part-of-speech tagging]], where some parts of speech occur much more commonly than others; learning algorithms that assume a uniform prior distribution generally perform poorly on this task.  The parameters of models of this sort, with non-uniform prior distributions, can be learned using [[Gibbs sampling]] or extended versions of the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]].\n\nAn extension of the previously described hidden Markov models with [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet]] priors uses a [[Dirichlet process]] in place of a Dirichlet distribution.  This type of model allows for an unknown and potentially infinite number of states.  It is common to use a two-level Dirichlet process, similar to the previously described model with two levels of Dirichlet distributions.  Such a model is called a ''hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model'', or ''HDP-HMM'' for short. It was originally described under the name \"Infinite Hidden Markov Model\"{{ref|Beal, Matthew J., Zoubin Ghahramani, and Carl Edward Rasmussen. \"The infinite hidden Markov model.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 14 (2002): 577-584.}} and was further formalized in{{ref|Teh, Yee Whye, et al. \"Hierarchical dirichlet processes.\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 101.476 (2006).}}.\n\nA different type of extension uses a [[discriminative model]] in place of the [[generative model]] of standard HMMs.  This type of model directly models the conditional distribution of the hidden states given the observations, rather than modeling the joint distribution.  An example of this model is the so-called ''[[maximum entropy Markov model]]'' (MEMM), which models the conditional distribution of the states using [[logistic regression]] (also known as a \"[[Maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum entropy]] model\").  The advantage of this type of model is that arbitrary features (i.e. functions) of the observations can be modeled, allowing domain-specific knowledge of the problem at hand to be injected into the model.  Models of this sort are not limited to modeling direct dependencies between a hidden state and its associated observation; rather, features of nearby observations, of combinations of the associated observation and nearby observations, or in fact of arbitrary observations at any distance from a given hidden state can be included in the process used to determine the value of a hidden state.  Furthermore, there is no need for these features to be [[statistically independent]] of each other, as would be the case if such features were used in a generative model.  Finally, arbitrary features over pairs of adjacent hidden states can be used rather than simple transition probabilities.  The disadvantages of such models are: (1) The types of prior distributions that can be placed on hidden states are severely limited; (2) It is not possible to predict the probability of seeing an arbitrary observation.  This second limitation is often not an issue in practice, since many common usages of HMM's do not require such predictive probabilities.\n\nA variant of the previously described discriminative model is the linear-chain [[conditional random field]].  This uses an undirected graphical model (aka [[Markov random field]]) rather than the directed graphical models of MEMM's and similar models.  The advantage of this type of model is that it does not suffer from the so-called ''label bias'' problem of MEMM's, and thus may make more accurate predictions.  The disadvantage is that training can be slower than for MEMM's.\n\nYet another variant is the ''factorial hidden Markov model'', which allows for a single observation to be conditioned on the corresponding hidden variables of a set of <math>K</math> independent Markov chains, rather than a single Markov chain. It is equivalent to a single HMM, with <math>N^K</math> states (assuming there are <math>N</math> states for each chain), and therefore, learning in such a model is difficult: for a sequence of length <math>T</math>, a straightforward Viterbi algorithm has complexity <math>O(N^{2K} \\, T)</math>. To find an exact solution, a junction tree algorithm could be used, but it results in an <math>O(N^{K+1} \\, K \\, T)</math> complexity.

The room contains urns X1, X2, X3, ... each of which contains a known mix of balls, each ball labeled y1, y2, y3, ... .  The genie chooses an urn in that room and randomly draws a ball from that urn.  They then put the ball onto a conveyor belt, where the observer can observe the sequence of the balls but not the sequence of urns from which they were drawn. The genie has some procedure to choose urns; the choice of the urn for the ''n''-th ball depends only upon a random number and the choice of the urn for the (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)-th ball.  The choice of urn does not directly depend on the urns chosen before this single previous urn; therefore, this is called a [[Markov process]]. It can be described by the upper part of Figure 1.\n\nThe Markov process itself cannot be observed, only the sequence of labeled balls, thus this arrangement is called a \"hidden Markov process\". This is illustrated by the lower part of the diagram shown in Figure 1, where one can see that balls y1, y2, y3, y4 can be drawn at each state. Even if the observer knows the composition of the urns and has just observed a sequence of three balls, ''e.g.'' y1, y2 and y3 on the conveyor belt, the observer still cannot be ''sure'' which urn (''i.e.'', at which state) the genie has drawn the third ball from. However, the observer can work out other information, such as the likelihood that the third ball came from each of the urns.\n\n=== Weather guessing game ===\n{{HMM example}}\n\n''A similar example is further elaborated in the [[Viterbi algorithm#Example|Viterbi algorithm]] page.''\n\n== Structural architecture ==\nThe diagram below shows the general architecture of an instantiated HMM. Each oval shape represents a random variable that can adopt any of a number of values. The random variable ''x''(''t'') is the hidden state at time {{mvar|t}} (with the model from the above diagram, ''x''(''t'')&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;{&nbsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;}). The random variable ''y''(''t'') is the observation at time {{mvar|t}} (with ''y''(''t'')&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;{&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;}). The arrows in the diagram (often called a [[Trellis (graph)|trellis diagram]]) denote conditional dependencies.\n\nFrom the diagram, it is clear that the [[conditional probability distribution]] of the hidden variable ''x''(''t'') at time {{mvar|t}}, given the values of the hidden variable {{mvar|x}} at all times, depends ''only'' on the value of the hidden variable ''x''(''t''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1); the values at time ''t''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 and before have no influence. This is called the [[Markov property]]. Similarly, the value of the observed variable ''y''(''t'') only depends on the value of the hidden variable ''x''(''t'') (both at time {{mvar|t}}).\n\nIn the standard type of hidden Markov model considered here, the state space of the hidden variables is discrete, while the observations themselves can either be discrete (typically generated from a [[categorical distribution]]) or continuous (typically from a [[Gaussian distribution]]).  The parameters of a hidden Markov model are of two types, ''transition probabilities'' and ''emission probabilities'' (also known as ''output probabilities'').  The transition probabilities control the way the hidden state at time {{mvar|t}} is chosen given the hidden state at time <math>t-1</math>.\n\nThe hidden state space is assumed to consist of one of {{mvar|N}} possible values, modelled as a categorical distribution. (See the section below on extensions for other possibilities.) This means that for each of the {{mvar|N}} possible states that a hidden variable at time {{mvar|t}} can be in, there is a transition probability from this state to each of the {{mvar|N}} possible states of the hidden variable at time <math>t+1</math>, for a total of <math>N^2</math> transition probabilities. Note that the set of transition probabilities for transitions from any given state must sum to 1. Thus, the <math>N \\times N</math> matrix of transition probabilities is a [[Stochastic matrix|Markov matrix]]. Because any one transition probability can be determined once the others are known, there are a total of <math>N(N-1)</math> transition parameters.\n\nIn addition, for each of the {{mvar|N}} possible states, there is a set of emission probabilities governing the distribution of the observed variable at a particular time given the state of the hidden variable at that time.  The size of this set depends on the nature of the observed variable.  For example, if the observed variable is discrete with {{mvar|M}} possible values, governed by a [[categorical distribution]], there will be <math>M-1</math> separate parameters, for a total of <math>N(M-1)</math> emission parameters over all hidden states.  On the other hand, if the observed variable is an {{mvar|M}}-dimensional vector distributed according to an arbitrary [[multivariate Gaussian distribution]], there will be {{mvar|M}} parameters controlling the [[mean]]s and <math>\\frac {M(M+1)} 2</math> parameters controlling the [[covariance matrix]], for a total of <math>N \\left(M + \\frac{M(M+1)}{2}\\right) = \\frac {NM(M+3)} 2 = O(NM^2)</math> emission parameters. (In such a case, unless the value of {{mvar|M}} is small, it may be more practical to restrict the nature of the covariances between individual elements of the observation vector, e.g. by assuming that the elements are independent of each other, or less restrictively, are independent of all but a fixed number of adjacent elements.)\n\n[[File:hmm temporal bayesian net.svg|500px|center|Temporal evolution of a hidden Markov model]]\n\n== Inference ==\n[[File:HMMsequence.svg|thumb|400px|The state transition and output probabilities of an HMM are indicated by the line opacity in the upper part of the diagram. Given that we have observed the output sequence in the lower part of the diagram, we may be interested in the most likely sequence of states that could have produced it. Based on the arrows that are present in the diagram, the following state sequences are candidates:<br />\n5 3 2 5 3 2<br />\n4 3 2 5 3 2<br />\n3 1 2 5 3 2<br />\nWe can find the most likely sequence by evaluating the joint probability of both the state sequence and the observations for each case (simply by multiplying the probability values, which here correspond to the opacities of the arrows involved). In general, this type of problem (i.e. finding the most likely explanation for an observation sequence) can be solved efficiently using the [[Viterbi algorithm]].]]\n\nSeveral [[inference]] problems are associated with hidden Markov models, as outlined below.\n\n=== Probability of an observed sequence ===\nThe task is to compute in a best way, given the parameters of the model, the probability of a particular output sequence.  This requires summation over all possible state sequences:\n\nThe probability of observing a sequence\n: <math>Y=y(0), y(1),\\dots,y(L-1)\\,</math>\nof length ''L'' is given by\n:<math>P(Y)=\\sum_{X}P(Y\\mid X)P(X),\\,</math>\nwhere the sum runs over all possible hidden-node sequences\n: <math>X=x(0), x(1), \\dots, x(L-1).\\,</math>\n\nApplying the principle of [[dynamic programming]], this problem, too, can be handled efficiently using the [[forward algorithm]].\n\n=== Probability of the latent variables ===\nA number of related tasks ask about the probability of one or more of the latent variables, given the model's parameters and a sequence of observations <math>y(1),\\dots,y(t).</math>\n\n==== Filtering ====\nThe task is to compute, given the model's parameters and a sequence of observations, the distribution over hidden states of the last latent variable at the end of the sequence, i.e. to compute <math>P(x(t)\\ |\\ y(1),\\dots,y(t))</math>.  This task is normally used when the sequence of latent variables is thought of as the underlying states that a process moves through at a sequence of points of time, with corresponding observations at each point in time.  Then, it is natural to ask about the state of the process at the end.\n\nThis problem can be handled efficiently using the [[forward algorithm]].\n\n==== Smoothing ====\nThis is similar to filtering but asks about the distribution of a latent variable somewhere in the middle of a sequence, i.e. to compute <math>P(x(k)\\ |\\ y(1), \\dots, y(t))</math> for some <math>k < t</math>.  From the perspective described above, this can be thought of as the probability distribution over hidden states for a point in time ''k'' in the past, relative to time ''t''.\n\nThe [[forward-backward algorithm]] is a good method for computing the smoothed values for all hidden state variables.\n\n==== Most likely explanation ====\nThe task, unlike the previous two, asks about the [[joint probability]] of the ''entire'' sequence of hidden states that generated a particular sequence of observations (see illustration on the right).  This task is generally applicable when HMM's are applied to different sorts of problems from those for which the tasks of filtering and smoothing are applicable.  An example is [[part-of-speech tagging]], where the hidden states represent the underlying [[part of speech|parts of speech]] corresponding to an observed sequence of words.  In this case, what is of interest is the entire sequence of parts of speech, rather than simply the part of speech for a single word, as filtering or smoothing would compute.\n\nThis task requires finding a maximum over all possible state sequences, and can be solved efficiently by the [[Viterbi algorithm]].\n\n=== Statistical significance ===\nFor some of the above problems, it may also be interesting to ask about [[statistical significance]].  What is the probability that a sequence drawn from some [[null distribution]] will have an HMM probability (in the case of the forward algorithm) or a maximum state sequence probability (in the case of the Viterbi algorithm) at least as large as that of a particular output sequence?<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Newberg |first1=L. |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-10-212 |title=Error statistics of hidden Markov model and hidden Boltzmann model results |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=10 |pages=212 |year=2009 |pmid=19589158 |pmc=2722652}} {{open access}}</ref>  When an HMM is used to evaluate the relevance of a hypothesis for a particular output sequence, the statistical significance indicates the [[false positive rate]] associated with failing to reject the hypothesis for the output sequence.\n\n== Learning ==\n\nThe parameter learning task in HMMs is to find, given an output sequence or a set of such sequences, the best set of state transition and emission probabilities. The task is usually to derive the [[maximum likelihood]] estimate of the parameters of the HMM given the set of output sequences. No tractable algorithm is known for solving this problem exactly, but a local maximum likelihood can be derived efficiently using the [[Baum\u2013Welch algorithm]] or the Baldi\u2013Chauvin algorithm.  The [[Baum\u2013Welch algorithm]] is a special case of the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]. If the HMMs are used for time series prediction, more sophisticated Bayesian inference methods, like [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) sampling are proven to be favorable over finding a single maximum likelihood model both in terms of accuracy and stability.<ref>Sipos, I.

Since then, they have become ubiquitous in the field of [[bioinformatics]].<ref name=durbin>{{Durbin 1998}}</ref>\n\n== Extensions ==\nIn the hidden Markov models considered above, the state space of the hidden variables is discrete, while the observations themselves can either be discrete (typically generated from a [[categorical distribution]]) or continuous (typically from a [[Gaussian distribution]]). Hidden Markov models can also be generalized to allow continuous state spaces. Examples of such models are those where the Markov process over hidden variables is a [[linear dynamical system]], with a linear relationship among related variables and where all hidden and observed variables follow a [[Gaussian distribution]]. In simple cases, such as the linear dynamical system just mentioned, exact inference is tractable (in this case, using the [[Kalman filter]]); however, in general, exact inference in HMMs with continuous latent variables is infeasible, and approximate methods must be used, such as the [[extended Kalman filter]] or the [[particle filter]].\n\nHidden Markov models are [[generative model]]s, in which the [[joint distribution]] of observations and hidden states, or equivalently both the [[prior distribution]] of hidden states (the ''transition probabilities'') and [[conditional distribution]] of observations given states (the ''emission probabilities''), is modeled.  The above algorithms implicitly assume a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] prior distribution over the transition probabilities. However, it is also possible to create hidden Markov models with other types of prior distributions. An obvious candidate, given the categorical distribution of the transition probabilities, is the [[Dirichlet distribution]], which is the [[conjugate prior]] distribution of the categorical distribution.  Typically, a symmetric Dirichlet distribution is chosen, reflecting ignorance about which states are inherently more likely than others.  The single parameter of this distribution (termed the ''concentration parameter'') controls the relative density or sparseness of the resulting transition matrix.  A choice of 1 yields a uniform distribution.  Values greater than 1 produce a dense matrix, in which the transition probabilities between pairs of states are likely to be nearly equal.  Values less than 1 result in a sparse matrix in which, for each given source state, only a small number of destination states have non-negligible transition probabilities.  It is also possible to use a two-level prior Dirichlet distribution, in which one Dirichlet distribution (the upper distribution) governs the parameters of another Dirichlet distribution (the lower distribution), which in turn governs the transition probabilities.  The upper distribution governs the overall distribution of states, determining how likely each state is to occur; its concentration parameter determines the density or sparseness of states.  Such a two-level prior distribution, where both concentration parameters are set to produce sparse distributions, might be useful for example in [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] [[part-of-speech tagging]], where some parts of speech occur much more commonly than others; learning algorithms that assume a uniform prior distribution generally perform poorly on this task.  The parameters of models of this sort, with non-uniform prior distributions, can be learned using [[Gibbs sampling]] or extended versions of the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]].\n\nAn extension of the previously described hidden Markov models with [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet]] priors uses a [[Dirichlet process]] in place of a Dirichlet distribution.  This type of model allows for an unknown and potentially infinite number of states.  It is common to use a two-level Dirichlet process, similar to the previously described model with two levels of Dirichlet distributions.  Such a model is called a ''hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model'', or ''HDP-HMM'' for short. It was originally described under the name \"Infinite Hidden Markov Model\"{{ref|Beal, Matthew J., Zoubin Ghahramani, and Carl Edward Rasmussen. \"The infinite hidden Markov model.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 14 (2002): 577-584.}} and was further formalized in{{ref|Teh, Yee Whye, et al. \"Hierarchical dirichlet processes.\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 101.476 (2006).}}.\n\nA different type of extension uses a [[discriminative model]] in place of the [[generative model]] of standard HMMs.  This type of model directly models the conditional distribution of the hidden states given the observations, rather than modeling the joint distribution.  An example of this model is the so-called ''[[maximum entropy Markov model]]'' (MEMM), which models the conditional distribution of the states using [[logistic regression]] (also known as a \"[[Maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum entropy]] model\").  The advantage of this type of model is that arbitrary features (i.e. functions) of the observations can be modeled, allowing domain-specific knowledge of the problem at hand to be injected into the model.  Models of this sort are not limited to modeling direct dependencies between a hidden state and its associated observation; rather, features of nearby observations, of combinations of the associated observation and nearby observations, or in fact of arbitrary observations at any distance from a given hidden state can be included in the process used to determine the value of a hidden state.  Furthermore, there is no need for these features to be [[statistically independent]] of each other, as would be the case if such features were used in a generative model.  Finally, arbitrary features over pairs of adjacent hidden states can be used rather than simple transition probabilities.  The disadvantages of such models are: (1) The types of prior distributions that can be placed on hidden states are severely limited; (2) It is not possible to predict the probability of seeing an arbitrary observation.  This second limitation is often not an issue in practice, since many common usages of HMM's do not require such predictive probabilities.\n\nA variant of the previously described discriminative model is the linear-chain [[conditional random field]].  This uses an undirected graphical model (aka [[Markov random field]]) rather than the directed graphical models of MEMM's and similar models.  The advantage of this type of model is that it does not suffer from the so-called ''label bias'' problem of MEMM's, and thus may make more accurate predictions.  The disadvantage is that training can be slower than for MEMM's.\n\nYet another variant is the ''factorial hidden Markov model'', which allows for a single observation to be conditioned on the corresponding hidden variables of a set of <math>K</math> independent Markov chains, rather than a single Markov chain. It is equivalent to a single HMM, with <math>N^K</math> states (assuming there are <math>N</math> states for each chain), and therefore, learning in such a model is difficult: for a sequence of length <math>T</math>, a straightforward Viterbi algorithm has complexity <math>O(N^{2K} \\, T)</math>. To find an exact solution, a junction tree algorithm could be used, but it results in an <math>O(N^{K+1} \\, K \\, T)</math> complexity. In practice, approximate techniques, such as variational approaches, could be used.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ghahramani |first=Zoubin |authorlink1=Zoubin Ghahramani |last2=Jordan |first2=Michael I. |authorlink2=Michael I.

The disadvantage of such models is that dynamic-programming algorithms for training them have an <math>O(N^K \\, T)</math> running time, for <math>K</math> adjacent states and <math>T</math> total observations (i.e. a length-<math>T</math> Markov chain).\n\nAnother recent extension is the ''triplet Markov model'',<ref name=\"TMM\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1631-073X(02)02462-7 |volume=335 |issue=3 |title=Cha\u0131\u0302nes de Markov Triplet |year=2002 |journal=Comptes Rendus Math\u00e9matique |pages=275\u2013278 |last1=Pieczynski |first1=Wojciech}}</ref> in which an auxiliary underlying process is added to model some data specificities.

Nemo appears in two of Verne's science-fiction classics, ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1869) and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1875). He also makes a cameo appearance in a play on which Verne may have collaborated, ''[[Journey Through the Impossible]]'' (1882).\n\nNemo is a mysterious figure. Though originally of unknown nationality, he's later described as the son of an East Indian [[Maharaja|raja]]. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to Nemo's cover address. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of [[imperialism]]; the [[British Empire]] is ultimately revealed as his great antagonist. \n\nNemo has appeared in various film adaptations of Verne's novels, where he has been portrayed by such celebrated actors as [[James Mason]], [[Herbert Lom]], and [[Michael Caine]]. He has also been appropriated by other authors for their own works, including [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'',  [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''[[Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius]]'', and [[Thomas F. Monteleone]]'s ''The Secret Sea''.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n''Nemo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"no one\".\n\n''Nemo'' is, moreover, the Latin rendering of [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[Outis]]'' (\"Nobody\"), the pseudonym adopted by [[Odysseus]], in [[Greek mythology]]\u2014a ruse employed to outwit the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]. This appears to be the intended meaning, since in ''The Mysterious Island'', when addressed by Cyrus Harding as Captain Nemo, he replies, \"I have no name!\"\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:OrchhaPalace.jpg|thumb|[[Jahangir Mahal, Orchha|Jahangir Mahal]], home to the real-life rajas of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], Bundelkhand]]\n[[File:Nemo s death.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo's death in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'']]\nNothing concerning his past is revealed in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', except his dislike of imperialism (and of British imperial society more generally) and the apparent loss of his family in the past.\n\nIn ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu [[Maharaja|raja]] of [[Bundelkhand]], and a descendant of the Muslim [[Sultan]] [[Tipu Sultan|Fateh Ali Khan Tipu]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], famous for the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1767\u20131799) and [[Mysorean rockets|Mysorean rocket]] technology. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], in which Dakkar lost his family and his kingdom, he devoted himself to scientific research and developed the [[Nautilus (Verne)|''Nautilus'']], wherein he and a crew of followers cruise the seas. They gather [[bullion]] from various shipwrecks in the oceans, most notably the wrecks of the Spanish treasure fleet in [[Vigo|Bay of Vigo]], sunk during the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]]. He claims to have no interest in the affairs of the world above, but occasionally he intervenes to aid the oppressed, such as by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)]] against the island's [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] rulers and by saving (both physically and financially) a [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]] pearl hunter from a diving accident, or by saving the castaways from drowning in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' and covertly protecting another set of castaways in ''The Mysterious Island''.\n\nLike many actual [[Princely state|Indian princes]] of the era, Nemo had a European or English education, in which (he states) he spent his youth studying and touring Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, they speak to him in French, English, [[Latin]], and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these. Aronnax comments that Nemo's French was perfect, and relies on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]] to infer that he was from southern latitudes; but is unable to determine his origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library and art collection reveal Nemo to be familiar with European culture and arts. Further, he was an accomplished player of the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo is said to have died of old age, on board the ''Nautilus'', at Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Funeral rites were administered by [[Cyrus Harding]], one of the castaways protected by Nemo himself, and his vessel was then submerged in the waters of the grotto.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's character in the novels is largely seen through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, the narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', when Nemo is about forty years of age and described as a reticent man, tall and swarthy in appearance, with a straight nose and wide-set eyes. In ''The Mysterious Island'', the aged Captain Nemo sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him. In one scene, Nemo exclaims:\n\n{{quotation|On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror. But thirty feet below sea level, their dominion ceases, their influence fades, their power vanishes! Ah, sir, live! Live in the heart of the seas! Here alone lies independence! Here I recognize no superiors! Here I'm free!<ref>{{cite wikisource |last=Verne |first=Jules |translator=Frederick Paul Walter |title=20,000 Leagues Under the Seas |wslink=20,000 Leagues Under the Seas (Walter)/Chapter 10 |origyear=1870 |year=1991 |isbn=978-1-43844-663-9 |noicon=yes}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:20000 graveyard.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo standing over the crew of the ''Nautilus'' as they observe an underwater funeral]]\n\nNemo is devoted to his crew and grieves deeply when one is killed in the [[giant squid]] attack in the [[Caribbean Sea]], or after a midnight encounter with a surface ship. He shows the same compassion in his treatment of the castaways in ''The Mysterious Island'', and retains a strong attachment to his deceased wife and children. Though short-tempered, he rarely expresses his anger. He is also a man of immense courage, in the forefront of every activity, from releasing the ''Nautilus'' from the Antarctic ice to fighting squid in the Caribbean; and notable for having worked consecutive eight-hour shifts without a break, with little oxygen, to free the ''Nautilus'' from the ice. He was also identified as having discovered [[Atlantis]].\n\nAn extraordinary engineer, Nemo has designed and built the ''Nautilus'', besides inventing her electric propulsion and navigation systems. He has an exceptional mastery of underwater navigation, taking upon himself the most difficult submarine passages, such as those under the [[Suez|Isthmus of Suez]] and the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n[[File:20000 Nautilus Salon.jpg|upright|thumb|The Grand Salon of the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'']]\n\nHe has a comprehensive knowledge of [[marine biology]], and it is his respect for Professor Aronnax's expertise in the field which led to his befriending the professor when the latter was cast upon the ''Nautilus''. Further, he is said to have read and annotated all the books he possessed in the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} vast library.\n\nHe has very fine taste in art, possessing several masterpieces of both painting and sculpture, from ancient and modern European masters, all of which are housed in the Grand Salon of the ''Nautilus'', along with his collection of [[pearl]]s, [[coral]]s and other such marine products, which he had gathered himself. In the opinion of Professor Aronnax, the collection of the Grand Salon far outstrips that of the [[Louvre]].

Nemo appears in two of Verne's science-fiction classics, ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1869) and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1875). He also makes a cameo appearance in a play on which Verne may have collaborated, ''[[Journey Through the Impossible]]'' (1882).\n\nNemo is a mysterious figure. Though originally of unknown nationality, he's later described as the son of an East Indian [[Maharaja|raja]]. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to Nemo's cover address. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of [[imperialism]]; the [[British Empire]] is ultimately revealed as his great antagonist. \n\nNemo has appeared in various film adaptations of Verne's novels, where he has been portrayed by such celebrated actors as [[James Mason]], [[Herbert Lom]], and [[Michael Caine]]. He has also been appropriated by other authors for their own works, including [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'', [[Thomas F. Monteleone]]'s ''[[The Secret Sea]]'', and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''[[Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius]]''.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n''Nemo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"no one\".\n\n''Nemo'' is, moreover, the Latin rendering of [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[Outis]]'' (\"Nobody\"), the pseudonym adopted by [[Odysseus]], in [[Greek mythology]]\u2014a ruse employed to outwit the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]. This appears to be the intended meaning, since in ''The Mysterious Island'', when addressed by Cyrus Harding as Captain Nemo, he replies, \"I have no name!\"\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:OrchhaPalace.jpg|thumb|[[Jahangir Mahal, Orchha|Jahangir Mahal]], home to the real-life rajas of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], Bundelkhand]]\n[[File:Nemo s death.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo's death in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'']]\nNothing concerning his past is revealed in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', except his dislike of imperialism (and of British imperial society more generally) and the apparent loss of his family in the past.\n\nIn ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu [[Maharaja|raja]] of [[Bundelkhand]], and a descendant of the Muslim [[Sultan]] [[Tipu Sultan|Fateh Ali Khan Tipu]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], famous for the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1767\u20131799) and [[Mysorean rockets|Mysorean rocket]] technology. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], in which Dakkar lost his family and his kingdom, he devoted himself to scientific research and developed the [[Nautilus (Verne)|''Nautilus'']], wherein he and a crew of followers cruise the seas. They gather [[bullion]] from various shipwrecks in the oceans, most notably the wrecks of the Spanish treasure fleet in [[Vigo|Bay of Vigo]], sunk during the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]]. He claims to have no interest in the affairs of the world above, but occasionally he intervenes to aid the oppressed, such as by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)]] against the island's [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] rulers and by saving (both physically and financially) a [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]] pearl hunter from a diving accident, or by saving the castaways from drowning in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' and covertly protecting another set of castaways in ''The Mysterious Island''.\n\nLike many actual [[Princely state|Indian princes]] of the era, Nemo had a European or English education, in which (he states) he spent his youth studying and touring Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, they speak to him in French, English, [[Latin]], and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these. Aronnax comments that Nemo's French was perfect, and relies on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]] to infer that he was from southern latitudes; but is unable to determine his origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library and art collection reveal Nemo to be familiar with European culture and arts. Further, he was an accomplished player of the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo is said to have died of old age, on board the ''Nautilus'', at Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Funeral rites were administered by [[Cyrus Harding]], one of the castaways protected by Nemo himself, and his vessel was then submerged in the waters of the grotto.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's character in the novels is largely seen through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, the narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', when Nemo is about forty years of age and described as a reticent man, tall and swarthy in appearance, with a straight nose and wide-set eyes. In ''The Mysterious Island'', the aged Captain Nemo sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him. In one scene, Nemo exclaims:\n\n{{quotation|On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror.

He shows the same compassion in his treatment of the castaways in ''The Mysterious Island'', and retains a strong attachment to his deceased wife and children. Though short-tempered, he rarely expresses his anger. He is also a man of immense courage, in the forefront of every activity, from releasing the ''Nautilus'' from the Antarctic ice to fighting squid in the Caribbean; and notable for having worked consecutive eight-hour shifts without a break, with little oxygen, to free the ''Nautilus'' from the ice. He was also identified as having discovered [[Atlantis]].\n\nAn extraordinary engineer, Nemo has designed and built the ''Nautilus'', besides inventing her electric propulsion and navigation systems. He has an exceptional mastery of underwater navigation, taking upon himself the most difficult submarine passages, such as those under the [[Suez|Isthmus of Suez]] and the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n[[File:20000 Nautilus Salon.jpg|upright|thumb|The Grand Salon of the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'']]\n\nHe has a comprehensive knowledge of [[marine biology]], and it is his respect for Professor Aronnax's expertise in the field which led to his befriending the professor when the latter was cast upon the ''Nautilus''. Further, he is said to have read and annotated all the books he possessed in the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} vast library.\n\nHe has very fine taste in art, possessing several masterpieces of both painting and sculpture, from ancient and modern European masters, all of which are housed in the Grand Salon of the ''Nautilus'', along with his collection of [[pearl]]s, [[coral]]s and other such marine products, which he had gathered himself. In the opinion of Professor Aronnax, the collection of the Grand Salon far outstrips that of the [[Louvre]]. Despite the opulence visible all through the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', Nemo's cabin was furnished with little beside a bed and the navigational instruments integral to the ''Nautilus''. Captain Nemo is believed to be extremely affluent, in that while he never states exactly how much he is worth, he claims that 'without missing it, he could pay the national debt of France'.  At the time of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''{{'s}} publication, this was worth 4.6 billion francs, or $18.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2018.\n\nNemo tells Professor Aronnax that his intention was to have his autobiography sealed in an unsinkable casket and thrown overboard by the last survivor of the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} crew, in the hope that it would be washed up somewhere. Accordingly an unsinkable casket does wash up in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (wherein is revealed Nemo's background story), containing tools, guns, navigation instruments, an atlas, books, blank paper, and even clothing. The crate is lashed to empty barrels, and the contents sealed in a waterproof zinc envelope, showing careful preparation and packing.

Lowe (then a radio executive with The [[E. W. Scripps Company]] and, subsequently, the [[chief executive officer]] of Scripps Networks Interactive) envisioned the concept of HGTV in 1992, with modest financial support from the E.W. Scripps corporate board, he purchased Cinetel, a small video production company in Knoxville, as the base and production hub of the new network. Lowe cofounded the channel with [[Susan Packard]].<ref name=Mink>{{cite web|url=http://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/susan-packard-drove-home-hgtvs-culture-while-ratings-sprouted/|title=Susan Packard Drove Home HGTV\u2019s Culture While Ratings Sprouted|date=24 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2016/03/louisville-why-working-women-need-to-think-like.html|title=Susan Packard of HGTV and Scripps Networks Interactive shares advice at Business Women First event - Bizwomen|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nCinetel became Scripps Productions, but it found producing more than 30 programs simultaneously daunting. The organization brought in former [[CBS]] television executive Ed Spray, who implemented a system of producing (nearly all) programming through independent production houses around the United States. Burton Jablin, as Vice President of Programming, set the tone and oversaw the production of the early series. About 90 percent of the channel's programming consisted of original productions at launch, with ten percent licensed and rerun from Canadian channels, [[PBS]], and other sources.\n\nUsing local Scripps cable franchises (since divested), the [[Federal Communications Commission]] \"[[must carry]]\" provisions of Scripps medium-market television stations, and other small television operators to gain cable carriage, the channel launched on December 1, 1994. The major programming themes, unchanged since the beginning, were home building and remodeling, landscaping and gardening, decorating and design, and crafts and hobbies.\n\n[[Image:HGTV Logo.svg|thumb|175px|left|HGTV logo used from December 1, 1994 to March 1, 2010.]]\nDuring its development, the channel was originally named the '''Home, Lawn, and Garden Channel'''. The name was later shortened and a logo was developed. The logo was amended in 2010, with this version debuting on March 1 of that year. The square with the \"G\" in it was removed, the roof was increased in size and the \"HGTV\" letters are now set in [[Gotham (typeface)|Gotham Black]] (from the original mixture of [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] and [[Times New Roman]]), with the other Gotham fonts being used around the network. The network debuted with a skeletal staff, but with gradual acceptance by other cable operators, it now reaches 94 million households in the United States and has either partner networks, or network interests, in Canada, Japan, and elsewhere. It is now referred to simply as \"HGTV\"; the full name of the channel is de-emphasized.\n\nIn July 2008, the E.W. Scripps Company [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] the channel and the other Scripps cable channels and web-based properties into a separate company, [[Scripps Networks Interactive]]; E.W. Scripps broadcast television and newspaper properties remain as part of the original company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn December 2011, the channel began broadcasting all of its programming in [[16:9]] [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] format on its primary [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HGTV%20Goes%20HD,%20Makes%20Teranex%20Video%20Processors%20Its%20Standard.-a0144575823|title=HGTV Goes HD, Makes Teranex Video Processors Its Standard. - Free Online Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027055235/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HGTV%20Goes%20HD,%20Makes%20Teranex%20Video%20Processors%20Its%20Standard.-a0144575823|archive-date=27 October 2016|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> This results in the appearance of black bars on the top and bottom of the screen on 4:3 aspect ratio televisions; its [[high-definition television|high-definition]] channel displays the channel's programming in its native aspect ratio.\n\nOn March 6, 2018, [[Discovery Communications]] completed its merger with Scripps Networks Interactive and assumed control of HGTV, [[Food Network]] and [[Travel Channel]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Meg James |title=Discovery completes $12-billion takeover of Scripps Networks\u2019 Food, HGTV and Travel channels |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-discovery-scripps-merger-20180306-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Dade Hayes |title=Discovery Closes $14.6B Acquisition Of Scripps Networks Interactive |url=https://deadline.com/2018/03/discovery-closes-14-6b-acquisition-of-scripps-networks-interactive-1202312478/ |website=Deadline |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n{{category see also|HGTV original programming}}\n[[File:Peyton Lambton and Chris Lambton.jpg|thumb|right|At the February 23\u201325, 2018, Capital Remodel and Garden Show at the Dulles Expo Center, (l to r) Chris Lambton and Peyton Lambton]]\nHGTV's current programming focuses primarily on home-buying, renovation, and [[reality show]]s following the business of house [[flipping]].

Lowe (then a radio executive with The [[E. W. Scripps Company]] and, subsequently, the [[chief executive officer]] of Scripps Networks Interactive) envisioned the concept of HGTV in 1992, with modest financial support from the E.W. Scripps corporate board, he purchased Cinetel, a small video production company in Knoxville, as the base and production hub of the new network. Lowe cofounded the channel with [[Susan Packard]].<ref name=Mink>{{cite web|url=http://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/susan-packard-drove-home-hgtvs-culture-while-ratings-sprouted/|title=Susan Packard Drove Home HGTV\u2019s Culture While Ratings Sprouted|date=24 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2016/03/louisville-why-working-women-need-to-think-like.html|title=Susan Packard of HGTV and Scripps Networks Interactive shares advice at Business Women First event - Bizwomen|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nCinetel became Scripps Productions, but it found producing more than 30 programs simultaneously daunting. The organization brought in former [[CBS]] television executive Ed Spray, who implemented a system of producing (nearly all) programming through independent production houses around the United States. Burton Jablin, as Vice President of Programming, set the tone and oversaw the production of the early series. About 90 percent of the channel's programming consisted of original productions at launch, with ten percent licensed and rerun from Canadian channels, [[PBS]], and other sources.\n\nUsing local Scripps cable franchises (since divested), the [[Federal Communications Commission]] \"[[must carry]]\" provisions of Scripps medium-market television stations, and other small television operators to gain cable carriage, the channel launched on December 1, 1994. The major programming themes, unchanged since the beginning, were home building and remodeling, landscaping and gardening, decorating and design, and crafts and hobbies.\n\n[[Image:HGTV Logo.svg|thumb|175px|left|HGTV logo used from December 1, 1994 to March 1, 2010.]]\nDuring its development, the channel was originally named the '''Home, Lawn, and Garden Channel'''. The name was later shortened and a logo was developed. The logo was amended in 2010, with this version debuting on March 1 of that year. The square with the \"G\" in it was removed, the roof was increased in size and the \"HGTV\" letters are now set in [[Gotham (typeface)|Gotham Black]] (from the original mixture of [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] and [[Times New Roman]]), with the other Gotham fonts being used around the network. The network debuted with a skeletal staff, but with gradual acceptance by other cable operators, it now reaches 94 million households in the United States and has either partner networks, or network interests, in Canada, Japan, and elsewhere. It is now referred to simply as \"HGTV\"; the full name of the channel is de-emphasized.\n\nIn July 2008, the E.W. Scripps Company [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] the channel and the other Scripps cable channels and web-based properties into a separate company, [[Scripps Networks Interactive]]; E.W. Scripps broadcast television and newspaper properties remain as part of the original company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn December 2011, the channel began broadcasting all of its programming in [[16:9]] [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] format on its primary [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HGTV%20Goes%20HD,%20Makes%20Teranex%20Video%20Processors%20Its%20Standard.-a0144575823|title=HGTV Goes HD, Makes Teranex Video Processors Its Standard. - Free Online Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027055235/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HGTV%20Goes%20HD,%20Makes%20Teranex%20Video%20Processors%20Its%20Standard.-a0144575823|archive-date=27 October 2016|accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> This results in the appearance of black bars on the top and bottom of the screen on 4:3 aspect ratio televisions; its [[high-definition television|high-definition]] channel displays the channel's programming in its native aspect ratio.\n\nOn March 6, 2018, [[Discovery Communications]] completed its merger with Scripps Networks Interactive and assumed control of HGTV, [[Food Network]] and [[Travel Channel]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Meg James |title=Discovery completes $12-billion takeover of Scripps Networks\u2019 Food, HGTV and Travel channels |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-discovery-scripps-merger-20180306-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Dade Hayes |title=Discovery Closes $14.6B Acquisition Of Scripps Networks Interactive |url=https://deadline.com/2018/03/discovery-closes-14-6b-acquisition-of-scripps-networks-interactive-1202312478/ |website=Deadline |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n{{category see also|HGTV original programming}}\n[[File:Peyton Lambton and Chris Lambton.jpg|thumb|right|At the February 23\u201325, 2018, Capital Remodel and Garden Show at the Dulles Expo Center, (l to r) Chris Lambton and Peyton Lambton]]\nHGTV's current programming focuses primarily on home-buying, renovation, and [[reality show]]s following the business of house [[flipping]].
