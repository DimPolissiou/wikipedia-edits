{"title_page": "Richard Walter Thomas", "text_new": "{{short description|African American professor (b. 1939)}}\n{{other people||Richard Thomas (disambiguation)}}\n'''Richard Walter Thomas''' (born April 2, 1939) is a retired African-American professor of [[Michigan State University]] known for his work in black issues and race relations.  He has published a number of scholarly works, his poetry has been gathered in various anthologies, and he has given a variety of talks, workshops, and interviews on issues of race and race relations.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in his later youth Thomas was introduced to the early forms of [[black power]] movements and joined the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] in 1962. He met people like [[Margaret Danner]] and [[Ron Milner]]. Thomas then became a student at Michigan State University (MSU) in 1966. When he returned home that summer he experienced the [[1967 Detroit riot]], and after some campus activism and success publishing, in his junior year he attended the funeral of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and began an activism on race issues on and  beyond campus. In his senior year Thomas founded an assistance program for black students on campus, wrote for the campus newspaper and transitioned directly to a Master's Degree program. In 1970 Thomas graduated and joined the staff of the new Center for Urban Affairs on campus and his poetry was included in ''A galaxy of black writing''. Around the same time Thomas married South Carolinian June Manning. Before coming to MSU in 1968 she had been part of the reaction to the [[Orangeburg massacre]]. Both continued to hold various positions over the next few years and by 1976 they had two children and both began to pursue PhDs at the [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]] \u2013 he finished his in 1976 on black history of Detroit from 1915 to 1945 and she finished hers in 1977.\n\nReturning to MSU in 1979, Thomas started as an associate professor of racial and ethnic studies working in the department's new program in the study of [[human rights]]. It was the first campus program that would feature [[African-American history]] as well as examples from the wider world of race issues and the work being done to address them. That year he also co-wrote the book ''Blacks and Chicanos in Urban Michigan''. The Thomas' kept up service and visibility in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community such as being present for the 50th anniversary of [[Louhelen Bah\u00e1'\u00ed School]]. Thomas gave a 30 minute talk at the 9th Association of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Studies (ABS) conference in 1984 and would continue to contribute to ABS conferences and publications in succeeding years: a day-long seminar on inter-cultural issues, a convener and editor for invited papers on \"Models of racial unity\" and the Hasan M. Balyuzi Memorial Lectureship. He also contributed a chapter to a book ''Circle of Unity''. Thomas also began to make appearances at and gave assistance to initiatives on race justice and equality in communities such as in Chicago at an award-winning program.\n\nIn 1987 Thomas was named a professor at MSU and co-wrote ''Detroit: Race and Uneven Development'' via Temple University Press, a text that has been updated and printed by MSU Press. His contribution highlighted what Thomas began to think of as the \"The Other Tradition\" of black-white cooperation, [[anti-racism]]. That same year Thomas became a founding member of the Black Men's Gathering (BMG) to encourage the leadership of service of black men in the religion. In 1992 Thomas revised his PhD and published ''Life for Us is what We Make it: Building Black Community in Detroit, 1915\u20131945'' through Indiana University Press and the Thomas' were also noted attending the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World Congress]]. Now using the term \"The Other Tradition\", in 1993 Thomas wrote ''Racial Unity: An Imperative for Social Progress'' and ''Understanding interracial unity: a study of U.S. race relations''. 1996 was the beginning of the implementation of the Multi-Racial Unity Living Experience (MRULE) project at MSU he founded with one of his advanced degree students and was eventually the subject of several advanced degrees at several universities. In 1997 Thomas contributed a chapter to a book on how non-profit non-governmental organizations contributed to social justice in ''Social justice philanthropy '' reviewing the American Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community as one case. Since 1997 Thomas had often been elected annually to the Regional Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Council of the area \u2013 a mid-level institution with responsibilities over Bah\u00e1'\u00ed communities in several states. In 2002 Thomas wrote ''Bridging Racial Divides in Michigan's Urban Communities'' published through MSU Press and several decades of work culminated in the text ''Lights of the Spirit: Historical Portraits of Black Bah\u00e1'\u00eds in North America, 1898\u20132004'' with Thomas as a co-editor, wrote three chapters of it, and was published by the US Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Publishing Trust. In 2007 Thomas contributed to ''The State of black Michigan, 1967\u20132007 '' by MSU Press and his poetry was included in ''Black Fire: An Anthology of Afro-American Writing''.\n\nIn 2012 Thomas retired from MSU. In 2013 he wrote and co-wrote two texts \u2013 ''Disenfranchisement: Social Health Issues and Implications'' and ''Detroit: Race Riots, Racial Conflicts, and Efforts to Bridge the Racial Divide. and Communication''. Since 2015 he has made several appearances discussing \"The Other Tradition\" theme.\n\n==Biography==\n===Born and raised in Detroit===\nRichard Walter Thomas was born April 2, 1939, in Detroit, Michigan,<ref name=BLACKFIRE/><ref name=NINEBLACK/> son of Walter<ref name=PhD/> and Estelle<ref name=BGOTH>{{cite book |editor= Heather Cardin |author=Richard W.

As he says:<blockquote>I had got quite comfortable hanging out with Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds, ... (and) was seriously studying the Faith, but for me, a devout Baptist, a monumental religious barrier stood in the way: was [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]] really the return of the Spirit of Christ? ... It would have profound personal, family, social and church community consequences. And Mama Bruce was not budging. 'Boy!!' she exclaimed one day. 'Do you know what day you're living in!!?' She would not suffer vacillation, foolish or otherwise.\n\nI know exactly where I was and what I was doing when I decided to accept Bah\u00e1\u2019u'll\u00e1h as the return of the Spirit of Christ and the Prophet of God for this day: sitting at the dining room table in my parents' house reading ''Thief in the Night'' .... Then, thanks to [[William Sears (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed)|Mr. Bill Sears]]'s wonderful book, it struck me! These people, these good, God-intoxicated Christians in 1844 were looking in the wrong place! They were searching for the Second Coming in the clouds of their spiritual misunderstanding.... As much as I loved my mom, minister, friends, Sunday school teachers, and dearly loved listening and singing and swaying with the choir, I had to make a decision, scary as it was to make. I decided in that quiet night, while the household slept, that I was going to accept Bah\u00e1\u2019u'll\u00e1h as the return of the Christ Spirit, as the Prophet for this day and age.\n\nNaomi and Mama Bruce would leap with joy! But, Lord help me! What would Mom say when she heard I was not only leaving the church of my birth but joining a strange religion that placed a strange Prophet on the same level as precious Jesus, who rescued our slave forebears and softened our present sorrows and grief.... I now recall how I did not help matters much by being overly enthusiastic about my new Faith. I could have been far more diplomatic in my dealings with Mom and my former church community but I was young and excited and inspired by the stories of the B\u00e1b and the B\u00e1b\u00eds and their sacrifices of life and limb.... At the same time, it also inspired me more than I had ever been inspired by the years of listening to preaching, choir singing and Sunday school lessons. The more I read of the life of the [[B\u00e1b]], [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]] and [[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]], the more I wanted to tell the entire world, to hit the streets like the B\u00e1b\u00eds, proclaiming the good news to everyone who would listen, regardless of the risks.<ref name=BGOTH/></blockquote>\n\nBut this was a turbulent time for black Bah\u00e1'\u00eds and Thomas speaks of his own struggles:<blockquote>There were times when, like other young African-American Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, I found myself at odds with older Bah\u00e1'\u00eds views of the racial crisis. We younger African-Americans were greatly influenced by [[Malcolm X]] and the civil rights and [[Black Power movement]]s. We were the first generation of African-American Bah\u00e1'\u00eds to be shaped by these powerful social forces.... This tended to strain relationships within local Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed  communities between some older Black and White Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds, ... and younger Black 'radical' Bah\u00e1'\u00eds.... The latter's concerns were often interpreted by the former as a source of disunity. On the other hand, the younger Black Bah\u00e1'\u00eds felt that some of the older Bah\u00e1'\u00eds wanted to maintain the racial status quo within the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community.\n\nThanks to older, wiser and especially sensitive African-American Bah\u00e1'\u00eds such as Naomi, ... we were able to survive our frustrations and eventually come to terms with those Bah\u00e1'\u00eds who were not yet prepared to challenge the racial status quo, even as the racial conflicts of the 1960s exploded around them. In the process we learned a valuable lesson about the power of the Covenant to create unity in the midst of racial and cultural differences.\"<ref name=BGOTH/></blockquote>\n\nOut of this, Thomas says, \"For the first time in my angry bag, I was able to see what Black poets could do with an eye big as the earth.\"<ref name=BLACKFIRE/> In 1966 Marie Bruce had gone to Mississippi.<ref>{{cite news\n | title = United States Baha'i Directory, part 2, national departments and committees 1966-7, State goals committees;

Not intended to be comprehensive, the book still offers much useful detail on the antislavery movement, the organization of early civil rights groups such as the NAACP, and recent civil rights organizations and movements. Thomas not only discusses black efforts and demands but also includes sharp profiles of antiracist whites, among them, the Grimke sisters, the brilliant revolutionary John Brown, Civil War Republican Thaddeus Stevens, the NAACP's Joel Spingarn, and Topeka's Esther Brown. In a nation facing the possibility of great racial upheavals, a book showing whites and blacks cooperating in struggles against racism is welcome.

He has published a number of scholarly works, his poetry has been gathered in various anthologies, and he has given a variety of talks, workshops, and interviews on issues of race and race relations.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in his later youth Thomas was introduced to the early forms of [[black power]] movements and joined the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] in 1962. He met people like [[Margaret Danner]] and [[Ron Milner]]. Thomas then became a student at Michigan State University (MSU) in 1966. When he returned home that summer he experienced the [[1967 Detroit riot]], and after some campus activism and success publishing, in his junior year he attended the funeral of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and began an activism on race issues on and  beyond campus. In his senior year Thomas founded an assistance program for black students on campus, wrote for the campus newspaper and transitioned directly to a Master's Degree program. In 1970 Thomas graduated and joined the staff of the new Center for Urban Affairs on campus and his poetry was included in ''A galaxy of black writing''. Around the same time Thomas married South Carolinian June Manning. Before coming to MSU in 1968 she had been part of the reaction to the [[Orangeburg massacre]]. Both continued to hold various positions over the next few years and by 1976 they had two children and both began to pursue PhDs at the [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]] \u2013 he finished his in 1976 on black history of Detroit from 1915 to 1945 and she finished hers in 1977.\n\nReturning to MSU in 1979, Thomas started as an associate professor of racial and ethnic studies working in the department's new program in the study of [[human rights]]. It was the first campus program that would feature [[African-American history]] as well as examples from the wider world of race issues and the work being done to address them. That year he also co-wrote the book ''Blacks and Chicanos in Urban Michigan''. The Thomas' kept up service and visibility in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community such as being present for the 50th anniversary of [[Louhelen Bah\u00e1'\u00ed School]]. Thomas gave a 30 minute talk at the 9th Association of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Studies (ABS) conference in 1984 and would continue to contribute to ABS conferences and publications in succeeding years: a day-long seminar on inter-cultural issues, a convener and editor for invited papers on \"Models of racial unity\" and the Hasan M. Balyuzi Memorial Lectureship. He also contributed a chapter to a book ''Circle of Unity''. Thomas also began to make appearances at and gave assistance to initiatives on race justice and equality in communities such as in Chicago at an award-winning program.\n\nIn 1987 Thomas was named a professor at MSU and co-wrote ''Detroit: Race and Uneven Development'' via Temple University Press, a text that has been updated and printed by MSU Press. His contribution highlighted what Thomas began to think of as the \"The Other Tradition\" of black-white cooperation, [[anti-racism]]. That same year Thomas became a founding member of the Black Men's Gathering (BMG) to encourage the leadership of service of black men in the religion. In 1992 Thomas revised his PhD and published ''Life for Us is what We Make it: Building Black Community in Detroit, 1915\u20131945'' through Indiana University Press and the Thomas' were also noted attending the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World Congress]]. Now using the term \"The Other Tradition\", in 1993 Thomas wrote ''Racial Unity: An Imperative for Social Progress'' and ''Understanding interracial unity: a study of U.S. race relations''. 1996 was the beginning of the implementation of the Multi-Racial Unity Living Experience (MRULE) project at MSU he founded with one of his advanced degree students and was eventually the subject of several advanced degrees at several universities. In 1997 Thomas contributed a chapter to a book on how non-profit non-governmental organizations contributed to social justice in ''Social justice philanthropy '' reviewing the American Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community as one case. Since 1997 Thomas had often been elected annually to the Regional Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Council of the area \u2013 a mid-level institution with responsibilities over Bah\u00e1'\u00ed communities in several states. In 2002 Thomas wrote ''Bridging Racial Divides in Michigan's Urban Communities'' published through MSU Press and several decades of work culminated in the text ''Lights of the Spirit: Historical Portraits of Black Bah\u00e1'\u00eds in North America, 1898\u20132004'' with Thomas as a co-editor, wrote three chapters of it, and was published by the US Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Publishing Trust. In 2007 Thomas contributed to ''The State of black Michigan, 1967\u20132007 '' by MSU Press and his poetry was included in ''Black Fire: An Anthology of Afro-American Writing''.\n\nIn 2012 Thomas retired from MSU. In 2013 he wrote and co-wrote two texts \u2013 ''Disenfranchisement: Social Health Issues and Implications'' and ''Detroit: Race Riots, Racial Conflicts, and Efforts to Bridge the Racial Divide. and Communication''. Since 2015 he has made several appearances discussing \"The Other Tradition\" theme.\n\n==Biography==\n===Born and raised in Detroit===\nRichard Walter Thomas was born April 2, 1939, in Detroit, Michigan,<ref name=BLACKFIRE/><ref name=NINEBLACK/> son of Walter<ref name=PhD/> and Estelle<ref name=BGOTH>{{cite book |editor= Heather Cardin |author=Richard W.

As he says:<blockquote>I had got quite comfortable hanging out with Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds, ... (and) was seriously studying the Faith, but for me, a devout Baptist, a monumental religious barrier stood in the way: was [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]] really the return of the Spirit of Christ? ... It would have profound personal, family, social and church community consequences. And Mama Bruce was not budging. 'Boy!!' she exclaimed one day. 'Do you know what day you're living in!!?' She would not suffer vacillation, foolish or otherwise.\n\nI know exactly where I was and what I was doing when I decided to accept Bah\u00e1\u2019u'll\u00e1h as the return of the Spirit of Christ and the Prophet of God for this day: sitting at the dining room table in my parents' house reading ''Thief in the Night'' .... Then, thanks to [[William Sears (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed)|Mr. Bill Sears]]'s wonderful book, it struck me! These people, these good, God-intoxicated Christians in 1844 were looking in the wrong place! They were searching for the Second Coming in the clouds of their spiritual misunderstanding.... As much as I loved my mom, minister, friends, Sunday school teachers, and dearly loved listening and singing and swaying with the choir, I had to make a decision, scary as it was to make. I decided in that quiet night, while the household slept, that I was going to accept Bah\u00e1\u2019u'll\u00e1h as the return of the Christ Spirit, as the Prophet for this day and age.\n\nNaomi and Mama Bruce would leap with joy! But, Lord help me! What would Mom say when she heard I was not only leaving the church of my birth but joining a strange religion that placed a strange Prophet on the same level as precious Jesus, who rescued our slave forebears and softened our present sorrows and grief.... I now recall how I did not help matters much by being overly enthusiastic about my new Faith. I could have been far more diplomatic in my dealings with Mom and my former church community but I was young and excited and inspired by the stories of the B\u00e1b and the B\u00e1b\u00eds and their sacrifices of life and limb.... At the same time, it also inspired me more than I had ever been inspired by the years of listening to preaching, choir singing and Sunday school lessons. The more I read of the life of the [[B\u00e1b]], [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]] and [[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]], the more I wanted to tell the entire world, to hit the streets like the B\u00e1b\u00eds, proclaiming the good news to everyone who would listen, regardless of the risks.<ref name=BGOTH/></blockquote>\n\nBut this was a turbulent time for black Bah\u00e1'\u00eds and Thomas speaks of his own struggles:<blockquote>There were times when, like other young African-American Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, I found myself at odds with older Bah\u00e1'\u00eds views of the racial crisis. We younger African-Americans were greatly influenced by [[Malcolm X]] and the civil rights and [[Black Power movement]]s. We were the first generation of African-American Bah\u00e1'\u00eds to be shaped by these powerful social forces.... This tended to strain relationships within local Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed  communities between some older Black and White Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds, ... and younger Black 'radical' Bah\u00e1'\u00eds.... The latter's concerns were often interpreted by the former as a source of disunity. On the other hand, the younger Black Bah\u00e1'\u00eds felt that some of the older Bah\u00e1'\u00eds wanted to maintain the racial status quo within the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community.\n\nThanks to older, wiser and especially sensitive African-American Bah\u00e1'\u00eds such as Naomi, ... we were able to survive our frustrations and eventually come to terms with those Bah\u00e1'\u00eds who were not yet prepared to challenge the racial status quo, even as the racial conflicts of the 1960s exploded around them. In the process we learned a valuable lesson about the power of the Covenant to create unity in the midst of racial and cultural differences.\"<ref name=BGOTH/></blockquote>\n\nOut of this, Thomas says, \"For the first time in my angry bag, I was able to see what Black poets could do with an eye big as the earth.\"<ref name=BLACKFIRE/> In 1966 Marie Bruce had gone to Mississippi.<ref>{{cite news\n | title = United States Baha'i Directory, part 2, national departments and committees 1966-7, State goals committees;

Not intended to be comprehensive, the book still offers much useful detail on the antislavery movement, the organization of early civil rights groups such as the NAACP, and recent civil rights organizations and movements. Thomas not only discusses black efforts and demands but also includes sharp profiles of antiracist whites, among them, the Grimke sisters, the brilliant revolutionary John Brown, Civil War Republican Thaddeus Stevens, the NAACP's Joel Spingarn, and Topeka's Esther Brown. In a nation facing the possibility of great racial upheavals, a book showing whites and blacks cooperating in struggles against racism is welcome.

It is governed by the [[Croatian Water Polo Federation]].\n\nIt was the first Croatian national team in any sport to win at gold medal at the Olympic Games or World Games, the World Championships, and European Championships.\n\n==History==\nAfter [[Independence of Croatia|the independence of Croatia]] the national water polo team competed at its first tournament and also its first finals at [[Water polo at the 1993 Mediterranean Games|1993 Mediterranean Games]], followed by the 1993 European Championships where Croatia won 5th place.\n\nCroatia has since became Olympic champion ([[Water polo at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]]), double World champion ([[Water polo at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2007]], [[Water polo at the 2017 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2017]]) and European champion ([[2010 Men's European Water Polo Championship|2010]]). Croatia has also won eight other medals at the [[Water polo at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], [[Water polo at the World Aquatics Championships|World Championships]] and [[European Water Polo Championship|European Championships]] and was fourth on six occasions. The team holds a record streak of winning 6 medals in a row at World Championships and has reached semi-finals in over 60% of appearances at the Olympic Games, World Championships and European Championships altogether since 2017. Since the formation of national team Croatia has qualified for every big tournament. It is the first Croatian national team in any Olympic team sport that has won gold medals at all three big competitions. Croatia has also won [[FINA Water Polo World League|World League]] ([[2012 FINA Men's Water Polo World League|2012]]) and [[Water polo at the Mediterranean Games|Mediterranean Games]] ([[Water polo at the 2013 Mediterranean Games \u2013 Men's tournament|2013]]). The only competition Croatia has yet to win is [[FINA Water Polo World Cup|World Cup]] where the national team won silver medal in [[2010 FINA Men's Water Polo World Cup|2010]].\n\nThe team has been awarded with [[Franjo Bu\u010dar State Award for Sport]] in 1996. So far two [[International Swimming Hall of Fame]] inductees have been members of Croatia national team \u2013 [[Perica Buki\u0107]] as a player and [[Ratko Rudi\u0107]] as a coach.\n\n==Results==\n===Medals===\nUpdated after '''[[2019 World Aquatics Championships]]'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=30% style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Competition !!{{gold1}} !!{{silver2}} !!{{bronze3}} !!Total\n|-\n|align=left|[[Water polo at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]\n| 1 || 2|| 0 || 3\n|-\n|align=left|[[Water polo at the World Aquatics Championships|World Championship]]\n| 2 || 1 || 4 || 7\n|-\n|align=left|[[FINA Water Polo World Cup|World Cup]]\n| 0 || 1 || 1 || 2\n|-\n|align=left|[[FINA Water Polo World League|World League]]\n| 1 || 3 || 3 || 7\n|-\n|align=left|[[European Water Polo Championship|European Championship]]\n| 1 || 2 || 1 || 4\n|-\n|align=left|[[LEN Europa Cup|Europa Cup]]\n| 1 || 1 || 0 || 2\n|-\n|align=left|[[Water polo at the Mediterranean Games|Mediterranean Games]]\n| 1 || 1|| 1 || 3\n|-\n!

It is governed by the [[Croatian Water Polo Federation]].\n\nIt was the first Croatian national team in any sport to win at gold medal at the Olympic Games or World Games, the World Championships, and European Championships.\n\n==History==\nAfter [[Independence of Croatia|the independence of Croatia]] the national water polo team competed at its first tournament and also its first finals at [[Water polo at the 1993 Mediterranean Games|1993 Mediterranean Games]], followed by the 1993 European Championships where Croatia won 5th place.\n\nCroatia has since became Olympic champion ([[Water polo at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]]), double World champion ([[Water polo at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2007]], [[Water polo at the 2017 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2017]]) and European champion ([[2010 Men's European Water Polo Championship|2010]]). Croatia has also won eight other medals at the [[Water polo at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], [[Water polo at the World Aquatics Championships|World Championships]] and [[European Water Polo Championship|European Championships]] and was fourth on six occasions. The team holds a record streak of winning 6 medals in a row at World Championships and has reached semi-finals in over 60% of appearances at the Olympic Games, World Championships and European Championships altogether since 2017. Since the formation of national team Croatia has qualified for every big tournament. It is the first Croatian national team in any Olympic team sport that has won gold medals at all three big competitions. Croatia has also won [[FINA Water Polo World League|World League]] ([[2012 FINA Men's Water Polo World League|2012]]) and [[Water polo at the Mediterranean Games|Mediterranean Games]] ([[Water polo at the 2013 Mediterranean Games \u2013 Men's tournament|2013]]). The only competition Croatia has yet to win is [[FINA Water Polo World Cup|World Cup]] where the national team won silver medal in [[2010 FINA Men's Water Polo World Cup|2010]].\n\nThe team has been awarded with [[Franjo Bu\u010dar State Award for Sport]] in 1996. So far two [[International Swimming Hall of Fame]] inductees have been members of Croatia national team \u2013 [[Perica Buki\u0107]] as a player and [[Ratko Rudi\u0107]] as a coach.\n\n==Results==\n===Medals===\nUpdated after '''[[2019 World Aquatics Championships]]'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=30% style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Competition !!{{gold1}} !!{{silver2}} !!{{bronze3}} !!Total\n|-\n|align=left|[[Water polo at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]\n| 1 || 2|| 0 || 3\n|-\n|align=left|[[Water polo at the World Aquatics Championships|World Championship]]\n| 2 || 1 || 4 || 7\n|-\n|align=left|[[FINA Water Polo World Cup|World Cup]]\n| 0 || 1 || 1 || 2\n|-\n|align=left|[[FINA Water Polo World League|World League]]\n| 1 || 3 || 3 || 7\n|-\n|align=left|[[European Water Polo Championship|European Championship]]\n| 1 || 2 || 1 || 4\n|-\n|align=left|[[LEN Europa Cup|Europa Cup]]\n| 1 || 1 || 0 || 2\n|-\n|align=left|[[Water polo at the Mediterranean Games|Mediterranean Games]]\n| 1 || 1|| 1 || 3\n|-\n!

Being King Vahusha and Queen Shubra's only daughter, Uruvi was pampered right from her birth and given whatever she wished for. She shares a strong bond of friendship with [[Arjuna|Arjun]]. [[Karna|Karn]], on the other hand, though the son of [[Surya|Surya Dev]], is considered of low caste because he was disowned by [[Kunti]] at his birth and adopted by a family of low caste; thus living a life full of hardships. Arjun has been in love with Uruvi since childhood but Uruvi considers him nothing more than a best friend.\n\nUruvi's friends Jaya and Vijaya gave her a precious pink gem which she gifts to Arjun as a sign of good luck. During a tournament, Karn challenges Arjun for a duel. [[Drona|Guru Drona]] refuses to let Karn take part in the competition, calling him a person of low caste. [[Duryodhana]] thus crowns Karn as the king of [[Anga]]. During the duel, Uruvi gets impressed with Karna's talent and courage. Karna's arrow breaks the pink gem gifted to Arjun by Uruvi. She approaches Karn and asks him to repair it. Karn promises to get her a similar gem by the next full moon. Duryodhana marries [[Bhanumati (Mahabharata)|Bhanumati]] forcefully by kidnapping her. Bhanumati gives away her pink gem to Karn and he fulfills his promise to Uruvi. Uruvi and Karn slowly form a bond of mutual trust and respect.\n\nQueen Shubra dislikes Karn due to his caste despite knowing that he is Kunti's eldest son who she had to disown. She always tries to push Uruvi towards Arjun. Despite this, Uruvi develops feelings for Karn.\n\n[[Krishna]] makes Uruvi realise her love for Karn. Karn is a little hesitant at first but later accepts his feelings for Uruvi. When Shubra gets to know about Uruvi's love for Karn, she claims to never let the two unite. Karn confesses his love to Uruvi and the two marry each other. Uruvi is forced to leave her luxurious and comfortable lifestyle due to her marriage with Karn. Radha, Shubra and Purushottam make Uruvi and Karn's life miserable but they overcome all the problems and challenges.\n\nEnter Kasturi, who claims to be Karn's first wife. Her aim is to separate Uruvi from Karn and become the queen. She manages to create a lot of misunderstandings between them but is finally exposed and Karn and Uruvi are united once again.\n\nKarn chooses to support [[Duryodhana]] during the [[Mahabharata]] war.

[[Karna|Karn]], on the other hand, though the son of [[Surya|Surya Dev]], is considered of low caste because he was disowned by [[Kunti]] at his birth and adopted by a family of low caste; thus living a life full of hardships. Arjun has been in love with Uruvi since childhood but Uruvi considers him nothing more than a best friend.\n\nUruvi's friends Jaya and Vijaya gave her a precious pink gem which she gifts to Arjun as a sign of good luck. During a tournament, Karn challenges Arjun for a duel. [[Drona|Guru Drona]] refuses to let Karn take part in the competition, calling him a person of low caste. [[Duryodhana]] thus crowns Karn as the king of [[Anga]]. During the duel, Uruvi gets impressed with Karna's talent and courage. Karna's arrow breaks the pink gem gifted to Arjun by Uruvi. She approaches Karn and asks him to repair it. Karn promises to get her a similar gem by the next full moon. Duryodhana marries [[Bhanumati (Mahabharata)|Bhanumati]] forcefully by kidnapping her. Bhanumati gives away her pink gem to Karn and he fulfills his promise to Uruvi. Uruvi and Karn slowly form a bond of mutual trust and respect.\n\nQueen Shubra dislikes Karn due to his caste despite knowing that he is Kunti's eldest son who she had to disown. She always tries to push Uruvi towards Arjun. Despite this, Uruvi develops feelings for Karn.\n\n[[Krishna]] makes Uruvi realise her love for Karn. Karn is a little hesitant at first but later accepts his feelings for Uruvi. When Shubra gets to know about Uruvi's love for Karn, she claims to never let the two unite. Karn confesses his love to Uruvi and the two marry each other. Uruvi is forced to leave her luxurious and comfortable lifestyle due to her marriage with Karn. Radha, Shubra and Purushottam make Uruvi and Karn's life miserable but they overcome all the problems and challenges.\n\nEnter Kasturi, who claims to be Karn's first wife. Her aim is to separate Uruvi from Karn and become the queen. She manages to create a lot of misunderstandings between them but is finally exposed and Karn and Uruvi are united once again.\n\nKarn chooses to support [[Duryodhana]] during the [[Mahabharata]] war. Even after learning about the truth of his birth, he continues to support his friend and as a result has to donate his armour and earrings to [[Indra]].\n\nEventually Karn meets his end at the hands of [[Arjuna|Arjun]] during the war. Later he is again tested by [[Krishna]] on his death bed and Karn donates his golden teeth thereby succeeding and attaining salvation.\n\nAfter Karn's death, his son was tutored by [[Krishna]] who later became the king of [[Indraprastha]].

[[Bud Hurlbut]], who built and operated (as a concessionaire) the Mine Ride, Log Ride and other rides, decided that having static props wasn't enough, so he put on a gorilla suit and scared guests as they rode on the Mine Ride.  Halloween Haunt was an instant hit, and by the next year, the event sold out nightly.<ref>Merritt, Christopher, and Lynxwiler, J. Eric.

In 1981, actor and [[Parody|parodist]] [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] joined the cast, as did Cassandra \"[[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]]\" Peterson in the following year.<ref name=\"c1980\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatehaunt.com/history2/haunt101/course2.htm|title=COURSE 2: the 1980s |publisher=ultimatehaunt.com|accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref> Elvira was prominently featured in many Halloween Haunt events until 2001.

Rides and other attractions are converted into [[macabre]] themes. Seasonal workers are cast as a variety of monsters, roaming the {{convert|160|acre|km2|sing=on}} park in terrifying scare zones, amidst haze produced by giant [[fog machine]]s. Some characters have developed a special appeal, such as the legendary and infamous Sarah Rebecca Anne \"The Green Witch\" Morgan-Marshall. Back in 1973 Diana Kelly was chosen to don the role of the first Green Witch under the name of Spooky when Haunt began. After Diana left the Haunt she passed her role to Charlene Parker in 1982, and still to this day Parker is the longest serving of all the monsters who scare the guests at this event. The controversial \"Hanging\" live show is a staple of the Haunt that lampoons celebrities and persons in the news through a series of staged [[hanging]]s. The Hanging has been an annual event since the 1979 Halloween Haunt.\nAs of 2019, the park has 9 mazes, 4 scare zones, 4 experiences, and 4 live shows.\n\n==Commercials, media and awards==\nKnott's Scary Farm has won [[Amusement Today]]'s [[Golden Ticket Award]] for ''Best Halloween Event'' twice, in 2005 and 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goldenticketawards.com/all-time-winners-by-category/#20|title=All-time Winners By Category \u2013 The Golden Ticket Awards - Presented by Amusement Today|website=goldenticketawards.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Halloween Haunt (disambiguation)|Halloween Haunt]], Halloween events at other [[Cedar Fair]] parks\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n* [https://buckingtrends.me/2011/09/30/knott%e2%80%99s-%e2%80%9cscary%e2%80%9d-farm-2011-here%e2%80%99s-a-cheer-for-38-years-of-fears Knott's Scary Farm 2011: Here's A Cheer For 38 Years Of Fears, Leo Buck Buck-ing Trends November 30, 2011]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.Knotts.com/haunt2012 Official  '''Knott's Scary Farm''' website]\n* [http://www.ultimatehaunt.com/ Comprehensive tribute site]\n* [http://themeparkadventure.com/ Halloween Haunt reviews, photos, and video]\n\n{{Knott's Berry Farm rides}}\n{{Halloween events}}\n\n[[Category:Knott's Berry Farm]]\n[[Category:Halloween events]]\n[[Category:Haunted attractions (simulated)]]\n[[Category:Recurring events established in 1973]]\n[[Category:1973 establishments in California]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox recurring event\n| name         = Knott's Scary Farm\n| logo         = [[File:Knotts Halloween Haunt Logo.jpg|250px]]\n| logo_caption = \n| image        = \n| imagesize    = \n| caption      = \n| frequency    = Annual\n| location     = [[Knotts Berry Farm]]<br/>{{Coord|33.844178|-118.000267|type:landmark_region:US-CA|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| years_active = \n| first        = {{start date and age|1973}}\n| last         = \n| participants = \n| attendance   = \n| genre        = [[Halloween]]\n| budget       = \n| patron       = \n| people       = \n| member       = \n| website      = {{Official website|https://www.knotts.com/play/scary-farm}}\n| footnotes    = \n}}\n\n'''Knott's Scary Farm''' or '''Knott's Halloween Haunt''' is a seasonal [[Halloween]] event at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park, California]].

[[Bud Hurlbut]], who built and operated (as a concessionaire) the Mine Ride, Log Ride and other rides, decided that having static props wasn't enough, so he put on a gorilla suit and scared guests as they rode on the Mine Ride.  Halloween Haunt was an instant hit, and by the next year, the event sold out nightly.<ref>Merritt, Christopher, and Lynxwiler, J. Eric.

In 1981, actor and [[Parody|parodist]] [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] joined the cast, as did Cassandra \"[[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]]\" Peterson in the following year.<ref name=\"c1980\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatehaunt.com/history2/haunt101/course2.htm|title=COURSE 2: the 1980s |publisher=ultimatehaunt.com|accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref> Elvira was prominently featured in many Halloween Haunt events until 2001. According to postings on her [[Myspace]] page, Cassandra was released from her contract by the park's new owners due to their wanting a more family friendly appeal.<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/2macabre Cassandra Peterson's] MySpace page</ref> The 1990s would show a different approach to Halloween.

Rides and other attractions are converted into [[macabre]] themes. Seasonal workers are cast as a variety of monsters, roaming the {{convert|160|acre|km2|sing=on}} park in terrifying scare zones, amidst haze produced by giant [[fog machine]]s. Some characters have developed a special appeal, such as the legendary and infamous Sarah Rebecca Anne \"The Green Witch\" Morgan-Marshall. Back in 1973 Diana Kelly was chosen to don the role of the first Green Witch under the name of Spooky when Haunt began.

Gaudiya Vaishnavism was founded by the saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] who rapidly spread his form of ecstatic ''[[bhakti]]'' (devotion) throughout Bengal. He established Sankirtan, the practice of publicly expressing devotion to \nLord Krishna, the Supreme God, through dance and song. This form of communal worship responded to rigid caste structures by engaging all people in worship regardless of caste and creed. Chaitanya emphasized chanting the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna Mahamantra]] (the 'great mantra'). He is considered by Gaudiya Vaishnavas to be an incarnation of Krishna himself.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hare-krishna|title=Hare Krishna|website=ReligionFacts|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.patheos.com/library/iskcon-hare-krishna/origins/influences|title=Influences|website=www.patheos.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref>\n\nBhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada brought Chaitanya's Gaudiya Vaishnavism to the West in 1965. At 69 years old, he landed in New York without any money. Instead of preaching to New York's elite, he tapped into the 1960s countercultural spirit by preaching and chanting in public parks and attracting hippies and the youth. His movement, then known as the \"Hare Krishna Movement\", grew even larger when he relocated to San Francisco a year later.<ref name=\":1\" /> When it spread to England, it gained publicity and financial backing from the Beatle [[George Harrison]].

To devotees, [[Radha]] represents Krishna's divine female counterpart, the original spiritual potency, and the embodiment of divine love. The individual soul is an eternal personal identity which does not ultimately merge into a non-dual consciousness (Brahman) as believed by the [[monistic]] ([[Advaita]]) schools of Hinduism.

It's both a way to express devotion to God and a way to attract newcomers to the movement. Devotees gather in public, in streets and parks, to sing the mantra accompanied by instruments like the [[mridanga]], hand cymbals, and the harmonium. During the 1970s ISKCON entered the public eye because of this practice. Devotees would sing, distribute books, and proselytize in airports and other public areas, often obtrusively. Sankirtan continues throughout the world today, but in a less confrontational manner.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nOther important religious practice within ISKCON and Gaudiya Vaishnavism is [[japa]], or the meditative practice of repeatedly chanting the names of Krishna on a [[rosary]]. It's considered the only way for salvation for people in the current age. Prabhupada established a standard for initiated devotees to chant sixteen rounds of the Hare Krishna a day.<ref>H\u00fcsken, Ute, and Christiane Brosius, eds. ''Ritual matters: dynamic dimensions in practice''. Routledge, 2010.</ref> Each round requires chanting the ''mahamantra'' 108 times on prayer beads, with sixteen rounds being 1728 repetitions and taking around two hours.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=The Hare Krishna movement the postcharismatic fate of a religious transplant|last=Bryant, Edwin Francis. Ekstrand, Maria.|date=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|oclc=748865897}}</ref>\n\nAnother important practice in ISKCON is [[arati]] (also called [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]). In arati, devotees offer water, incense, a fire lamp, and flowers to a [[murti]], a sacred statue or image of Krishna. This is accompanied by prayers and devotional songs called [[bhajan]]s. Practitioners may perform ''aarti'' at their own home or congregate at a temple to join in the ceremony. Along with this worship, devotees will bathe the murti, dress it, offer it food, and even put it to sleep. By doing arati and serving the murti, devotees aim to deepen their relationship with Krishna.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.patheos.com/library/iskcon-hare-krishna/ritual-worship-devotion-symbolism/rites-and-ceremonies|title=Rites and Ceremonies|website=www.patheos.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-03}}</ref>\n\nDuring initiation ([[diksha]]) ISKCON devotees vow to follow four basic rules and regulations,<ref name=\":4\" /> They vow to follow [[lacto-vegetarian]] diet; not to consume any intoxicants (alcohol, cigarettes or drugs); not to gamble and not to engage in 'illicit sex'.<ref name=\":3\" />[[File:International Society of Krishna Consciousness Chariot Procession.gif|left|thumb|Hare Krishna [[Ratha-Yatra]] through the streets of Boston, Massachusetts.]]\nISKCON devotees meet regularly (typically on  Sunday at a program known as the Sunday Feast)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://back2godhead.com/sunday-feast/|title=The Hare Krishna Temple Sunday Feast|date=2019-10-31|website=Back to Godhead|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> to worship deities, listen to discourses by senior devotees, participate in kirtan and eat sanctified offered food.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nBesides weekly gatherings, devotees within the ISKCON movement celebrate a diverse array of Hindu festivals, including [[Krishna Janmashtami|Janmashtami]], [[Radhastami|Radhashtami]], [[Diwali]], [[Ekadashi|Ekadasi]], [[Holi]], [[Rama Navami|Ram-Navami]] and [[Gita Jayanti|Gita-Jayanti]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iskcon.org/arts/,%20https://www.iskcon.org/festivals/|title=Festivals \u00bb Home \u2013 ISKCON \u2013 The Hare Krishna Movement|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThe Ratha Yatra [[Festival of Chariots]] is an annual parade whereby devotees chant and dance on the street, pulling a chariot with the deities of Lord Jagannatha, Baladeva, and Subhadra behind them.

Gaudiya Vaishnavism was founded by the saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] who rapidly spread his form of ecstatic ''[[bhakti]]'' (devotion) throughout Bengal. He established Sankirtan, the practice of publicly expressing devotion to \nLord Krishna, the Supreme God, through dance and song. This form of communal worship responded to rigid caste structures by engaging all people in worship regardless of caste and creed. Chaitanya emphasized chanting the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna Mahamantra]] (the 'great mantra'). He is considered by Gaudiya Vaishnavas to be an incarnation of Krishna himself.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hare-krishna|title=Hare Krishna|website=ReligionFacts|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.patheos.com/library/iskcon-hare-krishna/origins/influences|title=Influences|website=www.patheos.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref>\n\nBhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada brought Chaitanya's Gaudiya Vaishnavism to the West in 1965. At 69 years old, he landed in New York without any money. Instead of preaching to New York's elite, he tapped into the 1960s countercultural spirit by preaching and chanting in public parks and attracting hippies and the youth. His movement, then known as the \"Hare Krishna Movement\", grew even larger when he relocated to San Francisco a year later.<ref name=\":1\" /> When it spread to England, it gained publicity and financial backing from the Beatle [[George Harrison]].

To devotees, [[Radha]] represents Krishna's divine female counterpart, the original spiritual potency, and the embodiment of divine love. The individual soul is an eternal personal identity which does not ultimately merge into a non-dual consciousness (Brahman) as believed by the [[monistic]] ([[Advaita]]) schools of Hinduism.

It's both a way to express devotion to God and a way to attract newcomers to the movement. Devotees gather in public, in streets and parks, to sing the mantra accompanied by instruments like the [[mridanga]], hand cymbals, and the harmonium. During the 1970s ISKCON entered the public eye because of this practice. Devotees would sing, distribute books, and proselytize in airports and other public areas, often obtrusively. Sankirtan continues throughout the world today, but in a less confrontational manner.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nOther important religious practice within ISKCON and Gaudiya Vaishnavism is [[japa]], or the meditative practice of repeatedly chanting the names of Krishna on a [[rosary]]. It's considered the only way for salvation for people in the current age. Prabhupada established a standard for initiated devotees to chant sixteen rounds of the Hare Krishna a day.<ref>H\u00fcsken, Ute, and Christiane Brosius, eds. ''Ritual matters: dynamic dimensions in practice''. Routledge, 2010.</ref> Each round requires chanting the ''mahamantra'' 108 times on prayer beads, with sixteen rounds being 1728 repetitions and taking around two hours.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=The Hare Krishna movement the postcharismatic fate of a religious transplant|last=Bryant, Edwin Francis. Ekstrand, Maria.|date=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|oclc=748865897}}</ref>\n\nAnother important practice in ISKCON is [[arati]] (also called [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]). In arati, devotees offer water, incense, a fire lamp, and flowers to a [[murti]], a sacred statue or image of Krishna. This is accompanied by prayers and devotional songs called [[bhajan]]s. Practitioners may perform ''aarti'' at their own home or congregate at a temple to join in the ceremony. Along with this worship, devotees will bathe the murti, dress it, offer it food, and even put it to sleep. By doing arati and serving the murti, devotees aim to deepen their relationship with Krishna.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.patheos.com/library/iskcon-hare-krishna/ritual-worship-devotion-symbolism/rites-and-ceremonies|title=Rites and Ceremonies|website=www.patheos.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-03}}</ref>\n\nDuring initiation ([[diksha]]) ISKCON devotees vow to follow four basic rules and regulations,<ref name=\":4\" /> They vow to follow [[lacto-vegetarian]] diet; not to consume any intoxicants (alcohol, cigarettes or drugs); not to gamble and not to engage in 'illicit sex'.<ref name=\":3\" />[[File:International Society of Krishna Consciousness Chariot Procession.gif|left|thumb|Hare Krishna [[Ratha-Yatra]] through the streets of Boston, Massachusetts.]]\nISKCON devotees meet regularly (typically on  Sunday at a program known as the Sunday Feast)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://back2godhead.com/sunday-feast/|title=The Hare Krishna Temple Sunday Feast|date=2019-10-31|website=Back to Godhead|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> to worship deities, listen to discourses by senior devotees, participate in kirtan and eat sanctified offered food.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nBesides weekly gatherings, devotees within the ISKCON movement celebrate a diverse array of Hindu festivals, including [[Krishna Janmashtami|Janmashtami]], [[Radhastami|Radhashtami]], [[Diwali]], [[Ekadashi|Ekadasi]], [[Holi]], [[Rama Navami|Ram-Navami]] and [[Gita Jayanti|Gita-Jayanti]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iskcon.org/arts/,%20https://www.iskcon.org/festivals/|title=Festivals \u00bb Home \u2013 ISKCON \u2013 The Hare Krishna Movement|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThe Ratha Yatra [[Festival of Chariots]] is an annual parade whereby devotees chant and dance on the street, pulling a chariot with the deities of Lord Jagannatha, Baladeva, and Subhadra behind them.
