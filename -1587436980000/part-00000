[[Dave Carnie]] is credited with coining the term as editor of the skateboard magazine ''[[Big Brother (magazine)|Big Brother]]'' in the 1990s to refer specifically to the sort of relationships that develop between skaters who spent a great deal of time together.<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"Elliott\"/> The term did not attain broad currency until approximately 2005<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/> when the theme became more prominent in the motion picture industry.<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"SanFilippo\"/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Final4 2016 Fenix-PSG 4922.jpg|thumb|upright=1 |Hug in France]]\n[[File: Baiser, Casablanca, 2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1 |Bromance in Maroc]]\n''Bromance'' has been examined from viewpoints such as [[historiography]], [[discourse analysis]], [[social research]], and [[queer theory]] in book-length reviews.<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"Yalof\"/> The emergence of ''bromance'' as a topic over the past decade has been seen as reflecting how society has collectively changed its perception and interest in the theme.<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"Elder\"/><ref name=\"Strudwick\"/><ref name=\"SanFilippo\"/><ref name=\"Yalof\"/>\n\nSeveral characteristics of bromance have been cited:\n* Bromance conveys a male [[homosocial]] relationship that goes much further than traditional homosocial practices.<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/> The increased closeness goes beyond being mere friends, to a deep bond that has been characterized as capturing the conceptual edge of \"is [[gay]] / is not gay\".<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"SanFilippo\"/>\n* Its emergence as a distinctive conceptual genre and theme in the movie and television industry is seen as reflective of a \"broader acceptance of non-[[heteronormative]] cultural expressions as well as the prospect of a same-sex intimacy that transcends matters of sexual orientation\".<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/>\n* Contemporary cultural circumstances, including the struggle for and attainment of [[gay marriage]] equality, and specific elements of the depiction of bromance in movies and television separate it from [[buddy film]]s, as well as historic [[romantic friendships]], which reflect a different [[social construction]].<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"Strudwick\"/><ref name=\"SanFilippo\"/><ref name=\"Yalof\"/><ref name=\"Deresiewicz\"/><ref name=\"Tenden\"/><ref name=\"Knight\"/>\n\nAccording to Chen, society has taken a collective interest in reexamination of some of the traditional constraints on male friendship, and in potentially reshaping the constructs of gender, sexuality, and intimacy.<ref name=\"Chen\"/> Bromance provides \"a case study of gender, sexuality, and exclusivity constraints in twenty-first century America as they operate in law and beyond. Those constraints in turn speak to the privilege and subordination imbued in this type of relationship, with implications for other types as well.\"<ref name=\"Chen\"/> This is distinct from the connotations of ''[[romantic friendship]]'', a term of 20th&nbsp;century historical scholarship that retrospectively described close [[homosocial]] relationships, which had become less common after potential physical intimacy between non-sexual partners came to be regarded with anxiety in the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name=\"Faderman\"/>\n\nOn the one hand, social interest in the theme has been seen as driving the film industry, which has then fed back to society at large, exploring peoples' mindsets and addressing acceptance of \"other types of relationships\" between people.<ref name=\"AlbertiQR\"/> On the other hand, some have seen the emphasis on [[platonic love]] as a rejection of [[homoeroticism]], or as a deliberate confounding of ''homosocial'' and ''homoerotic'' relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgilldaily.com/2013/01/our-romance-with-the-bromance/|title=Our romance with the \"bromance\" - The McGill Daily|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Bromance'' has also been seen as a reflection of greater \"discursive expressivity\".<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/> The experiences of friendship and masculinity, perhaps due to more open parenting styles from the 1970s, reflect a trend toward more openness emotionally, with increased expressivity.<ref name=\"Elder\"/><ref name=\"Yalof\"/><ref name=\"Alberti\"/><ref name=\"Jacey\"/> According to sociologist Peter Nardi, \"men are less afraid of being perceived as gay. It has become more acceptable for them to show some emotion.\"<ref name=\"Bindley\"/> Men are marrying later, if at all, which impacts [[male bonding]].<ref name=\"Bindley\"/><ref name=\"Badoo\"/> According to the 2010 US Census, the average age of a man's first marriage is 28, up from 23 in 1960; men with more education are waiting until their 30s before getting married.\n\n==Celebrity==\nA number of celebrity relationships have been popularly characterised as \"''bromances''\". Although ''bromance'' is a new term, this treatment of celebrity relationships is not new: The composer [[Franz Schubert]] had a very close friendship with poet [[Franz von Schober]], whose texts Schubert set to music.

[[Dave Carnie]] is credited with coining the term as editor of the skateboard magazine ''[[Big Brother (magazine)|Big Brother]]'' in the 1990s to refer specifically to the sort of relationships that develop between skaters who spent a great deal of time together.<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"Elliott\"/> The term did not attain broad currency until approximately 2005<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/> when the theme became more prominent in the motion picture industry.<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"SanFilippo\"/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Final4 2016 Fenix-PSG 4922.jpg|thumb|upright=1 |Hug in France]]\n[[File: Baiser, Casablanca, 2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1 |Bromance in Maroc]]\n''Bromance'' has been examined from viewpoints such as [[historiography]], [[discourse analysis]], [[social research]], and [[queer theory]] in book-length reviews.<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"Yalof\"/> The emergence of ''bromance'' as a topic over the past decade has been seen as reflecting how society has collectively changed its perception and interest in the theme.<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"Elder\"/><ref name=\"Strudwick\"/><ref name=\"SanFilippo\"/><ref name=\"Yalof\"/>\n\nSeveral characteristics of bromance have been cited:\n* Bromance conveys a male [[homosocial]] relationship that goes much further than traditional homosocial practices.<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/> The increased closeness goes beyond being mere friends, to a deep bond that has been characterized as capturing the conceptual edge of \"is [[gay]] / is not gay\".<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"SanFilippo\"/>\n* Its emergence as a distinctive conceptual genre and theme in the movie and television industry is seen as reflective of a \"broader acceptance of non-[[heteronormative]] cultural expressions as well as the prospect of a same-sex intimacy that transcends matters of sexual orientation\".<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/>\n* Contemporary cultural circumstances, including the struggle for and attainment of [[gay marriage]] equality, and specific elements of the depiction of bromance in movies and television separate it from [[buddy film]]s, as well as historic [[romantic friendships]], which reflect a different [[social construction]].<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/><ref name=\"Strudwick\"/><ref name=\"SanFilippo\"/><ref name=\"Yalof\"/><ref name=\"Deresiewicz\"/><ref name=\"Tenden\"/><ref name=\"Knight\"/>\n\nAccording to Chen, society has taken a collective interest in reexamination of some of the traditional constraints on male friendship, and in potentially reshaping the constructs of gender, sexuality, and intimacy.<ref name=\"Chen\"/> Bromance provides \"a case study of gender, sexuality, and exclusivity constraints in twenty-first century America as they operate in law and beyond. Those constraints in turn speak to the privilege and subordination imbued in this type of relationship, with implications for other types as well.\"<ref name=\"Chen\"/> This is distinct from the connotations of ''[[romantic friendship]]'', a term of 20th&nbsp;century historical scholarship that retrospectively described close [[homosocial]] relationships, which had become less common after potential physical intimacy between non-sexual partners came to be regarded with anxiety in the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name=\"Faderman\"/>\n\nOn the one hand, social interest in the theme has been seen as driving the film industry, which has then fed back to society at large, exploring peoples' mindsets and addressing acceptance of \"other types of relationships\" between people.<ref name=\"AlbertiQR\"/> On the other hand, some have seen the emphasis on [[platonic love]] as a rejection of [[homoeroticism]], or as a deliberate confounding of ''homosocial'' and ''homoerotic'' relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgilldaily.com/2013/01/our-romance-with-the-bromance/|title=Our romance with the \"bromance\" - The McGill Daily|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Bromance'' has also been seen as a reflection of greater \"discursive expressivity\".<ref name=\"DeAngelis\"/> The experiences of friendship and masculinity, perhaps due to more open parenting styles from the 1970s, reflect a trend toward more openness emotionally, with increased expressivity.<ref name=\"Elder\"/><ref name=\"Yalof\"/><ref name=\"Alberti\"/><ref name=\"Jacey\"/> According to sociologist Peter Nardi, \"men are less afraid of being perceived as gay. It has become more acceptable for them to show some emotion.\"<ref name=\"Bindley\"/> Men are marrying later, if at all, which impacts [[male bonding]].<ref name=\"Bindley\"/><ref name=\"Badoo\"/> According to the 2010 US Census, the average age of a man's first marriage is 28, up from 23 in 1960; men with more education are waiting until their 30s before getting married.\n\n==Celebrity==\nA number of celebrity relationships have been popularly characterised as \"''bromances''\". Although ''bromance'' is a new term, this treatment of celebrity relationships is not new: The composer [[Franz Schubert]] had a very close friendship with poet [[Franz von Schober]], whose texts Schubert set to music. They were nicknamed \"''Schobert''\" in early 19th&nbsp;century Vienna.\n\n===Film celebrities===\n[[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] as the 1946-1956 \u2018rock star\u2019 comedy team [[Martin and Lewis]] set a new standard for a complex, multifaceted enactment of a \u2018special\u2019 male friendship.\u201d Coming post-war, \u201cthe comedy of Martin and Lewis teased with a sly alternative to the model of heterosexual affirmation traditionally peddled by Hollywood, as their intense and unstable relationship showcased a panoply of emotional and erotic intensities between men. The cultural resonance of Martin and Lewis's comedy derived from the way it set in motion a more complex \u2018queering of gender.\u2019\u201d <ref>{{cite article|title=The Handsome Man and His Monkey|first=Frank|last=Krutnik|publisher=Journal of Popular Film & Television|date=Spring 1995}}Vol.23 Issue 1</ref> They starred in 16 films together as an inseparable unit, as well as on [[Golden Age of Television|early live television]] and in [[nightclubs]]. They had an immeasurable effect on millions of [[baby boomers]] and future comedians, (including George Clooney, whose aunt [[Rosemary Clooney]] was a guest on their show).\n\n[[Ben Affleck]] and [[Matt Damon]] were described as \"''perhaps '''the''' pioneering bromance in showbiz history''\",<ref name=\"Yaskua\"/> which led to an [[off-Broadway]] play called ''Matt and Ben''.<ref name=\"Casablanca\"/> The relationship between [[Zachary Quinto]] and [[Chris Pine]], stars of the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film, has been described similarly, in common with their on-screen characters' relationship.<ref name=\"Burr\"/>\n\nThe close friendship between [[George Clooney]] and [[Brad Pitt]] was once suggested to be \"''George's longest-lasting affair''\"<ref name=\"Synnot\">{{cite news | last = Synnot| first = Siobhan| title = I'm a loser in love, admits Hollywood star George Clooney| work = The Daily Record| date = 2008-10-18|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/2008/10/17/i-m-a-loser-in-love-admits-hollywood-star-george-clooney-86908-20811800/| accessdate = 2008-10-29}}</ref> and Clooney's bromantic tendencies served as the basis for an episode of the animated series ''[[American Dad!]]'' entitled \"[[Tears of a Clooney]]\", in which lead character [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] becomes bromantically involved with Clooney as part of an elaborate revenge plot.\n\n=== Athletes ===\nProfessional [[Association football|footballers]] [[Eric Dier]] and [[Dele Alli]], who play together for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[England national football team|England]], have a close relationship that has been described as a ''bromance''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hay|first1=Anthony|title=Tottenham stars Dele Alli and Eric Dier have hit it off both on and off the pitch - they are the Premier League's blossoming bromance|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3528764/Tottenham-stars-Dele-Alli-Eric-Dier-Premier-League-s-blossoming-bromance.html|website=Mail Online|accessdate=12 October 2016|date=8 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bristow|first1=Thomas|title=Dele Alli and Eric Dier's bromance reaches record new heights while playing the water bottle challenge|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/dele-alli-eric-diers-bromance-8989068|website=Mirror|accessdate=12 October 2016|date=6 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2016 Olympics|2016 Olympic]] 100m finals, the friendship between Jamaican [[Usain Bolt]] and Canadian [[Andre De Grasse]] emerged, characterized and celebrated on social media as a bromance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4456975/2016-rio-olympics-usain-bolt-de-grasse-smile/|title=Usain Bolt's Happy Face Blows Up Twitter Again|last=Calvo|first=Amanda|website=Time|access-date=2017-07-17}}</ref>\n\nBodybuilders [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Franco Columbu]], had a close relationship described by themselves as bromance, since 1965.

I seem to recall, I said some things to you...\nHouse: You talked a lot. I stopped listening after you confessed your fear of dolphins. Can we just tone down the bromance a few notches? My leg is killing me.\" ''note: Thus, indirectly addmiting he sacrificed his own stash of pain killeres in order to treat Wilson''. A minute later, House supports Wilson on his way to the bathroom, and they both groan, each out of his own pain: \"Wilson: I thought you said you had plenty of Vicodin?\nHouse: Everybody lies... Wilson: So, the way I felt... You feel that, what, Most of the time? Really does suck being you, doesn't it? House: At least I don't have cancer.\"</ref>\n\n[[Brody Jenner]], featured on MTV's reality show ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'' and the subject of bromance discussions for his relationships with castmates [[Justin Bobby]] and [[Spencer Pratt]], debuted his own series on the network, called ''[[Bromance (TV series)|Bromance]]'', on December 29, 2008.

There are also commercial transportation security units such as the [[Amtrak Police]] in the United States. Critical infrastructure is vital for the essential functioning of a country. Incidental or deliberate damage can have a serious impact on the economy and essential services. Some of the threats to infrastructure include:\n\n* [[Terrorism]]: person or groups deliberately targeting critical infrastructure for political gain. In the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]], the Mumbai central station and hospital were deliberately targeted, for example.\n* [[Sabotage]]: person or groups such as ex-employees, anti-government groups, environmental groups. Refer to [[People's Alliance for Democracy#Seizure of Suvarnabhumi International Airport|Bangkok's International Airport Seized by Protestors]].\n* [[Information warfare]]: private person hacking for private gain or countries initiating attacks to glean information and damage a country's cyber infrastructure. [[2007 cyberattacks on Estonia|Cyberattacks on Estonia]] and [[cyberattacks during the 2008 South Ossetia war]] are examples.\n* [[Natural disaster]]: hurricane or other natural events which damage critical infrastructure such as oil pipelines, water and power grids. See [[Hurricane Ike#Oil and gas spills|Hurricane Ike]] and [[Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina]] for examples.\n\n== Issues in national security ==\n\n=== Consistency of approach ===\nThe dimensions of national security outlined above are frequently in tension with one another. For example:\n* The high cost of maintaining large [[Military|military forces]] places a burden on the economic security of a nation. The share of government expenditure on state armed forces varies internationally; for example, in 2015 it was 4% in Germany, 9% in Chile, 14% in the USA, 15% in Israel, and 19% in Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.ZS|title=Military expenditure (% of central government expenditure, 2015)|last=World Bank|date=2017|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-18}}</ref> Conversely, economic constraints can limit the scale of expenditure on [[Military|military capabilities]].\n* Unilateral security action by states can undermine political security at an international level if it erodes the [[rule of law]] and undermines the authority of [[International organization|international institutions]].

For example, the rights and liberties of citizens are affected by the use of [[military personnel]] and [[Militarization of police|militarised police forces]] to control public behaviour; the use of [[surveillance]], including [[mass surveillance]] in [[cyberspace]], which has implications for [[privacy]]; [[military recruitment]] and [[conscription]] practices; and the effects of [[warfare]] on [[civilian]]s and [[civil infrastructure]]. This has led to a [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical]] struggle, particularly in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], between government [[authority]] and the rights and freedoms of the general public.\n[[File:National Security Agency, 2013.jpg|thumb|The [[National Security Agency]] harvests personal data across the internet.]]\nEven where the exercise of national security is subject to [[good governance]] and the [[rule of law]], a risk remains that the term ''national security'' may be become a [[pretext]] for suppressing [[political dissent|unfavorable political and social views]]. In the US, for example, the controversial [[USA Patriot Act]] of 2001, and the revelation by [[Edward Snowden]] in 2013 that the [[National Security Agency]] [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|harvests the personal data of the general public]], brought these issues to wide public attention. Among the questions raised are whether and how national security considerations at times of war should lead to the suppression of individual rights and freedoms, and whether such restrictions are necessary when a state is not at war.\n\n{{See also|Civil liberties|Human rights|Mass surveillance}}\n\n== Country-by-country perspectives ==\n=== Africa ===\nConceptualizing and understanding the National Security choices and challenges of African States is a difficult task. This is due to the fact that it is often not rooted in the understanding of their (mostly disrupted) state formation and their often imported process of state building.\n\nAlthough Post-Cold War conceptualizations of Security have broadened, the policies and practices of many African states still privilege national security as being synonymous with state security and even more narrowly- regime security.\n\nThe problem with the above is that a number of African states (be specific) have been unable to govern their security in meaningful ways. Often failing to be able to claim the monopoly of force in their territories.

There are also commercial transportation security units such as the [[Amtrak Police]] in the United States. Critical infrastructure is vital for the essential functioning of a country. Incidental or deliberate damage can have a serious impact on the economy and essential services. Some of the threats to infrastructure include:\n\n* [[Terrorism]]: person or groups deliberately targeting critical infrastructure for political gain. In the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]], the Mumbai central station and hospital were deliberately targeted, for example.\n* [[Sabotage]]: person or groups such as ex-employees, anti-government groups, environmental groups. Refer to [[People's Alliance for Democracy#Seizure of Suvarnabhumi International Airport|Bangkok's International Airport Seized by Protestors]].\n* [[Information warfare]]: private person hacking for private gain or countries initiating attacks to glean information and damage a country's cyber infrastructure. [[2007 cyberattacks on Estonia|Cyberattacks on Estonia]] and [[cyberattacks during the 2008 South Ossetia war]] are examples.\n* [[Natural disaster]]: hurricane or other natural events which damage critical infrastructure such as oil pipelines, water and power grids. See [[Hurricane Ike#Oil and gas spills|Hurricane Ike]] and [[Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina]] for examples.\n\n== Issues in national security ==\n\n=== Consistency of approach ===\nThe dimensions of national security outlined above are frequently in tension with one another. For example:\n* The high cost of maintaining large [[Military|military forces]] places a burden on the economic security of a nation. The share of government expenditure on state armed forces varies internationally; for example, in 2015 it was 4% in Germany, 9% in Chile, 14% in the USA, 15% in Israel, and 19% in Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.ZS|title=Military expenditure (% of central government expenditure, 2015)|last=World Bank|date=2017|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-18}}</ref> Conversely, economic constraints can limit the scale of expenditure on [[Military|military capabilities]].\n* Unilateral security action by states can undermine political security at an international level if it erodes the [[rule of law]] and undermines the authority of [[International organization|international institutions]].

Some argue that the principal beneficiary of national security policy should be the nation state itself, which should centre its strategy on protective and coercive capabilities in order to safeguard itself in a hostile environment (and potentially to project that power into its environment, and dominate it to the point of [[Full-spectrum dominance|strategic supremacy]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45289|title=Joint Vision 2020 Emphasizes Full-spectrum Dominance|last=US, Department of Defense|date=2000|website=archive.defense.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmdfence/512/51202.htm|title=Re-thinking defence to meet new threats|last=House of Commons Defence Committee|date=2015|website=publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/building-a-british-military-fit-for-future-challenges-rather-than-past-conflicts|title=Building a British military fit for future challenges rather than past conflicts|last=General Sir Nicholas Houghton|date=2015|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref> Others argue that security depends principally on building the conditions in which equitable relationships between nations can develop, partly by reducing antagonism between actors, ensuring that fundamental needs can be met, and also that differences of interest can be negotiated effectively.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcnl.org/updates/peace-through-shared-security-79|title=Peace Through Shared Security|last=FCNL|first=|date=2015|work=|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\"/> In the UK, for example, Malcolm Chalmers argued in 2015 that the heart of the UK's approach should be support for the Western strategic military alliance led through [[NATO]] by the United States, as \"the key anchor around which international order is maintained\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://rusi.org/publication/briefing-papers/force-order-strategic-underpinnings-next-nss-and-sdsr|title=A Force for Order: Strategic Underpinnings of the Next NSS and SDSR|last=Chalmers|first=M|date=2015-05-05|work=RUSI|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}</ref> The Ammerdown Group argued in 2016 that the UK should shift its primary focus to building international cooperation to tackle the systemic drivers of insecurity, including [[climate change]], [[economic inequality]], [[Militarization|militarisation]] and the political exclusion of the world's poorest people.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Impact on civil liberties and human rights ===\nApproaches to national security can have a complex impact on [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]]. For example, the rights and liberties of citizens are affected by the use of [[military personnel]] and [[Militarization of police|militarised police forces]] to control public behaviour; the use of [[surveillance]], including [[mass surveillance]] in [[cyberspace]], which has implications for [[privacy]]; [[military recruitment]] and [[conscription]] practices; and the effects of [[warfare]] on [[civilian]]s and [[civil infrastructure]]. This has led to a [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical]] struggle, particularly in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], between government [[authority]] and the rights and freedoms of the general public.\n[[File:National Security Agency, 2013.jpg|thumb|The [[National Security Agency]] harvests personal data across the internet.]]\nEven where the exercise of national security is subject to [[good governance]] and the [[rule of law]], a risk remains that the term ''national security'' may be become a [[pretext]] for suppressing [[political dissent|unfavorable political and social views]]. In the US, for example, the controversial [[USA Patriot Act]] of 2001, and the revelation by [[Edward Snowden]] in 2013 that the [[National Security Agency]] [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|harvests the personal data of the general public]], brought these issues to wide public attention. Among the questions raised are whether and how national security considerations at times of war should lead to the suppression of individual rights and freedoms, and whether such restrictions are necessary when a state is not at war.\n\n{{See also|Civil liberties|Human rights|Mass surveillance}}\n\n== Country-by-country perspectives ==\n=== Africa ===\nConceptualizing and understanding the National Security choices and challenges of African States is a difficult task. This is due to the fact that it is often not rooted in the understanding of their (mostly disrupted) state formation and their often imported process of state building.\n\nAlthough Post-Cold War conceptualizations of Security have broadened, the policies and practices of many African states still privilege national security as being synonymous with state security and even more narrowly- regime security.\n\nThe problem with the above is that a number of African states (be specific) have been unable to govern their security in meaningful ways. Often failing to be able to claim the monopoly of force in their territories. The hybridity of security \u2018governance\u2019 or \u2018providers\u2019 thus exists.<ref name=\"Luckham, R. 2012\">Luckham, R., & Kirk, T. (2012).
