It takes its name from the city of [[Buenos Aires]], the capital of the country, which used to be part of the province and the province's capital until it was [[Federalization of Buenos Aires|federalized]] in 1880. Since then, in spite of bearing the same name, the province does not include Buenos Aires proper, though it does include all other parts of the [[Greater Buenos Aires]] [[metropolitan area]]. The current capital of the province is the city of [[La Plata]], founded in 1882.\n\nThe province is the only one within all of Argentina to be divided into ''[[Partidos of Buenos Aires|partidos]]'' and further into ''localidades'' (the other provinces have ''[[Departments of Argentina|departamentos]]''). It borders the provinces of [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre R\u00edos]] to the northeast, [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] to the north, [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] to the northwest, [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]] to the west, and [[R\u00edo Negro Province|R\u00edo Negro]] to the south and west and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires to the northeast. [[Uruguay]] is just across the [[Rio de la Plata]] to the northeast, and both are on the coast of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east. The entire province is part of the [[Pampas]] geographical region.\n\nThe province has a population of about 15.6 million people, which is 39% of Argentina's total population. Nearly 10 million people live in Greater Buenos Aires. The province covers an area of {{convert|307571|km2|abbr=on}}, which is about 11% of Argentina's total area and makes it the country's largest province.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Juan Manuel de Rosas.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] (1841 oil portrait by [[Cayetano Descalzi]]) ruled until 1852 with an [[Totalitarianism|iron fist]] and kept the fragile [[Argentine Confederation|Confederation]] under the tutelage of Buenos Aires Province.]]\nThe inhabitants of the province before the 16th-century advent of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] were [[indigenous people|aboriginal peoples]] such as the [[Charr\u00faa]]s and the [[Querand\u00ed]]es. Their culture was lost over the next 350 years. They were subjected to Eurasian plagues from which few survived. The survivors joined other [[tribe]]s or have been mostly absorbed by Argentina's [[European ethnic groups|European]] ethnic majority.\n\n[[Pedro de Mendoza]] founded ''[[Buenos Aires|Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre]]'' in 1536. Even though the first contact with the aboriginals was peaceful, it soon became hostile. The city was evacuated in 1541. [[Juan de Garay]] re-founded the settlement in 1580 as ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad y Puerto Santa Mar\u00eda de Los Buenos Aires''.\n\nAmidst ongoing conflict with the aboriginals, the cattle farms extended from [[Buenos Aires]], whose port was always the center of the economy of the territory. Following the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] at the end of the 18th century, the export of meat, leather and their derivatives through the port of Buenos Aires was the basis of the economic development of the region.\n\n[[Jesuit]]s unsuccessfully tried to peacefully assimilate the aboriginals into the European culture brought by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] conquistadores. A certain balance was found at the end of the 18th century when the [[Salado River (Buenos Aires)|Salado River]] became the limit between both civilizations, despite frequent ''[[mal\u00f3n|malones]]'' (aboriginal attacks on border settlements). The end to this situation came in 1879 with the [[Conquest of the Desert]] (''Conquista del Desierto'') in which the aboriginals were almost completely exterminated.\n\nAfter the independence from [[Spain]] in 1816, the city and province of Buenos Aires became the focus of an intermittent [[Argentine Civil War]] with other provinces. A [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] secured by Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in 1831 led to the establishment of the [[Argentine Confederation]] and to his gaining the [[sum of public power]], which provided a tenuous unity. Ongoing disputes regarding the influence of Buenos Aires, between [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|Federalists]] and [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]], and over the [[Port of Buenos Aires]] (the prime source of public revenue at the time) fueled periodic hostilities. The province was declared independent on September 11, 1852, as the [[State of Buenos Aires]]. Concessions gained in 1859 [[Pact of San Jos\u00e9 de Flores]] and a victory at the [[Battle of Pav\u00f3n]] led to its reincorporation into the Argentine Republic on December 17, 1861. Intermittent conflicts with the nation did not truly cease until 1880, when the city of Buenos Aires was formally [[Federalization of Buenos Aires|federalized]] and, thus, administratively separated from the province.\n\n[[File:Fundaci\u00f3n La Plata.jpg|thumb|right|Period illustration of the 1882 placement of La Plata's [[foundation stone]].]]\n[[La Plata]] was founded in 1882 by Governor [[Dardo Rocha]] for the purpose of becoming the provincial capital. The equivalent of a billion (1880s) dollars of British investment and pro-development, education and immigration [[Generation of '80|policies]] pursued at the national level subsequently spurred dramatic economic growth. Driven by [[Immigration in Argentina|European immigration]] and improved health, the province's population, like Argentina's, nearly doubled to one million by 1895 and doubled again by 1914.<ref name=\"indec\">{{cite web |title=Poblaci\u00f3n seg\u00fan los censos nacionales de 1895 a 2001 por provincia ordenadas por la cantidad de poblaci\u00f3n en 2001 |url=http://www.indec.mecon.gov.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/2/pobl_1895-01.xls |format=ms xls |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Censos |language=Spanish |accessdate=2012-08-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213191403/http://www.indec.mecon.gov.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/2/pobl_1895-01.xls |archivedate=2012-02-13 }}</ref> [[Rail transport in Argentina|Rail lines]] connected nearly every town and hamlet in the province by 1914; many developed around the new railway stations.\n\nThis era of accelerated development was cut short by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], which caused a sharp drop in commodity prices (99% of Argentine exports were agricultural) and led to a halt in the flow of investment funds between nations. The new [[Concordancia (Argentina)|Concordance]] and [[Juan Per\u00f3n|Per\u00f3n]] governments funded ambitious lending and public works programs, visible in Buenos Aires Province through the panoply of levees, power plants, water works, paved roads, municipal buildings, and (particularly during Per\u00f3n's 1946-55 tenure) schools, clinics and massive regional hospitals.\n\nThe province's population, after 1930, began to grow disproportionately quickly in the suburban areas of Buenos Aires. These suburbs had grown to include 4 million out of the province's total 7 million people in 1960.<ref name=\"indec\" /> Much of the area these new suburbs were developed on (particularly the poorer ones) consisted of wetlands and were prone to flooding. To address this, Governor [[Oscar Alende]] initiated the province's most important flood-control project to date, the Roggero Reservoir. Completed a decade later, in 1971, the reservoir and associated electric and water-treatment facilities encouraged still more, and more orderly, development of the [[Greater Buenos Aires]] region, which today includes around 10 million people ({{frac|2|3}} of the provincial population). It did not address worsening pollution resulting from the area's industrial growth, which had made itself evident since around 1920. This problem has been at its worst along the [[Reconquista River]] west and north of the city of Buenos Aires; over 4 million people (one in 10 Argentines) today live on the Reconquista's basin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsam.edu.ar/home/rr.pdf |format=pdf |title=Title unknown |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912122242/http://www.unsam.edu.ar/home/rr.pdf |archivedate=September 12, 2008 }}</ref> Of these, about a million still live with seriously compromised water quality, despite the province's (sometimes counterproductive) efforts to remedy the issue.<ref>\n\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.argentina.indymedia.org/news/2007/07/535599.php \n |title=R\u00edo Reconquista, un basural acu\u00e1tico \n |publisher=Argentina Centro de Medios Independientes \n |date=24 July 2012 \n |language=Spanish \n |accessdate=2012-08-14 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218095101/http://www.argentina.indymedia.org/news/2007/07/535599.php \n |archivedate=2012-02-18 \n}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary history===\nIn [[2013 Argentina floods|April 2013]], the northeastern section of Buenos Aires Province, particularly its capital, La Plata, experienced several flash floods that claimed the lives of at least 59 people.\n\n[[Alejandro Armend\u00e1riz]], of the [[Radical Civic Union]], was elected governor in 1983, when [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] became president. Alfons\u00edn lost the 1987 midterm elections, leading to the victory of [[Antonio Cafiero]]. From that year to 2015, all governors have been Peronists. The high population of the province makes it highly influential in Argentine politics. With both ruling for two terms, the rivalry of the president [[Carlos Menem]] and governor [[Eduardo Duhalde]] dominated the Argentine politics during the nineties. A similar case took place with the president [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] and governor [[Daniel Scioli]]. [[Mar\u00eda Eugenia Vidal]], from [[Republican Proposal]], won the 2015 elections, and became the first female governor of the province.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1839835-vidal-dio-la-gran-sorpresa-y-le-gano-a-anibal-fernandez-en-la-provincia|title= Vidal dio la gran sorpresa y le gan\u00f3 a An\u00edbal Fern\u00e1ndez en la provincia|trans-title=Vidal gave a great surprise and defeated An\u00edbal Fern\u00e1ndez in the province|language= Spanish|author= Ramiro Sagasti|date= October 26, 2015|publisher= La Naci\u00f3n|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Casa de Gobierno de La Plata.jpg|thumb|Government House]]\n[[File:Legislatura Provincia de Buenos Aires-La Plata-2.jpg|thumb|[[Legislature of Buenos Aires Province|Legislature]]]]\n[[File:Juzgados Federales-La Plata-1.jpg|thumb|Federal courts]]\n[[File:Patrullero de la Polic\u00eda Bonaerense.jpg|thumb|[[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]]]]\n\nThe provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the [[Legislative branch|legislative]]; and the [[Law of Argentina|judiciary]], headed by the Supreme Court.\n{{main|Chamber of Deputies of Buenos Aires|Governor of the Buenos Aires Province}}\nThe Constitution of Buenos Aires Province forms the formal law of the province.\n\nIn Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the [[Argentine Federal Police]] but the additional work is carried out by the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]].\n\n==Geography==\nBuenos Aires Province, at {{convert|307571|km2}}, is slightly bigger than [[Italy]]. The landscape is mainly flat, with two low mountain ranges; ''[[Sierra de la Ventana (mountains)|Sierra de la Ventana]]'' (near [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]]) and ''Sierra de Tandil'' ([[Tandil]]). The highest point is ''Cerro Tres Picos'' ({{convert|1239|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|amsl]]; {{coord|38|8|S|61|58|W}}) and the longest river is ''[[Salado River (Buenos Aires)|R\u00edo Salado]]'' ({{convert|700|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long).\n\nAs part of [[Pampa|The Pampas]], the weather of the province is strongly influenced by the ocean, with hot summers and temperate winters. Humidity is high and precipitation is abundant and distributed over the year. The Western and Southwestern regions are drier.\n\nAdministratively, Buenos Aires Province is divided into 135 [[Departments of Buenos Aires Province|''partidos'']].\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n[[File:Casa y monta\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Sierra de la Ventana (mountains)|Sierra de la Ventana Mountain Range]]]]\n|valign=\"top\"|\n[[File:Mdp nevada-1991-2.jpg|thumb|210px|Snow on La Perla beach, [[Mar del Plata]] (1991)]]\n|valign=\"top\"|\n[[File:View of Al Este Bodega y Vinedos.jpg|thumb|210px|Al Este Bodega y Vi\u00f1edos in [[Medanos (appellation)|M\u00e9danos]], located on the southern tip of Buenos Aires Province {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away from Bah\u00eda Blanca.]]\n|valign=\"top\"|\n|}\n</div>\n\n===Climate===\n{{see also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina}}\n[[File:Laguna de Gomez.jpg|thumb|225px|Lake G\u00f3mez, in the north]]\n[[File:Balcarce-buenosaires.JPG|thumb|Rural area near Balcarce, in the south]]\nThe climate of the province of Buenos Aires is extremely benign for human activities: it is temperate, with four marked seasons and reliable rainfall on most regions. The province can be divided into four main climatic regions: the southwestern, drier region; the cool Atlantic region; the northern and eastern humid region, and the Delta region, with the warmest, wettest climate.\n\nThe northern region has warm, humid summers, with days between {{convert|28|and|32|C|F}} and nights between {{convert|16|and|20|C|F}}, pleasant falls, cool, drier winters with highs between {{convert|13|and|18|C|F}} and nights between {{convert|2|and|5|C|F}}, and windy, variable springs. Heat waves may bring days with temperatures over {{convert|38|C|F}}, but these do not usually last very long, as cold fronts bring thunderstorms and cooler days, with night temperatures often falling down to {{convert|12|C|F}}. Winter cold waves may bring days with highs about {{convert|8|C|F}}, and lows below {{convert|-4|C|F}}, with extremes down to {{convert|-8|C|F}}. Snow is uncommon, but there have been accumulations on several occasions in the past. Precipitation ranges from {{convert|750|to|1100|mm|abbr=on}} per year.\n\nThe Delta region is slightly warmer, especially at night, due to the presence of water and the northerly location. Summer nights tend to be stickier, and winters can be damp and foggy, with most nights between {{convert|4|and|8|C|F}}. Frost is still to be expected, but temperatures will almost never fall below {{convert|-4|C|F}}, and snow has fallen only twice in the last century. Precipitation ranges from {{convert|1000|to|1300|mm|abbr=on}} and falls throughout the year. The city of Buenos Aires is surrounded by a climate similar to the northern part of the province, but the city itself resembles more the Delta climate, with less frost.\n\nThe southwestern region is the driest region, and it experiences a more marked differences in temperatures. Summers are often hot, between {{convert|30|and|35|C|F}}, but nights are usually comfortable ({{convert|14|to|18|C|F}}). Thunderstorms are less frequent but can be very violent in nature. Frost can make an appearance as early as March, but usually first comes in April. Winters are cool and dry, with days between {{convert|10|and|16|C|F}} and nights between {{convert|-1|and|4|C|F}}. Frost occurs on an almost daily basis, with temperatures below {{convert|-6|C|F}} not uncommon, and down to {{convert|-12|C|F}} recorded in some areas. Snowfall may occur every once in a while, but accumulations are usually small. Total precipitation ranges from {{convert|500|to|750|mm|abbr=on}}, with slightly rainier springs and falls.\n\nThe Atlantic region sees very moderate weather: the ocean is cold ({{convert|17|to|20|C|F}} in the summer) and sea breezes often bring chilly weather until midsummer. The hottest months average {{convert|25|to|27|C|F}} with nights between {{convert|12|and|16|C|F}}, providing a perfect relief for the inhabitants of the hotter interior. Fall is often rainy, and winters can be windy and chilly: temperatures average from {{convert|10|to|15|C|F}}, and nights from {{convert|1|to|5|C|F}}. There can be long periods of drizzly weather and constant temperatures of about {{convert|7|C|F}}. Frost is common but temperatures will rarely fall below {{convert|-5|C|F}}, and snowfalls sometimes, but accumulations are only to be expected every few years. Precipitation ranges from {{convert|700|to|950|mm|abbr=on}}. The Sierras de la Ventana (up to {{convert|1200|m}}) experience cooler weather, especially at night.\n\nThe geography of the province is crossed by occasional west [[Pampero Winds|Pampero]] winds.

These also constitute the municipal division of the province. As of December 2009, there were 135 partidos. The last partido declared by law is [[Lezama Partido|Lezama]] (22/12/2009).\n{{main|Partidos of Buenos Aires}}\nThe provincial Constitution does not recognize the municipal autonomy that was recognized for the whole country in the reform of the [[Constitution of Argentina|National Constitution]] of 1994. Each partido corresponds to a [[municipality]] and is governed by a mayor elected by popular vote. The process of creating a partido is much more dynamic than in the other provinces, with a total of six more partidos in 2000 than in 1990. Most of the newer partidos were created in [[Greater Buenos Aires]].\n\n==Demographics==\nBuenos Aires Province is the most populated province of the country, with 15 million inhabitants (38% of the national population), of which 12 million live in [[Greater Buenos Aires]] and 3 million in the rest of the province.

It takes its name from the city of [[Buenos Aires]], the capital of the country, which used to be part of the province and the province's capital until it was [[Federalization of Buenos Aires|federalized]] in 1880. Since then, in spite of bearing the same name, the province does not include Buenos Aires proper, though it does include all other parts of the [[Greater Buenos Aires]] [[metropolitan area]]. The current capital of the province is the city of [[La Plata]], founded in 1882.\n\nThe province is the only one within all of Argentina to be divided into ''[[Partidos of Buenos Aires|partidos]]'' and further into ''localidades'' (the other provinces have ''[[Departments of Argentina|departamentos]]''). It borders the provinces of [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre R\u00edos]] to the northeast, [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] to the north, [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] to the northwest, [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]] to the west, and [[R\u00edo Negro Province|R\u00edo Negro]] to the south and west and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires to the northeast. [[Uruguay]] is just across the [[Rio de la Plata]] to the northeast, and both are on the coast of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east. The entire province is part of the [[Pampas]] geographical region.\n\nThe province has a population of about 15.6 million people, which is 39% of Argentina's total population. Nearly 10 million people live in Greater Buenos Aires. The province covers an area of {{convert|307571|km2|abbr=on}}, which is about 11% of Argentina's total area and makes it the country's largest province.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Juan Manuel de Rosas.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] (1841 oil portrait by [[Cayetano Descalzi]]) ruled until 1852 with an [[Totalitarianism|iron fist]] and kept the fragile [[Argentine Confederation|Confederation]] under the tutelage of Buenos Aires Province.]]\nThe inhabitants of the province before the 16th-century advent of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] were [[indigenous people|aboriginal peoples]] such as the [[Charr\u00faa]]s and the [[Querand\u00ed]]es. Their culture was lost over the next 350 years. They were subjected to Eurasian plagues from which few survived. The survivors joined other [[tribe]]s or have been mostly absorbed by Argentina's [[European ethnic groups|European]] ethnic majority.\n\n[[Pedro de Mendoza]] founded ''[[Buenos Aires|Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre]]'' in 1536. Even though the first contact with the aboriginals was peaceful, it soon became hostile. The city was evacuated in 1541. [[Juan de Garay]] re-founded the settlement in 1580 as ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad y Puerto Santa Mar\u00eda de Los Buenos Aires''.\n\nAmidst ongoing conflict with the aboriginals, the cattle farms extended from [[Buenos Aires]], whose port was always the center of the economy of the territory. Following the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] at the end of the 18th century, the export of meat, leather and their derivatives through the port of Buenos Aires was the basis of the economic development of the region.\n\n[[Jesuit]]s unsuccessfully tried to peacefully assimilate the aboriginals into the European culture brought by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] conquistadores. A certain balance was found at the end of the 18th century when the [[Salado River (Buenos Aires)|Salado River]] became the limit between both civilizations, despite frequent ''[[mal\u00f3n|malones]]'' (aboriginal attacks on border settlements). The end to this situation came in 1879 with the [[Conquest of the Desert]] (''Conquista del Desierto'') in which the aboriginals were almost completely exterminated.\n\nAfter the independence from [[Spain]] in 1816, the city and province of Buenos Aires became the focus of an intermittent [[Argentine Civil War]] with other provinces. A [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] secured by Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in 1831 led to the establishment of the [[Argentine Confederation]] and to his gaining the [[sum of public power]], which provided a tenuous unity. Ongoing disputes regarding the influence of Buenos Aires, between [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|Federalists]] and [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]], and over the [[Port of Buenos Aires]] (the prime source of public revenue at the time) fueled periodic hostilities. The province was declared independent on September 11, 1852, as the [[State of Buenos Aires]]. Concessions gained in 1859 [[Pact of San Jos\u00e9 de Flores]] and a victory at the [[Battle of Pav\u00f3n]] led to its reincorporation into the Argentine Republic on December 17, 1861. Intermittent conflicts with the nation did not truly cease until 1880, when the city of Buenos Aires was formally [[Federalization of Buenos Aires|federalized]] and, thus, administratively separated from the province.\n\n[[File:Fundaci\u00f3n La Plata.jpg|thumb|right|Period illustration of the 1882 placement of La Plata's [[foundation stone]].]]\n[[La Plata]] was founded in 1882 by Governor [[Dardo Rocha]] for the purpose of becoming the provincial capital. The equivalent of a billion (1880s) dollars of British investment and pro-development, education and immigration [[Generation of '80|policies]] pursued at the national level subsequently spurred dramatic economic growth. Driven by [[Immigration in Argentina|European immigration]] and improved health, the province's population, like Argentina's, nearly doubled to one million by 1895 and doubled again by 1914.<ref name=\"indec\">{{cite web |title=Poblaci\u00f3n seg\u00fan los censos nacionales de 1895 a 2001 por provincia ordenadas por la cantidad de poblaci\u00f3n en 2001 |url=http://www.indec.mecon.gov.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/2/pobl_1895-01.xls |format=ms xls |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Censos |language=Spanish |accessdate=2012-08-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213191403/http://www.indec.mecon.gov.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/2/pobl_1895-01.xls |archivedate=2012-02-13 }}</ref> [[Rail transport in Argentina|Rail lines]] connected nearly every town and hamlet in the province by 1914; many developed around the new railway stations.\n\nThis era of accelerated development was cut short by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], which caused a sharp drop in commodity prices (99% of Argentine exports were agricultural) and led to a halt in the flow of investment funds between nations. The new [[Concordancia (Argentina)|Concordance]] and [[Juan Per\u00f3n|Per\u00f3n]] governments funded ambitious lending and public works programs, visible in Buenos Aires Province through the panoply of levees, power plants, water works, paved roads, municipal buildings, and (particularly during Per\u00f3n's 1946-55 tenure) schools, clinics and massive regional hospitals.\n\nThe province's population, after 1930, began to grow disproportionately quickly in the suburban areas of Buenos Aires. These suburbs had grown to include 4 million out of the province's total 7 million people in 1960.<ref name=\"indec\" /> Much of the area these new suburbs were developed on (particularly the poorer ones) consisted of wetlands and were prone to flooding. To address this, Governor [[Oscar Alende]] initiated the province's most important flood-control project to date, the Roggero Reservoir. Completed a decade later, in 1971, the reservoir and associated electric and water-treatment facilities encouraged still more, and more orderly, development of the [[Greater Buenos Aires]] region, which today includes around 10 million people ({{frac|2|3}} of the provincial population). It did not address worsening pollution resulting from the area's industrial growth, which had made itself evident since around 1920. This problem has been at its worst along the [[Reconquista River]] west and north of the city of Buenos Aires; over 4 million people (one in 10 Argentines) today live on the Reconquista's basin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsam.edu.ar/home/rr.pdf |format=pdf |title=Title unknown |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912122242/http://www.unsam.edu.ar/home/rr.pdf |archivedate=September 12, 2008 }}</ref> Of these, about a million still live with seriously compromised water quality, despite the province's (sometimes counterproductive) efforts to remedy the issue.<ref>\n\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.argentina.indymedia.org/news/2007/07/535599.php \n |title=R\u00edo Reconquista, un basural acu\u00e1tico \n |publisher=Argentina Centro de Medios Independientes \n |date=24 July 2012 \n |language=Spanish \n |accessdate=2012-08-14 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218095101/http://www.argentina.indymedia.org/news/2007/07/535599.php \n |archivedate=2012-02-18 \n}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary history===\nIn [[2013 Argentina floods|April 2013]], the northeastern section of Buenos Aires Province, particularly its capital, La Plata, experienced several flash floods that claimed the lives of at least 59 people.\n\n[[Alejandro Armend\u00e1riz]], of the [[Radical Civic Union]], was elected governor in 1983, when [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] became president. Alfons\u00edn lost the 1987 midterm elections, leading to the victory of [[Antonio Cafiero]]. From that year to 2015, all governors have been Peronists. The high population of the province makes it highly influential in Argentine politics. With both ruling for two terms, the rivalry of the president [[Carlos Menem]] and governor [[Eduardo Duhalde]] dominated the Argentine politics during the nineties. A similar case took place with the president [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] and governor [[Daniel Scioli]]. [[Mar\u00eda Eugenia Vidal]], from [[Republican Proposal]], won the 2015 elections, and became the first female governor of the province.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1839835-vidal-dio-la-gran-sorpresa-y-le-gano-a-anibal-fernandez-en-la-provincia|title= Vidal dio la gran sorpresa y le gan\u00f3 a An\u00edbal Fern\u00e1ndez en la provincia|trans-title=Vidal gave a great surprise and defeated An\u00edbal Fern\u00e1ndez in the province|language= Spanish|author= Ramiro Sagasti|date= October 26, 2015|publisher= La Naci\u00f3n|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Casa de Gobierno de La Plata.jpg|thumb|Government House]]\n[[File:Legislatura Provincia de Buenos Aires-La Plata-2.jpg|thumb|[[Legislature of Buenos Aires Province|Legislature]]]]\n[[File:Juzgados Federales-La Plata-1.jpg|thumb|Federal courts]]\n[[File:Patrullero de la Polic\u00eda Bonaerense.jpg|thumb|[[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]]]]\n\nThe provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the [[Legislative branch|legislative]]; and the [[Law of Argentina|judiciary]], headed by the Supreme Court.\n{{main|Chamber of Deputies of Buenos Aires|Governor of the Buenos Aires Province}}\nThe Constitution of Buenos Aires Province forms the formal law of the province.\n\nIn Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the [[Argentine Federal Police]] but the additional work is carried out by the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]].\n\n==Geography==\nBuenos Aires Province, at {{convert|307571|km2}}, is slightly bigger than [[Italy]]. The landscape is mainly flat, with two low mountain ranges; ''[[Sierra de la Ventana (mountains)|Sierra de la Ventana]]'' (near [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]]) and ''Sierra de Tandil'' ([[Tandil]]). The highest point is ''Cerro Tres Picos'' ({{convert|1239|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|amsl]]; {{coord|38|8|S|61|58|W}}) and the longest river is ''[[Salado River (Buenos Aires)|R\u00edo Salado]]'' ({{convert|700|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long).\n\nAs part of [[Pampa|The Pampas]], the weather of the province is strongly influenced by the ocean, with hot summers and temperate winters. Humidity is high and precipitation is abundant and distributed over the year. The Western and Southwestern regions are drier.\n\nAdministratively, Buenos Aires Province is divided into 135 [[Departments of Buenos Aires Province|''partidos'']].\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n[[File:Casa y monta\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Sierra de la Ventana (mountains)|Sierra de la Ventana Mountain Range]]]]\n|valign=\"top\"|\n[[File:Mdp nevada-1991-2.jpg|thumb|210px|Snow on La Perla beach, [[Mar del Plata]] (1991)]]\n|valign=\"top\"|\n[[File:View of Al Este Bodega y Vinedos.jpg|thumb|210px|Al Este Bodega y Vi\u00f1edos in [[Medanos (appellation)|M\u00e9danos]], located on the southern tip of Buenos Aires Province {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away from Bah\u00eda Blanca.]]\n|valign=\"top\"|\n|}\n</div>\n\n===Climate===\n{{see also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina}}\n[[File:Laguna de Gomez.jpg|thumb|225px|Lake G\u00f3mez, in the north]]\n[[File:Balcarce-buenosaires.JPG|thumb|Rural area near Balcarce, in the south]]\nThe climate of the province of Buenos Aires is extremely benign for human activities: it is temperate, with four marked seasons and reliable rainfall on most regions. The province can be divided into four main climatic regions: the southwestern, drier region; the cool Atlantic region; the northern and eastern humid region, and the Delta region, with the warmest, wettest climate.\n\nThe northern region has warm, humid summers, with days between {{convert|28|and|32|C|F}} and nights between {{convert|16|and|20|C|F}}, pleasant falls, cool, drier winters with highs between {{convert|13|and|18|C|F}} and nights between {{convert|2|and|5|C|F}}, and windy, variable springs. Heat waves may bring days with temperatures over {{convert|38|C|F}}, but these do not usually last very long, as cold fronts bring thunderstorms and cooler days, with night temperatures often falling down to {{convert|12|C|F}}. Winter cold waves may bring days with highs about {{convert|8|C|F}}, and lows below {{convert|-4|C|F}}, with extremes down to {{convert|-8|C|F}}. Snow is uncommon, but there have been accumulations on several occasions in the past. Precipitation ranges from {{convert|750|to|1100|mm|abbr=on}} per year.\n\nThe Delta region is slightly warmer, especially at night, due to the presence of water and the northerly location. Summer nights tend to be stickier, and winters can be damp and foggy, with most nights between {{convert|4|and|8|C|F}}. Frost is still to be expected, but temperatures will almost never fall below {{convert|-4|C|F}}, and snow has fallen only twice in the last century. Precipitation ranges from {{convert|1000|to|1300|mm|abbr=on}} and falls throughout the year. The city of Buenos Aires is surrounded by a climate similar to the northern part of the province, but the city itself resembles more the Delta climate, with less frost.\n\nThe southwestern region is the driest region, and it experiences a more marked differences in temperatures. Summers are often hot, between {{convert|30|and|35|C|F}}, but nights are usually comfortable ({{convert|14|to|18|C|F}}). Thunderstorms are less frequent but can be very violent in nature. Frost can make an appearance as early as March, but usually first comes in April. Winters are cool and dry, with days between {{convert|10|and|16|C|F}} and nights between {{convert|-1|and|4|C|F}}. Frost occurs on an almost daily basis, with temperatures below {{convert|-6|C|F}} not uncommon, and down to {{convert|-12|C|F}} recorded in some areas. Snowfall may occur every once in a while, but accumulations are usually small. Total precipitation ranges from {{convert|500|to|750|mm|abbr=on}}, with slightly rainier springs and falls.\n\nThe Atlantic region sees very moderate weather: the ocean is cold ({{convert|17|to|20|C|F}} in the summer) and sea breezes often bring chilly weather until midsummer. The hottest months average {{convert|25|to|27|C|F}} with nights between {{convert|12|and|16|C|F}}, providing a perfect relief for the inhabitants of the hotter interior. Fall is often rainy, and winters can be windy and chilly: temperatures average from {{convert|10|to|15|C|F}}, and nights from {{convert|1|to|5|C|F}}. There can be long periods of drizzly weather and constant temperatures of about {{convert|7|C|F}}. Frost is common but temperatures will rarely fall below {{convert|-5|C|F}}, and snowfalls sometimes, but accumulations are only to be expected every few years. Precipitation ranges from {{convert|700|to|950|mm|abbr=on}}. The Sierras de la Ventana (up to {{convert|1200|m}}) experience cooler weather, especially at night.\n\nThe geography of the province is crossed by occasional west [[Pampero Winds|Pampero]] winds. The southern ''[[Sudestada]]'' produces storms and temperature drops, most notably the ''Santa Rosa'' storm,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monte.gov.ar/planificacion/informacionutil1/climatolofia/santarosa.htm |title=Title unknown |publisher=monte.gov.ar |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226131555/http://www.monte.gov.ar/planificacion/informacionutil1/climatolofia/santarosa.htm |archivedate=December 26, 2005 }}</ref> which takes place every year almost exactly on August 30.\n\n==Administrative division==\n[[File:Buenos_aires_province_numbered.png|thumb|left|Partidos of Buenos Aires]]\nUnlike the other provinces of the country, in the province of Buenos Aires, the territorial divisions are called ''[[partidos]]'' instead of departments. These also constitute the municipal division of the province. As of December 2009, there were 135 partidos. The last partido declared by law is [[Lezama Partido|Lezama]] (22/12/2009).\n{{main|Partidos of Buenos Aires}}\nThe provincial Constitution does not recognize the municipal autonomy that was recognized for the whole country in the reform of the [[Constitution of Argentina|National Constitution]] of 1994. Each partido corresponds to a [[municipality]] and is governed by a mayor elected by popular vote. The process of creating a partido is much more dynamic than in the other provinces, with a total of six more partidos in 2000 than in 1990. Most of the newer partidos were created in [[Greater Buenos Aires]].\n\n==Demographics==\nBuenos Aires Province is the most populated province of the country, with 15 million inhabitants (38% of the national population), of which 12 million live in [[Greater Buenos Aires]] and 3 million in the rest of the province. Around 33.8% of the inhabitants weren't born in the province, of whom 3,918,552 are immigrants from other provinces and 758,640 were born abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gba.gov.ar/estadistica/ftp/Bs.As2001-2005/cuadros/DEMOGRAFIA/Migraciones%201.xls |title=Title unknown |format=ms xls |language= |accessdate= }}{{dead link|date=April 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CDCDCD\" | Evolution of population\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#D5D5D5\"\n!
