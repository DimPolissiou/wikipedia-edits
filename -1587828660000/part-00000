Diana, who is in fact an ancient [[Hamadryad]], kidnaps their infant daughter, taking her to a forest where she approaches a giant, gnarled tree, serving the child as a [[human sacrifice]] to sustain the tree's life. Diana's reflection as she stares into a pool of water transforms to that of a growling wolf.\n\nThree months later, Phil and Kate Sterling have recently relocated from [[Chicago]] to [[Los Angeles]], where Phil has taken a lucrative advertising job. Kate becomes pregnant, and gives birth to a son, Jake. The couple decide to hire a nanny to allow each of them to maintain their jobs, and interview two clients through a nanny agency: a young woman named Arlene, and a caring [[English people|English]] woman, Camilla. When Arlene dies in a bicycling accident, Camilla is swiftly hired and becomes an invaluable member of the Sterlings' household.\n\nOne afternoon while Camilla rests in a meadow with Jake, she is approached by three aggressive [[Motorcycling|bikers]] who attempt to sexually assault her. She flees to the base of the gnarled tree, which subsequently comes to life, its branches strangling and eviscerating the men. Wolves consume one of their entrails, and another spontaneously combusts. During a dinner party some days later, Ned, the Sterlings' neighbor who designed their home, invites Camilla on a date, which she declines. That night, Phil has a nightmare in which he has sex with Camilla. The next day, moments after Camilla leaves to go shopping, Ned stops by the house with a bouquet of flowers for her. Kate explains she just left on foot, and Ned drives after her, catching sight of her fleeing into the forest. Ned pursues her, eventually coming across her bathing in the creek. He watches as Camilla approaches the large tree, and begins to fuse with the tree bark. A pack of wolves pursue Ned, who flees back to his house. He leaves a rambling phone message for Phil and Kate. Moments later, Camilla appears, naked and ashen, on the hearth, before the wolves break into the home, eating him alive. Camilla drags his remains away.\n\nWhen checking the answering machine the following morning, Phil finds two messages: One from a stranger, Molly Sheridan, who says it is urgent she speak with him. The next is Ned's, which is incoherent, but Camilla interrupts him from finishing listening to it. Phil meets with Molly the next day. She describes the disappearance of her infant daughter, as well as the nanny Diana, whom she came to discover was a false identity. She requests that Phil arrange for her to see Camilla, suspecting they are the same person. When Phil returns home, he listens to Ned's message in full, which warns him against letting Camilla back in the house. Discovering Ned is missing, Phil confronts Camilla in front of Kate, but Jake grows violently ill during the confrontation and has to be rushed to the hospital, exhibiting [[coma]]-like symptoms.\n\nJake regains consciousness in the hospital, and Camilla attempts to kidnap him, but Phil intercepts, throwing Camilla to the ground. Phil and Kate depart with Jake, and upon arriving home are confronted by a pack of wolves. Kate flees to the couple's [[Jeep]], while Phil runs toward the woods with Jake, as Camilla pursues them both, [[levitation|levitating]] through the forest, until they reach the large tree. Kate chases after them in the Jeep, eventually hitting and killing Camilla. As Phil examines Camilla's body, he notices faces of babies embossed in the tree bark.\n\nLater, a detective tells the couple no evidence of Camilla's existence can be found. Phil decides to cut down the tree with a chainsaw, but in his absence, Kate is attacked by Camilla\u2014now part-tree, part-human\u2014who has again infiltrated the house. As Phil attempts to cut the tree, the branches entangle him and begin to bleed as he inflicts damage on them. The damage concurrently impacts Camilla, who is fighting Kate. When Phil saws off a large branch, Camilla's leg severs from her body, allowing Kate to push her out a window. Simultaneously, Phil manages to fell the tree, but it combusts before landing, as Camilla's body similarly disintegrates before hitting the ground.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Jenny Seagrove]] as Camilla Grandier / Diana Julian\n*[[Dwier Brown]] as Phil Sterling\n*[[Carey Lowell]] as Kate Sterling\n*[[Brad Hall]] as Ned Runcie\n*[[Miguel Ferrer]] as Ralph Hess\n*[[Natalia Nogulich]] as Molly Sheridan\n*[[Pamela Brull]] as Gail Krasno\n*[[Gary Swanson]] as Allan Sheridan\n*Jack David Walker as [[Punk subculture|Punk]] #1\n*[[Willy Parsons]] as Punk #2\n*[[Frank Noon]] as Punk #3\n*[[Theresa Randle]] as Arlene Russell\n*[[Xander Berkeley]] as Detective\n*Ray Reinhardt as Dr. Klein\n*Jacob Gelman as Scotty Sheridan\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\n''The Guardian'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Santa Clarita, California]].<ref name=\"effects\">{{cite AV media\n | people =Mungle, Matthew\n | date =\n | year =2015\n | title = Tree Woman: The Effects Of The Guardian - An Interview With Makeup Effects Artist Matthew Mungle\n | trans-title =\n | medium = Blu-ray short\n | language =English\n| publisher = [[Shout!

[[Uma Thurman]] was originally a candidate for the role prior to the script changes.<ref name=\"volk\"/> After Volk suggested using elements from the [[M.R. James]] story \"[[The Ash-tree]]\" in the script, Friedkin became fixated on incorporating a tree into Camilla's backstory. Volk reportedly suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and left the production, leaving Friedkin to finish the script's loose ends after filming had already begun.<ref name=\"jenny\"/> \n\nIn a 2015 interview, Jenny Seagrove recalled visiting Friedkin at his home in Los Angeles, where he told her he had been reading about [[Druid]] mythology and wanted to incorporate it into the film.<ref name=\"jenny\"/> According to Seagrove: \"Pages were flying at us [...] and then suddenly this idea of this weird kind of tree came about, and suddenly my character was not just a nanny but she was a Druid character who turned into a part of the tree, and she had to feed the tree\u2014things were evolving all the time.\"<ref name=\"jenny\"/>\n\n===Special effects===\nSeagrove underwent numerous extensive [[Prosthetic makeup|makeup]] transformations in the film, at times covered in [[tree bark]] during the metamorphosing scenes.<ref name=\"jenny\"/> The tree featured in the film was constructed by the special effects department in [[Burbank, California]], and transported to the nature preserve in Valencia. The tree contained tubes of circulating [[Theatrical blood|fake blood]] in order for the tree to properly \"bleed\" when cut.<ref name=\"effects\"/>\n\n==Alternate endings==\nThe television version of the film ends with Phil and Kate returning home from the hospital with Jake, while Camilla is alive and naked at the tree. Director William Friedkin disapproved of the television cut of the film, and removed his name from the credits, naming \"[[Alan Smithee|Alan von Smithee]]\" as the director.{{Sfn|Decherny|2013|p=129}}\n\nThe video and DVD versions have the full ending, in which Camilla appears in her true form and tries to take the baby from Kate, but Phil cuts down the tree with a chainsaw, thus killing both it and Camilla.<ref>Friedkin, William.
