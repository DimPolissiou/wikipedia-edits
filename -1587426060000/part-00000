Tyler later learns of his family's werewolf curse. Meanwhile, [[Caroline Forbes]] ([[Candice Accola]]) is killed by Katherine while having [[Damon Salvatore]]'s ([[Ian Somerhalder]]) blood in her system, turning her into a vampire. The arrival of the original vampires, [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Elijah Mikaelson|Elijah]] ([[Daniel Gillies]]) and [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Klaus Mikaelson|Klaus Mikaelson]] ([[Joseph Morgan (actor)|Joseph Morgan]]), also bring about complications. Klaus is a vampire-werewolf hybrid, but his werewolf side had been forced into dormancy by witches, as nature would not stand for such an imbalance in power.

It also introduces [[Werewolf|werewolves]]. Tyler's werewolf uncle, Mason Lockwood, arrives after the death of Tyler's father and tells Tyler about the so-called \"Lockwood curse\" in their family. To activate the werewolf gene, the person must kill someone. Katherine turns Caroline into a vampire, so as to have a spy against Stefan and Elena. Katherine's main reason for returning to Mystic Falls is to find the moonstone, with the help of Mason, who is killed by Damon. Katherine calls in a favor from a witch named Lucy to get the stone. Lucy casts a spell so that when Katherine is hurt, it also affects Elena. \n\nWhen Lucy finds out that another Bennett is at the party and that Katherine had deceived her, she puts a spell on the moonstone, injuring Katherine. Damon then leaves her in the original tomb where she is trapped until the spell has been removed from the tomb. She tells him that her reason for not killing Elena is that she is in danger. Elena is later kidnapped by a masked individual and held hostage by vampires Rose and Trevor, who have been on the run from [[The Originals (TV series)|the Originals]] (the first generation of vampires). Rose reveals to Elena that she is the Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger and needs to be sacrificed to break the sun and moon curse. Katherine was also a Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger, who used Trevor to help her escape from the Originals and Rose to turn her into a vampire to save herself. Elena is rescued by Stefan and Damon by stabbing Elijah with a sharp wooden pole and they escape. \n\nKlaus, one of the original vampires, arrives and is now hunting Elena. His brother Elijah has made a deal with Elena to protect her loved ones, because he wants to use her as bait to lure Klaus and kill him. Jules, a friend of Mason, tells the Lockwoods that Mason never came back to Florida and is missing. Alaric is suspicious of Jules and calls Damon to the Grill (local town hangout). Jules reveals that she is a werewolf. Damon tells Jules she won't find Mason and to leave town. Jules breaks into the Salvatore mansion in wolf form and attacks Damon, but Rose pushes him out of the way, getting bitten on the shoulder instead (werewolf bites are lethal to vampires). As Rose succumbs to the effects of the bite, Damon stakes her in a glorious dream they share, giving her a peaceful death. \n\nUncle John returns to Mystic Falls and comes as an unpleasant surprise to Elena, Damon, Jenna, and Alaric. John reveals to Damon that the only way to kill an Original is with a dagger dipped in [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]] wood. A boy named Luka settle in the town with his father (they are both [[Magician (fantasy)|warlocks]]) and reveals that they are working for Elijah because Klaus has his sister Greta and they want him (Luka) dead as well. Luka becomes friends with Bonnie and tells her that Klaus will be weakened by the sacrificial ritual, meaning that Elena has to die so that Elijah can kill him and free his sister. John gives Damon the special dagger to kill Elijah. \n\nElena finds out that if a vampire uses the dagger, that vampire will die. Stefan warns Damon and Alaric stabs Elijah, but he pulls the dagger out and tells Elena their deal is off. Elena stabs herself in the stomach, and Elijah begs her to let him heal her. She stabs him with the dagger and leaves it in him. Elijah's death means that Katherine is no longer compelled to stay in the tomb. She helps kill the Martin witches. When Isobel returns to town, Katherine double-crosses the Salvatores by kidnapping Elena and stealing the moonstone for Klaus in exchange for her freedom. But it is revealed that Klaus wanted Katherine and compelled Isobel to get her and the moonstone.\n\nKlaus enters Alaric's body and compels Katherine to stay in Alaric's house. Bonnie and Jeremy find the site of the a witch massacre and Bonnie channels all the power. Alaric/Klaus blends with Stefan, Damon, and Elena and finds out that Bonnie has her powers. Damon tells Bonnie to put on a protection spell and make Alaric/Klaus believe that she is dead. Elena does not want Bonnie to die, so she pulls the dagger out of Elijah's heart. After Elijah comes to life, Elena learns the full history of Klaus. The Aztec curse is fake and there is a curse on Klaus, as he is a vampire born in a werewolf bloodline. There is a ritual that involves killing a vampire and a werewolf and a Petrova doppelganger, that will unearth the werewolf side of Klaus making him a hybrid.\n\nElena realizes that the real curse is on Klaus, who therefore wants to kill her. But Elijah says he has an elixir that can save Elena from dying. Elena believes Elijah, but Damon says that there is another way to save her life and feeds her his blood. Stefan tries to stop him, but he stabs in the chest with the wooden dagger. Elena then cries that she will be a vampire against her will. Maddox kidnaps Tyler and Caroline. Damon frees them and is bitten. Then he goes to Klaus to tell him that he does not have a werewolf and witch, as he killed Maddox. Klaus says that he has backups. Klaus takes Elena from Stefan. Elena sees Jenna, who thinks she is dead, but Greta tells her she is transitioning. Damon asks Katherine about the vampire, and she says that Jenna is the backup vampire. He then checks his arm and sees that Tyler has bitten him.\n\nIn the season's finale, Klaus is working on the ritual out in the woods and is near completion when he is about to kill Elena, but Stefan tries to work a deal with him. Klaus agrees to have Stefan work for him in exchange for Damon's protection. Elena is \"killed\" in the ritual but is shown to have survived. Regardless, Klaus's werewolf side is unleashed and he becomes the first hybrid, half vampire half werewolf. Bonnie arrives and subdues Klaus with her powers, giving Elijah the opportunity to strike, but Klaus talks him down offering to help find their siblings. Elena's survival is revealed as John had Bonnie cast a spell that had him die in Elena's place. The next morning John succumbs and dies. At his funeral, Elena reads a note from John saying he will always love her and she will always be his daughter, even if she becomes a vampire. Damon also shows where he was bitten and walks away.\n\n==Reception==\nBased on 12 reviews, the 2nd season currently holds a 100% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average rating of 8.07 out of 10.

Klaus is a vampire-werewolf hybrid, but his werewolf side had been forced into dormancy by witches, as nature would not stand for such an imbalance in power.

It also introduces [[Werewolf|werewolves]]. Tyler's werewolf uncle, Mason Lockwood, arrives after the death of Tyler's father and tells Tyler about the so-called \"Lockwood curse\" in their family. To activate the werewolf gene, the person must kill someone. Katherine turns Caroline into a vampire, so as to have a spy against Stefan and Elena. Katherine's main reason for returning to Mystic Falls is to find the moonstone, with the help of Mason, who is killed by Damon. Katherine calls in a favor from a witch named Lucy to get the stone. Lucy casts a spell so that when Katherine is hurt, it also affects Elena. \n\nWhen Lucy finds out that another Bennett is at the party and that Katherine had deceived her, she puts a spell on the moonstone, injuring Katherine. Damon then leaves her in the original tomb where she is trapped until the spell has been removed from the tomb. She tells him that her reason for not killing Elena is that she is in danger. Elena is later kidnapped by a masked individual and held hostage by vampires Rose and Trevor, who have been on the run from [[The Originals (TV series)|the Originals]] (the first generation of vampires). Rose reveals to Elena that she is the Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger and needs to be sacrificed to break the sun and moon curse. Katherine was also a Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger, who used Trevor to help her escape from the Originals and Rose to turn her into a vampire to save herself. Elena is rescued by Stefan and Damon by stabbing Elijah with a sharp wooden pole and they escape. \n\nKlaus, one of the original vampires, arrives and is now hunting Elena. His brother Elijah has made a deal with Elena to protect her loved ones, because he wants to use her as bait to lure Klaus and kill him. Jules, a friend of Mason, tells the Lockwoods that Mason never came back to Florida and is missing. Alaric is suspicious of Jules and calls Damon to the Grill (local town hangout). Jules reveals that she is a werewolf. Damon tells Jules she won't find Mason and to leave town. Jules breaks into the Salvatore mansion in wolf form and attacks Damon, but Rose pushes him out of the way, getting bitten on the shoulder instead (werewolf bites are lethal to vampires). As Rose succumbs to the effects of the bite, Damon stakes her in a glorious dream they share, giving her a peaceful death. \n\nUncle John returns to Mystic Falls and comes as an unpleasant surprise to Elena, Damon, Jenna, and Alaric. John reveals to Damon that the only way to kill an Original is with a dagger dipped in [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]] wood. A boy named Luka settle in the town with his father (they are both [[Magician (fantasy)|warlocks]]) and reveals that they are working for Elijah because Klaus has his sister Greta and they want him (Luka) dead as well. Luka becomes friends with Bonnie and tells her that Klaus will be weakened by the sacrificial ritual, meaning that Elena has to die so that Elijah can kill him and free his sister. John gives Damon the special dagger to kill Elijah. \n\nElena finds out that if a vampire uses the dagger, that vampire will die. Stefan warns Damon and Alaric stabs Elijah, but he pulls the dagger out and tells Elena their deal is off. Elena stabs herself in the stomach, and Elijah begs her to let him heal her. She stabs him with the dagger and leaves it in him. Elijah's death means that Katherine is no longer compelled to stay in the tomb. She helps kill the Martin witches. When Isobel returns to town, Katherine double-crosses the Salvatores by kidnapping Elena and stealing the moonstone for Klaus in exchange for her freedom. But it is revealed that Klaus wanted Katherine and compelled Isobel to get her and the moonstone.\n\nKlaus enters Alaric's body and compels Katherine to stay in Alaric's house. Bonnie and Jeremy find the site of the a witch massacre and Bonnie channels all the power. Alaric/Klaus blends with Stefan, Damon, and Elena and finds out that Bonnie has her powers. Damon tells Bonnie to put on a protection spell and make Alaric/Klaus believe that she is dead. Elena does not want Bonnie to die, so she pulls the dagger out of Elijah's heart. After Elijah comes to life, Elena learns the full history of Klaus. The Aztec curse is fake and there is a curse on Klaus, as he is a vampire born in a werewolf bloodline. There is a ritual that involves killing a vampire and a werewolf and a Petrova doppelganger, that will unearth the werewolf side of Klaus making him a hybrid.\n\nElena realizes that the real curse is on Klaus, who therefore wants to kill her. But Elijah says he has an elixir that can save Elena from dying. Elena believes Elijah, but Damon says that there is another way to save her life and feeds her his blood. Stefan tries to stop him, but he stabs in the chest with the wooden dagger. Elena then cries that she will be a vampire against her will. Maddox kidnaps Tyler and Caroline. Damon frees them and is bitten. Then he goes to Klaus to tell him that he does not have a werewolf and witch, as he killed Maddox. Klaus says that he has backups. Klaus takes Elena from Stefan. Elena sees Jenna, who thinks she is dead, but Greta tells her she is transitioning. Damon asks Katherine about the vampire, and she says that Jenna is the backup vampire. He then checks his arm and sees that Tyler has bitten him.\n\nIn the season's finale, Klaus is working on the ritual out in the woods and is near completion when he is about to kill Elena, but Stefan tries to work a deal with him. Klaus agrees to have Stefan work for him in exchange for Damon's protection. Elena is \"killed\" in the ritual but is shown to have survived. Regardless, Klaus's werewolf side is unleashed and he becomes the first hybrid, half vampire half werewolf. Bonnie arrives and subdues Klaus with her powers, giving Elijah the opportunity to strike, but Klaus talks him down offering to help find their siblings. Elena's survival is revealed as John had Bonnie cast a spell that had him die in Elena's place. The next morning John succumbs and dies. At his funeral, Elena reads a note from John saying he will always love her and she will always be his daughter, even if she becomes a vampire. Damon also shows where he was bitten and walks away.\n\n==Reception==\nBased on 12 reviews, the 2nd season currently holds a 100% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average rating of 8.07 out of 10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"The sophomore season of ''Vampire Diaries'' is top shelf guilty pleasure, balancing wild twists and cliffhangers without going off the rails.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_vampire_diaries/s02 |title=The Vampire Diaries: Season 2 (2010-2011) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\nKen Tucker of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote, \"The throbbing red heart of ''The Vampire Diaries'' remains the tension between Damon and [[Paul Wesley]]'s Stefan, and their mutual attraction to whomever [[Nina Dobrev|Dobrev]] is embodying at the time.\"<ref name=\"metacritic\" /> Mark A. Perigard of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' said, \"The triangle&nbsp;\u2013 quadrangle?&nbsp;\u2013 becomes more twisted by episode's end.

The [[Venice Film Festival]] takes place at the Lido  late August/early September.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajhU1AAacUsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Frommer's 500 Extraordinary Islands | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | date=Jan 14, 2010 | accessdate=1 December 2013 | author=Hughes, Holly | pages=5}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Lido island is one of the two [[barrier islands]] of the Lagoon of Venice, the other is [[Pellestrina]]. They form the central part of the coastline of the lagoon on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The  peninsula of [[Cavallino-Treporti|Cavallino]]/Punta Sabbioni forms the northern part and the peninsula of [[Sottomarina]] forms the southern part. The sea has access to the lagoon through three inlets between the islands and between the islands and the peninsulas. At the northern end of Lido there is the Lido inlet which separates it from Cavallino/Punta Sabbioni and at the southern end there is the Malamocco inlet which separates it from Pellestrina.<ref>[http://cigno.atlantedellalaguna.it/maps/7/view Atlas of the Lagoon]</ref> These two inlets have been dredged to a greater depth to allow big ships through. The Malamocco inlet is the deepest one and is used by container ships and oil tankers to reach the commercial and industrial port of [[Marghera]]. The Lido inlet is the widest one (c.1&nbsp;km) and is used by cruise ships to reach Venice.\n\nLido is a long and narrow island which gets wider in its northern tract. At least half the seaward coast has sandy beaches. Much of the beach at the town of Lido belongs to various hotels. There are large public beaches towards the northern and southern ends.\n\nThe island is home to a town and a village. The town is in the north. It is also called Lido (population 15128 in 2019<ref name = portale>[https://portale.comune.venezia.it/millefoglie/statistiche/home Portale comune Venezia]</ref>). Its neighbourhoods are San Nicol\u00f2, Santa Maria Elisabetta, on the lagoon side coast (the landing stage for the Venice ferry is in the former and the one for the water bus is in the latter), and Quattro Fontane and La Favorita, on the seaward coast. It developed in the 19th century as a tourist centre, both as a leisure seaside resort and as a [[balneotherapy]] resort. It has many 19th century villas built in [[Liberty style]] (the Italian version of [[Art Nouveau]]) and many hotels. It is famous for being the seat of the [[Venice Film Festival]] and for its grand hotels, such as the [[Grand Hotel des Bains]], the Hotel Excelsior.<ref>[https://famoushotels.org/hotels/excelsior-lido-Venice Famous hotels]</ref> and the Hotel Ausonia & Hungaria <ref>[http://www.historichotelsthenandnow.com/ausoniahungariavenicelido.html Historic Hotels Now]</ref> which have hosted celebrities,  artists and writers, major businessmen, politicians and royalties. The  Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta (27 m wide and c. 700 m long) crosses the town from coast to coast and links the water bus landing stage to the beach.\n\nThe village of [[Malamocco]] (with a population of 1030 as of 2019)<ref name=portale/> is on the lagoon side coast, in the central-southern part of the island. From the 12th century to the 19th century it was the only significant settlement on the island. It was built after the settlement of Metamaucum, which had been the second capital of the [[Duchy of Venetia]], was submerged by a storm surge.\n\nAt the southern end of the islands there is Alberoni, an area of sand dunes. It has Venice's golf course<ref>[https://www.1golf.eu/en/club/circolo-golf-venezia/ Circolo Golf Venezia]</ref> and the Alberoni Dune Oasis which has one of the largest and best-preserved dune systems on the coasts of the Northern Adriatic Sea, with dunes up to 10 meters high, a large, c. 30 [[hectares]], pine forest and unique species of flora and fauna.<ref>[http://www.veniceandlagoon.net/web/en/itineraries/nature/alberoni-dunes-and-ca-roman/Alberoni Dunes]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Metamaucum===\n[[Malamocco|Metamaucum]] was one of the earliest settlements in the [[Lagoon of Venice]]. Its origins dated back to the Roman days. It became the second ducal seat of the [[duchy of Venetia]] (before the rise of Venice) when [[Teodato Ipato]] (742-55), the second [[doge]], transferred it from Heraclea, to 811, when the doge [[Agnello Participazio]] (811-27) moved it to Rivoalto. It was temporarily occupied by [[Pepin of Italy]] when he tried to invade the lagoon in 810. It was destroyed by the doge [[Giovanni I Participazio]] (829\u2013836) when he suppressed a rebellion based in Metamaucum. The settlement continued to be inhabited, but it was a shadow of its former self. Its decadence reached its peak when its priory was moved to the island of [[Murano]] (1080), the S.S. Leone e Basso nuns moved to the island of [[San Servolo]] (1109) and its [[dioceses]] was moved to Chioggia between 1107 and 1110. In 1116 it was submerged as a result of an exceptional storm surge. According to the tradition, Metamaucum was on the seashore of the Lido island, rather than on its lagoon shore.\n\nA new settlement was built on the lagoon shore of Lido, close to where Metamaucum had been. The existence of a Metamaucum Nova, which corresponds to today's Malamocco, was first attested in 1107.<ref>Lanfranchi, L., Zille, G.,  Il territorio del Ducato Veneziano dall'VIII al XII secolo, in  Storia di Venezia, 1958, pp. 27-28</ref>\n\n===Military island===\nUntil the 19th century Lido's main role was a military one for the defence of  the lagoon as it lies by the lido inlet, the widest point of entry of the lagoon and the one which is closest to Venice. It continued to have a military tole until WW II. Prior to the 19th century it was also a scarcely populated island. In 1820 Lido has 814 inhabitants, 662 of whom lived in Malamocco, and 152 lived in San   Nicol\u00f2.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 99</ref>\n\nIn 600 a lookout tower was built at San Nicol\u00f2, at the northern end of Lido, on its lagoon side shore, to monitor enemy ships, particularly pirate ships, approaching the lagoon at the Lido inlet. In 1100 it was strengthened and developed into a fort under the doge [[Vitale I Michiel]] (1096-1102). This fort was later called Castel Vecchio (Old Castle).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 28</ref>\n\nIn 1229 crossbow shooting ranges were created in areas of Venice for weekly exercises by men between the ages of 16 and 35. In 1229 a shooting range was established at San Nicol\u00f2. It hosted shooting contests at Christmas and Easter to make the exercises more interesting. Infantry, cavalry, and artillery units were also stationed in the area and foundries for armaments and munitions were built where the Jewish cemetery was later set up. In 1304 a militia was instituted. The sailing to Lido was also turned into a contest. The men rowed to the island on boats (called ganzaruoli) with 30-40 oarsmen boats which competed over who would get there first. This is the origin of the word regatta. The only establishment that sold wine at San Nicol\u00f2 was closed during the contests. A lighthouse was also built close to the shooting range. A permanent garrison was set up.  It served as rest area for troops which needed to briefly stop by. Wells to supply freshwater to ships that left the city were built.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 60, 64-65</ref>\n\nIn the mid-14th century tensions between Venice and the [[Republic of Genoa]] escalated due to their rivalry over supremacy of the naval routes and trading ports in the eastern Mediterranean . 1318. San Nicol\u00f2 was bombed several times by a Genoese fleet.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 62</ref>\n\nIn 1335 the Gagiandra (turtle in Venetian) was built. It was a platform for artillery which was placed in the Lido channel which went from the Lido inlet to Venice. It was broad and tapered at the stern and bow. It was covered by a metal plate which acted  as a shield. The canons were sticking out of this shield. This gave it the appearance of the head, tail and legs of a turtle. The platform was placed between the Castel Vecchio (Old Castle) at San Nicol\u00f2 and the Castel Novo (New Castle) on the [[Vignole]] island. These two islands and the island of Certosa formed the shores of the channel. An iron chain was placed across the channel. It was supported by the Gagiandra and two rafts placed midway between the \"turtle\" and the two shores. The chain was kept close to the surface of the water to prevent enemy ships to pass above it.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 64-65</ref>\n\nIn 1379 Genoa attacked the lagoon in the [[War of Chioggia]] (1379\u201380). Two towers were built as platforms for crossbows and cannons at the Castel Vecchio and Novo forts (on the Lido and Vignole islands) on the two sides of the Lido channel, to further protect the entrance to the lagoon. Small boats which were chained together were placed between the two towers. Between them there were three ships with archers covered with fresh hides to protect them from fire. A ditch and earthen rampant strengthened with stone were created to protect the S. Nicol\u00f3 abbey. Eventually Venice won the war.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 66-6</ref>\n\nIn 1409 an admiralty was established at S. Nicol\u00f2. 1520 The [[Council of Ten]] build a building to house its offices and barracks for its officers who were entrusted with monitoring Lido, its fortresses, its inlet and the way the sea changed its beaches. This was called the Casa Rossa (Red House).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp.70, 78</ref>\n \nIn the 16th century, with the Turkish conquests in south-eastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, which were a threat to the Venetian dominion in that part of the Mediterranean the Turks were also considered a threat to Venice itself.\n\nBetween 1543 and 1549 Castel Novo, on the Vignole island, was developed into the Sant\u2019Andrea fort. Between 1546 and 1574 Castel Novo at San Nicol\u00f2 was developed into the San Nicol\u00f2 fort. Between 1569 and 1574 the latter was strengthened with a triple ditch. Artillery was placed on the seaward side. There were no batteries on the lagoon side in case the fortress was seized and the cannons would be used against the Sant\u2019Andrea fort. The fort became a complex with the military headquarter of the [[Republic of Venice]]. The whole area became a c. 521 m long fortified citadel stretching along the lagoon coast with brick barriers and bastions, a dike and an earthen fore wall. It was later was extended towards the sea with angular barriers, six gates and underground exits on the sea beach side, towards the entrance to the Lido inlet. Inside the new fortification there were the old San Nicol\u00f2 church and its convent and the adjacent Palazzo dei dieci/Casa Rossa at the back. In 1572 an Istrian stone bridge that looked like a triumphal arch over the dock was built to provide access to the citadel.\n\nLarge barracks for the troops, known as Saraglio, Quartier Grando or Palazzo dei Soldati (Stronghold, Large Quarters or Building of the Soldiers) were built between 1591 and 1594. It was an imposing building which provided lodgings for 2000 soldiers. It was the first true barracks in Europe, the first instance in which troops were lodged in peacetime. It was an important step towards the creation of a modern army as opposed to a mercenary army or a militia. It was built on the location where the crusaders had gathered before setting off for the fourth crusade. From 1600 the barracks hosted the Fanti da Mar (Infantrymen of the Sea), the first amphibian troops in history, a sort of precursor of today\u2019s marines.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 28-29, 83-84</ref>\n\nIn 1571 it was decided to build octagonal forts for artillery batteries on islets off the lagoon side shore of Lido. They were the Ottagono Campana (later called Abbandonato, abandoned octagon),  between Malamocco and Alberoni (off the southern end of the Lido island) and the Ottagono Alberoni, by Alberoni and the northern end of the Malamocco inlet, the other point of access into the lagoon, where ships could turn towards Venice. The Ottagono di Poveglia (further north, on the Poveglia island, off Malamocco) acted as a reinforcement for the other two octagons further south. Two octagons were built off the [[Pellestrina]] island, the Ottagono San Pietro, at the northern end of the island and the southern end of the Malamocco inlet and the Ottagono Caroman, at the southern end of Pellestrina to guard the Chioggia inlet, the third entry point of the lagoon. In 1572, 75 artillery were supplied for the San Nicol\u00f2 fort and 56 for Sant\u2019Andrea.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 83-84</ref>\n\nSan Nicol\u00f2 was also where the soldiers and the ships for Venice\u2019s naval expeditions in the Adriatic Sea and the rest of the Mediterranean Sea gathered and set off from. Some of these were:\n\nIn 1000 the doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]] (991-1099) set off for a mission to [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] which freed the northern Adriatic from the [[Narentine]] pirates. In 1099, 207 ships set off at the end of the first crusade to help the crusaders to consolidate their conquests. It defeated a fleet of their Genoese rivals off [[Rhodes]]. In 1124 a fleet sets off to free the [[King of Jerusalem]] who had been imprisoned in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Lebanon]]. It had 108 vessels, 40 galleys 40 supply ships and 28 ships with rams. It besieged and seized Tyre. In 1171 A fleet set off for a battle against the emperor Byzantine Emmanuel Kommenos who had the Venetians in Constantinople arrested. The fleet was defeated more by the plague that the Byzantines, who were was joined by the rival maritime republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]]. In 1202 the crusaders of the fourth crusade gathered at Lido in preparation to be taken to the East by Venetian ships. In 1690 Francesco Morosini set off for a campaign in the Peloponnese. He was elected as doge while away. He was met at Lido by the abbot while the senators waited for him of the Bucintoro, the ceremonial boat of the doge. In 1784 there was a punitive expedition against the Barbary pirates.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 50, 54, 55, 58, 94, 100</ref>\n\n===Pope, emperor and the Peace of Venice===\nThe emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa|Frederick I, Barbarossa]] (reigned 1155-1190) conducted six military campaigns in Italy, which was under his [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Originally he wanted to confront the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in the south. However, his intervention in Italy was opposed by several Italian cities, particularly [[Milan]], which he had partially destroyed during his second campaign. A dispute with [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159-1181) developed because Frederick endorsed [[Antipope Victor IV (1159\u20131164)|antipope Victor IV]], who had been elected in opposition to Alexander. Opposition against Frederick in northern Italy grew and the [[Lombard League]], a league formed by several cities, fought him. Frederick was defeated at the [[Battle of Legnano]] in 1176. Preliminary peace negotiations took place at [[Anagni]] (the Peace of Anagni) in 1176.<ref>Davis, R. H. C. A History of Medieval Europe, 1957, p.332 et seq.</ref>  Negotiations involving all the concerned parties to reach a formal peace treaty took place in Venice where a conference was scheduled for July 1177. The [[doge]] [[Sebastiano Ziani]] (1172\u201378) was to act as an intermediary.\n\nThe pope arrived in Venice in 10 May 1177. Negotiations with the Lombard League and the king of Sicily started but they were taking a hard stance. Frederick was not allowed to go to Venice and waited for news in Ravenna. A pro-Frederick faction in Venice encouraged Frederick to come to Venice in defiance of the veto, but the emperor declined to do so without the doge\u2019s approval. Because of internal pressure, Ziani hesitated. The envoys of the League left Venice for [[Treviso]] in protest. The head of the Sicilian delegation threatened to leave and said that his king would take revenge on Venice breach of faith. This would have meant retaliation against Venetian traders in Sicily. The doge confirmed that Frederick would be allowed to enter Venice only after this received papal approval.\n\nThis situation highlighted the danger of a breakdown in the talks and negotiations proceeded more rapidly. On 23 July the agreement was completed. At the pope request, Venetian ships went to [[Chioggia]] to pick up the emperor, who was taken to Lido. Four cardinals went there to meet him there. Frederick recognised Alexander as the rightful pope and could now be allowed to enter Venice. Doge Ziani went to meet him at San Nicol\u00f2 and took him to Venice with great pomp. A ceremony was held at St. Mark\u2019s basilica.<ref>Norwich, J. J., A History of Venice, 2003, pp. 111-16</ref>\n\n===The Wedding to the Sea===\nIn 1000 the doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]] (991-1099) set off for a mission to [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] which freed the northern Adriatic from the [[Narentine]] pirates. Istria and Dalmatia accepted Venice's [[suzerainty]]. To celebrate this the Venetians celebrated with the ''Benedictio del Mare'' (Blessing of the Sea) ceremony,  which was held annually until 1177. In that year, after Venice's mediation which led to the Peace of Venice, it was replaced by the ''Sposalizio col Mare'' (Wedding with the Sea) .\n\nIn this ceremony the doge sailed for Lido on the bucintoro (the doge's ceremonial ship) with the top clergy, the top officials of the [[Republic of Venice]] and ambassadors. This was followed by a  large number of Venetians on various kinds of vessels. It was a festive parade. Between Lido and the Sant'Andrea fort (see above), where the [[Lagoon of Venice]] meets the [[Adriatic Sea]], the doge took a golden ring which pope Alexander III had donated him. He then threw it into the sea. It was attached to a string so that it can be retrieved. The doge then recited \"We marry thee, oh sea, in a sign of eternal domination.\" The ceremony ended in 1797 when the Republic fell with its conquest by Napoleon. It was performed on the first Sunday after [[ascension day]].\n\nThe ceremony and [[f\u00eate]] was performed again in 1965 and in 1988. The latter was an initiative by private citizens and cultural and sport associations which wanted to relaunch the celebrations.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 55-56, 202, 215</ref> The ceremony became permanent and is now led by the mayor of Venice\n\nThe ceremony was also associated with the ''Festa della Sensa'' (F\u00eate of Ascension). In 1180 it developed into the ''Fiera della Sensa'' (Ascension [[Fair]]). There were acrobats, jugglers and minstrels in all the streets of Venice. There was a large market in [[St. Mark's Square (Venice)|St. Mark's Square]]. From 1307 the market had especially prepared stands which over time became increasingly decoratively elaborate. Goods of all kinds and from all over the world were displayed.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 56</ref>\n\n===Murazzi===\nThe engineer Bernardo Zendrini found that [[pozzolana]] mixed with chalk and sand was an efficient water-resistant binder. In 1737 he built a 2.5 m long test wall near Malamocco. Three years later it had withstood two winter storm surges (one of which had been one of the worst) without damage. This lead to the building of the murazzi, imposing walls made with large blocks of [[Istrian stone]] to form a continuous sea defence on the barrier island of Pellestrina. Later murazzi were built at Lido as well, but here they were discontinuous. A previously unknown 350 m long test wall brought was to light by the seaward shore in 1980. It lies 380 from the sea.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 97</ref> This is because after the construction of the breakwater at San Nicol\u00f2 (see below), sand has been accumulating on the sea shore in the northern part of the island, widening the beach.\n\n===Churches, monasteries convents and saints===\nIn 887 the male Benedictine monastery of  San Cipriano was founded in Malamocco on the initiative of doge [[Giovanni II Participazio]]. This was followed by the female monastery of Santi Leone and Basso. In 1108 San Cipriano was abandoned due to damage caused by the sea and daily ground collapses. The friars moved to the [[Murano]] island and set up a new monastery of S. Cipriano. In 1109, for the same reason, the nuns moved to a convent on the [[San Servolo]] island vacated by Benedictine monks who had moved to the monastery of Sant'Ilario near Fusina.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 42, 53</ref>\n\nIn 1045 the doge Domenico Contarini I (1043\u201371), the [[Patriarch of Grado]] and the bishop of  Olivolo founded the church and convent of San Nicol\u00f2. The works for the church  were completed in 1064. In 1053, the management of the church and convent was handed to the abbot of the [[Benedictine]] monastery of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]]. In 1098 some of relics three of saints from [[Myra]] (now [[Demre]]), west of the [[Chelidonia (islands)|Chelidonia]] cape, [[Lydia]], on the southern coast of what is now [[Turkey]], were smuggled by a naval squadron which returned form the first crusade and placed in the San Nicol\u00f2 church. The saints were  Nicol\u00f2 Major, his uncle Nicol\u00f2 Minor and Theodoros. The church, which was small, was enlarged in 1134 and urns with the relics were moved from the crypt and put in three niches by the main altar. Between 1626 and 1634 the church was demolished and rebuilt, together with the bell tower, using material from the old church. In 1770 the Benedictines moved to San Giorgio Maggiore island because a 1768 law closed confraternities with less than 12 monks or friars. The building became a military quarter. The church remained open for worship. In 1938 it was granted to Franciscan friars.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46-50, 52, 62, 90-91, 100, 187</ref>\n\nThe first record of the Abbey of San Leonardo between Alberoni and Malamocco dates to 1111. It was destroyed by fire, along with the whole of the Malamocco coast, during the [[War of Chioggia]] (1379\u201380). In 1407 there was a bequest for the rebuilding of the monastery. The church was rebuilt with funds from the [[patriarch of Venice]]. The church merged with the San Camillo hospital in 1928 and was demolished to enlarge the hospital.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 53-54</ref>\n\nIn 1557 the parish church of Santa Maria Assunta church in Malamocco was rebuilt on top of old one, which dated to the 11th century.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 81</ref>\n\nIn 1620 there was a request to build a church at Lido to replace the unauthorised oratory of Beata Vergine Visitante Santa Elisabetta (Blessed Visiting Virgin St. Elizabeth) to the south of San Nicol\u00f2, which was built by the locals because they found it difficult to reach their parish church of [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]] on the island with the same name.\nIn 1627 the construction of the new church, now called Santa Maria Elisabetta, on top of the old oratory was completed. The patriarch of Venice granted it the title of parish church. It was the second parish church of Lido, after Santa Maria Assunta in Malamocco. In 19th century, when the area became built up, it was named after this church.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 88-91</ref>\n\n===Jewish and protestant cemeteries===\nIn 1386 the Jews were granted a plot of uncultivated land to develop the Jewish cemetery. The friars of the San Nicol\u00f2 convent were opposed to this and claimed that they owned the land. A few years later to resolve this, the Jews paid a token rent. Consent was given and burials started in 1389. A protestant cemetery was opened close to the Jewish one in 1674.  A very small catholic cemetery was opened in 1866 in front of the entrance of the Jewish one. In 1916 it was replaced by a new one. A new Jewish cemetery was also built. Its monumental  entrance was completed in 1923. As a result, the Catholic cemetery lies between the old and new Jewish cemeteries.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 67-68, 94, 157, 168</ref>\n\n===19th century===\nThe accumulation of sand carried by the sea at the Malamocco and Lido inlets made their navigability problematic. During second Napoleonic occupation (1806\u201314), it was decided to build breakwaters on the southern and northern shore of the Malamocco inlet. The latter was to be built at Alberoni, on the southern tip of Lido. However, the works were not completed due to the second Austrian occupation (1814\u201348). The Austrians disagreed with the French plans. The project was entrusted to the engineer Pietro Paleocapa. Works at Alberoni started in 1838 and were completed in 1845. Works on the southern breakwater at Santa Maria del Mare, on the [[Pellestrina]] island, started in 1853 and were completed in 1856. The object of the northern breakwater to keep the coastal current at bay and trap the sand it carried. That of the southern one was to channel the receding low tide water to make the inlet deeper through the force of the exit current.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 107-8, 115, 116, 118</ref>\n\nIn the late 18th century and in the 19th century, a number of poets and writers wrote about Lido. This made Lido an attractive destination for people from the European elites in their then fashionable  journeys in Italy.  In 1786 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], the German poet and scientist, visited Lido and wrote about his experience there in this book about his journey in Italy. [[Lord Byron]] spent five years (1816\u201321) in Venice and liked to ride his horses at Lido from a hut he rented at Alberoni. In 1818 he was visited by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. The two spent a couple of days at Lido. Shelley wrote a poem about this. Since Byron was a celebrity, this attracted tourists who hoped to meet the poet or get a glimpse of him at Lido.<ref>Saikia, R., The Venice Lido: A Blue Guide Travel Monograph (e-Edition), ch.4</ref> In 1830 [[James Fenimore Cooper]], the author of [[The Last of the Mohicans]], visited and described Lido and used Venice as the background for his novel [[The Bravo]]. In 1841 [[John Ruskin]], the art critic who wrote about Venice and her art, also wrote about Lido. Other people who visited Lido and described it were and the French poet [[Theophile Gautier]], in 1850, [[Herman Melville]], the American novelist and poet, in 1857, and [[Hyppolyte Taine]], the French critic and historian, in 1864. Henry James first arrived in Venice in 1869. He went to Lido 14 times. He wrote about Venice in some of his novels and one of them was set in Venice. The British poet and playwright [[Robert Browning]] went to Lido in 1888 and died in Venice nearly two months later.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 101-2, 112, 113, 116, 117, 120, 123, 132</ref>\n\n[[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Frederick William]], the [[Duke of Brunswick]] (1771-1815) bought a plot of land at Lido, intending it to have his holiday home there. From 1879 queen [[Margherita of Savoy]] took her sickly son [[Victor Emmanuel III]], the heir to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] on holiday at Lido, at the [[sea bathing]] facility of La Favorita. A royal chalet was arranged for her.<ref>Farina F., Architetture balneari tra Europa e Americhe nella Belle \u00e9poque, 2001, p. 10</ref>  In those days there was the belief that sea bathing had a curative or therapeutic value.\n\nTommaso Rima, a doctor at Venice\u2019s hospital, believed that bathing in the lagoon had therapeutic benefits for nervous illnesses, scrofulosis,<ref>A form of tuberculosis, most common in children, tending to cause enlarged and degenerated lymph nodes, especially in the neck, and often chronic, intractable skin inflammation as well, Wiktionary</ref> rickets and skin disorders. In 1833 he set up a floating bathing facility  at [[Punta della Dogana]], opposite [[St Mark's Square (Venice)|St Mark\u2019s]]. It consisted of two big rafts which created a pool with a grate at the bottom and which could be reassembled in the summer. There was a caf\u00e9 and one could sunbathe. The idea of bathing therapy caught on. Gondolas were adapted for the purpose and inns set up pools with water drawn for the nearby canals which was warmed up. There was an idea that this kind of bathing in the Venetian winter was particularly therapeutic. In 1857 a booklet about this notion published.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 114-15</ref>\n\nThe Lido\u2019s potential for tourism did not go unnoticed. In 1852 there was a proposal to set up two [[spa]]s, one on the lagoon shore and one on the sea shore, but it was then thought that the lagoon water was less pure. In 1855 De la Hante, a Frenchman, set up a bathing resort in the La Favorita area, which was named after the villa of the [[archduke Maximillian of Austria]] (1832-1867) the brother of the emperor who was in charge of the Austrian dominions in northern Italy (1815\u201359) and spent some of his time in Venice. The resort had 70 rooms. In 1872 De la Hante bought the archduke\u2019s villa to convert it into a restaurant, caf\u00e9, casino and 70 rooms for an exclusive beach resort. However, he then sold it to the Lido Bathing Resort Society (see below).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 118, 124</ref>\n\nIn 1857 Giovanni Busetto, nicknamed Fisola, also opened a seaside resort. This consisted of wooden cabins on pilings over the beach with a common central area and two wings with 15 small rooms each. Separate cabins for the lower classes were planned. It was demolished by the Austrians in 1859 due to the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against Austrian domination in northern Italy. In 1867, after Venice became part of Italy, the resort was reopened and expanded but was destroyed by a storm surge. It was reopened and expanded again in 1870. From 1867 to 1871 the number of bathers increased from 30 to 60 thousand.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 118-19</ref>\n\nIn 1857 a summer shuttle service to and from Venice was set up. It consisted of large boats with four oarsmen which could carry 16 passengers. In 1858 the road from the church of Santa Maria Elisabetta, which was by the landing stage in the lagoon coast and lead to the seacoast, was widened and made suitable for vehicle traffic. It eventually came to be called Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta (or just Gran Viale). It was widened again in 1888 and a horse-drawn [[Horsebus|omnibus]] which took tourists to the beach along the Gran Viale entered into service. In the same year the military steamship Alnoch, which could carry up to 200 passengers, was made available for linking Lido with Venice during the tourist season from 6 am to 9 pm. This was then extended to 4 am to 11 pm.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 119-20</ref>\n\nIn 1872 a group of entrepreneurs set up the ''Societ\u00e0 Civile dei Bagni di Lido'' (the Lido Bathing Resort Society). Its aim was to boost Lido's tourism potential. It bought the La Favorita villa, it reduced the number of its room to six to be used by queen Margaret. A large terrace which overlooked the sea was built. It could host 1500 people and had salons, caf\u00e9-restaurants, reading rooms and ballrooms, a telegraph and post office, medical assistance, a chemist and life guards with special lookout posts and boats. The group also wanted to promote sea bathing as a leisure activity as well as a therapeutic one. This idea was expounded by Paolo Mantegazza, a doctor who wrote about beaches and the sea as collective salons where people could rest and have fun.\n\nThe group planned more resorts and the urban development of the area between the landing stage of the lagoon side and the sea beach. This area came to be called Santa Maria Elisabetta. The project involved substantial land improvements and drainage on an island which was still largely rural and had areas of bog land and scattered dunes. A water drainage and sewer system was developed. The development was to have hospitality and entertainment facilities, residential areas, roads, gardens, woods, restaurants and cafes. Villas for wealthy bathers were built in Liberty style, the Italian version of [[Art Nouveau]]. The number of bathers increased from 60,000 in 1871 to 80,000 in 1872 to 160,000 in 1883.The number of small rooms for bathers increased to 600. They were equipped with facilities for seawater therapy with the spraying of rarefied water with compressed air.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 119, 124-25</ref>\n\nIn 1873 a steam navigation company was established. This was the birth of the Venetian waterbus, the service for the  transport of people around the lagoon. It used steamboats which were smaller than the military one which had been used and thus allowed more frequent journeys. With regard to Lido, compared to oar boats, it shortened the time needed to reach Santa Maria Elisabetta from San Zaccaria (near St Mark's Square) dramatically, from one hour to ten minutes. In 1881 a regular time table with services every half an hour between 6 am and 12 pm was introduced. It entered into operation in 1882. In 1898 the Municipality of Venice took over the Grand Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta and widened it to 17 m to allow for a single-track horse-drawn tramway. The Bathing Resort Society was given permission to set this up in 1889 s up. It replaced the omnibus.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 126-27</ref>\n\n1885 a low-cost bathing resort for the lower classes with 150 small rooms was established. In 1887 and 1888 the bathing resort was expanded again and an electricity power plant was built. The first beach huts were installed for bathing and for \"air sunlight and sand\" therapy, which was popular among families. This development required the construction of a seafront boulevard. Further urbanisation took place and more villas were built. In 1889 an electric tramway line along the Gran Viale was introduced and from 1892 the Gran Viale had electric lighting during the tourist season. The number of tourists increased from 80,000 in 1872 to 160,000 in 1883.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 130, 32, 33</ref>\n\nThe Ospizio Marino (Sea Nursing Home) opened in 1870. It was a hospital for poor children who suffered from scrofulosis, which affected especially children form deprived backgrounds, who needed [[heliotherapy]]. Experiments conducted in 1842 indicated that what was then called sea therapy was the required treatment. The hospital had 200 beds. It was expanded to 500 beds in 1873. After the opening of the Excelsior Hotel in 1908 it was planned to move the hospital elsewhere to make room next to the hotel and to move the sick away from it. This occurred in the 1920s.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 123-47</ref>\n\nThe lido inlet had not used for navigation since 1724 because this was prevented by frequent sand accumulation. In 1866 the engineer Pietro Paleocapa submitted a plan to build two breakwaters to reopen the inlet, one on its northern shore (Punta Sabbioni) and the other on its southern shore (San Nicol\u00f2). They were to be 3,5&nbsp;km and 2.85&nbsp;km long respectively, extend in the direction of the [[Sirocco|Scirocco]] wind, give the inlet a width of 1&nbsp;km and reach a depth of 8 m. In 1870 studies showed that similar works on the Malamocco inlet has been effective in preventing sand accumulation and that the sand was stopped by the northern breakwater. It accumulated by it. The project was approved in 1871. The works started in 1882. The San Nicol\u00f2 breakwater was the first that was built. The works on both was completed in 1910 with the construction of a 26 m high lighthouse at Punta Sabbioni.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 122-23, 125, 126, 127</ref>\n\nA theatre (Nuovo Teatro del Lido) which had 600 seats opened in 1892. A [[velodrome]] was opened in 1894, but cycling competitions were ended in 1896 due to high running costs. In 1911 it hosted period costume equestrian tournament which attracted a big crowd.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 133-34, 150</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe expansion of the bathing resorts and of the urbanisation of the Santa Maria Elisabetta area continued. From 1900 to 1920 some 50 villas were built. In 1904 a horse-riding school was established. Over the decades it held several international contests and two world cups. The planning for a boulevard to connect Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta to San Nicol\u00f2 started in 1905. An aquarium was opened next to the theatre in 1909. Both were later demolished.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 139, 140, 148</ref>\n\nLido also became an island of grand hotels. The Grand Hotel Lido, in Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta, the square in front of the landing stage, was opened in 1900. It was demolished in the 1970s. In the same year the famous [[Grand Hotel des Bains]] was opened.<ref>http://www.historichotelsthenandnow.com/bainsvenicelido.html Historic Hotels - Hotel des Bains</ref> The Hungaria Palace Hotel, later called Grand Hotel Ausonia & Hungaria, opened in 1907. It had 82 rooms furnished by Eugenio Quarti, a famous Milan furniture maker nicknamed prince of the ''ebanisti'' (carpenters who work with ebony). A [[maiolica]] [[mosaic]] with Renaissance motifs interpreted in liberty style \nwhich made the hotel very distinctive was installed on its facade between 1914 and 1916.<ref>Speziali A., Diletto e armonia.

Two flights from Venice to this beach were arranged later in the year. The last one attracted many people who paid tickets to get on the terrace of the hotel and crowded it. There was a lottery draw whose prize was a tour on the plane. More such flights were then organised. This helped to attract attention to the hotel. In 1914 the owner of the Excelsior opened a fun fair which was extremely successful. However, it was dismantled the next year because of WW I. Another one was opened in 1932 but it suffered the same fate because of WW II.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 149-50, 152-53, 181-82</ref>\n\nIn 1919 woks started on a staircase to a votive temple (built between 1925 and 1928) dedicated to the Madonna of Victory and built for the remembrance of the fallen soldiers of WW I. The bodies of 3700 soldiers are kept here.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 159-60</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s seaplanes became the next technological advance. A Frenchman organised an international competition, the Schneider International Cup, from 1920 to 1931. It was held at Lido in 1920, 1921 and 1927. It was extremely popular.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 161</ref>\n\nIn 1919 it was decided that the ''Ospizio Marino'' (see above) was to remain open permanently and not just in the summer. Between 1922 and 1926 a new site for the hospital was built in the La Favorita area. It was now opened to adults as well. The centre for rehabilitation for children with rickets merged with this hospital in 1924. The Ospizio developed [[balneotherapy]] (bathing therapy) psammotherapy (hot sand baths) and sun therapy. In 1933 it was renamed ''Ospedale al Mare'' (Hospital at the Sea). It became a hospital of specialised excellence and the foremost [[thalassotherapy]] (the use of seawater for therapy) centre in Italy. In 1933 a church was opened in this complex.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 123-24, 167-8, 182</ref>\n\nIn 1920 the Grand Hotel Company (CIGA) built a bagno popolare (low-cost bathing resort) and gave the municipality a large square to create a public playground. In 1923 another bagno popolare (later called zone A) was established next to the Ospizio Marino.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 161, 169</ref>\n\nThe Nicelli airport was developed during WW I for the defence of Venice. In 1926 it was converted to civilian use with the construction of a terminal. The first light was to Vienna and carried four passengers. By 1931 there were six routes. In 1935 a second terminal was built. By 1939 there were 23,285 passengers. The major European airlines operated here and the airport was the second most important one in Italy after Rome. During  WW II much of its equipment was confiscated by the Germans, who also tried to destroy it. Operations resumed after the war. However, with the advent of bigger jet planes, the runway became too short. In 1961 the new [[Venice Marco Polo Airport]] was opened. The Nicelli airport only handled small private planes and hosted a school for pilots and parachutists. In 1994 the municipality of Venice set up a management firm to the restore the airport and relaunch economic activity in the area.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 173-75, 221</ref>\n\nIn 1930 the golf course at Alberoni was inaugurated. It was said that [[Henry Ford]] had been disappointed that Lido did not have a golf course. The area at the southern end of the island, which had sand dunes (sand would provide good drainage), trees and a former military fort and stables was chosen. Originally it had 9 holes. It was extended to 18 holes in 1951. The course is 6&nbsp;km long. It hosted Italian opens in 1955, 1960 and 1974.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 178-79</ref>\n\nOn 15\u201316 June 1934 Hitler went to Venice to meet Mussolini. He stayed at the Grand Hotel in Venice and Mussolini stayed at the Grand Hotel Excelsior. The two men met at the golf club at Alberoni.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 182</ref>\n\nVenice was the first city in the world to have a publicly owned and regulated casino. It opened in 1638. However, it was closed in 1774. In 1938 the casino (Palazzo del Casin\u00f2) at Lido was opened. This marked the return of legal gambling in Venice. It became a summer casino in 1946, when a winter venue was opened in Venice in what is now Ca\u2019 Vendramin Calergi, formerly the last residence of Richard Wagner, who died there. The Palazzo del Casin\u00f2 at Lido was closed in the 1990s when a new casino was opened at Ca\u2019 Noghera in the mainland.<ref>https://casino.gioconews.it/cronaca/40599-una-serenissima-casa-da-gioco Casa da Gioco</ref><ref>http://www.arte.it/guida-arte/venezia/da-vedere/monumento/ex-casin\u00f2-del-lido-5776 Ex casin\u00f2 del Lido</ref>\n\nIn 1946 and 1947 a motor race was held at the Lido circuit to relaunch tourism. [[Tazio Nuvolari]] came third in the second race. Lido hosted the road cycling world championship in 1952 and track cycling world championship in 1962. In the latter year the ice rink was opened. Prior to that the rich skated at an inner terrace of the Excelsior Hotel and the non-rich skated at a small garden by the casino.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 191-2, 193-94</ref> \n \nIn the 1960s, the improving post-war Italian economy created a real-estate boom in the island and many Venetians moved to Lido to benefit from its modern infrastructure.\n\n== The Venice Film Festival ==\n{{main | Venice Film Festival}}\n[[File:66\u00e8me Festival de Venise (Mostra) Palais du Cinema.jpg|thumb|253x253px| [[66th Venice International Film Festival|66th Venice Int. Film Festival]] on the Lido.]]\n\nLido di Venezia is home to the [[Venice International Film Festival]] <small>([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Mostra Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica della Biennale di Venezia'', \"International Exhibition of Cinematographic Art of the [[Venice Biennale]]</small>\"). It is the world's oldest film festival and one of the three most prestigious ones, together with the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>Anheier, H.K., Juergensmeyer M., eds., Encyclopedia of Global Studies, 2012, p. 566. Cannes, Venice, and Berlin\u2014still hold the most prestigious status as cultural institutions that officially endorse the aesthetic and cinematic values of movies and critical currencies of film directors.</ref> These are sometimes called the \"Big Three\".<ref>Bordwell, D. (2005). Figures Traced in Light: On Cinematic Staging, 2005, p. 144. Because reputations were made principally on the festival circuit, the filmmaker had to find international financing and distribution and settle for minor festivals before arriving at one of the Big Three (Berlin, Cannes, Venice).</ref>\n\nThe film festival started in 1932. It was the idea of the then chair of the [[Venice Biennale]] who was worried about a decline in tourism at Lido due to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and understood that cinema could help to alleviate this. It was successful. The prince [[Umberto di Savoia]], the wife of the [[Prince of Wales]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Henry Ford]] and film stars such as [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Clark Gable]] attended. Forty films form six countries were shown on the terrace of the Excelsior hotel. No awards were given, but an audience referendum chose which films and performances were the most praiseworthy.\n\nThe second festival was held in 1934. It was meant to be a biennial event but it became annual because of the success of the first one. There were some 20 awards, but there was no jury. Premiers were shown, which increased the prestige of the festival. So did a scandal caused by a [[Gustav Machaty]]'s [[Ecstasy (film)|Ecstasy]] which showed the first scenes with a female nude in cinema history, which also launched the career of the actress [[Hedy Lamarr|Hedy Lammarr]]. This time the films were shown in the garden of the Excelsior hotel. In 1937 the venue of the festival was opened. It is the Palazzo del Cinema.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 180, 182-83, 185</ref>\n\nIn 1939 the fascist government imposed the assignation of the awards to two propaganda films, a fascist one and a Nazi one. Because of this the Americans boycotted the 1940 festival. The 1940-41-42 editions are not listed as part of the festival because the government assumed total control of the screening of films and chose films from the \u201cRome-Berlin\u201d axis. These festival were screened at two cinemas in Venice because the film hall was requisitioned. In 1943-45 the festival was suspended because of the war. It resumed in 1946. However, the French wanted their new festival, the  [[Cannes Film Festival]], to start at the same time as he Venice one. After negotiations it was decided that Cannes would run in the spring and Venice would start later, in late August. In 1946 and 1947 the festival was held in Venice because the film hall was requisitioned, this time by the American army. In the latter year the screenings took place at the [[Doge\u2019s Palace]]. The festival returned o Lido in 1948. An arena for outdoors screenings was built outside the film hall. In 1949 the festival\u2019s award, which was called International Great Prize of Venice, was renamed St. Mark\u2019s Lion Prize. Later it was called the Golden Lion.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 188, 189, 191, 192</ref>\n\nThe Lido has also hosted numerous film-shoots. In 1971 the film [[Death in Venice (film)|''Death in Venice'']] <small>(''Morte a Venezia'')</small> directed by [[Luchino Visconti]], starring [[Dirk Bogarde]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen]], and based on the [[Death in Venice]] novel published in 1912 by [[Thomas Mann]] was screened.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/death-venice-arthouse Death in Venice: No 14 best arthouse film of all time]</ref> Both the novel and the film were set at lido and the [[Grand Hotel des Bains]], where Thomas Mann stayed with his wife and brother in the summer of 1911.  The novel was also turned into the [[Death in Venice (opera)|Death in Venice opera]] by Benjamin Britten (his last opera) in 1973 and a ballet by John Neumeier in 2003.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/arts/dance/09hamb.html Thomas Mann Dances to the Strains of Bach and Wagner]</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe term [[Lido]], which originates from this island, forms the first part of the name of many seaside resorts in Italy and is used to refer to certain types of outdoor swimming pools, especially in [[Great Britain]]. It also the origin of the name \"Lido deck\" on a [[cruise ship]].\n\nThe British travel writer [[Robin Saikia]] has written a literary history, ''The Venice Lido'', which covers aspects of the island's history from its early days to the present day, published by [http://blueguides.com/all/?display=book&key=205 Blue Guides].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"225px\" heights=\"187px\">\nFile:A view of Piazzale S.M.

The [[Venice Film Festival]] takes place at the Lido  late August/early September.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajhU1AAacUsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Frommer's 500 Extraordinary Islands | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | date=Jan 14, 2010 | accessdate=1 December 2013 | author=Hughes, Holly | pages=5}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Lido island is one of the two [[barrier islands]] of the Lagoon of Venice, the other is [[Pellestrina]]. They form the central part of the coastline of the lagoon on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The  peninsula of [[Cavallino-Treporti|Cavallino]]/Punta Sabbioni forms the northern part and the peninsula of [[Sottomarina]] forms the southern part. The sea has access to the lagoon through three inlets between the islands and between the islands and the peninsulas. At the northern end of Lido there is the Lido inlet which separates it from Cavallino/Punta Sabbioni and at the southern end there is the Malamocco inlet which separates it from Pellestrina.<ref>[http://cigno.atlantedellalaguna.it/maps/7/view Atlas of the Lagoon]</ref> These two inlets have been dredged to a greater depth to allow big ships through. The Malamocco inlet is the deepest one and is used by container ships and oil tankers to reach the commercial and industrial port of [[Marghera]]. The Lido inlet is the widest one (c.1&nbsp;km) and is used by cruise ships to reach Venice.\n\nLido is a long and narrow island which gets wider in its northern tract. At least half the seaward coast has sandy beaches. Much of the beach at the town of Lido belongs to various hotels. There are large public beaches towards the northern and southern ends.\n\nThe island is home to a town and a village. The town is in the north. It is also called Lido (population 15128 in 2019<ref name = portale>[https://portale.comune.venezia.it/millefoglie/statistiche/home Portale comune Venezia]</ref>). Its neighbourhoods are San Nicol\u00f2, Santa Maria Elisabetta, on the lagoon side coast (the landing stage for the Venice ferry is in the former and the one for the water bus is in the latter), and Quattro Fontane and La Favorita, on the seaward coast. It developed in the 19th century as a tourist centre, both as a leisure seaside resort and as a [[balneotherapy]] resort. It has many 19th century villas built in [[Liberty style]] (the Italian version of [[Art Nouveau]]) and many hotels. It is famous for being the seat of the [[Venice Film Festival]] and for its grand hotels, such as the [[Grand Hotel des Bains]], the Hotel Excelsior.<ref>[https://famoushotels.org/hotels/excelsior-lido-Venice Famous hotels]</ref> and the Hotel Ausonia & Hungaria <ref>[http://www.historichotelsthenandnow.com/ausoniahungariavenicelido.html Historic Hotels Now]</ref> which have hosted celebrities,  artists and writers, major businessmen, politicians and royalties. The  Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta (27 m wide and c. 700 m long) crosses the town from coast to coast and links the water bus landing stage to the beach.\n\nThe village of [[Malamocco]] (with a population of 1030 as of 2019)<ref name=portale/> is on the lagoon side coast, in the central-southern part of the island. From the 12th century to the 19th century it was the only significant settlement on the island. It was built after the settlement of Metamaucum, which had been the second capital of the [[Duchy of Venetia]], was submerged by a storm surge.\n\nAt the southern end of the islands there is Alberoni, an area of sand dunes. It has Venice's golf course<ref>[https://www.1golf.eu/en/club/circolo-golf-venezia/ Circolo Golf Venezia]</ref> and the Alberoni Dune Oasis which has one of the largest and best-preserved dune systems on the coasts of the Northern Adriatic Sea, with dunes up to 10 meters high, a large, c. 30 [[hectares]], pine forest and unique species of flora and fauna.<ref>[http://www.veniceandlagoon.net/web/en/itineraries/nature/alberoni-dunes-and-ca-roman/Alberoni Dunes]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Metamaucum===\n[[Malamocco|Metamaucum]] was one of the earliest settlements in the [[Lagoon of Venice]]. Its origins dated back to the Roman days. It became the second ducal seat of the [[duchy of Venetia]] (before the rise of Venice) when [[Teodato Ipato]] (742-55), the second [[doge]], transferred it from Heraclea, to 811, when the doge [[Agnello Participazio]] (811-27) moved it to Rivoalto. It was temporarily occupied by [[Pepin of Italy]] when he tried to invade the lagoon in 810. It was destroyed by the doge [[Giovanni I Participazio]] (829\u2013836) when he suppressed a rebellion based in Metamaucum. The settlement continued to be inhabited, but it was a shadow of its former self. Its decadence reached its peak when its priory was moved to the island of [[Murano]] (1080), the S.S. Leone e Basso nuns moved to the island of [[San Servolo]] (1109) and its [[dioceses]] was moved to Chioggia between 1107 and 1110. In 1116 it was submerged as a result of an exceptional storm surge. According to the tradition, Metamaucum was on the seashore of the Lido island, rather than on its lagoon shore.\n\nA new settlement was built on the lagoon shore of Lido, close to where Metamaucum had been. The existence of a Metamaucum Nova, which corresponds to today's Malamocco, was first attested in 1107.<ref>Lanfranchi, L., Zille, G.,  Il territorio del Ducato Veneziano dall'VIII al XII secolo, in  Storia di Venezia, 1958, pp. 27-28</ref>\n\n===Military island===\nUntil the 19th century Lido's main role was a military one for the defence of  the lagoon as it lies by the lido inlet, the widest point of entry of the lagoon and the one which is closest to Venice. It continued to have a military tole until WW II. Prior to the 19th century it was also a scarcely populated island. In 1820 Lido has 814 inhabitants, 662 of whom lived in Malamocco, and 152 lived in San   Nicol\u00f2.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 99</ref>\n\nIn 600 a lookout tower was built at San Nicol\u00f2, at the northern end of Lido, on its lagoon side shore, to monitor enemy ships, particularly pirate ships, approaching the lagoon at the Lido inlet. In 1100 it was strengthened and developed into a fort under the doge [[Vitale I Michiel]] (1096-1102). This fort was later called Castel Vecchio (Old Castle).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 28</ref>\n\nIn 1229 crossbow shooting ranges were created in areas of Venice for weekly exercises by men between the ages of 16 and 35. In 1229 a shooting range was established at San Nicol\u00f2. It hosted shooting contests at Christmas and Easter to make the exercises more interesting. Infantry, cavalry, and artillery units were also stationed in the area and foundries for armaments and munitions were built where the Jewish cemetery was later set up. In 1304 a militia was instituted. The sailing to Lido was also turned into a contest. The men rowed to the island on boats (called ganzaruoli) with 30-40 oarsmen boats which competed over who would get there first. This is the origin of the word regatta. The only establishment that sold wine at San Nicol\u00f2 was closed during the contests. A lighthouse was also built close to the shooting range. A permanent garrison was set up.  It served as rest area for troops which needed to briefly stop by. Wells to supply freshwater to ships that left the city were built.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 60, 64-65</ref>\n\nIn the mid-14th century tensions between Venice and the [[Republic of Genoa]] escalated due to their rivalry over supremacy of the naval routes and trading ports in the eastern Mediterranean . 1318. San Nicol\u00f2 was bombed several times by a Genoese fleet.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 62</ref>\n\nIn 1335 the Gagiandra (turtle in Venetian) was built. It was a platform for artillery which was placed in the Lido channel which went from the Lido inlet to Venice. It was broad and tapered at the stern and bow. It was covered by a metal plate which acted  as a shield. The canons were sticking out of this shield. This gave it the appearance of the head, tail and legs of a turtle. The platform was placed between the Castel Vecchio (Old Castle) at San Nicol\u00f2 and the Castel Novo (New Castle) on the [[Vignole]] island. These two islands and the island of Certosa formed the shores of the channel. An iron chain was placed across the channel. It was supported by the Gagiandra and two rafts placed midway between the \"turtle\" and the two shores. The chain was kept close to the surface of the water to prevent enemy ships to pass above it.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 64-65</ref>\n\nIn 1379 Genoa attacked the lagoon in the [[War of Chioggia]] (1379\u201380). Two towers were built as platforms for crossbows and cannons at the Castel Vecchio and Novo forts (on the Lido and Vignole islands) on the two sides of the Lido channel, to further protect the entrance to the lagoon. Small boats which were chained together were placed between the two towers. Between them there were three ships with archers covered with fresh hides to protect them from fire. A ditch and earthen rampant strengthened with stone were created to protect the S. Nicol\u00f3 abbey. Eventually Venice won the war.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 66-6</ref>\n\nIn 1409 an admiralty was established at S. Nicol\u00f2. 1520 The [[Council of Ten]] build a building to house its offices and barracks for its officers who were entrusted with monitoring Lido, its fortresses, its inlet and the way the sea changed its beaches. This was called the Casa Rossa (Red House).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp.70, 78</ref>\n \nIn the 16th century, with the Turkish conquests in south-eastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, which were a threat to the Venetian dominion in that part of the Mediterranean the Turks were also considered a threat to Venice itself.\n\nBetween 1543 and 1549 Castel Novo, on the Vignole island, was developed into the Sant\u2019Andrea fort. Between 1546 and 1574 Castel Novo at San Nicol\u00f2 was developed into the San Nicol\u00f2 fort. Between 1569 and 1574 the latter was strengthened with a triple ditch. Artillery was placed on the seaward side. There were no batteries on the lagoon side in case the fortress was seized and the cannons would be used against the Sant\u2019Andrea fort. The fort became a complex with the military headquarter of the [[Republic of Venice]]. The whole area became a c. 521 m long fortified citadel stretching along the lagoon coast with brick barriers and bastions, a dike and an earthen fore wall. It was later was extended towards the sea with angular barriers, six gates and underground exits on the sea beach side, towards the entrance to the Lido inlet. Inside the new fortification there were the old San Nicol\u00f2 church and its convent and the adjacent Palazzo dei dieci/Casa Rossa at the back. In 1572 an Istrian stone bridge that looked like a triumphal arch over the dock was built to provide access to the citadel.\n\nLarge barracks for the troops, known as Saraglio, Quartier Grando or Palazzo dei Soldati (Stronghold, Large Quarters or Building of the Soldiers) were built between 1591 and 1594. It was an imposing building which provided lodgings for 2000 soldiers. It was the first true barracks in Europe, the first instance in which troops were lodged in peacetime. It was an important step towards the creation of a modern army as opposed to a mercenary army or a militia. It was built on the location where the crusaders had gathered before setting off for the fourth crusade. From 1600 the barracks hosted the Fanti da Mar (Infantrymen of the Sea), the first amphibian troops in history, a sort of precursor of today\u2019s marines.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 28-29, 83-84</ref>\n\nIn 1571 it was decided to build octagonal forts for artillery batteries on islets off the lagoon side shore of Lido. They were the Ottagono Campana (later called Abbandonato, abandoned octagon),  between Malamocco and Alberoni (off the southern end of the Lido island) and the Ottagono Alberoni, by Alberoni and the northern end of the Malamocco inlet, the other point of access into the lagoon, where ships could turn towards Venice. The Ottagono di Poveglia (further north, on the Poveglia island, off Malamocco) acted as a reinforcement for the other two octagons further south. Two octagons were built off the [[Pellestrina]] island, the Ottagono San Pietro, at the northern end of the island and the southern end of the Malamocco inlet and the Ottagono Caroman, at the southern end of Pellestrina to guard the Chioggia inlet, the third entry point of the lagoon. In 1572, 75 artillery were supplied for the San Nicol\u00f2 fort and 56 for Sant\u2019Andrea.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 83-84</ref>\n\nSan Nicol\u00f2 was also where the soldiers and the ships for Venice\u2019s naval expeditions in the Adriatic Sea and the rest of the Mediterranean Sea gathered and set off from. Some of these were:\n\nIn 1000 the doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]] (991-1099) set off for a mission to [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] which freed the northern Adriatic from the [[Narentine]] pirates. In 1099, 207 ships set off at the end of the first crusade to help the crusaders to consolidate their conquests. It defeated a fleet of their Genoese rivals off [[Rhodes]]. In 1124 a fleet sets off to free the [[King of Jerusalem]] who had been imprisoned in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Lebanon]]. It had 108 vessels, 40 galleys 40 supply ships and 28 ships with rams. It besieged and seized Tyre. In 1171 A fleet set off for a battle against the emperor Byzantine Emmanuel Kommenos who had the Venetians in Constantinople arrested. The fleet was defeated more by the plague that the Byzantines, who were was joined by the rival maritime republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]]. In 1202 the crusaders of the fourth crusade gathered at Lido in preparation to be taken to the East by Venetian ships. In 1690 Francesco Morosini set off for a campaign in the Peloponnese. He was elected as doge while away. He was met at Lido by the abbot while the senators waited for him of the Bucintoro, the ceremonial boat of the doge. In 1784 there was a punitive expedition against the Barbary pirates.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 50, 54, 55, 58, 94, 100</ref>\n\n===Pope, emperor and the Peace of Venice===\nThe emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa|Frederick I, Barbarossa]] (reigned 1155-1190) conducted six military campaigns in Italy, which was under his [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Originally he wanted to confront the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in the south. However, his intervention in Italy was opposed by several Italian cities, particularly [[Milan]], which he had partially destroyed during his second campaign. A dispute with [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159-1181) developed because Frederick endorsed [[Antipope Victor IV (1159\u20131164)|antipope Victor IV]], who had been elected in opposition to Alexander. Opposition against Frederick in northern Italy grew and the [[Lombard League]], a league formed by several cities, fought him. Frederick was defeated at the [[Battle of Legnano]] in 1176. Preliminary peace negotiations took place at [[Anagni]] (the Peace of Anagni) in 1176.<ref>Davis, R. H. C. A History of Medieval Europe, 1957, p.332 et seq.</ref>  Negotiations involving all the concerned parties to reach a formal peace treaty took place in Venice where a conference was scheduled for July 1177. The [[doge]] [[Sebastiano Ziani]] (1172\u201378) was to act as an intermediary.\n\nThe pope arrived in Venice in 10 May 1177. Negotiations with the Lombard League and the king of Sicily started but they were taking a hard stance. Frederick was not allowed to go to Venice and waited for news in Ravenna. A pro-Frederick faction in Venice encouraged Frederick to come to Venice in defiance of the veto, but the emperor declined to do so without the doge\u2019s approval. Because of internal pressure, Ziani hesitated. The envoys of the League left Venice for [[Treviso]] in protest. The head of the Sicilian delegation threatened to leave and said that his king would take revenge on Venice breach of faith. This would have meant retaliation against Venetian traders in Sicily. The doge confirmed that Frederick would be allowed to enter Venice only after this received papal approval.\n\nThis situation highlighted the danger of a breakdown in the talks and negotiations proceeded more rapidly. On 23 July the agreement was completed. At the pope request, Venetian ships went to [[Chioggia]] to pick up the emperor, who was taken to Lido. Four cardinals went there to meet him there. Frederick recognised Alexander as the rightful pope and could now be allowed to enter Venice. Doge Ziani went to meet him at San Nicol\u00f2 and took him to Venice with great pomp. A ceremony was held at St. Mark\u2019s basilica.<ref>Norwich, J. J., A History of Venice, 2003, pp. 111-16</ref>\n\n===The Wedding to the Sea===\nIn 1000 the doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]] (991-1099) set off for a mission to [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] which freed the northern Adriatic from the [[Narentine]] pirates. Istria and Dalmatia accepted Venice's [[suzerainty]]. To celebrate this the Venetians celebrated with the ''Benedictio del Mare'' (Blessing of the Sea) ceremony,  which was held annually until 1177. In that year, after Venice's mediation which led to the Peace of Venice, it was replaced by the ''Sposalizio col Mare'' (Wedding with the Sea) .\n\nIn this ceremony the doge sailed for Lido on the bucintoro (the doge's ceremonial ship) with the top clergy, the top officials of the [[Republic of Venice]] and ambassadors. This was followed by a  large number of Venetians on various kinds of vessels. It was a festive parade. Between Lido and the Sant'Andrea fort (see above), where the [[Lagoon of Venice]] meets the [[Adriatic Sea]], the doge took a golden ring which pope Alexander III had donated him. He then threw it into the sea. It was attached to a string so that it can be retrieved. The doge then recited \"We marry thee, oh sea, in a sign of eternal domination.\" The ceremony ended in 1797 when the Republic fell with its conquest by Napoleon. It was performed on the first Sunday after [[ascension day]].\n\nThe ceremony and [[f\u00eate]] was performed again in 1965 and in 1988. The latter was an initiative by private citizens and cultural and sport associations which wanted to relaunch the celebrations.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 55-56, 202, 215</ref> The ceremony became permanent and is now led by the mayor of Venice\n\nThe ceremony was also associated with the ''Festa della Sensa'' (F\u00eate of Ascension). In 1180 it developed into the ''Fiera della Sensa'' (Ascension [[Fair]]). There were acrobats, jugglers and minstrels in all the streets of Venice. There was a large market in [[St. Mark's Square (Venice)|St. Mark's Square]]. From 1307 the market had especially prepared stands which over time became increasingly decoratively elaborate. Goods of all kinds and from all over the world were displayed.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46, 56</ref>\n\n===Murazzi===\nThe engineer Bernardo Zendrini found that [[pozzolana]] mixed with chalk and sand was an efficient water-resistant binder. In 1737 he built a 2.5 m long test wall near Malamocco. Three years later it had withstood two winter storm surges (one of which had been one of the worst) without damage. This lead to the building of the murazzi, imposing walls made with large blocks of [[Istrian stone]] to form a continuous sea defence on the barrier island of Pellestrina. Later murazzi were built at Lido as well, but here they were discontinuous. A previously unknown 350 m long test wall brought was to light by the seaward shore in 1980. It lies 380 from the sea.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 97</ref> This is because after the construction of the breakwater at San Nicol\u00f2 (see below), sand has been accumulating on the sea shore in the northern part of the island, widening the beach.\n\n===Churches, monasteries convents and saints===\nIn 887 the male Benedictine monastery of  San Cipriano was founded in Malamocco on the initiative of doge [[Giovanni II Participazio]]. This was followed by the female monastery of Santi Leone and Basso. In 1108 San Cipriano was abandoned due to damage caused by the sea and daily ground collapses. The friars moved to the [[Murano]] island and set up a new monastery of S. Cipriano. In 1109, for the same reason, the nuns moved to a convent on the [[San Servolo]] island vacated by Benedictine monks who had moved to the monastery of Sant'Ilario near Fusina.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 42, 53</ref>\n\nIn 1045 the doge Domenico Contarini I (1043\u201371), the [[Patriarch of Grado]] and the bishop of  Olivolo founded the church and convent of San Nicol\u00f2. The works for the church  were completed in 1064. In 1053, the management of the church and convent was handed to the abbot of the [[Benedictine]] monastery of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]]. In 1098 some of relics three of saints from [[Myra]] (now [[Demre]]), west of the [[Chelidonia (islands)|Chelidonia]] cape, [[Lydia]], on the southern coast of what is now [[Turkey]], were smuggled by a naval squadron which returned form the first crusade and placed in the San Nicol\u00f2 church. The saints were  Nicol\u00f2 Major, his uncle Nicol\u00f2 Minor and Theodoros. The church, which was small, was enlarged in 1134 and urns with the relics were moved from the crypt and put in three niches by the main altar. Between 1626 and 1634 the church was demolished and rebuilt, together with the bell tower, using material from the old church. In 1770 the Benedictines moved to San Giorgio Maggiore island because a 1768 law closed confraternities with less than 12 monks or friars. The building became a military quarter. The church remained open for worship. In 1938 it was granted to Franciscan friars.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 46-50, 52, 62, 90-91, 100, 187</ref>\n\nThe first record of the Abbey of San Leonardo between Alberoni and Malamocco dates to 1111. It was destroyed by fire, along with the whole of the Malamocco coast, during the [[War of Chioggia]] (1379\u201380). In 1407 there was a bequest for the rebuilding of the monastery. The church was rebuilt with funds from the [[patriarch of Venice]]. The church merged with the San Camillo hospital in 1928 and was demolished to enlarge the hospital.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 53-54</ref>\n\nIn 1557 the parish church of Santa Maria Assunta church in Malamocco was rebuilt on top of old one, which dated to the 11th century.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 81</ref>\n\nIn 1620 there was a request to build a church at Lido to replace the unauthorised oratory of Beata Vergine Visitante Santa Elisabetta (Blessed Visiting Virgin St. Elizabeth) to the south of San Nicol\u00f2, which was built by the locals because they found it difficult to reach their parish church of [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]] on the island with the same name.\nIn 1627 the construction of the new church, now called Santa Maria Elisabetta, on top of the old oratory was completed. The patriarch of Venice granted it the title of parish church. It was the second parish church of Lido, after Santa Maria Assunta in Malamocco. In 19th century, when the area became built up, it was named after this church.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 88-91</ref>\n\n===Jewish and protestant cemeteries===\nIn 1386 the Jews were granted a plot of uncultivated land to develop the Jewish cemetery. The friars of the San Nicol\u00f2 convent were opposed to this and claimed that they owned the land. A few years later to resolve this, the Jews paid a token rent. Consent was given and burials started in 1389. A protestant cemetery was opened close to the Jewish one in 1674.  A very small catholic cemetery was opened in 1866 in front of the entrance of the Jewish one. In 1916 it was replaced by a new one. A new Jewish cemetery was also built. Its monumental  entrance was completed in 1923. As a result, the Catholic cemetery lies between the old and new Jewish cemeteries.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 67-68, 94, 157, 168</ref>\n\n===19th century===\nThe accumulation of sand carried by the sea at the Malamocco and Lido inlets made their navigability problematic. During second Napoleonic occupation (1806\u201314), it was decided to build breakwaters on the southern and northern shore of the Malamocco inlet. The latter was to be built at Alberoni, on the southern tip of Lido. However, the works were not completed due to the second Austrian occupation (1814\u201348). The Austrians disagreed with the French plans. The project was entrusted to the engineer Pietro Paleocapa. Works at Alberoni started in 1838 and were completed in 1845. Works on the southern breakwater at Santa Maria del Mare, on the [[Pellestrina]] island, started in 1853 and were completed in 1856. The object of the northern breakwater to keep the coastal current at bay and trap the sand it carried. That of the southern one was to channel the receding low tide water to make the inlet deeper through the force of the exit current.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 107-8, 115, 116, 118</ref>\n\nIn the late 18th century and in the 19th century, a number of poets and writers wrote about Lido. This made Lido an attractive destination for people from the European elites in their then fashionable  journeys in Italy.  In 1786 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], the German poet and scientist, visited Lido and wrote about his experience there in this book about his journey in Italy. [[Lord Byron]] spent five years (1816\u201321) in Venice and liked to ride his horses at Lido from a hut he rented at Alberoni. In 1818 he was visited by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. The two spent a couple of days at Lido. Shelley wrote a poem about this. Since Byron was a celebrity, this attracted tourists who hoped to meet the poet or get a glimpse of him at Lido.<ref>Saikia, R., The Venice Lido: A Blue Guide Travel Monograph (e-Edition), ch.4</ref> In 1830 [[James Fenimore Cooper]], the author of [[The Last of the Mohicans]], visited and described Lido and used Venice as the background for his novel [[The Bravo]]. In 1841 [[John Ruskin]], the art critic who wrote about Venice and her art, also wrote about Lido. Other people who visited Lido and described it were and the French poet [[Theophile Gautier]], in 1850, [[Herman Melville]], the American novelist and poet, in 1857, and [[Hyppolyte Taine]], the French critic and historian, in 1864. Henry James first arrived in Venice in 1869. He went to Lido 14 times. He wrote about Venice in some of his novels and one of them was set in Venice. The British poet and playwright [[Robert Browning]] went to Lido in 1888 and died in Venice nearly two months later.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 101-2, 112, 113, 116, 117, 120, 123, 132</ref>\n\n[[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Frederick William]], the [[Duke of Brunswick]] (1771-1815) bought a plot of land at Lido, intending it to have his holiday home there. From 1879 queen [[Margherita of Savoy]] took her sickly son [[Victor Emmanuel III]], the heir to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] on holiday at Lido, at the [[sea bathing]] facility of La Favorita. A royal chalet was arranged for her.<ref>Farina F., Architetture balneari tra Europa e Americhe nella Belle \u00e9poque, 2001, p. 10</ref>  In those days there was the belief that sea bathing had a curative or therapeutic value.\n\nTommaso Rima, a doctor at Venice\u2019s hospital, believed that bathing in the lagoon had therapeutic benefits for nervous illnesses, scrofulosis,<ref>A form of tuberculosis, most common in children, tending to cause enlarged and degenerated lymph nodes, especially in the neck, and often chronic, intractable skin inflammation as well, Wiktionary</ref> rickets and skin disorders. In 1833 he set up a floating bathing facility  at [[Punta della Dogana]], opposite [[St Mark's Square (Venice)|St Mark\u2019s]]. It consisted of two big rafts which created a pool with a grate at the bottom and which could be reassembled in the summer. There was a caf\u00e9 and one could sunbathe. The idea of bathing therapy caught on. Gondolas were adapted for the purpose and inns set up pools with water drawn for the nearby canals which was warmed up. There was an idea that this kind of bathing in the Venetian winter was particularly therapeutic. In 1857 a booklet about this notion published.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 114-15</ref>\n\nThe Lido\u2019s potential for tourism did not go unnoticed. In 1852 there was a proposal to set up two [[spa]]s, one on the lagoon shore and one on the sea shore, but it was then thought that the lagoon water was less pure. In 1855 De la Hante, a Frenchman, set up a bathing resort in the La Favorita area, which was named after the villa of the [[archduke Maximillian of Austria]] (1832-1867) the brother of the emperor who was in charge of the Austrian dominions in northern Italy (1815\u201359) and spent some of his time in Venice. The resort had 70 rooms. In 1872 De la Hante bought the archduke\u2019s villa to convert it into a restaurant, caf\u00e9, casino and 70 rooms for an exclusive beach resort. However, he then sold it to the Lido Bathing Resort Society (see below).<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 118, 124</ref>\n\nIn 1857 Giovanni Busetto, nicknamed Fisola, also opened a seaside resort. This consisted of wooden cabins on pilings over the beach with a common central area and two wings with 15 small rooms each. Separate cabins for the lower classes were planned. It was demolished by the Austrians in 1859 due to the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against Austrian domination in northern Italy. In 1867, after Venice became part of Italy, the resort was reopened and expanded but was destroyed by a storm surge. It was reopened and expanded again in 1870. From 1867 to 1871 the number of bathers increased from 30 to 60 thousand.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 118-19</ref>\n\nIn 1857 a summer shuttle service to and from Venice was set up. It consisted of large boats with four oarsmen which could carry 16 passengers. In 1858 the road from the church of Santa Maria Elisabetta, which was by the landing stage in the lagoon coast and lead to the seacoast, was widened and made suitable for vehicle traffic. It eventually came to be called Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta (or just Gran Viale). It was widened again in 1888 and a horse-drawn [[Horsebus|omnibus]] which took tourists to the beach along the Gran Viale entered into service. In the same year the military steamship Alnoch, which could carry up to 200 passengers, was made available for linking Lido with Venice during the tourist season from 6 am to 9 pm. This was then extended to 4 am to 11 pm.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 119-20</ref>\n\nIn 1872 a group of entrepreneurs set up the ''Societ\u00e0 Civile dei Bagni di Lido'' (the Lido Bathing Resort Society). Its aim was to boost Lido's tourism potential. It bought the La Favorita villa, it reduced the number of its room to six to be used by queen Margaret. A large terrace which overlooked the sea was built. It could host 1500 people and had salons, caf\u00e9-restaurants, reading rooms and ballrooms, a telegraph and post office, medical assistance, a chemist and life guards with special lookout posts and boats. The group also wanted to promote sea bathing as a leisure activity as well as a therapeutic one. This idea was expounded by Paolo Mantegazza, a doctor who wrote about beaches and the sea as collective salons where people could rest and have fun.\n\nThe group planned more resorts and the urban development of the area between the landing stage of the lagoon side and the sea beach. This area came to be called Santa Maria Elisabetta. The project involved substantial land improvements and drainage on an island which was still largely rural and had areas of bog land and scattered dunes. A water drainage and sewer system was developed. The development was to have hospitality and entertainment facilities, residential areas, roads, gardens, woods, restaurants and cafes. Villas for wealthy bathers were built in Liberty style, the Italian version of [[Art Nouveau]]. The number of bathers increased from 60,000 in 1871 to 80,000 in 1872 to 160,000 in 1883.The number of small rooms for bathers increased to 600. They were equipped with facilities for seawater therapy with the spraying of rarefied water with compressed air.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 119, 124-25</ref>\n\nIn 1873 a steam navigation company was established. This was the birth of the Venetian waterbus, the service for the  transport of people around the lagoon. It used steamboats which were smaller than the military one which had been used and thus allowed more frequent journeys. With regard to Lido, compared to oar boats, it shortened the time needed to reach Santa Maria Elisabetta from San Zaccaria (near St Mark's Square) dramatically, from one hour to ten minutes. In 1881 a regular time table with services every half an hour between 6 am and 12 pm was introduced. It entered into operation in 1882. In 1898 the Municipality of Venice took over the Grand Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta and widened it to 17 m to allow for a single-track horse-drawn tramway. The Bathing Resort Society was given permission to set this up in 1889 s up. It replaced the omnibus.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 126-27</ref>\n\n1885 a low-cost bathing resort for the lower classes with 150 small rooms was established. In 1887 and 1888 the bathing resort was expanded again and an electricity power plant was built. The first beach huts were installed for bathing and for \"air sunlight and sand\" therapy, which was popular among families. This development required the construction of a seafront boulevard. Further urbanisation took place and more villas were built. In 1889 an electric tramway line along the Gran Viale was introduced and from 1892 the Gran Viale had electric lighting during the tourist season. The number of tourists increased from 80,000 in 1872 to 160,000 in 1883.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 130, 32, 33</ref>\n\nThe Ospizio Marino (Sea Nursing Home) opened in 1870. It was a hospital for poor children who suffered from scrofulosis, which affected especially children form deprived backgrounds, who needed [[heliotherapy]]. Experiments conducted in 1842 indicated that what was then called sea therapy was the required treatment. The hospital had 200 beds. It was expanded to 500 beds in 1873. After the opening of the Excelsior Hotel in 1908 it was planned to move the hospital elsewhere to make room next to the hotel and to move the sick away from it. This occurred in the 1920s.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 123-47</ref>\n\nThe lido inlet had not used for navigation since 1724 because this was prevented by frequent sand accumulation. In 1866 the engineer Pietro Paleocapa submitted a plan to build two breakwaters to reopen the inlet, one on its the northern shore (Punta Sabbioni) and the other on its southern shore (San Nicol\u00f2). They were to be 3,5&nbsp;km and 2.85&nbsp;km long respectively, extend in the direction of the [[Sirocco|Scirocco]] wind, give the inlet a width of 1&nbsp;km and reach a depth of 8 m. In 1870 studies showed that similar works on the Malamocco inlet has been effective in preventing sand accumulation and that the sand was stopped by the northern breakwater. It accumulated by it. The project was approved in 1871. The works started in 1882. The San Nicol\u00f2 breakwater was the first that was built. The works on both was completed in 1910 with the construction of a 26 m high lighthouse at Punta Sabbioni.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 122-23, 125, 126, 127</ref>\n\nA theatre (Nuovo Teatro del Lido) which had 600 seats opened in 1892. A [[velodrome]] was opened in 1894, but cycling competitions were ended in 1896 due to high running costs. In 1911 it hosted period costume equestrian tournament which attracted a big crowd.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 133-34, 150</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe expansion of the bathing resorts and of the urbanisation of the Santa Maria Elisabetta area continued. From 1900 to 1920 some 50 villas were built. In 1904 a horse-riding school was established. Over the decades it held several international contests and two world cups. The planning for a boulevard to connect Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta to San Nicol\u00f2 started in 1905. An aquarium was opened next to the theatre in 1909. Both were later demolished.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 139, 140, 148</ref>\n\nLido also became an island of grand hotels. The Grand Hotel Lido, in Piazzale Santa Maria Elisabetta, the square in front of the landing stage, was opened in 1900. It was demolished in the 1970s. In the same year the famous [[Grand Hotel des Bains]] was opened.<ref>http://www.historichotelsthenandnow.com/bainsvenicelido.html Historic Hotels - Hotel des Bains</ref> The Hungaria Palace Hotel, later called Grand Hotel Ausonia & Hungaria, opened in 1907. It had 82 rooms furnished by Eugenio Quarti, a famous Milan furniture maker nicknamed prince of the ''ebanisti'' (carpenters who work with ebony). A [[maiolica]] [[mosaic]] with Renaissance motifs interpreted in liberty style \nwhich made the hotel very distinctive was installed on its facade between 1914 and 1916.<ref>Speziali A., Diletto e armonia.

Two flights from Venice to this beach were arranged later in the year. The last one attracted many people who paid tickets to get on the terrace of the hotel and crowded it. There was a lottery draw whose prize was a tour on the plane. More such flights were then organised. This helped to attract attention to the hotel. In 1914 the owner of the Excelsior opened a fun fair which was extremely successful. However, it was dismantled the next year because of WW I. Another one was opened in 1932 but it suffered the same fate because of WW II.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 149-50, 152-53, 181-82</ref>\n\nIn 1919 woks started on a staircase to a votive temple (built between 1925 and 1928) dedicated to the Madonna of Victory and built for the remembrance of the fallen soldiers of WW I. The bodies of 3700 soldiers are kept here.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 159-60</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s seaplanes became the next technological advance. A Frenchman organised an international competition, the Schneider International Cup, from 1920 to 1931. It was held at Lido in 1920, 1921 and 1927. It was extremely popular.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 161</ref>\n\nIn 1919 it was decided that the ''Ospizio Marino'' (see above) was to remain open permanently and not just in the summer. Between 1922 and 1926 a new site for the hospital was built in the La Favorita area. It was now opened to adults as well. The centre for rehabilitation for children with rickets merged with this hospital in 1924. The Ospizio developed [[balneotherapy]] (bathing therapy) psammotherapy (hot sand baths) and sun therapy. In 1933 it was renamed ''Ospedale al Mare'' (Hospital at the Sea). It became a hospital of specialised excellence and the foremost [[thalassotherapy]] (the use of seawater for therapy) centre in Italy. In 1933 a church was opened in this complex.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 123-24, 167-8, 182</ref>\n\nIn 1920 the Grand Hotel Company (CIGA) built a bagno popolare (low-cost bathing resort) and gave the municipality a large square to create a public playground. In 1923 another bagno popolare (later called zone A) was established next to the Ospizio Marino.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 161, 169</ref>\n\nThe Nicelli airport was developed during WW I for the defence of Venice. In 1926 it was converted to civilian use with the construction of a terminal. The first light was to Vienna and carried four passengers. By 1931 there were six routes. In 1935 a second terminal was built. By 1939 there were 23,285 passengers. The major European airlines operated here and the airport was the second most important one in Italy after Rome. During  WW II much of its equipment was confiscated by the Germans, who also tried to destroy it. Operations resumed after the war. However, with the advent of bigger jet planes, the runway became too short. In 1961 the new [[Venice Marco Polo Airport]] was opened. The Nicelli airport only handled small private planes and hosted a school for pilots and parachutists. In 1994 the municipality of Venice set up a management firm to the restore the airport and relaunch economic activity in the area.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 173-75, 221</ref>\n\nIn 1930 the golf course at Alberoni was inaugurated. It was said that [[Henry Ford]] had been disappointed that Lido did not have a golf course. The area at the southern end of the island, which had sand dunes (sand would provide good drainage), trees and a former military fort and stables was chosen. Originally it had 9 holes. It was extended to 18 holes in 1951. The course is 6&nbsp;km long. It hosted Italian opens in 1955, 1960 and 1974.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 178-79</ref>\n\nOn 15\u201316 June 1934 Hitler went to Venice to meet Mussolini. He stayed at the Grand Hotel in Venice and Mussolini stayed at the Grand Hotel Excelsior. The two men met at the golf club at Alberoni.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, p. 182</ref>\n\nVenice was the first city in the world to have a publicly owned and regulated casino. It opened in 1638. However, it was closed in 1774. In 1938 the casino (Palazzo del Casin\u00f2) at Lido was opened. This marked the return of legal gambling in Venice. It became a summer casino in 1946, when a winter venue was opened in Venice in what is now Ca\u2019 Vendramin Calergi, formerly the last residence of Richard Wagner, who died there. The Palazzo del Casin\u00f2 at Lido was closed in the 1990s when a new casino was opened at Ca\u2019 Noghera in the mainland.<ref>https://casino.gioconews.it/cronaca/40599-una-serenissima-casa-da-gioco Casa da Gioco</ref><ref>http://www.arte.it/guida-arte/venezia/da-vedere/monumento/ex-casin\u00f2-del-lido-5776 Ex casin\u00f2 del Lido</ref>\n\nIn 1946 and 1947 a motor race was held at the Lido circuit to relaunch tourism. [[Tazio Nuvolari]] came third in the second race. Lido hosted the road cycling world championship in 1952 and track cycling world championship in 1962. In the latter year the ice rink was opened. Prior to that the rich skated at an inner terrace of the Excelsior Hotel and the non-rich skated at a small garden by the casino.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 191-2, 193-94</ref> \n \nIn the 1960s, the improving post-war Italian economy created a real-estate boom in the island and many Venetians moved to Lido to benefit from its modern infrastructure.\n\n== The Venice Film Festival ==\n{{main | Venice Film Festival}}\n[[File:66\u00e8me Festival de Venise (Mostra) Palais du Cinema.jpg|thumb|253x253px| [[66th Venice International Film Festival|66th Venice Int. Film Festival]] on the Lido.]]\n\nLido di Venezia is home to the [[Venice International Film Festival]] <small>([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Mostra Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica della Biennale di Venezia'', \"International Exhibition of Cinematographic Art of the [[Venice Biennale]]</small>\"). It is the world's oldest film festival and one of the three most prestigious ones, together with the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>Anheier, H.K., Juergensmeyer M., eds., Encyclopedia of Global Studies, 2012, p. 566. Cannes, Venice, and Berlin\u2014still hold the most prestigious status as cultural institutions that officially endorse the aesthetic and cinematic values of movies and critical currencies of film directors.</ref> These are sometimes called the \"Big Three\".<ref>Bordwell, D. (2005). Figures Traced in Light: On Cinematic Staging, 2005, p. 144. Because reputations were made principally on the festival circuit, the filmmaker had to find international financing and distribution and settle for minor festivals before arriving at one of the Big Three (Berlin, Cannes, Venice).</ref>\n\nThe film festival started in 1932. It was the idea of the then chair of the [[Venice Biennale]] who was worried about a decline in tourism at Lido due to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and understood that cinema could help to alleviate this. It was successful. The prince [[Umberto di Savoia]], the wife of the [[Prince of Wales]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Henry Ford]] and film stars such as [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Clark Gable]] attended. Forty films form six countries were shown on the terrace of the Excelsior hotel. No awards were given, but an audience referendum chose which films and performances were the most praiseworthy.\n\nThe second festival was held in 1934. It was meant to be a biennial event but it became annual because of the success of the first one. There were some 20 awards, but there was no jury. Premiers were shown, which increased the prestige of the festival. So did a scandal caused by a [[Gustav Machaty]]'s [[Ecstasy (film)|Ecstasy]] which showed the first scenes with a female nude in cinema history, which also launched the career of the actress [[Hedy Lamarr|Hedy Lammarr]]. This time the films were shown in the garden of the Excelsior hotel. In 1937 the venue of the festival was opened. It is the Palazzo del Cinema.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 180, 182-83, 185</ref>\n\nIn 1939 the fascist government imposed the assignation of the awards to two propaganda films, a fascist one and a Nazi one. Because of this the Americans boycotted the 1940 festival. The 1940-41-42 editions are not listed as part of the festival because the government assumed total control of the screening of films and chose films from the \u201cRome-Berlin\u201d axis. These festival were screened at two cinemas in Venice because the film hall was requisitioned. In 1943-45 the festival was suspended because of the war. It resumed in 1946. However, the French wanted their new festival, the  [[Cannes Film Festival]], to start at the same time as he Venice one. After negotiations it was decided that Cannes would run in the spring and Venice would start later, in late August. In 1946 and 1947 the festival was held in Venice because the film hall was requisitioned, this time by the American army. In the latter year the screenings took place at the [[Doge\u2019s Palace]]. The festival returned o Lido in 1948. An arena for outdoors screenings was built outside the film hall. In 1949 the festival\u2019s award, which was called International Great Prize of Venice, was renamed St. Mark\u2019s Lion Prize. Later it was called the Golden Lion.<ref>Distefano G., Lido di Venezia, atlante storico, 2103, pp. 188, 189, 191, 192</ref>\n\nThe Lido has also hosted numerous film-shoots. In 1971 the film [[Death in Venice (film)|''Death in Venice'']] <small>(''Morte a Venezia'')</small> directed by [[Luchino Visconti]], starring [[Dirk Bogarde]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen]], and based on the [[Death in Venice]] novel published in 1912 by [[Thomas Mann]] was screened.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/death-venice-arthouse Death in Venice: No 14 best arthouse film of all time]</ref> Both the novel and the film were set at lido and the [[Grand Hotel des Bains]], where Thomas Mann stayed with his wife and brother in the summer of 1911.

The city is close to winter skiing centres in the north and to seaside resorts on the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\n[[Podgorica Municipality]] covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory and is home to 29.9% of the country's population. It is the nation's administrative centre and its economic, cultural, and educational focus.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Podgorica'' means \"[area] below Gorica\". Gorica, meaning \"little hill\", is the name of one of the [[cypress]]-covered [[hillock]]s that overlook the city centre.\n\nSome three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of [[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], from which the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] hailed. In later centuries, Romans \"corrected\" the name to {{lang|la|Dioclea}}, guessing wrongly that an ''i'' had been lost in vulgar speech. {{lang|zls|Duklja}} is the later [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] version of that word.\n\nAt its foundation (some time before the 11th century), the town was called '''Birziminium'''. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was known as '''Ribnica''' (Montenegrin Cyrillic: {{lang|sh|\u0420\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}} {{IPA-sh|r\u00eebnitsa|}}). The name Podgorica was used from 1326. From 1946 to 1992, the city was [[List of places named after Tito|named]] '''Titograd''' in honour of [[Josip Broz Tito]], the former [[President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|President of Yugoslavia]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Doclea Roman city Podgorica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], Roman town, the seat of the Late Roman province of [[Praevalitana]].]]\n[[File:Ancient city Doclea - ruins 06.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Archeological remains of the Roman period in Doclea.]]\nPodgorica is at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of several historically important routes, near the rivers [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Mora\u010da]], [[Cijevna]], [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]], [[Sitnica (Mora\u010da)|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] in the valley of [[Lake Skadar]] and near the Adriatic Sea, in fertile lowlands with favourable climate. The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]], the area between the [[Zeta plain|Zeta]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i plain|Bjelopavli\u0107i valleys]] was occupied by two Illyrian tribes, the [[Labeates]] and the [[Docleatae]]. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000\u201310,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favourable climate and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nFrom the 5th century AD, with the arrival of the first [[Sclaveni|Slavic]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] tribes and the beginning of the break-up of the [[Roman Empire]], the area bore witness to many noteworthy events. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} With time, the fortifications ceased their function and new towns were built; a new settlement probably named after the Ribnica river, on whose banks it was built, Ribnica, was established. It was first mentioned during the reign of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], as part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian kingdom]]. The importance of Ribnica was its position as crossroads in communications with the west. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the [[Kotor]] archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through [[Trebinje]] and [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]. As a busy crossroad, Podgorica was a vibrant regional centre of trade and communication.

An occasional strong northerly wind influences the climate in the winter, with a [[wind chill]] effect lowering the perceived temperature by a few degrees. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe all-time maximum snowfall record was beaten on 11 February 2012, when {{convert|58|cm|0|abbr=on}} of snowfall were measured.

This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as city centre, and is called ''Nova Varo\u0161'' (''New town'')\n\nDuring World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being [[Bombing of Podgorica in World War II|bombed over 70 times]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} All that part of the city on the right bank of the [[Mora\u010da River]] was built this way.\n\nThe main contemporary traffic arteries were laid out during this period, which extended the orthogonal street layout of city center, to the south and west. Residential and infrastructural developments in the SFRY era have mostly shaped the layout of today's Podgorica, and accommodated the unprecedented population growth that followed World War II. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n<gallery>\nSaborniHram.JPG|[[Roman Square (Podgorica)|Roman Square]] and [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].\nMost_Bla\u017ea_Jovanovi\u0107a.jpg|[[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107 Bridge]] over the Mora\u010da.\nPodgorica_EKIP_and_Prva_TV_IMG_1286_82_Bulevar_D%C5%BEord%C5%BEa_Va%C5%A1ingtona.JPG|Office building at George Washington Street\nBlok_5_i_6.jpg|Highrise housing in Podgorica.\nDelta City - panoramio.jpg|[[Delta Holding|Delta Shopping Mall]].\nBulevar Svetog Petra Cetinjskog, 2019.jpg|[[Peter I of Montenegro|St Peter of Cetinje]] Boulevard\nAerodromPodgorica.jpg|[[Podgorica Airport]]\nMora\u010da Sports Center.jpg|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]]\n</gallery>\n\nA major advance in Podgorica architecture began in the late 1990s and, since then, the face of the city has changed rapidly. Residential and business construction are proceeding rapidly, incorporating contemporary glass-and-steel architectural trends. In an effort to create a recognizable and modern state capital, city officials are routing significant investments in city's public spaces. Thus, the city has gained entirely new squares, parks and monuments. New landmarks include the ''Hristovog Vaskrsenja'' [[Orthodox temple (church)|orthodox temple]] and the [[Millennium Bridge, Podgorica|Millennium Bridge]], the main feature of the Podgorica skyline. \n{{wide image|Dva_mosta_Podgorica_banner.jpg|1400px|A panoramic view of the [[Moscow bridge]] (right) and the [[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]] (left).

The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most significant theatre not only in Podgorica but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City Theatre (''Gradsko pozori\u0161te''), which includes the Children's Theatre and the Puppet Theatre. Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital [[Cetinje]], there are several noteworthy museums:\n\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(9).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] interior.]]\n[[File:Royal Garden in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former residence of King Nikola I Petrovi\u0107, today an art gallery.]]\n[[File:Crnogorsko Narodno Pozori\u0161te.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Montenegrin National Theatre]]]]\n[[File:Podgorica, museo nazionale, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|{{nowrap|National Museum of Montenegro}}]]\n* The Podgorica City Museum (''Muzej grada Podgorice'') preserves Podgorica's rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical and cultural-historical. It houses artefacts which date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n eras. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* The Archaeological Research Centre (''Centar za arheolo\u0161ka istra\u017eivanja'') was founded in 1961. Its mission is to gather, classify, restore and display archaeological sites.\n* The [[Marko Miljanov]] Museum (''Muzej Marka Miljanova'') in [[Medun]] shows life in 19th century Montenegro. \n* The Natural History Museum (''Prirodnja\u010dki muzej'') displays specimens of Montenegrin flora and fauna. This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\nThere is a notable art gallery in the ''Dvorac'' [[House of Petrovi\u0107|''Petrovi\u0107a'']] ([[Podgorica Royal Palace|Petrovi\u0107 Castle]]) complex in Podgorica's largest public park. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas]]'s castle, ''Perjani\u010dki Dom'' (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (''Centar savremenih umjetnosti'') and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (''Kino Kultura''), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a [[Ster-Kinekor]] (later acquired by [[Cineplexx Cinemas|Cineplexx]]) 6-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema opened at [[Delta City]] shopping mall.\n\nA significant cultural institution of over fifty years' standing is the Budo Tomovi\u0107 Cultural-Informational Centre (''KIC Budo Tomovi\u0107''). It is a public institution which organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (''Podgori\u010dko Kulturno Ljeto''), FIAT \u2013 International Alternative Theatre Festival (''Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra''), DEUS \u2013 December Arts Scene (''Decembarska Umjetni\u010dka Scena'').\n\n==Media==\nPodgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned [[public television]] broadcaster [[RTCG]]. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include [[RTV A1]], [[TV Vijesti]], [[Nova M]] and [[Prva TV]]. It was announced that the city's local television will be launched soon.<ref>[http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html Mugo\u0161a: Podgorica dobija svoju televiziju] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723040909/http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> Their programmes can be received in much of Montenegro.\n\nAll Montenegro's daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Pobjeda]]'', ''[[Vijesti]]'', ''[[Dnevne Novine]]'' and ''[[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]]'') are published in Podgorica, as the weekly magazines ''[[The Monitor (Montenegro)|Monitor]]'' and ''[[Magazin BIT]]''.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(34).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]].]]\nThe most popular sports by far are [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of [[KK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|KK Budu\u0107nost]], both in [[ABA League|Regional]] and European competitions.\n\nFootball in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]]. World-famous players [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]] and [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club [[FK Zeta]] from the Podgorica suburb of [[Golubovci]] has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] from Nik\u0161i\u0107, usually compete with each other for leading position in the [[First League of Montenegro]].\nOther clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. [[OFK Titograd]] & [[FK Kom|Kom]]. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is [[FK Ribnica]] from [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]], [[FK Zabjelo]] from [[Zabjelo]] and [[OFK Mladost Lje\u0161kopolje|OFK Mladost 1970]] from ''Donja Gorica''.\n\nThe volleyball team [[OK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|OK Budu\u0107nost]] and the women's handball team [[\u017dRK Budu\u0107nost T-Mobile]] have had significant success in European competition. [[Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means ''Future''.\n\n[[Chess]] is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like [[Slavko Dedi\u0107]], are born in Podgorica.\n\nSporting events like the annual [[Podgorica Marathon]] and the ''Mora\u010da River'' jumps attract international competitors.\nPodgorica was the host of [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]].\n\n===Venues===\n[[File:PodgoricaCityStadium2017.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Podgorica City Stadium]]]]\nPodgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:\n*[[Podgorica City Stadium]]. It has a capacity of 11,264 and it is the home of [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] and the [[Montenegro national football team]]. It is currently the only venue in Montenegro that complies with [[FIFA]] standards for international football matches.\n*[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]], a multi functional indoor sport facility. It has a capacity of 6 000 seats. It hosted one group of [[EuroBasket 2005]], while other games were played in [[Belgrade Arena|Belgrade]], [[Millennium Centar|Vr\u0161ac]], and [[Spens Sports Center|Novi Sad]].\n\nAlmost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium, although these are often only fields with small stands or no stands at all.\nOther notable venues are the [[Stadion malih sportova]] under Gorica hill and the [[sport shooting]] range under Ljubovi\u0107 hill. There are many other sports facilities around the city, most notably [[indoor soccer]] fields.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Podgorica_National_bank_of_Montenegro.JPG|thumb|left|Central Bank of Montenegro.]]\n[[File:Podgorica-Tuzi plantaze wineyard IMG 1318 Cijevna river.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Planta\u017ee]] wineyard, this wine field is the largest single one in Europe.]]\nPodgorica is not only the administrative centre of Montenegro, but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro's industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nBefore World War I, most of Podgorica's economy was in trade and small-scale manufacture, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, [[textile industry|textiles]], engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica's GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=Croatian | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107 | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav wars]], and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN-imposed sanctions]] left Podgorica's industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical [[Transition economy|transition]] pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, some of the industries, including [[Podgorica Aluminium Plant|Podgorica aluminium smelter]] and [[Planta\u017ee]], managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.\n\nAs Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from increased concentration of government and service sectors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to almost the entire country's government, Podgorica is home to the [[Montenegro Stock Exchange]] and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, [[Montenegro Airlines|Montenegrin flag carrier airline]], and other significant institutions and companies.\n\nThe large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]], which hit Montenegro hard. Although, in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro's citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country's employed. Out of the entire mass of paid nwt salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in May, 2014 was \u20ac509 in Podgorica municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |title=Monthly Statistical Review, no. 6/2014 |format=pdf|publisher=Monstat |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Capital Plaza of Podgorica Trg Svetog Petra Cetinjskog IMG 1291 Ulitsa Dr Ljubomira Ra\u0161ovi\u0107a.jpg|The Capital Plaza\nFile:Telenor.JPG|Telenor Center\nFile:DeltaPG.JPG|Delta City\nFile:PC Kru\u0161evac.JPG|TC Kru\u0161evac\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Demographics of Podgorica}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1948|14369 |1953|19868 |1961|35054 |1971|61727 |1981|96074 |1991|117875 |2003|136473 |2011|150977 |2018|199715\n|\n}}\n\nAlthough medium-sized by European standards, Podgorica is by far the largest city in [[Montenegro]]: almost one third of Montenegrin citizens live there. According to the 2011 census, there are 185,937 people in Podgorica Capital City, which is analogous to metropolitan area, and includes the small towns of [[Tuzi]] and [[Golubovci]], while 150,977 people live within the city proper.\n\nOut of the total population of Podgorica, 48.73% are male, while 51.27% are female. The average age of the population is 35.7. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is the most spoken language, with 42.4% of Podgorica citizens declaring it as their first language. It is followed closely by [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], at 41.17%. Other significant languages spoken in Podgorica are [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (5.53%) and [[Romani language|Romani]] (1.81%).\n\nThe majority of Podgorica citizens are [[Orthodox Christians]] (78.27%), while there are significant minorities of [[Muslims]] (11.23%) and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (4.27%).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"100\" | Nationality (2011 census)\n! width=\"80\" | Number\n! width=\"80\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 106,642 || 57.35%\n|-\n| [[Serbs]] || 43,248 || 23.26%\n|-\n| [[Albanians]] || 9,538 || 5.13%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 4,122 || 2.22%\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks]] || 3,687\t || 1,98%\n|-\n| [[Romani people|Romani]] || 3,988 || 2.14%\n|-\n| others || 5,820 || 3.13%\n|-\n| undeclared || 8,892 || 4.78%'''\n|}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Podgorica, cattedrale della resurrezione di cristo, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].]]\n[[File:Manastir Dajbabe - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dajbabe Monastery]].]]\n\nPodgorica is home to three main religious groups: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Christians]].\n\nOrthodox Christian population mostly originates from the local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] and [[Serb]] population, which accepted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Middle Ages after a major split during [[East\u2013West Schism|The Great Schism]]. They represent the major religious group. There are various Eastern Orthodox churches in the City such as St. George Church which originates from the 13th century, or [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] which is the largest church in the city to have been recently erected.\nThe [[Muslims|Muslim]] population mostly originates from local [[Bosniaks]], as well as [[Albanians]].\n\nThere are several mosques in Podgorica and [[Tuzi]]. Catholic population mainly consists of local Albanian minority. The main religious site for the Catholic population located in the [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik neighbourhood]] is the [[Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus (Podgorica)|Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]] constructed in 1966, in [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style which makes this object unique. Other Catholic objects are located in eastern suburb Tuzi.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Religion\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Number\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Percentage\n|-\n|[[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodoxy]]||145,575||78.29%\n|-\n|[[Muslims|Islam]] ||20,883||11.23%\n|-\n|[[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]] ||7,947||4.27%\n|-\n|[[Christians|Other Christian]]||568||0.31%\n|-\n|[[Agnostic]]||225||0.12%\n|-\n|[[Atheist]]||3,698||1.99%\n|-\n|Other||1,961||1.05%\n|-\n|Did not declare||4,583 ||\n|}\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Podgorica City Hall, 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Podgorica City Hall.]]\n[[File:PodgoricaUrbanSubdivisions.png|thumb|350px|right|[[List of Podgorica neighbourhoods and suburbs|Podgorica urban subdivisions]]]]\nThe city administration consists of mayor, city [[deliberative assembly|assembly]] and a number of secretariats and administrative bodies which together act as a city local government. The city assembly has 59 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during his term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of [[Golubovci]] since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for [[Golubovci]]. In 2018, [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]] became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/|title=Tuzi became its own Municipality.}}</ref>\n\nOn local elections held on 25 May 2014, the [[Democratic Party of Socialists]] won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority. [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] won 17 seats, [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|SNP]] won 8 seats, while coalition made of [[Positive Montenegro]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro|SDP]] won 5 seats. After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna, and made arrangement on forming majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is longtime partner of DPS at national level, it has been in opposition in Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010-2014 period. \nSince October 2014, position of the mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists|DPS]] official, Slavoljub Stijepovi\u0107, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, [[Miomir Mugo\u0161a]].\n\n===City Assembly===\n{{see|Podgorica City Assembly election, 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!colspan=2|Party/Coalition\n!Seats\n!Local government\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F6931D\" |\n| [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] \n| {{Composition bar|32|60|hex=#F6931D}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| [[Democratic Montenegro]] \n| {{Composition bar|12|60|hex=#FF0000}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkred\" |\n| [[United Reform Action]]\n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkred}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkblue\" |\n| [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] \n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue\" |\n| [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]]\n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=cornflowerblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #fd00ff\" |\n| [[Social Democrats of Montenegro|Social Democrats]] \n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=#fd00ff}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n| [[Albanian Alternative]]\n| {{Composition bar|1|60|hex=blue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|}\n\n===Local subdivisions===\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Podgorica}}\n\nThe municipality of Podgorica consists of ''Podgorica City Proper'' and one subdivision (called ''[[city municipality]],'' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435, ''gradske op\u0161tine''), which is [[Golubovci]].\n\nThe entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 57 ''[[local community|local communities]]'' (\u043c\u0458\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435, ''mjesne zajednice''), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.\n\n==Education==\n\nMost of Montenegro's higher education establishments are in Podgorica. It is home to the [[University of Montenegro]], the country's most significant such institution. The following faculties are in Podgorica:\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Electrical Engineering|Faculty of Electrical Engineering]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology|Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Political Sciences|Faculty of Political Sciences]]\n* Faculty of [[Civil Engineering]]\n{{col-2}}\n* Faculty of [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n* Faculty of [[Natural Sciences]] and [[Mathematics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Pharmacy|Faculty of Pharmacy]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Architecture|Faculty of Architecture]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Biotechnology|Faculty of Biotechnology]]\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe university's scientific research institutes are in the city:\n* Institute of Foreign Languages\n* Institute of Biotechnology\n* Institute of History\n\nThe [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]] is in Podgorica, as is the [[Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts|DANU]] cultural organization.\n\nThe [[Mediterranean University]] was founded 2006 as first private university in Montenegro. In the meantime, the number of private institutions for higher education has increased, like [[University of Donja Gorica|UDG - University of Donja Gorica]]. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is [[Gymnasium \"Slobodan \u0160kerovi\u0107\"]]. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education. The Radosav Ljumovi\u0107 National Library is considered the most comprehensive in Montenegro.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:PGWelcome.jpg|thumb|left|Northern entrance to Podgorica ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]).]]\n[[File:Millennium Bridge in Podgorica, Montenegro 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]].]]\nPublic transport in Podgorica consists of 11 urban and 16 suburban bus lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |title=Saobra\u0107aj |publisher=Podgorica.me |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325043642/http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |archivedate=25 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city-owned ''AD Gradski saobra\u0107aj'' public transport company used to be the sole bus operator until the 1990s, when private carriers were introduced. The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers.\n\nPublic transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation and stiff competition has made taxi services very affordable. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Over 20 taxi companies are operating in Podgorica with close to 800 vehicles in service. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and [[GPS]]-tracked vehicles.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Sozina-Tunnel.png|thumb|350px|[[Sozina Tunnel]] shortens the journey from Podgorica to Montenegro's main port [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], by some 25 km.]]\nPodgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]]) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, [[A-1 motorway (Montenegro)|Bar-Boljare motorway]] and [[Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway#Montenegro|Nudo\u2013Bo\u017eaj motorway]], will pass near Podgorica. The newly built [[Sozina tunnel]] (4.2&nbsp;km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. Also a new road bypass has been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city centre. A south-western bypass has also been planned {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, with same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic for its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the [[Mora\u010da River]] also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe current main transit connections of Podgorica are:\n* north ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]), towards [[Belgrade]] and on to Central Europe\n* west ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and on to Western Europe\n* south ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]) towards the [[Adriatic coast]]\n* east ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Albania]]\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:01.10.13 Podgorica 6111.101 & 461.040 (10101220063).jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Rail Station]].]]\nPodgorica is a hub of the X-shaped [[Railways of Montenegro|Montenegrin rail network]]. The [[Belgrade\u2013Bar railway|Belgrade\u2013Bar]] line converges with the [[Nik\u0161i\u0107-Podgorica railway|line to Nik\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway|line to Shkod\u00ebr]] at the [[Podgorica Rail Station]]. The station itself is located {{convert|1.5|km|2|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica's main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade\u2013Bar.  The link to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] was recently under reconstruction ([[Railway electrification system|electrification]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718|title=U \u017deljeznicu ula\u017eu 52 miliona eura}}</ref> afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to [[Shkod\u00ebr]] is currently used as freight-only.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Podgorica airport.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Airport]] near [[Golubovci]].]]\n[[Podgorica Airport]] is located in [[Zeta Plain]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro's main international airport. The airport is locally known as Golubovci Airport (\u0410\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438 / Aerodrom Golubovci), as it is located within the administrative boundaries of the town of [[Golubovci]]. The IATA code of the airport is still TGD because Podgorica was named Titograd, during which time the airport opened. It is the main hub for [[Montenegro Airlines]] and [[Di Air]].\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Montenegro}}\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\nPodgorica is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|NMK}} [[Skopje]], North Macedonia<ref name=\"Skopje twinnings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skopje.gov.mk/EN/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=69|title=Official portal of City of Skopje \u2013 Skopje Sister Cities|publisher=2006\u20132009 [http://www.skopje.gov.mk/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=1 City of Skopje]|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n\n===Partner cities===\n*{{flagicon|ARM}} [[Yerevan]], Armenia<ref name=\"Yerevan partnerships\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yerevan.am/3-233-233.html|title=Yerevan - Partner Cities|accessdate=2013-11-04|work=Yerevan Municipality Official Website|publisher=\u00a9 2005\u20142013 www.yerevan.am|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105220142/http://www.yerevan.am/3-233-233.html|archivedate=5 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nBelow are some of the most notable people who were either born, or spent most of their lives in Podgorica:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Bo\u017eidar Vukovi\u0107]], one of the first printers among the [[South Slavs]]\n*[[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107]], first [[President of Montenegro|President of the People's Assembly]] of [[Montenegro]]\n*[[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]], football player, [[1990\u201391 European Cup|European Cup]] champion\n*[[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Stevan Joveti\u0107]], football player\n*[[Du\u0161ko Vujo\u0161evi\u0107]], Montenegrin basketball coach\n*[[Marko Miljanov]], general, clan chief and writer\n*[[Vojo Stani\u0107]], sculptor and painter\n*[[Risto Stijovi\u0107]], sculptor and painter\n*[[Borislav Peki\u0107]], novelist\n*[[Nikola Radovi\u0107]], football player, Olympic silver medalist\n*[[Zoran Filipovi\u0107]] football player and coach\n*[[Du\u0161ko Radinovi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Simon Vuk\u010devi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Refik \u0160abanad\u017eovi\u0107]] football player\n*[[Dejan Zlati\u010danin]], boxer, lightweight [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion\n*[[Dejan Radonji\u0107]], basketball player and coach\n*[[Nikola Bulatovi\u0107]], basketball player\n*[[Ljiljana Mugo\u0161a]], handball player, Olympic champion\n*[[Svetlana Mugo\u0161a-Anti\u0107]], handball player, Olympic champion\n*[[Nikola Miroti\u0107]], Spanish basketball player, Olympic bronze medalist and European champion\n*[[Ivan Strugar]], kick-boxer\n*[[An\u0111ela Bulatovi\u0107]], handball player, Olympic silver medalist and European champion\n*[[Jovanka Radi\u010devi\u0107]], handball player, Olympic silver medalist and European champion\n*[[Knez (singer)|Nenad Kne\u017eevi\u0107 \"Knez\"]], pop singer\n*[[Sergej \u0106etkovi\u0107]], pop singer\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Honorary citizens===\n\n*{{flagicon|CRO}} [[Stjepan Mesi\u0107]], former [[List of Presidents of Croatia|President of Croatia]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Podgorica City Hall Independence Day Montenegro.jpg|Podgorica City Hall on Independence Day\nFile:Podgorica Trg Republike.JPG|[[Independence Square (Podgorica)|Independence Square]]\nFile:Vaso Brajovic.jpg|Monument to General [[Vaso Brajovi\u0107]]\nFile:Marko Miljanov - spomenik u Podgorici.jpg|Monument to [[Marko Miljanov]]\nFile:Josip Broz Tito Podgorica.jpg|Monument to [[Josip Broz Tito]]\nFile:Moskovska.jpg|Moscow street, Preko Mora\u010de neighbourhood\nFile:Pet udovica - panoramio.jpg|Momi\u0161i\u0107i neighbourhood\nFile:Natural History Museum of Montenegro, Sahat Kula, 2019.jpg|Natural History Museum and Clock Tower in the Old Town\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | url = http://www.cpi.hr/download/links/7292.pdf | chapter = Antibirokratska revolucija 1987-1989. godine | language = Serbian | first = Olivera | last = Milosavljevi\u0107 | format = PDF | title = Dijalog povjesni\u010dara - istori\u010dara 8, Zadar | editor-last1 = Graovac | editor-first1 = Igor | editor-last2 = Fleck | editor-first2 = Hans-Georg | publisher = Political Science Research Centre Ltd.

The city is close to winter skiing centres in the north and to seaside resorts on the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\n[[Podgorica Municipality]] covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory and is home to 29.9% of the country's population. It is the nation's administrative centre and its economic, cultural, and educational focus.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Podgorica'' means \"[area] below Gorica\". Gorica, meaning \"little hill\", is the name of one of the [[cypress]]-covered [[hillock]]s that overlook the city centre.\n\nSome three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of [[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], from which the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] hailed. In later centuries, Romans \"corrected\" the name to {{lang|la|Dioclea}}, guessing wrongly that an ''i'' had been lost in vulgar speech. {{lang|zls|Duklja}} is the later [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] version of that word.\n\nAt its foundation (some time before the 11th century), the town was called '''Birziminium'''. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was known as '''Ribnica''' (Montenegrin Cyrillic: {{lang|sh|\u0420\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}} {{IPA-sh|r\u00eebnitsa|}}). The name Podgorica was used from 1326. From 1946 to 1992, the city was [[List of places named after Tito|named]] '''Titograd''' in honour of [[Josip Broz Tito]], the former [[President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|President of Yugoslavia]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Doclea Roman city Podgorica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], Roman town, the seat of the Late Roman province of [[Praevalitana]].]]\n[[File:Ancient city Doclea - ruins 06.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Archeological remains of the Roman period in Doclea.]]\nPodgorica is at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of several historically important routes, near the rivers [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Mora\u010da]], [[Cijevna]], [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]], [[Sitnica (Mora\u010da)|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] in the valley of [[Lake Skadar]] and near the Adriatic Sea, in fertile lowlands with favourable climate. The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]], the area between the [[Zeta plain|Zeta]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i plain|Bjelopavli\u0107i valleys]] was occupied by two Illyrian tribes, the [[Labeates]] and the [[Docleatae]]. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000\u201310,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favourable climate and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nFrom the 5th century AD, with the arrival of the first [[Sclaveni|Slavic]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] tribes and the beginning of the break-up of the [[Roman Empire]], the area bore witness to many noteworthy events. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} With time, the fortifications ceased their function and new towns were built; a new settlement probably named after the Ribnica river, on whose banks it was built, Ribnica, was established. It was first mentioned during the reign of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], as part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian kingdom]]. The importance of Ribnica was its position as crossroads in communications with the west. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the [[Kotor]] archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through [[Trebinje]] and [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]. As a busy crossroad, Podgorica was a vibrant regional centre of trade and communication. This boosted its development, economic power, military strength and strategic importance. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:28iulsah.jpg|thumb|View of [[Depedogen|Ribnica fortress and Old bridge]], Catholic Church (right), Debbaglar Bridge, government mansion and the Mirko Varosh Hotel (far left), before 1901.]]\n[[File:Sahat-kula in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Clock Tower (Podgorica)|City Clock Tower]].]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] captured Podgorica in 1474.

The area is crossed with rivers and the city itself is only {{convert|15|km}} north of [[Lake Skadar]]. The [[Mora\u010da River|Mora\u010da]] and [[Ribnica River|Ribnica]] rivers flow through the city, while the [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Cijevna River|Cijevna]], [[Sitnica River|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] flow nearby. ''Mora\u010da'' is the largest river in the city, being {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} wide near downtown, and having carved a {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} deep canyon for the length of its course through the city. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Except for the Mora\u010da and Zeta, other rivers have an appearance of small creeks. The richness in bodies of water is a major feature of the city.\n\nIn contrast to most of Montenegro, Podgorica lies in a mainly flat area at the northern end of the Zeta plain, at an elevation of {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The only exceptions are hills which overlook the city. The most significant is {{convert|130.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} high '''Gorica Hill''' ({{IPA-sh|\u02c8\u0261\u01d2rit\u035csa|pron}}), city's namesake, which rises above the city centre. The other hills include ''Malo brdo'' (\"little hill\", {{convert|205.4|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), ''Velje brdo'' (\"big hill\", {{convert|283|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), ''Ljubovi\u0107'' ({{convert|101|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and ''Dajbapska gora'' ({{convert|172|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). For the most part, these are too steep for development and thus limit the city's expansion, especially to the north. However, urbanization has been encroaching on the lower slopes of the hills since the 1990s. \nPodgorica city proper has an area of {{convert|108|km2|sqmi}}, while actual urbanized area is much smaller.\n\n<gallery>\nPodgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(14).jpg|[[Mora\u010da]] river canyon.\nLago Skadar, Montenegro, 2014-04-14, DD 01.JPG|[[Lake Skadar]]\nNijagara_-_panoramio.jpg|River Cijevna waterfalls near Podgorica\nZagoric.JPG|Podgorica panoramic view.\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Podgorica, piazza repubblica.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Republic Square (Podgorica)|Independence Square]].]]\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Podgorica has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' instead of ''Csa''), since there is only one summer month with less than {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} of precipitation,<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

Although the city is only some {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[Adriatic Sea]], an arm of the Mediterranean, [[Rumija]] mountain acts as a natural [[Dinaric Alps]] barrier, separating Skadar Lake basin and Podgorica area from the sea, thus limiting temperate maritime influence on the local climate.\n\nThe mean annual rainfall is {{convert|1659|mm|in|abbr=on}}, making Podgorica by far wettest capital in Europe, [[Ljubljana]] being second with {{convert|1362|mm|in|abbr=on}}. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The temperature exceeds {{convert|25|\u00b0C}} on about 135 days each year and the median daily temperature is {{convert|15.6|\u00b0C|1}}. The number of rainy days is about 120, and those with a strong wind around 60. An occasional strong northerly wind influences the climate in the winter, with a [[wind chill]] effect lowering the perceived temperature by a few degrees. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe all-time maximum snowfall record was beaten on 11 February 2012, when {{convert|58|cm|0|abbr=on}} of snowfall were measured.

This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as city centre, and is called ''Nova Varo\u0161'' (''New town'')\n\nDuring World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being [[Bombing of Podgorica in World War II|bombed over 70 times]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} All that part of the city on the right bank of the [[Mora\u010da River]] was built this way.\n\nThe main contemporary traffic arteries were laid out during this period, which extended the orthogonal street layout of city center, to the south and west.

Residential and business construction are proceeding rapidly, incorporating contemporary glass-and-steel architectural trends. In an effort to create a recognizable and modern state capital, city officials are routing significant investments in city's public spaces. Thus, the city has gained entirely new squares, parks and monuments.

The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most significant theatre not only in Podgorica but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City Theatre (''Gradsko pozori\u0161te''), which includes the Children's Theatre and the Puppet Theatre. Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital [[Cetinje]], there are several noteworthy museums:\n\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(9).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] interior.]]\n[[File:Royal Garden in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former residence of King Nikola I Petrovi\u0107, today an art gallery.]]\n[[File:Crnogorsko Narodno Pozori\u0161te.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Montenegrin National Theatre]]]]\n[[File:Podgorica, museo nazionale, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|{{nowrap|National Museum of Montenegro}}]]\n* The Podgorica City Museum (''Muzej grada Podgorice'') preserves Podgorica's rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical and cultural-historical. It houses artefacts which date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n eras. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* The Archaeological Research Centre (''Centar za arheolo\u0161ka istra\u017eivanja'') was founded in 1961.

This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\nThere is a notable art gallery in the ''Dvorac'' [[House of Petrovi\u0107|''Petrovi\u0107a'']] ([[Podgorica Royal Palace|Petrovi\u0107 Castle]]) complex in Podgorica's largest public park. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas]]'s castle, ''Perjani\u010dki Dom'' (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (''Centar savremenih umjetnosti'') and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (''Kino Kultura''), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a [[Ster-Kinekor]] (later acquired by [[Cineplexx Cinemas|Cineplexx]]) 6-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema opened at [[Delta City]] shopping mall.\n\nA significant cultural institution of over fifty years' standing is the Budo Tomovi\u0107 Cultural-Informational Centre (''KIC Budo Tomovi\u0107''). It is a public institution which organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (''Podgori\u010dko Kulturno Ljeto''), FIAT \u2013 International Alternative Theatre Festival (''Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra''), DEUS \u2013 December Arts Scene (''Decembarska Umjetni\u010dka Scena'').\n\n==Media==\nPodgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned [[public television]] broadcaster [[RTCG]]. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include [[RTV A1]], [[TV Vijesti]], [[Nova M]] and [[Prva TV]]. It was announced that the city's local television will be launched soon.<ref>[http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html Mugo\u0161a: Podgorica dobija svoju televiziju] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723040909/http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> Their programmes can be received in much of Montenegro.\n\nAll Montenegro's daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Pobjeda]]'', ''[[Vijesti]]'', ''[[Dnevne Novine]]'' and ''[[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]]'') are published in Podgorica, as the weekly magazines ''[[The Monitor (Montenegro)|Monitor]]'' and ''[[Magazin BIT]]''.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(34).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]].]]\nThe most popular sports by far are [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of [[KK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|KK Budu\u0107nost]], both in [[ABA League|Regional]] and European competitions.\n\nFootball in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]]. World-famous players [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]] and [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club [[FK Zeta]] from the Podgorica suburb of [[Golubovci]] has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] from Nik\u0161i\u0107, usually compete with each other for leading position in the [[First League of Montenegro]].\nOther clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. [[OFK Titograd]] & [[FK Kom|Kom]]. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is [[FK Ribnica]] from [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]], [[FK Zabjelo]] from [[Zabjelo]] and [[OFK Mladost Lje\u0161kopolje|OFK Mladost 1970]] from ''Donja Gorica''.\n\nThe volleyball team [[OK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|OK Budu\u0107nost]] and the women's handball team [[\u017dRK Budu\u0107nost T-Mobile]] have had significant success in European competition. [[Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means ''Future''.\n\n[[Chess]] is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like [[Slavko Dedi\u0107]], are born in Podgorica.\n\nSporting events like the annual [[Podgorica Marathon]] and the ''Mora\u010da River'' jumps attract international competitors.\nPodgorica was the host of [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]].\n\n===Venues===\n[[File:PodgoricaCityStadium2017.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Podgorica City Stadium]]]]\nPodgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:\n*[[Podgorica City Stadium]]. It has a capacity of 11,264 and it is the home of [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] and the [[Montenegro national football team]]. It is currently the only venue in Montenegro that complies with [[FIFA]] standards for international football matches.\n*[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]], a multi functional indoor sport facility. It has a capacity of 6 000 seats. It hosted one group of [[EuroBasket 2005]], while other games were played in [[Belgrade Arena|Belgrade]], [[Millennium Centar|Vr\u0161ac]], and [[Spens Sports Center|Novi Sad]].\n\nAlmost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium, although these are often only fields with small stands or no stands at all.\nOther notable venues are the [[Stadion malih sportova]] under Gorica hill and the [[sport shooting]] range under Ljubovi\u0107 hill. There are many other sports facilities around the city, most notably [[indoor soccer]] fields.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Podgorica_National_bank_of_Montenegro.JPG|thumb|left|Central Bank of Montenegro.]]\n[[File:Podgorica-Tuzi plantaze wineyard IMG 1318 Cijevna river.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Planta\u017ee]] wineyard, this wine field is the largest single one in Europe.]]\nPodgorica is not only the administrative centre of Montenegro, but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro's industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nBefore World War I, most of Podgorica's economy was in trade and small-scale manufacture, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, [[textile industry|textiles]], engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica's GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=Croatian | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107 | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav wars]], and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN-imposed sanctions]] left Podgorica's industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical [[Transition economy|transition]] pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, some of the industries, including [[Podgorica Aluminium Plant|Podgorica aluminium smelter]] and [[Planta\u017ee]], managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.\n\nAs Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from increased concentration of government and service sectors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to almost the entire country's government, Podgorica is home to the [[Montenegro Stock Exchange]] and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, [[Montenegro Airlines|Montenegrin flag carrier airline]], and other significant institutions and companies.\n\nThe large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]], which hit Montenegro hard. Although, in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro's citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country's employed. Out of the entire mass of paid nwt salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in May, 2014 was \u20ac509 in Podgorica municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |title=Monthly Statistical Review, no. 6/2014 |format=pdf|publisher=Monstat |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Capital Plaza of Podgorica Trg Svetog Petra Cetinjskog IMG 1291 Ulitsa Dr Ljubomira Ra\u0161ovi\u0107a.jpg|The Capital Plaza\nFile:Telenor.JPG|Telenor Center\nFile:DeltaPG.JPG|Delta City\nFile:PC Kru\u0161evac.JPG|TC Kru\u0161evac\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Demographics of Podgorica}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1948|14369 |1953|19868 |1961|35054 |1971|61727 |1981|96074 |1991|117875 |2003|136473 |2011|150977 |2018|199715\n|\n}}\n\nAlthough medium-sized by European standards, Podgorica is by far the largest city in [[Montenegro]]: almost one third of Montenegrin citizens live there. According to the 2011 census, there are 185,937 people in Podgorica Capital City, which is analogous to metropolitan area, and includes the small towns of [[Tuzi]] and [[Golubovci]], while 150,977 people live within the city proper.\n\nOut of the total population of Podgorica, 48.73% are male, while 51.27% are female. The average age of the population is 35.7. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is the most spoken language, with 42.4% of Podgorica citizens declaring it as their first language. It is followed closely by [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], at 41.17%. Other significant languages spoken in Podgorica are [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (5.53%) and [[Romani language|Romani]] (1.81%).\n\nThe majority of Podgorica citizens are [[Orthodox Christians]] (78.27%), while there are significant minorities of [[Muslims]] (11.23%) and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (4.27%).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"100\" | Nationality (2011 census)\n! width=\"80\" | Number\n! width=\"80\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 106,642 || 57.35%\n|-\n| [[Serbs]] || 43,248 || 23.26%\n|-\n| [[Albanians]] || 9,538 || 5.13%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 4,122 || 2.22%\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks]] || 3,687\t || 1,98%\n|-\n| [[Romani people|Romani]] || 3,988 || 2.14%\n|-\n| others || 5,820 || 3.13%\n|-\n| undeclared || 8,892 || 4.78%'''\n|}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Podgorica, cattedrale della resurrezione di cristo, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].]]\n[[File:Manastir Dajbabe - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dajbabe Monastery]].]]\n\nPodgorica is home to three main religious groups: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Christians]].\n\nOrthodox Christian population mostly originates from the local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] and [[Serb]] population, which accepted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Middle Ages after a major split during [[East\u2013West Schism|The Great Schism]]. They represent the major religious group. There are various Eastern Orthodox churches in the City such as St. George Church which originates from the 13th century, or [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] which is the largest church in the city to have been recently erected.\nThe [[Muslims|Muslim]] population mostly originates from local [[Bosniaks]], as well as [[Albanians]].\n\nThere are several mosques in Podgorica and [[Tuzi]]. Catholic population mainly consists of local Albanian minority. The main religious site for the Catholic population located in the [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik neighbourhood]] is the [[Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus (Podgorica)|Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]] constructed in 1966, in [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style which makes this object unique.

The city assembly has 59 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during his term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of [[Golubovci]] since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for [[Golubovci]]. In 2018, [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]] became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/|title=Tuzi became its own Municipality.}}</ref>\n\nOn local elections held on 25 May 2014, the [[Democratic Party of Socialists]] won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority. [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] won 17 seats, [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|SNP]] won 8 seats, while coalition made of [[Positive Montenegro]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro|SDP]] won 5 seats. After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna, and made arrangement on forming majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is longtime partner of DPS at national level, it has been in opposition in Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010-2014 period. \nSince October 2014, position of the mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists|DPS]] official, Slavoljub Stijepovi\u0107, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, [[Miomir Mugo\u0161a]].\n\n===City Assembly===\n{{see|Podgorica City Assembly election, 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!colspan=2|Party/Coalition\n!Seats\n!Local government\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F6931D\" |\n| [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] \n| {{Composition bar|32|60|hex=#F6931D}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| [[Democratic Montenegro]] \n| {{Composition bar|12|60|hex=#FF0000}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkred\" |\n| [[United Reform Action]]\n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkred}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkblue\" |\n| [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] \n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue\" |\n| [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]]\n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=cornflowerblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #fd00ff\" |\n| [[Social Democrats of Montenegro|Social Democrats]] \n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=#fd00ff}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n| [[Albanian Alternative]]\n| {{Composition bar|1|60|hex=blue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|}\n\n===Local subdivisions===\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Podgorica}}\n\nThe municipality of Podgorica consists of ''Podgorica City Proper'' and one subdivision (called ''[[city municipality]],'' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435, ''gradske op\u0161tine''), which is [[Golubovci]].\n\nThe entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 57 ''[[local community|local communities]]'' (\u043c\u0458\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435, ''mjesne zajednice''), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.\n\n==Education==\n\nMost of Montenegro's higher education establishments are in Podgorica.

In the meantime, the number of private institutions for higher education has increased, like [[University of Donja Gorica|UDG - University of Donja Gorica]]. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is [[Gymnasium \"Slobodan \u0160kerovi\u0107\"]]. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education.

The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers.\n\nPublic transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation and stiff competition has made taxi services very affordable. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Over 20 taxi companies are operating in Podgorica with close to 800 vehicles in service. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and [[GPS]]-tracked vehicles.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Sozina-Tunnel.png|thumb|350px|[[Sozina Tunnel]] shortens the journey from Podgorica to Montenegro's main port [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], by some 25 km.]]\nPodgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]]) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, [[A-1 motorway (Montenegro)|Bar-Boljare motorway]] and [[Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway#Montenegro|Nudo\u2013Bo\u017eaj motorway]], will pass near Podgorica. The newly built [[Sozina tunnel]] (4.2&nbsp;km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. Also a new road bypass has been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city centre. A south-western bypass has also been planned {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, with same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic for its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the [[Mora\u010da River]] also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe current main transit connections of Podgorica are:\n* north ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]), towards [[Belgrade]] and on to Central Europe\n* west ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and on to Western Europe\n* south ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]) towards the [[Adriatic coast]]\n* east ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Albania]]\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:01.10.13 Podgorica 6111.101 & 461.040 (10101220063).jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Rail Station]].]]\nPodgorica is a hub of the X-shaped [[Railways of Montenegro|Montenegrin rail network]].

The station itself is located {{convert|1.5|km|2|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica's main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade\u2013Bar.  The link to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] was recently under reconstruction ([[Railway electrification system|electrification]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718|title=U \u017deljeznicu ula\u017eu 52 miliona eura}}</ref> afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to [[Shkod\u00ebr]] is currently used as freight-only.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Podgorica airport.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Airport]] near [[Golubovci]].]]\n[[Podgorica Airport]] is located in [[Zeta Plain]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro's main international airport.

Following a trip to the [[Radiodiffusion-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise|RTF]] studios in Paris, she began to campaign for the BBC to provide electronic music facilities for composing sounds and music, using [[electronic music]] and [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, for use in its programming.<ref name=\"OramBBC\" /> In 1957 she was commissioned to compose music for the play ''[[Amphitryon 38]].''  She created this piece using a [[electronic oscillator|sine wave oscillator]], a tape recorder and some self-designed filters, thereby producing the first wholly electronic score in BBC history.<ref name=\"OramBBC\" /> Along with fellow electronic musician and BBC colleague [[Desmond Briscoe]], she began to receive commissions for many other works, including a significant production of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[All That Fall]]'' (1957). As demand grew for these electronic sounds, the [[BBC]] gave Oram and Briscoe a budget to establish the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] in early 1958, where she was the first Studio Manager.<ref name=\"OramBBC\" /> The workshop was focused on creating sound effects and theme music for all of the corporation's output, including the science fiction serial ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1958\u201359) and \"Major Bloodnok's Stomach\" for the radio comedy series ''[[The Goon Show]]''.\n\nIn October 1958, Oram was sent by the BBC to the \"Journ\u00e9es Internationales de Musique Exp\u00e9rimentale\" at the [[Expo '58|Brussels World's Fair]] (where [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]] demonstrated his ''[[Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique]]''). After hearing some of the work produced by her contemporaries and being unhappy at the BBC music department's continued refusal to push electronic composition into the foreground of their activities, she decided to resign from the BBC less than one year after the workshop had opened, hoping to develop her techniques further on her own.<ref name=\"Guardian Obit\" />\n\nIn 1965, Oram produced ''Pulse Persephone'' for the Treasures of the Commonwealth exhibition at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy of the Arts]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170522-daphne-oram-pioneered-electronic-music|title=The woman who could 'draw' music|last=Williams|first=Holly|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\n\nOram provided the prominent electronic sounds for the soundtrack of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), uncredited.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDadgfW3B4A</ref> These sounds were used by the James Bond films up until ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964).

A second Gulbenkian grant of \u00a31,000 was awarded in 1965. The first entirely drawn-sound composition using the machine, entitled \"Contrasts Essonic\", was recorded in 1963. As the Oramics research evolved, Oram's focus turned to the subtle nuances and interactions between sonic parameters. In this phase of Oramics, she applied her sound research to the non-linear behavior of the human ear and to perception of the brain's apprehension of the world. She used Oramics to study vibrational phenomena, divided into \"commercial Oramics\" and \"mystical Oramics.\" In her notes, Oram defined Oramics as \"the study of sound and its relationship to life.\"\n\nIn the 1980s Oram worked on the development of a software version of Oramics for the [[Acorn Archimedes]] computer using grant money received from the RVW ([[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]) Trust.<ref name=\"Guardian Obit\"/><ref name=\"Brewer2018\">{{Cite web\n| title = The Sound of 'Doctor Who'\n| first = Nathan | last = Brewer\n| work = IEEE: The Institute\n| date = March 2018\n| accessdate = 2018-03-12\n| url = http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/ieee/institute_march2018/index.php?startid=7#/6\n}}</ref> She wished to continue her \"Mystical Oramics\" research, but a lack of funding prevented this project from being fully realized.\n\n== Written works ==\n\nThroughout her career, Oram lectured on electronic music and studio techniques.

In this manuscript she speculates on archaeological acoustics, and presents a theory backed by research that suggests that Neolithic chambered mounds and ancient sites like [[Stonehenge]] and [[The Great Pyramid]] in Egypt were used as resonators.

In her unfinished manuscript, ''The Sound of the Past, a Resonating Speculation'', she postulated that ancient civilizations might have done this to a highly evolved degree.<ref name=\":0\" /> In a letter to [[Sir George Trevelyan, 4th Baronet|Sir George Trevelyan]], Oram expressed hope that her wide-ranging work on Oramics would plant seeds that would mature in the 21st century.\n\nThe Daphne Oram Creative Arts Building at [[Canterbury Christ Church University]] was opened in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Daphne Oram Creative Arts Building |url=https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/about-us/estate-master-plan/arts-building.aspx |website=Canterbury Christ Church University |accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''The Wire''===\n\nA detailed feature on Daphne Oram's musical philosophy was published in the August 2011 issue of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' magazine.\n\n===''Click'' tribute===\nIn its first show of 2012, the BBC television technology programme, ''[[Click (TV programme)|Click]],'' featured a piece about Daphne Oram and her synthesiser, mainly prompted by the three-part Oramics Machine being on display at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]], London, during a year-long exhibition on the history of electronic music. It showed the machine being installed in a large display cabinet, and described how it was no longer possible to play due to its fragile state. However, an interactive, virtual version of the machine has been created, which allows visitors to create their own compositions. The programme showed archive footage of Oram describing the process of what became Oramics, also showing her 'drawing' the music, then playing her machine. The piece was entirely positive and described her as an 'unsung hero' of electronic music.\n\n=== ''Daphne Oram's Wonderful World of Sound'' ===\n''Daphne Oram's Wonderful World of Sound'' is a play that detailed Oram's life and career. It was presented by Blood of the Young and [[Tron Theatre]]. The play premiered in Glasgow on 9 May 2017 and toured around Scotland from May 2017 to June 2017. The play was written by Isobel McArthur and directed by Paul Brotherston.

Following a trip to the [[Radiodiffusion-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise|RTF]] studios in Paris, she began to campaign for the BBC to provide electronic music facilities for composing sounds and music, using [[electronic music]] and [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, for use in its programming.<ref name=\"OramBBC\" /> In 1957 she was commissioned to compose music for the play ''[[Amphitryon 38]].''  She created this piece using a [[electronic oscillator|sine wave oscillator]], a tape recorder and some self-designed filters, thereby producing the first wholly electronic score in BBC history.<ref name=\"OramBBC\" /> Along with fellow electronic musician and BBC colleague [[Desmond Briscoe]], she began to receive commissions for many other works, including a significant production of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[All That Fall]]'' (1957). As demand grew for these electronic sounds, the [[BBC]] gave Oram and Briscoe a budget to establish the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] in early 1958, where she was the first Studio Manager.<ref name=\"OramBBC\" /> The workshop was focused on creating sound effects and theme music for all of the corporation's output, including the science fiction serial ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1958\u201359) and \"Major Bloodnok's Stomach\" for the radio comedy series ''[[The Goon Show]]''.\n\nIn October 1958, Oram was sent by the BBC to the \"Journ\u00e9es Internationales de Musique Exp\u00e9rimentale\" at the [[Expo '58|Brussels World's Fair]] (where [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]] demonstrated his ''[[Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique]]'').

A second Gulbenkian grant of \u00a31,000 was awarded in 1965. The first entirely drawn-sound composition using the machine, entitled \"Contrasts Essonic\", was recorded in 1963. As the Oramics research evolved, Oram's focus turned to the subtle nuances and interactions between sonic parameters. In this phase of Oramics, she applied her sound research to the non-linear behavior of the human ear and to perception of the brain's apprehension of the world. She used Oramics to study vibrational phenomena, divided into \"commercial Oramics\" and \"mystical Oramics.\" In her notes, Oram defined Oramics as \"the study of sound and its relationship to life.\"\n\nIn the 1980s Oram worked on the development of a software version of Oramics for the [[Acorn Archimedes]] computer using grant money received from the RVW ([[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]) Trust.<ref name=\"Guardian Obit\"/><ref name=\"Brewer2018\">{{Cite web\n| title = The Sound of 'Doctor Who'\n| first = Nathan | last = Brewer\n| work = IEEE: The Institute\n| date = March 2018\n| accessdate = 2018-03-12\n| url = http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/ieee/institute_march2018/index.php?startid=7#/6\n}}</ref> She wished to continue her \"Mystical Oramics\" research, but a lack of funding prevented this project from being fully realized.\n\n== Written works ==\n\nThroughout her career, Oram lectured on electronic music and studio techniques.

Her tape-manipulation techniques at the Radiophonic Workshop became influential across the globe, across many genres over many decades. Her work at the Radiophonic Workshop also helped pave the way for [[Delia Derbyshire]], who arrived at the BBC in 1960 and later co-created the original ''[[Doctor Who]]'' theme music.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs the creator of Oramics she helped lay the foundation for modern electronic music production. She furthered music philosophy in her writings, and dedicated time to considering the human element in connection to sound and resonant frequencies. In her unfinished manuscript, ''The Sound of the Past, a Resonating Speculation'', she postulated that ancient civilizations might have done this to a highly evolved degree.<ref name=\":0\" /> In a letter to [[Sir George Trevelyan, 4th Baronet|Sir George Trevelyan]], Oram expressed hope that her wide-ranging work on Oramics would plant seeds that would mature in the 21st century.\n\nThe Daphne Oram Creative Arts Building at [[Canterbury Christ Church University]] was opened in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Daphne Oram Creative Arts Building |url=https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/about-us/estate-master-plan/arts-building.aspx |website=Canterbury Christ Church University |accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''The Wire''===\n\nA detailed feature on Daphne Oram's musical philosophy was published in the August 2011 issue of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' magazine.\n\n===''Click'' tribute===\nIn its first show of 2012, the BBC television technology programme, ''[[Click (TV programme)|Click]],'' featured a piece about Daphne Oram and her synthesiser, mainly prompted by the three-part Oramics Machine being on display at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]], London, during a year-long exhibition on the history of electronic music. It showed the machine being installed in a large display cabinet, and described how it was no longer possible to play due to its fragile state. However, an interactive, virtual version of the machine has been created, which allows visitors to create their own compositions. The programme showed archive footage of Oram describing the process of what became Oramics, also showing her 'drawing' the music, then playing her machine. The piece was entirely positive and described her as an 'unsung hero' of electronic music.\n\n=== ''Daphne Oram's Wonderful World of Sound'' ===\n''Daphne Oram's Wonderful World of Sound'' is a play that detailed Oram's life and career. It was presented by Blood of the Young and [[Tron Theatre]]. The play premiered in Glasgow on 9 May 2017 and toured around Scotland from May 2017 to June 2017. The play was written by Isobel McArthur and directed by Paul Brotherston. It was live-scored by Anneke Kampman, a Scottish electronic sound artist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloodoftheyoung.org/daphne-orams-wonderful-world-of-sound-1|title=Daphne Oram's Wonderful World of Sound|website=Blood of the Young|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tron.co.uk/event/daphne-orams-wonderful-world-of-sound/|title=Daphne Oram's Wonderful World of Sound at Tron Theatre Ltd.|website=Tron Theatre Ltd.|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anakanak.co.uk/about/|title=ANNEKE KAMPMAN - ABOUT|website=www.anakanak.co.uk|access-date=2018-03-09}}</ref>\n\n=== The Oram Awards ===\nThe Oram Awards was launched by the PRS Foundation and the New BBC Radiophonic Workshop to celebrate \"emerging artists in the fields of music, sound and related technologies in honour of Daphne Oram, and other pioneering women in music and sound.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> The inaugural Oram Awards took place on 3 July 2017 at the Turner Contemporary in Margate, as a part of the Oscillate Festival of Experimental Music And Sound.

Through dialogue, three philosophers named Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes debate the nature of [[God]]'s existence. Whether or not these names reference specific philosophers, ancient or otherwise, remains a topic of scholarly dispute. While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity.\n\nIn the ''Dialogues'', Hume's characters debate a number of [[argument]]s for the [[existence of God]], and arguments whose proponents believe through which we may come to know the nature of God. Such topics debated include the [[argument from design]]\u2014for which Hume uses a house\u2014and whether there is more suffering or good in the world ([[argument from evil]]).\n\nHume started writing the ''Dialogues'' in 1750 but did not complete them until 1776, shortly before his death. They are based partly on [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Natura Deorum]]''.

The company established a library and its [[Clockmakers' Museum|Museum]] in 1813, which is the oldest specific collection of clocks and watches worldwide.<ref>https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/clockmakers-museum</ref> This is administered by the company's affiliated charity, the Clockmakers\u2019 Charity,<ref>Charity No. 275380 registered with the UK Charity Commission</ref> and is presently housed on the second floor of London's [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]. The modern aims of the company and its Museum are charitable and educational, in particular to promote and preserve clockmaking and watchmaking, which as of 2019 were added to the [[HCA Red List of Endangered Crafts]].\n\n==Museum==\nThe [[Clockmakers' Museum|Clockmakers\u2019 Museum]], first established in 1813, was housed at London's [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] from 1874 to 2014. The collection of clocks and watches was moved to a new gallery provided by the Science Museum, officially opened by HRH [[Princess Anne]] on 22 October 2015. The company's archive and library are however still kept at [[Guildhall Library]]. The collection includes [[John Harrison|John Harrison's]] sea watch H5, once personally tested by [[King George III]].\n\n==Motto==\nThe company's motto, ''Tempus Rerum Imperator'', can be translated as \u2018Time, the Ruler of All Things\u2019. It appears as an epitaph on the tombstone of former British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], a liveryman of the company. It has also been adopted by the [[Google Web Accelerator]] project.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the seventeenth century, clockmaking by native English craftsmen was mostly confined to the production of [[turret clocks]]. Domestic clocks and watches were mostly imported or the work of immigrants from the Continent. Because turret clock making involved working in ferrous metal, clockmakers within the City of London tended to be freemen of the [[Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths|Blacksmiths\u2019 Company]], though some were members of other livery companies, notably the [[Worshipful Company of Clothworkers|Clothworkers]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Lantern Clocks|last=White|first=George|publisher=ACC|year=1989|location=|pages=51\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAfter the loss of many London clock and watchmakers in the plagues of 1598 and 1603, the trade consolidated and began to grow. The continued influx of newcomers led to resentment from those who had become established in London towards outsiders who came to set up in or near the City and who threatened their market. From 1620 onwards, groups of clockmakers attempted to set up their own guild. The Blacksmiths initially succeeded in opposing these moves. Eventually, however, with the King issuing charters as a means of raising much needed finance at a time when he had prorogued Parliament, the clockmakers succeeded in securing a Royal Charter, on 22 August 1631, to the distress of the Blacksmiths, who could naturally expect to lose members, and therefore income.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Clockmakers of London|last=White|first=George|publisher=WCC|year=2018|location=London|pages=14\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe Charter gave regulatory authority to the Clockmakers to control the horological trade in the City of London and for a radius of ten miles around. It incorporated a controlling body which should have \u2018continuance for ever under the style and name of The Master, Wardens and Fellowship of the Art and Mystery of Clockmaking\u2019. It provided that the Fellowship should be governed by a Master, three Wardens and ten or more Assistants who would form the Court. The first Master was [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]], a Scot, who had been appointed watchmaker to [[James VI of Scotland]], later James I of England. The noted clockmaker [[Edward East (clockmaker)|Edward East]] also formed part of the first Court.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Some Account of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|last=Atkins|first=Samuel|publisher=|year=1881|location=London|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nThe original Charter is still in the company's possession and is housed with the rest of its library and archive in the Guildhall Library.<ref>See the catalogue of the London Metropolitan Archive, reference CLC/L/CD</ref>\nThe company obtained a [[grant of arms]] from the [[College of Arms]] in January 1672. In 1766, the [[Court of Aldermen]] granted the Company its livery. The number of Liverymen was originally limited at sixty but has been increased in number over the years by approval of the [[City of London Corporation]] and currently stands at a maximum of three hundred.<ref>http://www.clockmakers.org/history-customs/freedom-and-livery/</ref>\n\n==Horological Training and Awards for Excellence==\nThe company bestows three awards for excellence: the Tompion Medal for outstanding achievements in horology, the Harrison Medal for the propagation of horological knowledge and its appreciation, and the Derek Pratt Prize for innovation, ingenuity, elegance, and the highest standards of workmanship and precision performance in the craft and science of time and timekeeping.\nThe company also closely co-operates with the trustees of the [[George Daniels (watchmaker)|George Daniels]] Educational Trust in supporting education in horology.\n\n==Affiliations==\nThe Clockmakers Company is formally affiliated with the [[Antiquarian Horological Society]], the [[UCL Observatory]], [[HMS Protector (A173)|HMS ''Protector'']], the Royal Navy's Ice Patrol Ship.<ref>http://www.clockmakers.org/about/affiliations/</ref> and [[HMS Archer|HMS ''Archer'']], a P264 Class University Royal Naval Unit based in Edinburgh.\n\n==Masters==\n[[File:Reverend Henry Leonard Nelthropp.jpg|thumb|The Reverend Henry Leonard Nelthropp MA FSA, Master of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers of the City of London 1893 and 1894.]]\n[[File:City of London, unusually arranged clock - geograph.org.uk - 559842.jpg|thumb|The [[Newgate|Newgate Street]] clock, the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers' 375th anniversary gift to the City of London.]]\nThose who have been Master of the company include the following:<ref>[http://www.clockmakers.org/about/the-court-committees-panels/masters-since-1631/ Masters since 1631], The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers website, accessed 06/02/2011</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*1631, [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]]\n*1636, [[Elias Allen]]\n*1645, 1652 [[Edward East (clockmaker)|Edward East]]\n*1700, [[Charles Gretton]]<ref>[Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila.

The company established a library and its [[Clockmakers' Museum|Museum]] in 1813, which is the oldest specific collection of clocks and watches worldwide.<ref>https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/clockmakers-museum</ref> This is administered by the company's affiliated charity, the Clockmakers\u2019 Charity,<ref>Charity No. 275380 registered with the UK Charity Commission</ref> and is presently housed on the second floor of London's [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]. The modern aims of the company and its Museum are charitable and educational, in particular to promote and preserve clockmaking and watchmaking, which as of 2019 were added to the [[HCA Red List of Endangered Crafts]].\n\n==Museum==\nThe [[Clockmakers' Museum|Clockmakers\u2019 Museum]], first established in 1813, was housed at London's [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] from 1874 to 2014. The collection of clocks and watches was moved to a new gallery provided by the Science Museum, officially opened by HRH [[Princess Anne]] on 22 October 2015. The company's archive and library are however still kept at [[Guildhall Library]]. The collection includes [[John Harrison|John Harrison's]] sea watch H5, once personally tested by [[King George III]].\n\n==Motto==\nThe company's motto, ''Tempus Rerum Imperator'', can be translated as \u2018Time, the Ruler of All Things\u2019. It appears as an epitaph on the tombstone of former British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], a liveryman of the company. It has also been adopted by the [[Google Web Accelerator]] project.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the seventeenth century, clockmaking by native English craftsmen was mostly confined to the production of [[turret clocks]]. Domestic clocks and watches were mostly imported or the work of immigrants from the Continent. Because turret clock making involved working in ferrous metal, clockmakers within the City of London tended to be freemen of the [[Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths|Blacksmiths\u2019 Company]], though some were members of other livery companies, notably the [[Worshipful Company of Clothworkers|Clothworkers]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Lantern Clocks|last=White|first=George|publisher=ACC|year=1989|location=|pages=51\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAfter the loss of many London clock and watchmakers in the plagues of 1598 and 1603, the trade consolidated and began to grow. The continued influx of newcomers led to resentment from those who had become established in London towards outsiders who came to set up in or near the City and who threatened their market. From 1620 onwards, groups of clockmakers attempted to set up their own guild. The Blacksmiths initially succeeded in opposing these moves. Eventually, however, with the King issuing charters as a means of raising much needed finance at a time when he had prorogued Parliament, the clockmakers succeeded in securing a Royal Charter, on 22 August 1631, to the distress of the Blacksmiths, who could naturally expect to lose members, and therefore income.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Clockmakers of London|last=White|first=George|publisher=WCC|year=2018|location=London|pages=14\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe Charter gave regulatory authority to the Clockmakers to control the horological trade in the City of London and for a radius of ten miles around. It incorporated a controlling body which should have \u2018continuance for ever under the style and name of The Master, Wardens and Fellowship of the Art and Mystery of Clockmaking\u2019. It provided that the Fellowship should be governed by a Master, three Wardens and ten or more Assistants who would form the Court. The first Master was [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]], a Scot, who had been appointed watchmaker to [[James VI of Scotland]], later James I of England. The noted clockmaker [[Edward East (clockmaker)|Edward East]] also formed part of the first Court.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Some Account of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|last=Atkins|first=Samuel|publisher=|year=1881|location=London|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nThe original Charter is still in the company's possession and is housed with the rest of its library and archive in the Guildhall Library.<ref>See the catalogue of the London Metropolitan Archive, reference CLC/L/CD</ref>\nThe company obtained a [[grant of arms]] from the [[College of Arms]] in January 1672. In 1766, the [[Court of Aldermen]] granted the Company its livery. The number of Liverymen was originally limited at sixty but has been increased in number over the years by approval of the [[City of London Corporation]] and currently stands at a maximum of three hundred.<ref>http://www.clockmakers.org/history-customs/freedom-and-livery/</ref>\n\n==Horological Training and Awards for Excellence==\nThe company bestows three awards for excellence: the Tompion Medal for outstanding achievements in horology, the Harrison Medal for the propagation of horological knowledge and its appreciation, and the Derek Pratt Prize for innovation, ingenuity, elegance, and the highest standards of workmanship and precision performance in the craft and science of time and timekeeping.\nThe company also closely co-operates with the trustees of the [[George Daniels (watchmaker)|George Daniels]] Educational Trust in supporting education in horology.\n\n==Affiliations==\nThe Clockmakers Company is formally affiliated with the [[Antiquarian Horological Society]], the [[UCL Observatory]], [[HMS Protector (A173)|HMS ''Protector'']], the Royal Navy's Ice Patrol Ship.<ref>http://www.clockmakers.org/about/affiliations/</ref> and [[HMS Archer|HMS ''Archer'']], a P264 Class University Royal Naval Unit based in Edinburgh.\n\n==Masters==\n[[File:Reverend Henry Leonard Nelthropp.jpg|thumb|The Reverend Henry Leonard Nelthropp MA FSA, Master of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers of the City of London 1893 and 1894.]]\n[[File:City of London, unusually arranged clock - geograph.org.uk - 559842.jpg|thumb|The [[Newgate|Newgate Street]] clock, the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers' 375th anniversary gift to the City of London.]]\nThose who have been Master of the company include the following:<ref>[http://www.clockmakers.org/about/the-court-committees-panels/masters-since-1631/ Masters since 1631], The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers website, accessed 06/02/2011</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*1631, [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]]\n*1636, [[Elias Allen]]\n*1645, 1652 [[Edward East (clockmaker)|Edward East]]\n*1700, [[Charles Gretton]]<ref>[Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila.
