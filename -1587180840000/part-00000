It was first recorded by Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club (with [[Thomas Dolby]] on keyboards) for their album ''[[English Garden (album)|English Garden]]'', and later by British new wave/synth-pop group [[the Buggles]], consisting of Horn and Downes. The track was recorded and mixed in 1979, released as their debut single on 7 September 1979 by [[Island Records]], and included on their first album ''[[The Age of Plastic]]''. The backing track was recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, and mixing and vocal recording would later take place at [[Sarm East Studios]].\n\nThe song relates to concerns about mixed attitudes towards 20th-century inventions and machines for the media arts. Musically, the song performs like an extended jingle and the composition plays in the key of [[D-flat major]] in [[common time]] at a [[tempo]] of 132 [[beats per minute]]. The track has been positively received, with reviewers praising its unusual musical pop elements. Although the song includes several common pop characteristics and six basic chords are used in its structure, Downes and writer Timothy Warner described the piece as musically complicated, due to its use of suspended and minor ninth chords for enhancement that gave the song a \"slightly different feel.\"\n\nUpon release, the single topped sixteen international [[Record chart|music charts]], including those in the UK, Australia, and Japan. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa, but only reached number 40 in the US. The accompanying [[music video]] was written, directed, and edited by [[Russell Mulcahy]]. It was the [[First music videos aired on MTV|first music video]] shown on [[MTV]] in the US, airing at 12:01{{nbsp}}a.m. on 1 August 1981, and the first video shown on [[MTV Classic (UK & Ireland)|MTV Classic]] in the UK on 1 March 2010. The song has received several critical accolades, such as being ranked number 40 on VH1's ''100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the '80s''.<ref name=\"VH1\">Ali, Rahsheeda (2 May 2013). {{cite web|url= http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2013-05-02/100-greatest-one-hit-wonders-of-the-80s/62/ |title= 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders Of The 80s: 40. \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" \u2013 The Buggles |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130505172248/http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2013-05-02/100-greatest-one-hit-wonders-of-the-80s/62/ |archivedate= 5 May 2013}}.

It was first recorded by Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club (with [[Thomas Dolby]] on keyboards) for their album ''[[English Garden (album)|English Garden]]'', and later by British new wave/synth-pop group [[the Buggles]], consisting of Horn and Downes. The track was recorded and mixed in 1979, released as their debut single on 7 September 1979 by [[Island Records]], and included on their first album ''[[The Age of Plastic]]''. The backing track was recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, and mixing and vocal recording would later take place at [[Sarm East Studios]].\n\nThe song relates to concerns about mixed attitudes towards 20th-century inventions and machines for the media arts. Musically, the song performs like an extended jingle and the composition plays in the key of [[D-flat major]] in [[common time]] at a [[tempo]] of 132 [[beats per minute]]. The track has been positively received, with reviewers praising its unusual musical pop elements. Although the song includes several common pop characteristics and six basic chords are used in its structure, Downes and writer Timothy Warner described the piece as musically complicated, due to its use of suspended and minor ninth chords for enhancement that gave the song a \"slightly different feel.\"\n\nUpon release, the single topped sixteen international [[Record chart|music charts]], including those in the UK, Australia, and Japan. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa, but only reached number 40 in the US. The accompanying [[music video]] was written, directed, and edited by [[Russell Mulcahy]]. It was the [[First music videos aired on MTV|first music video]] shown on [[MTV]] in the US, airing at 12:01{{nbsp}}a.m. on 1 August 1981, and the first video shown on [[MTV Classic (UK & Ireland)|MTV Classic]] in the UK on 1 March 2010. The song has received several critical accolades, such as being ranked number 40 on VH1's ''100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the '80s''.<ref name=\"VH1\">Ali, Rahsheeda (2 May 2013). {{cite web|url= http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2013-05-02/100-greatest-one-hit-wonders-of-the-80s/62/ |title= 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders Of The 80s: 40. \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" \u2013 The Buggles |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130505172248/http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2013-05-02/100-greatest-one-hit-wonders-of-the-80s/62/ |archivedate= 5 May 2013}}.

[[Tom Hanks]] stars as Sullenberger, with [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Laura Linney]], [[Anna Gunn]], [[Autumn Reeser]], [[Holt McCallany]], [[Jamey Sheridan]], and [[Jerry Ferrara]] in supporting roles. The film follows Sullenberger's January 2009 emergency landing of [[US Airways Flight 1549]] on the [[Hudson River]], in which all 155 passengers and crew survived with only minor injuries, and the subsequent publicity and investigation.\n\n''Sully'' premiered at the 43rd Annual [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 2, 2016, and was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros.]] on September 9, 2016, in conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters.<ref name=\"IMAX\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.imax.com/movies/sully |title=Sully &#124; Nearby Showtimes, Movie Tickets |publisher=IMAX |date= |accessdate=2016-11-26}}</ref> The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $240 million worldwide, but created controversy with its fictionalized portrayal of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) as \"prosecutorial and closed-minded.\" The [[American Film Institute]] and [[National Board of Review]] both selected it as one of their ten best films of 2016,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hipes |first=Patrick | url=https://deadline.com/2016/12/afi-awards-film-2016-list-silence-sully-zootopia-1201867080/ |title=AFI Awards: Best Of 2016 List Includes 'Silence', 'Hacksaw Ridge' & More |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date =December 8, 2016 |access-date= December 8, 2016| archive-date=December 22, 2016|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20161222192150/http://deadline.com/2016/12/afi-awards-film-2016-list-silence-sully-zootopia-1201867080/ | url-status=live}}</ref> and it received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn January 15, 2009, [[US Airways]] pilots [[Pilot in command|Captain]] [[Chesley Sullenberger|Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger]] and [[First officer (aeronautics)|First Officer]] [[Jeff Skiles]] board [[US Airways Flight 1549]] from [[LaGuardia Airport]] to [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport]]. Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 feet (approx. 850 m), the [[Airbus A320]] [[Bird strike|strikes a flock of birds]], disabling both engines. Without engine power and judging themselves unable to reach nearby airports ([[Teterboro Airport]] being the closest), Sully [[Water landing|ditches]] the aircraft on the [[Hudson River]]. The crew and passengers evacuate without any fatalities. The press and public hail Sullenburger a hero, but the incident leaves him haunted, and experiencing a dream in which the plane crashes into a building.\n\nSully learns that preliminary data from [[Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System|ACARS]] suggest that the left engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, this would have left him with enough power to return to LaGuardia or land at Teterboro. Furthermore, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] claims that several confidential computerized simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport without engines. Sully, however, insists that he lost both engines, which left him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport.\n\nSully realizes that the Board believes the accident may have been [[pilot error]], which would end his career. He arranges to have the simulations rerun with live pilots, and the results are relayed to the public hearing. Both simulations result in successful landings, one at each airport. Sully argues that they are unrealistic because the pilots knew in advance of the situation they would face and of the suggested emergency action, and were able to practice the scenario several times. The board accepts that in real life the pilots would have taken some time to react and run [[Emergency procedure|emergency checks]] before deciding to divert the plane.\n\nBoth simulations are rerun and relayed to the hearing, this time allowing a 35-second pause before the plane is diverted. The simulated diversion to LaGuardia ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and to Teterboro with a crash into buildings before the airport. The board announces that analysis of the port engine, now recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it was disabled by the bird strikes. The board concludes that Sullenberger acted correctly in selecting the best of the options available to him, which in the event saved the lives of everyone aboard.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align        = right\n| direction    = horizontal\n| footer       = [[Chesley Sullenberger]] (left) portrayed by [[Tom Hanks]] (right)\n| footer_align = center\n| image1       = Chesley Sullenberger honored crop.jpg\n| width1       = 170\n| image2       = Sully Japan Premiere Red Carpet- Tom Hanks (29747442771).jpg\n| width2       = 150\n}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Chesley Sullenberger|Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger]]\n** Blake Jones as Sully (16 years old)\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as [[Jeff Skiles]]\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Lorraine Sullenberger\n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Charles Porter\n* [[Anna Gunn]] as Dr. Elizabeth Davis\n* [[Jamey Sheridan]] as Ben Edwards\n* [[Ann Cusack]] as Donna Dent\n* [[Autumn Reeser]] as Tess Sosa\n* [[Molly Hagan]] as Doreen Welsh\n* [[Holt McCallany]] as Mike Cleary\n* [[Chris Bauer]] as Larry Rooney\n* Patch Darragh as Patrick Harten\n* [[Jerry Ferrara]] as Michael Delaney\n* [[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]] as Jimmy Stefanik\n* [[Sam Huntington]] as Jeff Kolodjay\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Pete the Bartender\n* [[Wayne Bastrup]] as Brian Kelly\n* [[Valerie Mahaffey]] as Diane Higgins\n* [[Jeff Kober]] as L.

Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 feet (approx. 850 m), the [[Airbus A320]] [[Bird strike|strikes a flock of birds]], disabling both engines. Without engine power and judging themselves unable to reach nearby airports ([[Teterboro Airport]] being the closest), Sully [[Water landing|ditches]] the aircraft on the [[Hudson River]]. The crew and passengers evacuate without any fatalities. The press and public hail Sullenburger a hero, but the incident leaves him haunted, and experiencing a dream in which the plane crashes into a building.\n\nSully learns that preliminary data from [[Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System|ACARS]] suggest that the left engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, this would have left him with enough power to return to LaGuardia or land at Teterboro. Furthermore, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] claims that several confidential computerized simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport without engines. Sully, however, insists that he lost both engines, which left him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport.\n\nSully realizes that the Board believes the accident may have been [[pilot error]], which would end his career. He arranges to have the simulations rerun with live pilots, and the results are relayed to the public hearing. Both simulations result in successful landings, one at each airport. Sully argues that they are unrealistic because the pilots knew in advance of the situation they would face and of the suggested emergency action, and were able to practice the scenario several times. The board accepts that in real life the pilots would have taken some time to react and run [[Emergency procedure|emergency checks]] before deciding to divert the plane.\n\nBoth simulations are rerun and relayed to the hearing, this time allowing a 35-second pause before the plane is diverted. The simulated diversion to LaGuardia ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and to Teterboro with a crash into buildings before the airport. The board announces that analysis of the port engine, now recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it was disabled by the bird strikes. The board concludes that Sullenberger acted correctly in selecting the best of the options available to him, which in the event saved the lives of everyone aboard.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align        = right\n| direction    = horizontal\n| footer       = [[Chesley Sullenberger]] (left) portrayed by [[Tom Hanks]] (right)\n| footer_align = center\n| image1       = Chesley Sullenberger honored crop.jpg\n| width1       = 170\n| image2       = Sully Japan Premiere Red Carpet- Tom Hanks (29747442771).jpg\n| width2       = 150\n}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Chesley Sullenberger|Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger]]\n** Blake Jones as Sully (16 years old)\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as Jeff Skiles\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Lorraine Sullenberger\n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Charles Porter\n* [[Anna Gunn]] as Dr. Elizabeth Davis\n* [[Jamey Sheridan]] as Ben Edwards\n* [[Ann Cusack]] as Donna Dent\n* [[Autumn Reeser]] as Tess Sosa\n* [[Molly Hagan]] as Doreen Welsh\n* [[Holt McCallany]] as Mike Cleary\n* [[Chris Bauer]] as Larry Rooney\n* Patch Darragh as Patrick Harten\n* [[Jerry Ferrara]] as Michael Delaney\n* [[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]] as Jimmy Stefanik\n* [[Sam Huntington]] as Jeff Kolodjay\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Pete the Bartender\n* [[Wayne Bastrup]] as Brian Kelly\n* [[Valerie Mahaffey]] as Diane Higgins\n* [[Jeff Kober]] as L.
