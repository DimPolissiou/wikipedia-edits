But means were found to place Wilhelm, a youth of seventeen, in the [[D\u00fcsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts]], to which the sculptor [[Christian Daniel Rauch|Rauch]] had obtained him admission. The academy was then becoming renowned under the directorship of [[Peter von Cornelius]], of whom he became a distinguished pupil. Young Kaulbach contended against hardships, even hunger. But his courage never failed; and, uniting genius with industry, he was soon foremost among the young national party which sought to revive the arts of Germany.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|p=698}}\n\n===Munich murals===\n[[File:Wilhelm von Kaulbach 003.jpg|thumb|Sketches for [[fresco]]s in the New Pinakothek, 1850.]]\n\nThe ambitious work by which [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] sought to transform Munich into a German Athens afforded the young painter an appropriate sphere. Cornelius had been commissioned to execute the enormous frescoes in the [[Glyptothek]], and his custom was in the winters, with the aid of Kaulbach and others, to complete the cartoons at D\u00fcsseldorf, and in the summers, accompanied by his best pupils, to carry out the designs in colour on the museum walls in Munich. In 1824 Cornelius became director of the [[Munich Academy of Fine Arts]]. Kaulbach, not yet twenty, followed, took up his permanent residence in Munich, worked hard on the public works, executed independent commissions, and in 1849, when Cornelius left for Berlin, succeeded to the directorship of the academy, an office which he held till his death.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|p=698}}\n\nKaulbach matured, after the example of the masters of the Middle Ages, the practice of mural or monumental decoration; he once more conjoined painting with architecture, and displayed a creative fertility and readiness of resource scarcely found since the era of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]].{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|p=698}} Under the direction of Cornelius, he designed (1825\u20138) many frescoes for the new buildings at Munich, including \"Apollo and the Muses\", for the ceiling of the Odeon; designs from [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]]'s Battle of Hermann\", and from [[Goethe]]'s and [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]]'s poems, for the royal palace; purely classical illustrations of the story of Amor and Psyche, for the palace of Duke Max; and many allegorical figures for the arcades of the palace garden.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nEarly in the series of his multitudinous works came the famous ''Narrenhaus'', the appalling memories of a certain madhouse near D\u00fcsseldorf; the composition all the more deserves mention for points of contact with [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]]. Somewhat to the same category belong the illustrations to ''[[Reineke Fuchs]]''.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|p=698}} After ''Narrenhaus'', his next great work, the ''Battle of the Huns'', or ''Spectre Battle'', representing the legend of the continued combat in mid-air between the spirits of the Huns and of Romans who had fallen before the walls of Rome, exhibited on the largest scale his talent for the symbolical and allegorical. Count Raczynski commissioned him to paint the work in sepia, and he finished it in 1837. The king of Saxony now offered him the direction of the academy of Dresden, with a salary of 2,000 thalers; but Kaulbach preferred to remain in Munich, although he received only 800 florins from the king of Bavaria.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThese works, together with occasional figures or passages in complex pictorial dramas, show how dominant and irrepressible were the artists sense of satire and enjoyment of fun; character in its breadth and sharpness is depicted with keenest relish, and at times the sardonic smile bursts into the loudest laugh. Thus occasionally the grotesque degenerates into the vulgar, the grand into the ridiculous, as in the satire on \"The Pigtail Age\", a fresco outside the [[New Pinakothek]]. Yet these exceptional extravagances came not of weakness but from excess of power. Kaulbach tried hard to become Grecian and Italian; but he never reached [[Phidias]] or Raphael; in short the blood of [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]] and [[Martin Sch\u00f6ngauer]] ran strong in his veins.

With regard to these examples of the Munich school, it was asserted that Kaulbach had been unfortunate  alike in having found Cornelius for a master and King Ludwig for a patron, that he attempted subjects far beyond him, believing that his admiration for them was the same as inspiration; and supplied the lack of real imagination by a compound of intellect and fancy. Nevertheless, in such compositions as the ''Destruction of Jerusalem'' and the ''Battle of the Huns'', Kaulbach shows creative imagination. As a dramatic poet he tells the story, depicts character, seizes on action and situation, and thus as it were takes the spectator by storm. The manner may be occasionally noisy and ranting, but the effect after its kind is tremendous. The cartoon, which, as usual in German art of the time, is superior to the ultimate picture, was executed in the artist's prime at the age of thirty.

The flight crew failed to arm the automatic [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]] system, which automatically moves the spoiler control lever and deploys the spoilers upon landing.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|15\u201316}} The pilots also failed to set the plane's automatic braking system.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|21}} The flight crew also failed to set [[Flap (aeronautics)|landing flaps]], another item on the pre-flight checklist, but as the plane descended past {{convert|1000|feet|m}}, the first officer realized the flaps were not set and the flight crew set a 40-degree flap setting for landing.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|123}}\n\nAt 23:49:32, the controller issued the last weather report before Flight 1420 landed, advising that winds at the airport were 330 degrees at 25 knots.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|6}} The reported winds exceeded the MD-82's 20-knot crosswind limit for landing in reduced visibility on a wet runway.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|3}} Despite the excessive crosswind and two wind-shear reports, Captain Buschmann did not abandon the aircraft's approach into Little Rock, instead deciding to continue the approach to 4R.\n\n==Crash==\n[[File:AA1420Little rock airplane web.ogv|thumb|Simulation of the landing]] \nThe aircraft touched down on Runway 4R at 23:50:20. About two seconds after the wheels touched down, First Officer Origel stated, \"We're down. We're sliding!\" Because the pilots failed to arm the autospoiler, the spoilers did not deploy automatically on landing, and the flight crew did not deploy them manually.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|167}} Autospoilers and autobrakes are essential to ensure the plane's ability to stop within the confines of a wet runway, especially one that is being subjected to strong and gusting winds. Spoilers disrupt the airflow over the wings, prevent them from generating lift, and cause more of the plane's weight to be borne by the landing gear. About 65 percent of Flight 1420's weight would have been supported by the plane's landing gear if the spoilers had been deployed, but without the spoilers this number dropped to only 15 percent.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|134}} With the light loading of the landing gear, the aircraft's brakes were ineffective at slowing down the plane, which continued down the runway at high speed.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|134\u2013135}} Directional control was lost when Captain Buschmann applied too much reverse thrust, which reduced the effectiveness of the plane's rudder and vertical stabilizer.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|135\u2013136}}\n\nThe aircraft continued past the end of the runway, traveling another 800 feet and striking a security fence and an ILS localizer array. The aircraft then collided with a structure built to support the approach lights for Runway 22L, which extended out into the [[Arkansas River]].<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|43}} Such structures are usually [[wikt:frangible|frangible]], designed to shear off on impact, but because the approach lights were located on the unstable river bank, they were firmly anchored.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|159}}  The collision with the sturdy structure crushed the airplane's nose and destroyed the left side of the plane's fuselage, from the cockpit back to the first two rows of coach seating.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|159}} The impact broke the aircraft apart into large sections, which came to a rest short of the river bank.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|43}}\n\nCaptain Buschmann and 10 of the plane's 139 passengers died in the crash, including two passengers who died in the hospital in the weeks that followed.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|47}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2001/apr/11/flight-1420-plaintiff-sobbingly-testifies-about-he/ |title=Flight 1420 plaintiff sobbingly testifies about her distress |last=Harter |first=Andrea |newspaper=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette |date=April 11, 2001 |accessdate=March 10, 2016}}</ref> First Officer Origel, three of the four flight attendants, and 41 passengers sustained serious injuries, the remaining flight attendant and 64 passengers sustained minor injuries, and 24 passengers sustained no injuries.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|47}}\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe [[National Transportation Safety Board|National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)]] investigated the crash.\n\n===Automatic spoiler and brake systems===\nThe NTSB conducted extensive testing to determine whether the automatic spoiler and brake systems had been armed by the pilots before landing.\n\nThe plane's [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR) was reviewed, and no sounds consistent with the spoiler arming or automatically deploying were recorded by the CVR.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|42}} The NTSB conducted two test flights of American Airlines MD-80 aircraft, which confirmed that manually arming the spoiler created an audible click noise, distinguishable from that made by automatic deployment of the system, that could be clearly heard on CVR playback.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|42}} The NTSB also conducted ground tests on similar aircraft, including another American Airlines MD-80 for which the autospoiler system failed to deploy during a runway overrun, an event in [[Palm Springs, California]] that did not result in destruction of the aircraft.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|55}}\n\nAfter Flight 1420 and the Palm Springs incident, American Airlines revised its checklist so that pilots would confirm that the spoilers are armed for auto-deployment before landing, confirm spoiler deployment and deploy spoilers manually if they had failed to automatically deploy.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|87}}<ref name=\"Racing the Storm\">{{Cite episode |title=Racing the Storm|series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]|network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Channel]]|season=1|number=2|year=2003}}</ref>\n\n===Pilot behavior regarding thunderstorms===\nThe NTSB investigation also focused on pilot behavior in inclement weather, to determine the impact the storms may have had on the pilots' decision-making process while approaching Little Rock National Airport.\n\nExperts from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]] performed a study recording behavior of pilots landing at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport,<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|142}} which aimed to see whether pilots were willing to land in thunderstorms. From a total of 1,952 thunderstorm encounters, 1,310 pilots (67 percent) flew into thunderstorms during landing attempts.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|142}} The study found that pilots exhibited more recklessness if they fell behind schedule, if they were attempting to land at night and if aircraft in front of them successfully landed in similar weather. In a later interview, [[Greg Feith]], the lead NTSB investigator, said he was surprised to learn that pilots exhibited this behavior.<ref name=\"Racing the Storm\" /> Feith added that the pilots may have exhibited \"get there-itis\" as the pilots knew that they were approaching their 14-hour duty limits.<ref name=\"Racing the Storm\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Rhoda|first=D.A.|title=An Assessment of Thunderstorm Penetrations and Deviations by Commercial Aircraft in the Terminal Area|url=http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/aviation/publications/publication-files/nasa-reports/Rhoda_1999_NASA-A2_WW-10087.pdf|author2=Pawlak, M.L.|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT Lincoln Laboratory]]|date=June 3, 1999|accessdate=March 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204003134/http://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/aviation/publications/publication-files/nasa-reports/Rhoda_1999_NASA-A2_WW-10087.pdf|archive-date=February 4, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Fatigue===\nThe NTSB report cited fatigue as a contributing factor.

In the lawsuits, the passengers sought compensatory and punitive damages from American Airlines.\n\nJudge Woods separated the passenger cases into those involving domestic and international passengers, because different laws governed the rights of the claimants in each category. For example, passengers traveling on international tickets were prohibited by an international treaty (the [[Warsaw Convention]]) from recovering punitive damages. Therefore, Woods ruled that only the domestic passengers would be permitted to pursue punitive damages claims.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=In Re Air Crash at Little Rock, Ark., on June 1, 1999 |vol=109 |reporter=F.Supp.2d |opinion=1022 |pinpoint=1024 |court=E.D.Ark. |date=2000 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/109/1022/2522798/ |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |quote= }}</ref>\n\nThe compensatory damages claims proceeded first.

About two seconds after the wheels touched down, First Officer Origel stated, \"We're down. We're sliding!\" Because the pilots failed to arm the autospoiler, the spoilers did not deploy automatically on landing, and the flight crew did not deploy them manually.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|167}} Autospoilers and autobrakes are essential to ensure the plane's ability to stop within the confines of a wet runway, especially one that is being subjected to strong and gusting winds. Spoilers disrupt the airflow over the wings, prevent them from generating lift, and cause more of the plane's weight to be borne by the landing gear. About 65 percent of Flight 1420's weight would have been supported by the plane's landing gear if the spoilers had been deployed, but without the spoilers this number dropped to only 15 percent.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|134}} With the light loading of the landing gear, the aircraft's brakes were ineffective at slowing down the plane, which continued down the runway at high speed.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|134\u2013135}} Directional control was lost when Captain Buschmann applied too much reverse thrust, which reduced the effectiveness of the plane's rudder and vertical stabilizer.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-01-02\" />{{rp|135\u2013136}}\n\nThe aircraft continued past the end of the runway, traveling another 800 feet and striking a security fence and an ILS localizer array.

is structurally related to [[anesthetic]] medications of the [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA) class which includes [[procaine]] and [[tetracaine]].<ref name=\"Tessalon label\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Procaine and tetracaine, previously used heavily in [[dentistry]] and [[anesthesiology]] fields, have fallen out of favor due to allergies associated with their metabolites.<ref name=\":1\" /> Severe hypersensitivity reactions to benzonatate, including [[bronchospasm]], [[laryngospasm]], and [[Circulatory collapse|cardiovascular collapse]], are have been reported and are possibly related to local anesthesia from sucking or chewing on the capsule instead of swallowing it.<ref name=\"Tessalon label\" />\n\n=== Improper use ===\nBenzonatate should be swallowed whole.<ref name=\"Tessalon label\" /> Chewing or sucking on the liquid-filled capsule, or \"[[softgel]],\" will cause release of benzonatate from the capsule and can produce a temporary [[local anesthesia]] of the oral mucosa.<ref name=\"Tessalon label\" /> Rapid development of numbness of the tongue and choking can occur.<ref name=\"Tessalon label\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> In severe cases, excessive absorption can lead to [[laryngospasm]], [[bronchospasm]], and [[circulatory collapse]].<ref name=\"Tessalon label\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> This may be due to a hypersensitivity reaction to benzonatate or a systemic [[local anesthetic]] toxicity, both of which have similar symptoms.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n=== Psychiatric effects ===\nIsolated cases of bizarre behavior, mental confusion, and visual hallucinations have been reported during concurrent use with other prescribed medications.<ref name=\"Tessalon label\" /> [[Central nervous system]] effects associated with other [[4-Aminobenzoic acid|para-aminobenozic acid]] (PABA) derivative local anesthetics, for example [[procaine]] or [[tetracaine]], could occur with benzonatate and should be considered.<ref name=\"AHFS2019\" />\n\n=== Children ===\nSafety and
