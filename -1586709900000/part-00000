Under the management of [[Gordon Strachan]] he proved himself to be a solid defensive midfielder, helping the attacking [[Dion Dublin|Dublin]]-[[Darren Huckerby|Huckerby]] Coventry side of 1998 finish eleventh in the [[Premier League]] and enjoy mid table stability. He is still fondly remembered by Sky Blues fans as being responsible for breaking one of Coventry's longstanding hoodoo's-victory at [[Villa Park]]: Boateng scored twice in the 4\u20131 win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at Villa Park on 27 February 1999, ending Coventry's 63-year-long wait for a league win at the ground.\n\nThe next season Boateng transferred to Aston Villa for \u00a34.5 million. He proceeded to play 131 matches for Villa, including an [[FA Cup]] final defeat against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2000. The tough-tackling central midfielder then fell out with manager [[Graham Taylor (football manager)|Graham Taylor]] in the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302]] season. After a move to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] collapsed due to demands from agents, and in spite of interest from [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2301509/The-Footballers-Football-Column--George-Boateng-Steve-McClaren-best-manager-I-played-under.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=GEORGE BOATENG: England fans may not agree but Steve McClaren is the best boss I have played for... and when I hang up my boots my dream is to manage Aston Villa}}</ref> that summer Boateng completed a \u00a35 million move to Middlesbrough.\n\nBoateng made his full debut on the first day of the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] season away to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in an uneventful game that finished 0\u20130. Occupying the defensive midfield position, he became the solid platform upon which Middlesbrough built their attack. He recovered from an ankle operation in the summer of 2003 to be fit for the start of the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304]] season. That season, he was part of the Middlesbrough team which lifted the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] for the first time.\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] season, he scored his first goal for Middlesbrough in a 4\u20130 win at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 16 October 2004. However, he was injured for eight weeks with a broken toe; during this period, Middlesbrough dropped from fourth down to ninth in the league. He did recover in time to help Middlesbrough obtain the results they needed for qualification for the [[UEFA Cup]]. In a poll on the official Boro website, fans voted him the player most missed due to injury in the 2004\u201305 season. He started for Middlesbrough in the [[2006 UEFA Cup Final]].\n\nIn June 2006 he signed a new three-year contract with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. He was announced as the new club captain on 21 July 2006, replacing [[Gareth Southgate]], who had been promoted to manager. On 10 March 2007, he scored in an [[FA Cup]] tie against league leaders [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], his first goal in the tournament since 1999 when he scored for Coventry against Macclesfield Town.\n\nOn 22 January 2008, Boateng had his captaincy rescinded by Gareth Southgate. Southgate cited his desire for Boateng to \"concentrate on his game\". He was replaced as captain by [[Emanuel Pogatetz]].\n\n[[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] announced on 10 July 2008 that Boateng had agreed to sign a contract with them.<ref>{{cite news | date=10 July 2008 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/7498807.stm | title=Hull agree contract with Boateng | publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport | accessdate=10 June 2008}}</ref> The move was completed on 16 July, after the completion of a medical.\nOn 6 February 2010, Boateng scored his first career goal for Hull City in a 2\u20131 win over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], their first win since November 2009.<ref>{{cite news |date=6 February 2010| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8498610.stm| title=Hull 2\u20131 Man City|publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nBoateng's contract with Hull City came to an end following their relegation from the Premier League in 2010.

Under the management of [[Gordon Strachan]] he proved himself to be a solid defensive midfielder, helping the attacking [[Dion Dublin|Dublin]]-[[Darren Huckerby|Huckerby]] Coventry side of 1998 finish eleventh in the [[Premier League]] and enjoy mid table stability. He is still fondly remembered by Sky Blues fans as being responsible for breaking one of Coventry's longstanding hoodoo's-victory at [[Villa Park]]: Boateng scored twice in the 4\u20131 win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at Villa Park on 27 February 1999, ending Coventry's 63-year-long wait for a league win at the ground.\n\nThe next season Boateng transferred to Aston Villa for \u00a34.5 million. He proceeded to play 131 matches for Villa, including an [[FA Cup]] final defeat against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2000. The tough-tackling central midfielder then fell out with manager [[Graham Taylor (football manager)|Graham Taylor]] in the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302]] season. After a move to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] collapsed due to demands from agents, and in spite of interest from [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2301509/The-Footballers-Football-Column--George-Boateng-Steve-McClaren-best-manager-I-played-under.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=GEORGE BOATENG: England fans may not agree but Steve McClaren is the best boss I have played for... and when I hang up my boots my dream is to manage Aston Villa}}</ref> that summer Boateng completed a \u00a35 million move to Middlesbrough.\n\nBoateng made his full debut on the first day of the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] season away to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in an uneventful game that finished 0\u20130. Occupying the defensive midfield position, he became the solid platform upon which Middlesbrough built their attack. He recovered from an ankle operation in the summer of 2003 to be fit for the start of the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304]] season. That season, he was part of the Middlesbrough team which lifted the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] for the first time.\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]] season, he scored his first goal for Middlesbrough in a 4\u20130 win at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 16 October 2004. However, he was injured for eight weeks with a broken toe; during this period, Middlesbrough dropped from fourth down to ninth in the league. He did recover in time to help Middlesbrough obtain the results they needed for qualification for the [[UEFA Cup]]. In a poll on the official Boro website, fans voted him the player most missed due to injury in the 2004\u201305 season. He started for Middlesbrough in the [[2006 UEFA Cup Final]].\n\nIn June 2006 he signed a new three-year contract with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. He was announced as the new club captain on 21 July 2006, replacing [[Gareth Southgate]], who had been promoted to manager. On 10 March 2007, he scored in an [[FA Cup]] tie against league leaders [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], his first goal in the tournament since 1999 when he scored for Coventry against Macclesfield Town.\n\nOn 22 January 2008, Boateng had his captaincy rescinded by Gareth Southgate. Southgate cited his desire for Boateng to \"concentrate on his game\". He was replaced as captain by [[Emanuel Pogatetz]].\n\n[[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] announced on 10 July 2008 that Boateng had agreed to sign a contract with them.<ref>{{cite news | date=10 July 2008 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/7498807.stm | title=Hull agree contract with Boateng | publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport | accessdate=10 June 2008}}</ref> The move was completed on 16 July, after the completion of a medical.\nOn 6 February 2010, Boateng scored his first career goal for Hull City in a 2\u20131 win over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], their first win since November 2009.<ref>{{cite news |date=6 February 2010| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8498610.stm| title=Hull 2\u20131 Man City|publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nBoateng's contract with Hull City came to an end following their relegation from the Premier League in 2010.

The registration identifier is a numeric or alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies the vehicle within the issuing authority's database. In Europe most countries have adopted a format for number plates that satisfies the requirements in the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]], which states that cross-border vehicles must display a distinguishing code for the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle. This sign may be an oval sticker placed separately from the registration plate, or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate.

This blue strip has the [[Flag of Europe|EU flag]] symbol (twelve yellow stars), along with the [[List of international license plate codes|country code]] of the member state in which the vehicle is registered. All EU countries now issue plates in the common format, but the use of the EU flag on registration plates is optional for member states.\n*EU member states that require foreign vehicles to display a distinguishing sign of the country of origin are obliged by Article 3 of EC 2411/98 to accept the standard design as a distinguishing sign when displayed on a vehicle registered in another member state. The requirement to display a distinguishing sign stems from the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, and the regulation is referencing the recognition of distinguishing signs according to that convention.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* EU format plates are either white or yellow, on a plate wider than it is tall. Yellow registration plates are used both front and rear in [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]. [[Denmark]] and [[Hungary]] use yellow plates for vehicles registered as commercial vehicles. [[Denmark]] implemented the EU format on a voluntary basis in 2009.<ref>http://www.skat.dk/SKAT.aspx?oId=1815328&vId=0 (d\u00e4nisch)</ref> Danish plates have a small holographic strip to the right of the blue EU strip. In [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]],  [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Sweden]] yellow plates are used for taxi vehicles.\n*[[Belgium]] uses red characters and is the only country not to use the standard black-on-white or black-on-yellow combination; with the introduction of European-style plates in November 2010, a slightly darker shade of red was chosen (RAL 3003) to improve legibility.\n*Most European countries use metal plates, however [[France]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] use a mixture of flat plastic and metal plates. Flat plastic plates have earlier also been used in [[Sweden]].\n\n=== Other countries ===\nSeveral non-EU European states have implemented formats similar to the EU format, with national flags or symbols in place of the circle of stars. Vehicles with such number plates, issued in countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, do not need to display the [[List of international vehicle registration codes|white oval international vehicle registration code]] while within countries signatory to the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*[[Vehicle registration plates of Norway|Norway]] is an example of such a state, issuing europlates with the Norwegian flag replacing the circle of stars and the country code (N). In Norway, regular number plates are white with black characters, however, cars with front seats only (used for carrying goods) have green plates with black characters. Norwegian registration plates are made of metal, but flat plastic plates has also been used earlier. [[Ukraine]] issues plates similar to the Norwegian ones, with the Ukrainian flag above the country code (UA). [[Moldova|Moldovan]] registration plates have a wider than usual blue band with the Moldovan flag and the international country code MD. [[Albania|Albanian]] number plates has a [[double-headed eagle]] above the country code (AL).\n*[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] issues plates with a blue strip on the left side of the plate with the country code (BIH), but without the EU-stars or any other symbol. So does [[Vehicle registration plates of Turkey|Turkey]] (TR) (which is in a customs union with the EU), [[Montenegro]] (MNE), [[North Macedonia]] (NMK) and [[Serbia]] (SRB). \n*[[Vehicle registration plates of Iceland|Iceland]] issues plates with the Icelandic flag above the country code (IS) on the left side, but without the blue strip. Iceland, however, is not party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. [[Belarus]] issues plates similar to the Icelandic plates, with the national flag above the country code on the left side, but without the blue strip.\n*[[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]] uses registration plates with their coat of arms above the respective country codes (AND and MC). [[San Marino]] issues similar plates but with the text \"Repubblica di San Marino\" underneath the coat of arms, instead of the country code (RSM).\n* Of those states that joined in the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union]] Malta already used europlates, while Latvia, Poland and Lithuania had used EU number plates displaying the [[national flag]] before their accession, as did [[Vehicle registration plates of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[Vehicle registration plates of Romania|Romania]] before their [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|accession in 2007]].\n* Vehicles registered in Great Britain are authorised by the nation's [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]]<ref name=\"dvla2001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@motor/documents/digitalasset/dg_067666.pdf|title=INF104: Vehicle registration numbers and number plates|author=DVLA|date=27 April 2009|format=PDF|accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref> to use number plates featuring the [[national flag]] of [[Flag of England|England]], [[Flag of Scotland|Scotland]] or [[Flag of Wales|Wales]], or alternatively the [[Union Flag]], together with the code names \"ENG\", \"Eng\", \"ENGLAND\" or \"England\" for the English flag, \"SCO\", \"Sco\", \"SCOTLAND\" or \"Scotland\" for the Scottish flag, \"CYM\", \"Cym\", \"CYMRU\" , \"Cymru\", \"WALES\" or \"Wales\" for the Welsh flag, \"GB\", \"GREAT BRITAIN\", \"Great Britain\", \"UK\" ,\"UNITED KINGDOM\" or \"United Kingdom for the Union Flag respectively. Motorists with vehicles registered in [[Northern Ireland]] are not permitted to display the letters NI alongside any flag; only the Union Flag alongside GB/UK or the EU format (featuring in this case the letters GB), being optionally permitted.<ref>http://www.parliament.uk/Templates/BriefingPapers/Pages/BPPdfDownload.aspx?bp-id=SN01328</ref> \n*The UK government state that these are not recognised in other countries, and therefore a motorist who drives a vehicle abroad displaying these plates must also affix a \"GB\" sticker. However, after the UK ratified the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] in 2018, number plates with the distinguishing code \"GB\" featuring the [[Union Jack]] (flag of the UK) should be valid in other countries party to named convention, as such number plate displays a distinguishing code for the country (GB) of registration incorporated into the vehicle registration plate, and is supplemented with a flag or emblem of the national state, and hence satisfies the requirements set out in the convention.<ref>https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/conventn/Conv_road_traffic_EN.pdf</ref>\n*The British Overseas Territory of [[Gibraltar]] uses registration plates in the EU format. The [[Crown dependencies]] of [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]] have registration plates that are different from those used in the UK. [[Guernsey]] plates sometimes contain the letters '''GBG''' below the Guernsey flag on the left side. [[Jersey]] number plates may incorporate the [[coat of arms of Jersey]] in a white strip on the left, along with the country identifier '''GBJ,''' and since 2004 Manx plates may incorporate the Manx flag and the international country identification code '''GBM'''.\n*[[Gibraltar]] and the [[United Kingdom]] uses yellow plates at the rear and white at the front. The [[United Kingdom]] use a mixture of flat plastic and metal plates (the United Kingdom mostly uses flat plastic plates)\n\n===Common letter and digit systems between countries===\nSeveral countries have made efforts to avoid duplicating registration numbers used by other countries. This is not completely successful and there are occasional difficulties in connection with parking fines and automatic speed cameras.\n\n* Belgium (until 2010), Cyprus, Finland, Georgia (until 2014), Hungary, Lithuania, [[Malta]], Sweden (since 1974), and Moldova (since 2014) each use combinations of first three letters and then three digits.\n* Bulgaria uses plate numbers in the form A[A]-0000-AA, i.e. one or two letters representing the region, then four digits, then two more letters. All letters used are intersection of Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, i.e. A, B, C, E, H, K, M, O, P, T, X and Y.\n* Greece uses a combination of three letters (which are chosen from the 14 character shapes which appear in both the Latin and the Greek alphabet (but not necessarily with the same sound values), i.e. A, B, E, Z, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, T, Y, X in Greek alphabetic order) and four numbers, in the form of AAA-0000, while [[Spain]] uses a four number-three letter combination, in the form of 0000 BBB (vowels and some maybe confusing consonants, like \u00d1 and Q, are not used)\n* Denmark and Norway use two letters and five digits, while trailers use two letters and four digits. The plates look very similar, but Denmark has a red border around the plate. Use of the country code on the plate may mitigate this problem (Norway began using the system on 1 November 2006). Denmark has begun running out of combinations in this style and has now introduced combinations previously reserved for the Faroe Islands for EU style number plates (which will use different letters from non-EU style plates).\n* The Netherlands (until 2008) and Portugal both use three groups of two characters (letters or numbers) in several sequences: <code>AB-12-CD</code>, <code>12-34-AB</code>, <code>12-AB-34</code>, <code>AB-12-34</code>, etc. However, Portuguese plates have a white background, while those of Netherlands (after 1 January 1978) have a yellow one, though both countries also use white letters on blue plates for [[classic car]]s. Furthermore, newer plates on Dutch vehicles only contain consonants, to avoid coincidental abbreviations or words. Also some sensitive letter combinations, such as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] or [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], are not used. The combination 'AA' is reserved for cars of the royal family. Dutch company registered bus, truck and/or minivan plates always start with a <code>B</code> or a <code>V</code>. Dutch taxis use blue registration plates. The number of new combinations ran out in 2008. New registered cars in the Netherlands now use the format of two digits-three letters-one digit (<code>12-ABC-3</code>).\n* Belgium used the sequence <code>ABC-123</code> between 1973 and 2008. When these combinations ran out in 2008, the inverse sequence <code>123-ABC</code> was adopted, with the first plate in the new series issued on 25 June 2008. With the introduction of the European format on 15 November 2010, a seven-character combination <code>1-ABC-234</code> is used and the previous <code>123-ABC</code> was discontinued. However, the six-character plates will remain valid, and no date is set for their expiration. Since Belgian plates are linked to an owner rather than to a vehicle, these older plates are likely to remain in use for a considerable time. As a way to phase out the six-character plates, future vehicle subscriptions will only be possible on the seven-character plates. Private numbers, not following any notation, are also allowed.\n* Luxembourg standard plates use two letters and four digits (<code>AB 1234</code>). Plates with 5 digits (<code>12345</code>) and 4 digits (<code>1234</code>) are also issued upon request. Older series with two letters and three digits (<code>AB 123</code>), and one letter and 4 digits (<code>A 1234</code>) are no longer issued but are still in use. Special plates for diplomats, the government, the grand-ducal family, military vehicles and temporary registrations exist and follow [[Vehicle registration plates of Luxembourg|specific rules]]. Two letters and three digits (<code>AB 123</code>) is also used in Northern Cyprus, and until 1973 it was used on the entire island of Cyprus. \n* Current registrations allocated in [[Romania]] and the United Kingdom (where the registration contains two digits) are both of the form AB12 CDE. The Romanian rear plates are white whereas UK ones are yellow. There is also a difference in the spacing and the font. In 2010, Bucharest, the capital of Romania, adopted the form B 123 AAA, three digits and three letters, because the number of cars had risen. In the United Kingdom, B123 AAA was issued to cars registered from August 1984 to August 1985. Aside from this, some county codes can clash (SV, in Romania it stands for [[Suceava]], and in the United Kingdom, it stands for [[Aberdeen]]).\n* Until 1973/74 the Swedish pattern was one letter representing the l\u00e4n (county) where the car was first registered, followed by four or five digits. However, in the more populated l\u00e4n, a second letter was introduced over time. For example, vehicles from southernmost county got the letter M + five digits, later also MA + five digits, MB + five digits etc. A problem was that the two northernmost counties had already been given two letters, the letter prefixes AC and BD, as the number of usable letters exceeded the number of counties. The ABC 123 system was introduced gradually from July 1973 until June 1974.\n* Slovakia uses AB 123CD and Serbia and Croatia uses AB 123-CD (in both cases also other patterns are possible). All three countries use a coat of arms after first two letters, and the fonts and colors also look very similar. The plates can be easily distinguished by country code on the blue strip on left.Croatia and Serbia uses \u010c,\u0160,\u017d for some municipality codes while in Slovakia C,S,Z are used instead.\n\nThere are also many municipality codes that are same in all three countries.\n\n*[[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]], currently not members of the EU, used the following: MM 12-34, MM 123-45 or MM 123-456 (MM being two letter abbreviation of [[Serbia and Montenegro#Administrative divisions|municipality]]), and having state flag (of [[FR Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]], later [[Serbia and Montenegro]]) between municipality and numbers. Montenegro left that system in 2007, and introduced new format: MM AB 123, with [[Coat of arms of Montenegro|Montenegrin coat of arms]] in circular shape between municipality and letter sequence. Blue strip with MNE country code is placed in the left side, with vacant place for EU stars, in case of joining the Union. Serbia also uses new system since 2011. with blue strip country code SRB: MM 123-AB and MM 1234-AB, with [[Coat of arms of Serbia|Serbian coat of arms]] between municipality and number sequence. The first two letters on the Serbian plates represent the municipality code, written in Latin letters, and repeated in Cyrillic characters with small letters under the coat of arms. The following system is used for taxi vehicles: BG 123 TX or BG 1234 TX and recently even BG 12345 TX, where a TX combination is reserved for this purpose only (another taxi vehicles have private vehicle plates). Since 2017, Serbia stopped issuing plates with last two letters containing W, Q, Y, X (except TX), \u010c, \u0106, \u0160, \u017d, and \u0110, however Serbian Latin letters with diacritics are still used to mark the municipality code, like \u010cA for \u010ca\u010dak or \u0160A for \u0160abac.\n* Poland and the United Kingdom have both used AAA 123A.  In Poland these were issued from 1976-2000, in the UK, they were issued from 1963-1983, with those issued prior to 1973 being the same colour as their Polish counterparts (white on black).  These plates are still valid in both countries.\n\n===Differing numbering systems===\nIndividual European countries use differing numbering schemes and text [[font]]s:\n\n* Most countries, including [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Switzerland]] (formerly also [[Sweden]] until 1974, [[Italy]] until 1994, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] until 1998, [[Lithuania]] and [[Spain]]  until 2000, [[Estonia]] until 2004 and [[Albania]] until 2011, also former countries [[East Germany]]  until 1990, [[Soviet Union]]  until 1991, [[Czechoslovakia]] until 1993, [[Yugoslavia]] until 1998 and [[Serbia and Montenegro]] until 2011), have systems in which there is a direct link between a letter or letters appearing on the plate and the town or district where the plate was issued (e.g. ''\"B\"'' and ''\"M\"'' in Germany for [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]], ''\"TN\"'' and ''\"ZV\"'' in [[Slovakia]] for [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]] and [[Zvolen]], ''\"BG\"'' and ''\"KG\"'' in Serbia for [[Belgrade]] and [[Kragujevac]] and \"''AX''\" and \"''KY''\" in Greece for [[Achaea]] and [[Corfu]]). Some countries, including Austria, Germany, Slovenia, and Switzerland, even include a regional or municipal coat of arms on the plate, but Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovakia include a national coat of arms. In Ireland, all plates have the name of the county of registration in [[Irish language|Irish]] in smaller letters on the top.\n*[[France]] (until 2009), and [[Turkey]] and [[Russia]] (since October 2013) use a system with an indirect number relation to the car's place of registration.  Formerly in France, the last two characters on a plate comprised the [[Departments of France#Current departments|departmental code]] of registration.  This pattern was discontinued, but in response to popular outcry, France added a second color bar, on the right edge of the plate, where the departmental code (no longer a part of the plate number) appears.\n* The [[United Kingdom|UK]] uses a [[Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom|system]] based on the region where the car was first registered and the date of registration, for example CA52 GJK, where the \"''C''\" stands for [[Wales]] (the name of that country in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] being [[Cymru]]), the \"''A''\" stands for [[Cardiff]] (the letters A-O assigned to the city), and the \"''52''\" means that the car was registered in the period September 2002 to February 2003.\n*[[Belgium]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], Estonia (after 2004), [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Latvia]], Lithuania (after 2000), [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]] and Sweden (after 1974) use plates that do not denote the location where the car is registered. Since 2000 Spain no longer uses province codes on plates but codes like 'B' for [[Barcelona]] or 'M' for [[Madrid]] can still be seen, for cars registered before that date. Italy, also, did not use the province codes on plates between 1994 and 1999.\n* Italy, since 1999, has added a blue strip on either side. On the right one are the two digits of the year when the plate was issued (e.g. \"99\", \"05\", \"08\") and below that there may be an optional two-letter code for the province, such as \"MO\" for the [[Province of Modena]]. Albania and France have adopted similar formats.\n* Portuguese registration plates since late 1998 have an yellow strip on the right side, with one number at the top and another at the bottom separated by a line, respectively the year and month of the vehicle's registration.\n* Irish registration plates also contain the year in which the vehicle was registered. A car registered in 2008 would have the format 08-XX-XXXX. In 2013, this was updated to specify which half of the year the registration occurred. So from January to June, the registration plate would show (for 2018) 181-XX-XXXX, whereas from July to December, the plate instead shows 182-XX-XXXX.\n* Turkish registration plates consist of letters and digits in combinations of 99 AB 999, 99 A 9999, 99 ABC 99, 99 AB 9999 or 99 A 99999 where the first two digits show which province the vehicle is registered from. First two digits numbers go from 01 to 81 (as there are 81 provinces in Turkey) and each one is assigned to a province with alphabetical order e.g. 01 is the code of the province Adana or 34 is the code of the province Istanbul. All 81 provinces uses \"01 AB 123\" style plates initially until all combinations ran out, then the province starts to use 01 A 1234 then 01 ABC 12 etc. As a result, three largest provinces i.e. Istanbul, Ankara and \u0130zmir are currently issuing 99 AB 9999 style plates since they used all combinations of previous series but the province Sivas for example, still issues 99 AB 999 plates as having a modest population and number of vehicles. 99 A 99999 series are not regular since they are only used in provinces where commercial vehicles are abundant e.g. Bursa to distinguish these vehicles there from passenger cars. Letters \"I\" and \"O\" are only used in the middle 01 ABC 12 series e.g. 34 YOC 34 or 06 TIL 56 to avoid confusion with numerals \"1\" and \"0\" respectively. Also some letters combinations like \"PKK\" are not issued due to their referring to political organizations or words likely to cause offence.\n\n==Cross-border traffic==\nAccording to the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]], vehicles in cross-border traffic are obliged to display a [[List of international vehicle registration codes|distinguishing sign of the country of registration]] on the rear of the vehicle. This sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate or, after the convention was amended in 2006, may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate. One of the main benefits of the convention for motorists is the obligation on signatory countries to recognise the legality of vehicles from other signatory countries. The following requirements must be met when driving outside the country of registration:\n\n* The physical requirements for the separate sign are defined in Annex 3 of the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]], which states that the letters shall be in black on a white background having the shape of an ellipse with the major axis horizontal. The distinguishing sign should not be affixed in such a way that it could be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility.\n* When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organisation to which the country belongs. The distinguishing sign should be displayed on the far left or far right on the registration plate. When a symbol/flag/emblem is also displayed, the distinguishing sign shall obligatory be placed on the far left on the plate. The distinguishing sign shall be positioned so to be easy identifiable and so that it cannot be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility. The distinguishing sign shall therefore be at least a different colour from the registration number, or have a different background colour to that reserved for the registration number, or be clearly separated from the registration number, preferably with a line.<ref name=\"international-driving-permit.com\" />\n\nThe common EU format of having a blue section on the extreme left with EU circle of stars and the country code was introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 2411/98 of 3 November 1998 and entered into force on the 11 November 1998. According to Article 3 of the regulation shall member states that require vehicles registered in another member state to display a distinguishing registration sign also recognize distinguishing signs issued in accordance with the regulation (the common EU format).<ref name=\":1\" /> After the amendment of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic in 2006, registration plates issued in the common EU format also satisfies the requirements of the named convention and hence is also valid in all countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. \n\nAfter Brexit, The European Commission has confirmed that after Brexit, British cars with number plates with the distinguishing sign incorporated do not need a separate sign when driving in EU countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. If the number plate does not include the distinguishing sign, or if the vehicle is driven in an EU country not party to the Vienna Convention, a separate sign has to be displayed at the rear of the vehicle.

The registration identifier is a numeric or alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies the vehicle within the issuing authority's database. In Europe most countries have adopted a format for number plates that satisfies the requirements in the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]], which states that cross-border vehicles must display a distinguishing code for the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle. This sign may be an oval sticker placed separately from the registration plate, or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate. When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organisation to which the country belongs.<ref name=\"international-driving-permit.com\">http://www.international-driving-permit.com/Convention-on-Road-Traffic/8-November-1968/EN/Annexex/Annex-3-Distinguishing-Sign-of-Motor-Vehicles-and-Trailers-to-International-Traffic.aspx</ref> An example of such format is the common EU format, with the [[Flag of Europe|EU flag]] above the [[List of international license plate codes|country code]] issued in [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]].\n\n==Format==\n[[File:Vehicle registration plates in Europe.png|thumb|Vehicle registration plates in Europe, including dependencies and disputed territories.|500px]]The vast majority of [[Europe]]an countries issue registration plates that are:\n\n* 520 by 110&nbsp;mm (20.5 by 4.3 inches)\n* 520 by 120&nbsp;mm (20.5 by 4.7 inches)\n\nThis is one of the basic standard sizes worldwide.\n\nThe others are:\n\n* 305 by 152&nbsp;mm (12.0 by 6.0 inches)\n* 305 by 160&nbsp;mm (12.0 by 6.3 inches)\n* 372 by 135&nbsp;mm (14.6 by 5.3 inches)\n\nSome European countries use registration plates in other formats: \n\n* 330 by 140&nbsp;mm (13.0 by 5.5 inches) in [[Andorra]]\n* 440 by 120&nbsp;mm (17.3 by 4.7 inches) in  [[Finland]]\n* 260 by 110&nbsp;mm (10.2 by 4.3 inches) in [[Monaco]]\n* 390 by 120&nbsp;mm (15.4 by 4.7 inches) in [[San Marino]]\n* 300 by 80&nbsp;mm (11.8 by 3.1 inches) in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] (only front plates)\n* 360 by 110&nbsp;mm (14.1 by 4.3 inches) in [[Italy]] (only front plates)\n* 390 by 130&nbsp;mm (15.4 by 5.1 inches) and 345 by 130&nbsp;mm (13.5 by 5.1 inches) in [[\u00c5land]]\n\n=== European Union ===\nThe common EU format of having a blue section on the extreme left with EU [[circle of stars]] and the [[List of international vehicle registration codes|country code]] was introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 2411/98 of 3 November 1998<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31998R2411:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 31998R2411 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2016}}</ref> and entered into force on the 11 November 1998.

This blue strip has the [[Flag of Europe|EU flag]] symbol (twelve yellow stars), along with the [[List of international license plate codes|country code]] of the member state in which the vehicle is registered. All EU countries now issue plates in the common format, but the use of the EU flag on registration plates is optional for member states.\n*EU member states that require foreign vehicles to display a distinguishing sign of the country of origin are obliged by Article 3 of EC 2411/98 to accept the standard design as a distinguishing sign when displayed on a vehicle registered in another member state. The requirement to display a distinguishing sign stems from the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, and the regulation is referencing the recognition of distinguishing signs according to that convention.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* EU format plates are either white or yellow, on a plate wider than it is tall. Yellow registration plates are used both front and rear in [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]. [[Denmark]] and [[Hungary]] use yellow plates for vehicles registered as commercial vehicles. [[Denmark]] implemented the EU format on a voluntary basis in 2009.<ref>http://www.skat.dk/SKAT.aspx?oId=1815328&vId=0 (d\u00e4nisch)</ref> Danish plates have a small holographic strip to the right of the blue EU strip. In [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]],  [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Sweden]] yellow plates are used for taxi vehicles.\n*[[Belgium]] uses red characters and is the only country not to use the standard black-on-white or black-on-yellow combination; with the introduction of European-style plates in November 2010, a slightly darker shade of red was chosen (RAL 3003) to improve legibility.\n*Most European countries use metal plates, however [[France]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] use a mixture of flat plastic and metal plates. Flat plastic plates have earlier also been used in [[Sweden]].\n\n=== Other countries ===\nSeveral non-EU European states have implemented formats similar to the EU format, with national flags or symbols in place of the circle of stars. Vehicles with such number plates, issued in countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, do not need to display the [[List of international vehicle registration codes|white oval international vehicle registration code]] while within countries signatory to the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*[[Vehicle registration plates of Norway|Norway]] is an example of such a state, issuing europlates with the Norwegian flag replacing the circle of stars and the country code (N). In Norway, regular number plates are white with black characters, however, cars with front seats only (used for carrying goods) have green plates with black characters. Norwegian registration plates are made of metal, but flat plastic plates has also been used earlier. [[Ukraine]] issues plates similar to the Norwegian ones, with the Ukrainian flag above the country code (UA). [[Moldova|Moldovan]] registration plates have a wider than usual blue band with the Moldovan flag and the international country code MD. [[Albania|Albanian]] number plates has a [[double-headed eagle]] above the country code (AL).\n*[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] issues plates with a blue strip on the left side of the plate with the country code (BIH), but without the EU-stars or any other symbol. So does [[Vehicle registration plates of Turkey|Turkey]] (TR) (which is in a customs union with the EU), [[Montenegro]] (MNE), [[North Macedonia]] (NMK) and [[Serbia]] (SRB). \n*[[Vehicle registration plates of Iceland|Iceland]] issues plates with the Icelandic flag above the country code (IS) on the left side, but without the blue strip. Iceland, however, is not party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. [[Belarus]] issues plates similar to the Icelandic plates, with the national flag above the country code on the left side, but without the blue strip.\n*[[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]] uses registration plates with their coat of arms above the respective country codes (AND and MC). [[San Marino]] issues similar plates but with the text \"Repubblica di San Marino\" underneath the coat of arms, instead of the country code (RSM).\n* Of those states that joined in the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union]] Malta already used europlates, while Latvia, Poland and Lithuania had used EU number plates displaying the [[national flag]] before their accession, as did [[Vehicle registration plates of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[Vehicle registration plates of Romania|Romania]] before their [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|accession in 2007]].\n* Vehicles registered in Great Britain are authorised by the nation's [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]]<ref name=\"dvla2001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@motor/documents/digitalasset/dg_067666.pdf|title=INF104: Vehicle registration numbers and number plates|author=DVLA|date=27 April 2009|format=PDF|accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref> to use number plates featuring the [[national flag]] of [[Flag of England|England]], [[Flag of Scotland|Scotland]] or [[Flag of Wales|Wales]], or alternatively the [[Union Flag]], together with the code names \"ENG\", \"Eng\", \"ENGLAND\" or \"England\" for the English flag, \"SCO\", \"Sco\", \"SCOTLAND\" or \"Scotland\" for the Scottish flag, \"CYM\", \"Cym\", \"CYMRU\" , \"Cymru\", \"WALES\" or \"Wales\" for the Welsh flag, \"GB\", \"GREAT BRITAIN\", \"Great Britain\", \"UK\" ,\"UNITED KINGDOM\" or \"United Kingdom for the Union Flag respectively. Motorists with vehicles registered in [[Northern Ireland]] are not permitted to display the letters NI alongside any flag; only the Union Flag alongside GB/UK or the EU format (featuring in this case the letters GB), being optionally permitted.<ref>http://www.parliament.uk/Templates/BriefingPapers/Pages/BPPdfDownload.aspx?bp-id=SN01328</ref> \n*The UK government state that these are not recognised in other countries, and therefore a motorist who drives a vehicle abroad displaying these plates must also affix a \"GB\" sticker. However, after the UK ratified the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] in 2018, number plates with the distinguishing code \"GB\" featuring the [[Union Jack]] (flag of the UK) should be valid in other countries party to named convention, as such number plate displays a distinguishing code for the country (GB) of registration incorporated into the vehicle registration plate, and is supplemented with a flag or emblem of the national state, and hence satisfies the requirements set out in the convention.<ref>https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/conventn/Conv_road_traffic_EN.pdf</ref>\n*The British Overseas Territory of [[Gibraltar]] uses registration plates in the EU format. The [[Crown dependencies]] of [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]] have registration plates that are different from those used in the UK. [[Guernsey]] plates sometimes contain the letters '''GBG''' below the Guernsey flag on the left side. [[Jersey]] number plates may incorporate the [[coat of arms of Jersey]] in a white strip on the left, along with the country identifier '''GBJ,''' and since 2004 Manx plates may incorporate the Manx flag and the international country identification code '''GBM'''.\n*[[Gibraltar]] and the [[United Kingdom]] uses yellow plates at the rear and white at the front. The [[United Kingdom]] use a mixture of flat plastic and metal plates (the United Kingdom mostly uses flat plastic plates)\n\n===Common letter and digit systems between countries===\nSeveral countries have made efforts to avoid duplicating registration numbers used by other countries. This is not completely successful and there are occasional difficulties in connection with parking fines and automatic speed cameras.\n\n* Belgium (until 2010), Cyprus, Finland, Georgia (until 2014), Hungary, Lithuania, [[Malta]], Sweden (since 1974), and Moldova (since 2014) each use combinations of first three letters and then three digits.\n* Bulgaria uses plate numbers in the form A[A]-0000-AA, i.e. one or two letters representing the region, then four digits, then two more letters. All letters used are intersection of Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, i.e. A, B, C, E, H, K, M, O, P, T, X and Y.\n* Greece uses a combination of three letters (which are chosen from the 14 character shapes which appear in both the Latin and the Greek alphabet (but not necessarily with the same sound values), i.e. A, B, E, Z, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, T, Y, X in Greek alphabetic order) and four numbers, in the form of AAA-0000, while [[Spain]] uses a four number-three letter combination, in the form of 0000 BBB (vowels and some maybe confusing consonants, like \u00d1 and Q, are not used)\n* Denmark and Norway use two letters and five digits, while trailers use two letters and four digits. The plates look very similar, but Denmark has a red border around the plate. Use of the country code on the plate may mitigate this problem (Norway began using the system on 1 November 2006). Denmark has begun running out of combinations in this style and has now introduced combinations previously reserved for the Faroe Islands for EU style number plates (which will use different letters from non-EU style plates).\n* The Netherlands (until 2008) and Portugal both use three groups of two characters (letters or numbers) in several sequences: <code>AB-12-CD</code>, <code>12-34-AB</code>, <code>12-AB-34</code>, <code>AB-12-34</code>, etc. However, Portuguese plates have a white background, while those of Netherlands (after 1 January 1978) have a yellow one, though both countries also use white letters on blue plates for [[classic car]]s. Furthermore, newer plates on Dutch vehicles only contain consonants, to avoid coincidental abbreviations or words. Also some sensitive letter combinations, such as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] or [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], are not used. The combination 'AA' is reserved for cars of the royal family. Dutch company registered bus, truck and/or minivan plates always start with a <code>B</code> or a <code>V</code>. Dutch taxis use blue registration plates. The number of new combinations ran out in 2008. New registered cars in the Netherlands now use the format of two digits-three letters-one digit (<code>12-ABC-3</code>).\n* Belgium used the sequence <code>ABC-123</code> between 1973 and 2008. When these combinations ran out in 2008, the inverse sequence <code>123-ABC</code> was adopted, with the first plate in the new series issued on 25 June 2008. With the introduction of the European format on 15 November 2010, a seven-character combination <code>1-ABC-234</code> is used and the previous <code>123-ABC</code> was discontinued. However, the six-character plates will remain valid, and no date is set for their expiration. Since Belgian plates are linked to an owner rather than to a vehicle, these older plates are likely to remain in use for a considerable time. As a way to phase out the six-character plates, future vehicle subscriptions will only be possible on the seven-character plates. Private numbers, not following any notation, are also allowed.\n* Luxembourg standard plates use two letters and four digits (<code>AB 1234</code>). Plates with 5 digits (<code>12345</code>) and 4 digits (<code>1234</code>) are also issued upon request. Older series with two letters and three digits (<code>AB 123</code>), and one letter and 4 digits (<code>A 1234</code>) are no longer issued but are still in use. Special plates for diplomats, the government, the grand-ducal family, military vehicles and temporary registrations exist and follow [[Vehicle registration plates of Luxembourg|specific rules]]. Two letters and three digits (<code>AB 123</code>) is also used in Northern Cyprus, and until 1973 it was used on the entire island of Cyprus. \n* Current registrations allocated in [[Romania]] and the United Kingdom (where the registration contains two digits) are both of the form AB12 CDE. The Romanian rear plates are white whereas UK ones are yellow. There is also a difference in the spacing and the font. In 2010, Bucharest, the capital of Romania, adopted the form B 123 AAA, three digits and three letters, because the number of cars had risen. In the United Kingdom, B123 AAA was issued to cars registered from August 1984 to August 1985. Aside from this, some county codes can clash (SV, in Romania it stands for [[Suceava]], and in the United Kingdom, it stands for [[Aberdeen]]).\n* Until 1973/74 the Swedish pattern was one letter representing the l\u00e4n (county) where the car was first registered, followed by four or five digits. However, in the more populated l\u00e4n, a second letter was introduced over time. For example, vehicles from southernmost county got the letter M + five digits, later also MA + five digits, MB + five digits etc. A problem was that the two northernmost counties had already been given two letters, the letter prefixes AC and BD, as the number of usable letters exceeded the number of counties. The ABC 123 system was introduced gradually from July 1973 until June 1974.\n* Slovakia uses AB 123CD and Serbia and Croatia uses AB 123-CD (in both cases also other patterns are possible). All three countries use a coat of arms after first two letters, and the fonts and colors also look very similar. The plates can be easily distinguished by country code on the blue strip on left.Croatia and Serbia uses \u010c,\u0160,\u017d for some municipality codes while in Slovakia C,S,Z are used instead.\n\nThere are also many municipality codes that are same in all three countries.\n\n*[[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]], currently not members of the EU, used the following: MM 12-34, MM 123-45 or MM 123-456 (MM being two letter abbreviation of [[Serbia and Montenegro#Administrative divisions|municipality]]), and having state flag (of [[FR Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]], later [[Serbia and Montenegro]]) between municipality and numbers. Montenegro left that system in 2007, and introduced new format: MM AB 123, with [[Coat of arms of Montenegro|Montenegrin coat of arms]] in circular shape between municipality and letter sequence. Blue strip with MNE country code is placed in the left side, with vacant place for EU stars, in case of joining the Union. Serbia also uses new system since 2011. with blue strip country code SRB: MM 123-AB and MM 1234-AB, with [[Coat of arms of Serbia|Serbian coat of arms]] between municipality and number sequence. The first two letters on the Serbian plates represent the municipality code, written in Latin letters, and repeated in Cyrillic characters with small letters under the coat of arms. The following system is used for taxi vehicles: BG 123 TX or BG 1234 TX and recently even BG 12345 TX, where a TX combination is reserved for this purpose only (another taxi vehicles have private vehicle plates). Since 2017, Serbia stopped issuing plates with last two letters containing W, Q, Y, X (except TX), \u010c, \u0106, \u0160, \u017d, and \u0110, however Serbian Latin letters with diacritics are still used to mark the municipality code, like \u010cA for \u010ca\u010dak or \u0160A for \u0160abac.\n* Poland and the United Kingdom have both used AAA 123A.  In Poland these were issued from 1976-2000, in the UK, they were issued from 1963-1983, with those issued prior to 1973 being the same colour as their Polish counterparts (white on black).  These plates are still valid in both countries.\n\n===Differing numbering systems===\nIndividual European countries use differing numbering schemes and text [[font]]s:\n\n* Most countries, including [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Switzerland]] (formerly also [[Sweden]] until 1974, [[Italy]] until 1994, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] until 1998, [[Lithuania]] and [[Spain]]  until 2000, [[Estonia]] until 2004 and [[Albania]] until 2011, also former countries [[East Germany]]  until 1990, [[Soviet Union]]  until 1991, [[Czechoslovakia]] until 1993, [[Yugoslavia]] until 1998 and [[Serbia and Montenegro]] until 2011), have systems in which there is a direct link between a letter or letters appearing on the plate and the town or district where the plate was issued (e.g. ''\"B\"'' and ''\"M\"'' in Germany for [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]], ''\"TN\"'' and ''\"ZV\"'' in [[Slovakia]] for [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]] and [[Zvolen]], ''\"BG\"'' and ''\"KG\"'' in Serbia for [[Belgrade]] and [[Kragujevac]] and \"''AX''\" and \"''KY''\" in Greece for [[Achaea]] and [[Corfu]]). Some countries, including Austria, Germany, Slovenia, and Switzerland, even include a regional or municipal coat of arms on the plate, but Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovakia include a national coat of arms. In Ireland, all plates have the name of the county of registration in [[Irish language|Irish]] in smaller letters on the top.\n*[[France]] (until 2009), and [[Turkey]] and [[Russia]] (since October 2013) use a system with an indirect number relation to the car's place of registration.  Formerly in France, the last two characters on a plate comprised the [[Departments of France#Current departments|departmental code]] of registration.  This pattern was discontinued, but in response to popular outcry, France added a second color bar, on the right edge of the plate, where the departmental code (no longer a part of the plate number) appears.\n* The [[United Kingdom|UK]] uses a [[Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom|system]] based on the region where the car was first registered and the date of registration, for example CA52 GJK, where the \"''C''\" stands for [[Wales]] (the name of that country in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] being [[Cymru]]), the \"''A''\" stands for [[Cardiff]] (the letters A-O assigned to the city), and the \"''52''\" means that the car was registered in the period September 2002 to February 2003.\n*[[Belgium]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], Estonia (after 2004), [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Latvia]], Lithuania (after 2000), [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]] and Sweden (after 1974) use plates that do not denote the location where the car is registered. Since 2000 Spain no longer uses province codes on plates but codes like 'B' for [[Barcelona]] or 'M' for [[Madrid]] can still be seen, for cars registered before that date. Italy, also, did not use the province codes on plates between 1994 and 1999.\n* Italy, since 1999, has added a blue strip on either side. On the right one are the two digits of the year when the plate was issued (e.g. \"99\", \"05\", \"08\") and below that there may be an optional two-letter code for the province, such as \"MO\" for the [[Province of Modena]]. Albania and France have adopted similar formats.\n* Portuguese registration plates since late 1998 have an yellow strip on the right side, with one number at the top and another at the bottom separated by a line, respectively the year and month of the vehicle's registration.\n* Irish registration plates also contain the year in which the vehicle was registered. A car registered in 2008 would have the format 08-XX-XXXX. In 2013, this was updated to specify which half of the year the registration occurred. So from January to June, the registration plate would show (for 2018) 181-XX-XXXX, whereas from July to December, the plate instead shows 182-XX-XXXX.\n* Turkish registration plates consist of letters and digits in combinations of 99 AB 999, 99 A 9999, 99 ABC 99, 99 AB 9999 or 99 A 99999 where the first two digits show which province the vehicle is registered from. First two digits numbers go from 01 to 81 (as there are 81 provinces in Turkey) and each one is assigned to a province with alphabetical order e.g. 01 is the code of the province Adana or 34 is the code of the province Istanbul. All 81 provinces uses \"01 AB 123\" style plates initially until all combinations ran out, then the province starts to use 01 A 1234 then 01 ABC 12 etc. As a result, three largest provinces i.e. Istanbul, Ankara and \u0130zmir are currently issuing 99 AB 9999 style plates since they used all combinations of previous series but the province Sivas for example, still issues 99 AB 999 plates as having a modest population and number of vehicles. 99 A 99999 series are not regular since they are only used in provinces where commercial vehicles are abundant e.g. Bursa to distinguish these vehicles there from passenger cars. Letters \"I\" and \"O\" are only used in the middle 01 ABC 12 series e.g. 34 YOC 34 or 06 TIL 56 to avoid confusion with numerals \"1\" and \"0\" respectively. Also some letters combinations like \"PKK\" are not issued due to their referring to political organizations or words likely to cause offence.\n\n==Cross-border traffic==\nAccording to the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]], vehicles in cross-border traffic are obliged to display a [[List of international vehicle registration codes|distinguishing sign of the country of registration]] on the rear of the vehicle. This sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate or, after the convention was amended in 2006, may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate. One of the main benefits of the convention for motorists is the obligation on signatory countries to recognise the legality of vehicles from other signatory countries. The following requirements must be met when driving outside the country of registration:\n\n* The physical requirements for the separate sign are defined in Annex 3 of the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]], which states that the letters shall be in black on a white background having the shape of an ellipse with the major axis horizontal. The distinguishing sign should not be affixed in such a way that it could be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility.\n* When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organisation to which the country belongs. The distinguishing sign should be displayed on the far left or far right on the registration plate. When a symbol/flag/emblem is also displayed, the distinguishing sign shall obligatory be placed on the far left on the plate. The distinguishing sign shall be positioned so to be easy identifiable and so that it cannot be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility. The distinguishing sign shall therefore be at least a different colour from the registration number, or have a different background colour to that reserved for the registration number, or be clearly separated from the registration number, preferably with a line.<ref name=\"international-driving-permit.com\" />\n\nThe common EU format of having a blue section on the extreme left with EU circle of stars and the country code was introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 2411/98 of 3 November 1998 and entered into force on the 11 November 1998. According to Article 3 of the regulation shall member states that require vehicles registered in another member state to display a distinguishing registration sign also recognize distinguishing signs issued in accordance with the regulation (the common EU format).<ref name=\":1\" /> After the amendment of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic in 2006, registration plates issued in the common EU format also satisfies the requirements of the named convention and hence is also valid in all countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. \n\nAfter Brexit, The European Commission has confirmed that after Brexit, British cars with number plates with the distinguishing sign incorporated do not need a separate sign when driving in EU countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. If the number plate does not include the distinguishing sign, or if the vehicle is driven in an EU country not party to the Vienna Convention, a separate sign has to be displayed at the rear of the vehicle. All EU countries except Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and Spain are party to the convention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/travelling_en_2.pdf#page10|title=NOTICE ON TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE EU AND THE UNITED KINGDOM FOLLOWING WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM THE EU|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n'''The following European countries are required to recognise the registration plate of other European countries, satisfying the requirements set out in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, as an international vehicle registration code:'''\n|-\n!\n!{{collapsible list\n| title = <br>Registration plate issued in EU member states in the common EU format|{{Flag|Austria}}|{{Flag|Belgium}}|{{Flag|Bulgaria}}|{{Flag|Croatia}}|{{Flag|Cyprus}}|{{Flag|Czech Republic}}|{{Flag|Denmark}}|{{Flag|Estonia}}|{{Flag|Finland}}|{{Flag|France}}|{{Flag|Germany}}|{{Flag|Greece}}|{{Flag|Hungary}}|{{Flag|Ireland}}|{{Flag|Italy}}|{{Flag|Latvia}}|{{Flag|Lithuania}}|{{Flag|Luxembourg}}|{{Flag|Malta}}|{{Flag|Netherlands}}|{{Flag|Poland}}|{{Flag|Portugal}}|{{Flag|Romania}}|{{Flag|Slovakia}}|{{Flag|Slovenia}}|{{Flag|Spain}}|{{Flag|Sweden}}\n}}\n!{{collapsible list\n| title = <br>registration plates issued in European countries signatory to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic\n|{{Flag|Albania}}\n|{{Flag|Armenia}}\n|{{Flag|Austria}}\n|{{Flag|Azerbaijan}}\n|{{Flag|Belarus}}\n|{{Flag|Belgium}}\n|{{Flag|Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n|{{Flag|Bulgaria}}\n|{{Flag|Croatia}}\n|{{Flag|Czech Republic}}\n|{{Flag|Denmark}}\n|{{Flag|Estonia}}\n|{{Flag|Finland}}\n|{{Flag|France}}\n|{{Flag|Georgia}}\n|{{Flag|Germany}}\n|{{Flag|Greece}}\n|{{Flag|Hungary}}\n|{{Flag|Italy}}\n|{{Flag|Kazakhstan}}\n|{{Flag|Latvia}}\n|{{Flag|Lithuania}}\n|{{Flag|Luxembourg}}\n|{{Flag|Moldova}}\n|{{Flag|Monaco}}\n|{{Flag|Montenegro}}\n|{{Flag|Netherlands}}\n|{{Flag|North Macedonia}}\n|{{Flag|Norway}}\n|{{Flag|Poland}}\n|{{Flag|Portugal}}\n|{{Flag|Romania}}\n|{{Flag|Russia}}\n|{{Flag|San Marino}}\n|{{Flag|Serbia}}\n|{{Flag|Slovakia}}\n|{{Flag|Slovenia}}\n|{{Flag|Sweden}}\n|{{Flag|Switzerland}}\n|{{Flag|Turkey}}\n|{{Flag|Ukraine}}\n|{{Flag|United Kingdom}}\n}}\n|-\n|{{collapsible list\n| titlestyle = background:transparent;text-align:left;font-weight:normal;\n| title = <br>Member states of the European Economic Area (EEA)|{{Flag|Austria}}|{{Flag|Belgium}}|{{Flag|Bulgaria}}|{{Flag|Croatia}}|{{Flag|Cyprus}}|{{Flag|Czech Republic}}|{{Flag|Denmark}}|{{Flag|Estonia}}|{{Flag|Finland}}|{{Flag|France}}|{{Flag|Germany}}|{{Flag|Greece}}|{{Flag|Hungary}}|{{Flag|Iceland}}|{{Flag|Ireland}}|{{Flag|Italy}}|{{Flag|Latvia}}|{{Flag|Liechtenstein}}|{{Flag|Lithuania}}|{{Flag|Luxembourg}}|{{Flag|Malta}}|{{Flag|Netherlands}}|{{Flag|Norway}}|{{Flag|Poland}}|{{Flag|Portugal}}|{{Flag|Romania}}|{{Flag|Slovakia}}|{{Flag|Slovenia}}|{{Flag|Spain}}|{{Flag|Sweden}}\n}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{No}}\n|-\n|{{collapsible list| titlestyle = background:transparent;text-align:left;font-weight:normal;\n| title = <br>Countries signatory to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic\n|{{Flag|Albania}}\n|{{Flag|Armenia}}\n|{{Flag|Austria}}\n|{{Flag|Azerbaijan}}\n|{{Flag|Belarus}}\n|{{Flag|Belgium}}\n|{{Flag|Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n|{{Flag|Bulgaria}}\n|{{Flag|Croatia}}\n|{{Flag|Czech Republic}}\n|{{Flag|Denmark}}\n|{{Flag|Estonia}}\n|{{Flag|Finland}}\n|{{Flag|France}}\n|{{Flag|Georgia}}\n|{{Flag|Germany}}\n|{{Flag|Greece}}\n|{{Flag|Hungary}}\n|{{Flag|Italy}}\n|{{Flag|Kazakhstan}}\n|{{Flag|Latvia}}\n|{{Flag|Lithuania}}\n|{{Flag|Luxembourg}}\n|{{Flag|Moldova}}\n|{{Flag|Monaco}}\n|{{Flag|Montenegro}}\n|{{Flag|Netherlands}}\n|{{Flag|North Macedonia}}\n|{{Flag|Norway}}\n|{{Flag|Poland}}\n|{{Flag|Portugal}}\n|{{Flag|Romania}}\n|{{Flag|Russia}}\n|{{Flag|San Marino}}\n|{{Flag|Serbia}}\n|{{Flag|Slovakia}}\n|{{Flag|Slovenia}}\n|{{Flag|Sweden}}\n|{{Flag|Switzerland}}\n|{{Flag|Turkey}}\n|{{Flag|Ukraine}}\n|{{Flag|United Kingdom}}\n}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|{{Yes}}\n|}\n[[File:D international vehicle registration oval.svg|right|150x150px]]\nSome European countries are not party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.

According to the Geneva convention, a distinguishing sign of the country of registration must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle.
