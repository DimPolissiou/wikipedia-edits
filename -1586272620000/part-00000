In 1995, Pesci had his third collaboration with Scorsese and De Niro in the film ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'', playing Nicky Santoro, based on real-life Mob enforcer [[Anthony Spilotro]], along with [[Sharon Stone]] and [[James Woods]]; Pesci had previously co-starred with the latter in ''Once Upon a Time in America''. During filming, Pesci broke the same rib that had been broken 15 years prior during the production of ''[[Raging Bull]]''.<ref name=LATimes/> In 1996, Pesci was considered to play Myron Larabee, the stressed-out postman, in ''[[Jingle All the Way]]'' opposite [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], but the part was ultimately given to [[Sinbad (entertainer)|Sinbad]], whose physical size was more comparable to Schwarzenegger's.\n\nHe had starring roles in several other films, including ''[[Man on Fire (1987 film)|Man on Fire]]'' (1987), ''[[The Super (1991 film)|The Super]]'' (1991), ''[[Jimmy Hollywood]]'' (1994), ''[[With Honors (film)|With Honors]]'' (also 1994) and ''[[Gone Fishin' (film)|Gone Fishin']]'' (1997). Pesci's role in ''With Honors'' was a dramatic role in which he played a homeless man living on the campus of Harvard.\n\n=== Other work, retirement from acting and reprise for ''The Irishman'' ===\nIn 1998, he released his second album, and his first in 30 years, ''[[Vincent LaGuardia Gambini Sings Just for You]]'', which was named after his character from the 1992 film ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]''. The album was both humorous and serious, exploring a variety of genres, though most of it was [[big band]] [[jazz]]. The album spawned the single \"Wise Guy,\" a rap number that played on the [[gangsta rap|gangsta]] theme by making reference to [[American Mafia|Mafia]] gangsterism. \"Wise Guy\" interpolated the 1980 hit \"[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]\" by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], and was co-written and produced by the hip-hop production team the [[Trackmasters]].\n\nIn 1999, Pesci announced his retirement from acting to pursue a musical career and to enjoy life away from the camera. He returned to acting when he did a [[cameo role|cameo]] in De Niro's 2006 film ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]''. In 2010, he starred in the brothel drama ''[[Love Ranch]]'', alongside [[Helen Mirren]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topnews.in/light/three-join-helen-mirren-and-joe-pesci-%E2%80%98love-ranch%E2%80%99-26500 |title=Three join Helen Mirren and Joe Pesci in 'Love Ranch' |publisher=Topnews.in |date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=January 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623205332/http://www.topnews.in/light/three-join-helen-mirren-and-joe-pesci-%E2%80%98love-ranch%E2%80%99-26500 |archive-date=June 23, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPesci appeared with [[Don Rickles]] in a 2011 [[Snickers]] advertisement in which he portrays the angry alter ego of a young man who attends a party and becomes agitated by two women until he is calmed down by eating a Snickers bar.<ref>{{cite web |title=There is an Angry Joe Pesci in all of us Snickers Ad |url=http://mememachine.viralvideochart.com/blog/2011/5/19/snickers-ad-there-is-an-angry-joe-pesci-in-all-of-us-just-in.html |work=mememachine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613024651/http://mememachine.viralvideochart.com/blog/2011/5/19/snickers-ad-there-is-an-angry-joe-pesci-in-all-of-us-just-in.html |archivedate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Pesci sued Fiore Films, the producers of the film ''[[Gotti (2018 film)|Gotti]]'', for having broken their promise to cast him in that film as real-life mobster [[Angelo Ruggiero]].<ref name=\"settles dispute\">{{cite web |title=Joe Pesci settles dispute over \"Gotti\" film payday |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-pesci-settles-dispute-over-gotti-film-payday/ |publisher=CBS/AP |date=February 5, 2013 |access-date=January 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229112321/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-pesci-settles-dispute-over-gotti-film-payday/ |archive-date=December 29, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>  Pesci stated that he had gained {{convert|30|lbs|kg}} for the role.<ref name=\"settles dispute\" /> He sued them for $3 million, which was the payment he had been promised.<ref name=\"settles dispute\" /> The lawsuit was settled out of court in 2013 for an unspecified sum,<ref name=\"settles dispute\" /> and the role, after many production delays, eventually went to [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]].\n\nPesci appears in the 2016 music documentary ''Jimmy Scott: I Go Back Home'' in which he is filmed recording \"[[The Folks Who Live on the Hill]]\" from Scott's 2017 posthumous album ''I Go Back Home''.\n\nIn 2017, Pesci was cast alongside [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Al Pacino]] in ''[[The Irishman]]'', a crime film directed by [[Martin Scorsese]].

In the film, the Joe Pesci character asks \"Funny how?\", a quote from ''Goodfellas''.\n\nPesci was briefly a recurring character on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', played by [[Jim Breuer]]. Breuer's characterization was based on Pesci's ''GoodFellas'' character, re-imagined as a talk show host, but maintaining Tommy DeVito's violent temper, often beating his guests with a baseball bat. This recurring gag eventually culminated in the real Pesci appearing in a cameo and beating Breuer with a bat.\n\n== Personal life ==\nPesci has been married and divorced three times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.philly.com/1992-03-14/news/26020215_1_cousin-vinny-vincent-la-guardia-gambini-identity-crisis |title=Now They're Good Fellas Ray Liotta And Joe Pesci Were Cold-blooded Wiseguys In Their 1990 Movie, But In Films Opening This Weekend, They're Unlikely Heroes.

He served as [[Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office]] from 2011 to 2013 and 2017 to 2020.\n\nTrickett served as the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] from 2008 to 2010 and was promoted to the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]] by [[Ed Miliband]] in 2011 as [[Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office]].\n\nTrickett was appointed [[Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]] under new Party Leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in September 2015, before serving as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills]] from July to October 2016. He was later appointed [[Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office]] by Corbyn in February 2017, alongside his portfolio as [[Shadow Lord President of the Council]].\n\n==Education and early political career==\nTrickett studied at Roundhay Grammar School (now called [[Roundhay School]]) in Leeds. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Politics from the [[University of Hull]], and later an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Political Sociology from the [[University of Leeds]].\n\nFormed politically by the [[Anti-Vietnam War movement|anti-Vietnam war movement]], he joined the Labour Party in 1969 and was active on the Labour left in Leeds from the late 1960s. From 1974 to 1986 he worked as a builder and plumber. During the campaigns relating to the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|Common Market referendum]] in 1975  he was the secretary of the Vote No campaign in Leeds.\n\nDuring the 1970s Trickett was a member of the ILP (the successor body of the [[Independent Labour Party]]), contributed to its newspaper, the ''[[Labour Leader]]'', and was elected for a number of years to its ruling body, the National Administrative Council. Trickett was also active in anti-fascist and anti-war movements, and was a delegate to the [[Leeds Trades Council]]. Later he was the election agent for [[Michael McGowan (politician)|Michael McGowan]] who became the MEP for Leeds in 1984.\n\nTrickett was first elected to [[Leeds City Council]] for the [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston]] ward in [[1984 Leeds City Council election#By-elections between 1984 and 1986|1984]] at the age of 34. He replaced [[George Mudie (politician)|George Mudie]] as Leader of the Council in 1989, holding the leadership until 1996 and his election to [[House of Commons (UK)|Parliament]]. Brian Walker replaced Trickett as Council Leader and resigned his council seat after the May local elections.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\n===Labour government===\nElected on 1 February 1996 in a by-election brought about by the death of the previous MP, Labour's [[Derek Enright]], Trickett was made PPS to [[Peter Mandelson]] after Labour was elected to power and worked in the Cabinet office and subsequently the DTI. After leaving the government at the time of Mandelson's fall from grace, Trickett was chair of the [[Compass (think tank)|Compass]] pressure group.\n\nHe played a significant role in rebelling against the [[Iraq War]] and participated in demonstrations against the War in London, Wakefield and Leeds. He rebelled on a number of occasions against [[Tony Blair]]'s reforms to public services. He led the demands for a [[recall of Parliament]] at the time of the Israeli attacks on the Lebanon, and the campaign inside the Commons to amend the Companies Bill to secure public listed companies reporting on 'supply chain issues' in line with the suggestions of a range of non governmental organisations. He was also a leading figure in the campaign to prevent a decision to replace the Trident<ref>{{YouTube|jjykqXv3VYQ}}</ref> nuclear weapons system in 2007. In addition, he was [[Jon Cruddas]]'s campaign manager during the [[2007 Labour Party (UK) deputy leadership election|2007 Labour Party deputy leadership election]].\n\nTrickett had previously voted against the Blair Government's 90-day detention proposals in the [[Terrorism Act 2006]], which had been [[Terrorism Act 2006#Police advocacy of 90 day detention|publicly advocated by the police]], and was joined by both Labour and Conservative MPs in the vote, the only time Blair was defeated in the Commons. Trickett and Cruddas voted in favour of the subsequent 28-day detention proposal, and Trickett then resigned from his position in Compass after voting in favour of the legislation despite opposition to the Bill from some members of Compass.\n\nTrickett was appointed by the trades unions as acting chair of the board of [[Tribune (magazine)|''Tribune'']] in 2007, but gave up this role when the paper was taken over by a private proprietor.\n\nIn June 2007 he was asked by Gordon Brown to chair the party's manifesto group on housing, a position which he declined to take up.\nFollowing the cabinet reshuffle of 3 October 2008, Trickett became the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7653134.stm |title=Blair advised Mandelson on return |publisher=BBC News |date=5 October 2008 |accessdate=19 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===In opposition===\nOn 7 October 2011, Trickett was appointed to the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] as [[Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office]] by Labour Leader [[Ed Miliband]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He was re-elected to the House of Commons at the 2015 general election with a majority of 12,078.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title = Jon Trickett MP|url = http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/jon-trickett/410|website = UK Parliament|accessdate = 3 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, a former [[British National Party]] candidate was convicted of making an anti-semitic verbal attack upon Trickett.<ref name=guardian-20160204>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/04/constituent-pleads-guilty-to-anti-semitic-attack-on-jon-trickett-mp |title=Constituent pleads guilty to antisemitic attack on Jon Trickett MP |author=Frances Perraudin |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 February 2016 |accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=jc-20160205>{{cite news |url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/153186/mp-shocked-and-shaken%E2%80%99-antisemitic-abuse |title=MP 'shocked and shaken' by antisemitic abuse |author=Marcus Dysch |newspaper=Jewish Chronicle |date=5 February 2016 |accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nTrickett was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate [[Jeremy Corbyn]] as a candidate in the [[2015 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|Labour leadership election of 2015]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bright |first=Sam |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/06/who-nominated-who-2015-labour-leadership-election |title=Who nominated who for the 2015 Labour leadership election? |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=15 June 2015 |accessdate=19 July 2016}}</ref> On 27 June 2016 Trickett was appointed as Shadow [[Lord President of the Council]] and Campaigns and Elections Director.<ref name=sunderlandecho-20160628>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/politics/easington-mp-appointed-to-jeremy-corbyn-s-shadow-cabinet-1-7985886 |title=Easington MP appointed to Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet |author=Ross Robertson |newspaper=Sunderland Echo |date=28 June 2016 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref> Later that year, Trickett was appointed [[Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/len-mccluskey-plays-peacemaker-between-corbyn-and-watson|title=Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet agrees to Labour peace talks|last=Stewart|first=Heather|last2=Mason|first2=Rowena|date=5 July 2016|website=the Guardian|access-date=6 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/07/why-ed-balls-wrong-about-what-jeremy-corbyns-labour-needs-do-win |title=Why Ed Balls is wrong about what Jeremy Corbyn's Labour needs to do to win|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, Trickett apologised for comments on Twitter which appeared to liken [[2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|an attempted coup in Turkey]] to attempts to oust Jeremy Corbyn.

has been the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Hemsworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Hemsworth]] in [[West Yorkshire]] since a [[1996 Hemsworth by-election|1996 by-election]]. He served as [[Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office]] from 2011 to 2013 and 2017 to 2020.\n\nTrickett served as the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] from 2008 to 2010 and was promoted to the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]] by [[Ed Miliband]] in 2011 as [[Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office]].\n\nTrickett was appointed [[Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]] under new Party Leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in September 2015, before serving as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills]] from July to October 2016. He was later appointed [[Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office]] by Corbyn in February 2017, alongside his portfolio as [[Shadow Lord President of the Council]].\n\n==Education and early political career==\nTrickett studied at Roundhay Grammar School (now called [[Roundhay School]]) in Leeds. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Politics from the [[University of Hull]], and later an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Political Sociology from the [[University of Leeds]].\n\nFormed politically by the [[Anti-Vietnam War movement|anti-Vietnam war movement]], he joined the Labour Party in 1969 and was active on the Labour left in Leeds from the late 1960s. From 1974 to 1986 he worked as a builder and plumber. During the campaigns relating to the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|Common Market referendum]] in 1975  he was the secretary of the Vote No campaign in Leeds.\n\nDuring the 1970s Trickett was a member of the ILP (the successor body of the [[Independent Labour Party]]), contributed to its newspaper, the ''[[Labour Leader]]'', and was elected for a number of years to its ruling body, the National Administrative Council. Trickett was also active in anti-fascist and anti-war movements, and was a delegate to the [[Leeds Trades Council]]. Later he was the election agent for [[Michael McGowan (politician)|Michael McGowan]] who became the MEP for Leeds in 1984.\n\nTrickett was first elected to [[Leeds City Council]] for the [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston]] ward in [[1984 Leeds City Council election#By-elections between 1984 and 1986|1984]] at the age of 34. He replaced [[George Mudie]] as Leader of the Council in 1989, holding the leadership until 1996 and his election to [[House of Commons (UK)|Parliament]]. Brian Walker replaced Trickett as Council Leader and resigned his council seat after the May local elections.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\n===Labour government===\nElected on 1 February 1996 in a by-election brought about by the death of the previous MP, Labour's [[Derek Enright]], Trickett was made PPS to [[Peter Mandelson]] after Labour was elected to power and worked in the Cabinet office and subsequently the DTI. After leaving the government at the time of Mandelson's fall from grace, Trickett was chair of the [[Compass (think tank)|Compass]] pressure group.\n\nHe played a significant role in rebelling against the [[Iraq War]] and participated in demonstrations against the War in London, Wakefield and Leeds. He rebelled on a number of occasions against [[Tony Blair]]'s reforms to public services. He led the demands for a [[recall of Parliament]] at the time of the Israeli attacks on the Lebanon, and the campaign inside the Commons to amend the Companies Bill to secure public listed companies reporting on 'supply chain issues' in line with the suggestions of a range of non governmental organisations. He was also a leading figure in the campaign to prevent a decision to replace the Trident<ref>{{YouTube|jjykqXv3VYQ}}</ref> nuclear weapons system in 2007. In addition, he was [[Jon Cruddas]]'s campaign manager during the [[2007 Labour Party (UK) deputy leadership election|2007 Labour Party deputy leadership election]].\n\nTrickett had previously voted against the Blair Government's 90-day detention proposals in the [[Terrorism Act 2006]], which had been [[Terrorism Act 2006#Police advocacy of 90 day detention|publicly advocated by the police]], and was joined by both Labour and Conservative MPs in the vote, the only time Blair was defeated in the Commons. Trickett and Cruddas voted in favour of the subsequent 28-day detention proposal, and Trickett then resigned from his position in Compass after voting in favour of the legislation despite opposition to the Bill from some members of Compass.\n\nTrickett was appointed by the trades unions as acting chair of the board of [[Tribune (magazine)|''Tribune'']] in 2007, but gave up this role when the paper was taken over by a private proprietor.\n\nIn June 2007 he was asked by Gordon Brown to chair the party's manifesto group on housing, a position which he declined to take up.\nFollowing the cabinet reshuffle of 3 October 2008, Trickett became the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7653134.stm |title=Blair advised Mandelson on return |publisher=BBC News |date=5 October 2008 |accessdate=19 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===In opposition===\nOn 7 October 2011, Trickett was appointed to the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] as [[Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office]] by Labour Leader [[Ed Miliband]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He was re-elected to the House of Commons at the 2015 general election with a majority of 12,078.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title = Jon Trickett MP|url = http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/jon-trickett/410|website = UK Parliament|accessdate = 3 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, a former [[British National Party]] candidate was convicted of making an anti-semitic verbal attack upon Trickett.<ref name=guardian-20160204>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/04/constituent-pleads-guilty-to-anti-semitic-attack-on-jon-trickett-mp |title=Constituent pleads guilty to antisemitic attack on Jon Trickett MP |author=Frances Perraudin |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 February 2016 |accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=jc-20160205>{{cite news |url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/153186/mp-shocked-and-shaken%E2%80%99-antisemitic-abuse |title=MP 'shocked and shaken' by antisemitic abuse |author=Marcus Dysch |newspaper=Jewish Chronicle |date=5 February 2016 |accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nTrickett was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate [[Jeremy Corbyn]] as a candidate in the [[2015 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|Labour leadership election of 2015]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bright |first=Sam |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/06/who-nominated-who-2015-labour-leadership-election |title=Who nominated who for the 2015 Labour leadership election? |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=15 June 2015 |accessdate=19 July 2016}}</ref> On 27 June 2016 Trickett was appointed as Shadow [[Lord President of the Council]] and Campaigns and Elections Director.<ref name=sunderlandecho-20160628>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/politics/easington-mp-appointed-to-jeremy-corbyn-s-shadow-cabinet-1-7985886 |title=Easington MP appointed to Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet |author=Ross Robertson |newspaper=Sunderland Echo |date=28 June 2016 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref> Later that year, Trickett was appointed [[Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/len-mccluskey-plays-peacemaker-between-corbyn-and-watson|title=Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet agrees to Labour peace talks|last=Stewart|first=Heather|last2=Mason|first2=Rowena|date=5 July 2016|website=the Guardian|access-date=6 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/07/why-ed-balls-wrong-about-what-jeremy-corbyns-labour-needs-do-win |title=Why Ed Balls is wrong about what Jeremy Corbyn's Labour needs to do to win|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, Trickett apologised for comments on Twitter which appeared to liken [[2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|an attempted coup in Turkey]] to attempts to oust Jeremy Corbyn.

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE). The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death. This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nMayor De Blasio made a call for medical staff.<ref name=\"20200403com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc.html|title=Opinion: We Need All Medical Workers on the Front Lines|first=Bill|last=de Blasio|date=3 April 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>{{explain|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news |author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE). The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death.
