{"title_page": "Pulse Polio", "text_new": "[[File:Pulse Polio Day, Gwalior, January 2014.jpg|thumb|A child is vaccinated on Pulse Polio Day in Gwalior.]]\n'''Pulse Polio''' is an   [[immunisation]] campaign established by the [[government of India]] to eliminate   [[poliomyelitis]] (polio) in [[India]] by  vaccinating all children under the age of five years against the  [[poliomyelitis|polio virus]]. The project fights polio through a large-scale,  [[pulse vaccination]]  programme and monitoring for poliomyelitis cases. [[Vellore]] ,(Tamil Nadu) was the first Indian town to become 100% polio-free through the pulse strategy, and rest of India adopted the strategy in 1995.\n\n==History==\n\nIndia, vaccination against polio started on 1978 with Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). By 1999, it covered around 60% of infants, giving three doses of OPV to each.\n\nIn 1985,the Universal Immunization Programme  (UIP) was launched to cover all the districts of the country. UIP became a part of child survival and safe motherhood program (CSSM) in 1992 and Reproductive and Child Health Program (RCH) in 1997\n. This program led to a significant increase in coverage, up to 5%. The number of reported cases of polio also declined from thousands <!-- Correct number needed -->during 1987 to 42 in 2010.\n\nIn 1995, following the Global Polio Eradication Initiative of the World Health Organization (1988), India launched Pulse Polio immunization program with Universal Immunization Program which aimed at 100% coverage.\n\nThe last reported cases of wild polio in India were in West Bengal and Gujarat on 13 January 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=Polio Global Eradication Initiative |url=http://www.polioeradication.org/InfectedCountries/India.aspx}}</ref> On 27 March 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) declared India a polio free country, since no cases of wild polio been reported in for five years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/policy-and-issues/who-certifies-india-poliofree/article5839833.ece|title= WHO certifies India polio-free|date=27 March 2014|work=[[The Hindu]]}}</ref>\n\n==Preventive Pulse Polio==\n\nThe Pulse Polio Initiative (PPI) aims at covering every individual in the country.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recommended eight to ten doses for each child.\n\nChildren in some areas of India are weaker and often had diarrhea, which reduced the efficiency of the vaccine. [[Open defecation]], monsoon flooding, and a lack of water treatment made it easier for a child to swallow more polio virus. As a result, children with too few doses of vaccine were not fully protected and sometimes got polio.<ref name=rosa/>\n\nThe eradication program therefore gave drops over and over again, to boost children's immunity higher and as a precaution against missed children. Few parents initially knew that the vaccination campaign was trying to eradicate the disease, so they did not understand the reasons for the increasing intensity of vaccination.

He continued by saying: \"It's a very significant, detailed and intense undertaking that will stretch over four or five days.\" In December 2011 the DPC published a first report on Facebook. This report was not legally binding but suggested changes that Facebook should undertake until July 2012. The DPC is planning to do a review about Facebook's progress in July 2012.\n\n====Changes====\nIn spring 2012, Facebook had to undertake many changes (e.g., having an extended download tool that should allow users to exercise the European right to access to all stored information or an update of the worldwide [[privacy policy]]). These changes were seen as not sufficient to comply with European law by europe-v-facebook.org. The download tool does not allow, for example, access to all data.

Since the group managed to get more than 7.000 comments on Facebook's pages, Facebook had to do a worldwide vote on the proposed changes. Such a vote would have only been binding if 30% of all users would have taken part.

This policy is in compliance with a United States law, the 1998 [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]], which requires minors aged 13 or younger to gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites. In jurisdictions where a similar law sets a lower minimum age, Facebook enforces the lower age. Of the 1,007 households surveyed for the study, 76% of parents reported that their child joined Facebook at an age younger than 13, the minimum age in the site's terms of service. The study also reported that Facebook removes roughly 20,000 users each day for violating its minimum age policy. The study's authors also note, \"Indeed, Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join.\" The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of United States federal law, but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors. Only 53% of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age; 35% of these parents believe that the minimum age is merely a recommendation or thought the signup age was 16 or 18, not 13.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/education/parents-children-facebook-privacy-age/ |title = Why Parents Help Their Children Lie to Facebook About Age: Unintended Consequences of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\n===Student-related issues===\n====Student privacy concerns====\nStudents who post illegal or otherwise inappropriate material have faced disciplinary action from their universities, colleges, and schools including expulsion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/10/06/fisher_college_expels_student_over_website_entries|work=The Boston Globe|title=Fisher College expels student over website entries|first=Sarah|last=Schweitzer|date=October 6, 2005}}</ref> Others posting libelous content relating to faculty have also faced disciplinary action.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=January 25, 2010|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/seventh-grade_north_syracuse_s.html|title=Seventh-grade North Syracuse student suspended, 25 others disciplined for Facebook page about teacher |work=[[The Post-Standard]]|date=January 24, 2010|author=O'Toole, Catie }}</ref> The ''Journal of Education for Business'' states that \"a recent study of 200 Facebook profiles found that 42% had comments regarding alcohol, 53% had photos involving alcohol use, 20% had comments regarding sexual activities, 25% had seminude or sexually provocative photos, and 50% included the use of profanity.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal | last1 = Peluchette | first1 = Joy | last2 = Karl | first2 = Katherine | year = 2010 | title = Examining Students' Intended Image on Facebook: \"what were they Thinking?!\". | url = | journal = Journal of Education for Business | volume = 85 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u20137 | doi=10.1080/08832320903217606}}</ref> It is inferred that negative or incriminating Facebook posts can affect alumni's and potential employers' perception of them.

A. 2008\" /> found that there were no differences in overall grade point average (GPA) between users and non-users of Facebook. Kirschner and Karpinski (2010)<ref name=\"ou-nl.academia.edu\" /> found that Facebook users reported a lower mean GPA than non-users. Junco's (2012)<ref name=\"reyjunco.com\" /> study clarifies the discrepancies in these findings. While Junco (2012)<ref name=\"reyjunco.com\" /> found a negative relationship between time spent on Facebook and student GPA in his large sample of college students, the real-world impact of the relationship was negligible. Furthermore, Junco (2012)<ref name=\"reyjunco.com\" /> found that sharing links and checking up on friends were positively related to GPA while posting status updates was negatively related. In addition to noting the differences in how Facebook use was measured among the four studies, Junco (2012)<ref name=\"reyjunco.com\" /> concludes that the ways in which students use Facebook are more important in predicting academic outcomes.\n\n=== Phishing ===\n{{See also|Facebook malware}}\nThe term ''phishing'' is one kind of online fraud in which criminals try to trick people into revealing passwords, credit card information, and other sensitive information. Phishing takes the form of a message or Wall post that appears to come from someone on the user's Friend List but in actuality the message was sent by phishers using the friend's login information. The phishers are hoping the user takes the bait resulting in the phishers gaining access to the user's Facebook account. Soon afterwards, the user's other friends will start getting phishing messages from what appears to be the Facebook user. The point of the post is to get the users to visit a website with viruses and malware.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Unpublished photo disclosure bug ===\nIn September 2018, a software bug meant that photos that had been uploaded to Facebook accounts, but that had not been \"published\" (and which therefore should have remained private between the user and Facebook), were exposed to app developers.<ref name=\"guardian-2018-12-14\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/14/facebook-admits-bug-app-developers-hidden-photos|title=Facebook admits bug allowed apps to see hidden photos|first=Alex|last=Hern|date=December 14, 2018|accessdate=December 15, 2018|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> Approximately 6.8 million users and 1500 third-party apps were affected.<ref name=\"guardian-2018-12-14\"/>\n\n===Sharing private messages and contacts' details without consent===\nIn December 2018, it emerged that Facebook had, during the period 2010\u20132018, granted access to users' private messages, address book contents, and private posts, without the users' consent, to more than 150 third parties including Microsoft, Amazon, Yahoo, Netflix, and Spotify.

This effect is caused mainly by the fact that most users of Facebook usually only display the positive aspects of their lives while excluding the negative, though it is also strongly connected to [[Social inequality|inequality]] and the disparities between social groups as Facebook is open to users from all classes of society.

The results showed that the frequency of Facebook use was moderately negatively related to general political knowledge.

Many studies have attempted to discover whether Facebook has a positive or negative effect on children\u2019s and teenagers\u2019 social lives, and many of them have come to the conclusion that there are distinct social problems that arise with Facebook usage. British neuroscientist [[Susan Greenfield, Baroness Greenfield|Susan Greenfield]] stuck up for the issues that children encounter on social media sites. She said that they can rewire the brain, which caused some hysteria over whether or not social networking sites are safe. She did not back up her claims with research, but did cause quite a few studies to be done on the subject. When that self is then broken down by others by badmouthing, criticism, harassment, criminalization or vilification, intimidation, demonization, demoralization, belittlement, or attacking someone over the site it can cause much of the envy, anger, or depression.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Are social networking sites breeding antisocial young people? |first=Alanna |last=Bromley |journal=Journal of Digital Research and Publishing |year=2011 |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/8137/1/DRPJournal_5pm_S2_2011.pdf#page=7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WoP0y3SylQ|title=Students Take On Cyberbullying|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=My Best Day: Presentation of Self and Social Manipulation in Facebook and IM |first=Naomi S. |last=Baron |year=2007 |url=http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/5782/Baron%20-%20My%20Best%20Day.pdf?sequence=1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523064049/http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/5782/Baron%20-%20My%20Best%20Day.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=May 23, 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=A new addiction for teacher candidates: social networks |journal=The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=2012 |url=http://tojet.net/articles/v11i3/1132.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[Sherry Turkle]], in her book ''[[Sherry Turkle#Alone Together|Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other]]'', argues that social media bring people closer and further apart at the same time.

In its complaint, EPIC alleged that Facebook had deceived users by secretly conducting a psychological experiment on their emotions: \"At the time of the experiment, Facebook did not state in the Data Use Policy that user data would be used for research purposes.

John Grohol, writing for [[Psych Central]], argued that despite its title and claims of \"[[emotional contagion]],\" this study did not look at emotions at all. Instead, its authors used an application (called \"Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count\" or LIWC 2007) that simply counted positive and negative words in order to infer users' sentiments. He wrote that a shortcoming of the LIWC tool is that it does not understand negations. Hence, the tweet \"I am not happy\" would be scored as positive: \"Since the LIWC 2007 ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication, so do the researchers.\" Grohol concluded that given these subtleties, the [[effect size]] of the findings are little more than a \"statistical blip.\"\n\n<blockquote>Kramer et al. (2014) found a 0.07%\u2014that's not 7 percent, that's 1/15th of one percent!!\u2014decrease in negative words in people's status updates when the number of negative posts on their Facebook news feed decreased.

The BBC found images and videos on social media of the bodies of fighters and civilians being desecrated by fighters from the self-styled Libyan National Army. The force, led by [[Khalifa Haftar|General Khalifa Haftar]], controls a swathe of territory in the east of Libya and is trying to seize the capital, Tripoli. BBC Arabic found almost one hundred images and videos from Libya shared on Facebook and YouTube, in violation of their companies\u2019 guidelines.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{Citation|title=Libyan conflict: Suspected war crimes shared online - BBC Newsnight|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp_dOW3LZ5w|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref> The UK Foreign Office said it took the allegations extremely seriously and is concerned about the impact the recent violence is having on the civilian population.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn 2017, a Facebook video of Libyan National Army (LNA) special forces commander, Mahmoud al-Werfalli was uploaded showing him shooting dead three captured fighters. The video was then shared on YouTube over ten thousand times. The International Criminal Court used it as evidence to indict al-Werfalli for the war crime of murder.<ref>https://www.icc-cpi.int/CaseInformationSheets/al-werfalliEng.pdf</ref> The BBC found the original video was still on Facebook 2 years after his indictment and also discovered videos showing the bodies of civilians being desecrated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} These were taken in Ganfouda, a district of Benghazi which was [[Battle of Benghazi (2014\u20132017)|under siege]] by the LNA between 2016-2017. More than 300 people, including dozens of children died during the siege. A video uncovered by BBC Arabic showed soldiers mocking a pile of corpses of dead civilians and trampling on bodies. Among them was a 77 year old woman, Alia Hamza. Her son, Ali Hamza had five family members killed in Ganfouda.\n\nAli Hamza told BBC Arabic, \u201cI sent links to lawyers to send to the ICC in the Hague against Khalifa Haftar and his military commanders regarding the massacres of civilians,\u201d said Hamza. In the video, the LNA soldiers label the civilians as terrorists. Human rights lawyer and war crimes specialist Rodney Dixon QC reviewed the evidence BBC Arabic found. \u201cIf groups are using those platforms to propagate their campaigns then those platforms should seriously look at their role because they could then be assisting in that process of further crimes being committed,\u201d he said.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} After presenting our findings to Facebook they removed all the videos that show a suspected war crime taking place. However, they opted not to suspend any of the accounts which we found linked to the images. Erin Saltman, Facebook's policy manager for Counterterrorism in Europe, Middle East and Africa, told BBC Arabic, \u201cSometimes there are very conflicting narratives of whether or not the victim is a terrorist, or whether it's a civilian over who's committing that act, we cannot be the pure arbiters of truth.\u201d<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> But Facebook and Youtube\u2019s own community guidelines

The NGO [[Shurat Hadin]]-Israel Law Center conducted an experiment over the incitement issue, which sought to expose what it viewed as double standards regarding anti-Israel sentiment vis-a-vis the simultaneous launch of two Facebook pages: \"Stop Palestinians\" and \"Stop Israel\". Following the launch of the two nearly identical pages, the NGO posted hateful content simultaneously on both pages. Next, Shurat Hadin's reported both faux-incitement pages to Facebook to see which, if either, would be removed. According to them, despite featuring nearly identical content, only one was removed from the online platform. They said the page inciting against Palestinians was closed by Facebook (on the same day that it was reported) for \"containing credible threat of violence\" which \"violated our [Facebook's] community standards\", but not the page inciting against Israelis. Shurat Hadin said that Facebook claimed that this page was \"not in violation of Facebook's rules\". Shurat Hadin's staged anti-Israel group \"Stop Israel\" still remains active on Facebook.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/When-it-comes-to-incitement-is-Facebook-biased-against-Israel-439436|title=When it comes to incitement, is Facebook biased against Israel? - Arab-Israeli Conflict - Jerusalem Post|website=Jpost.com|accessdate=December 16, 2018}}</ref> ProPublica stated in September 2017 that a website was able to target ads at Facebook users who were interested in \"how to burn Jew\" and \"Jew hater\".

In Facebook's [[Dublin]], Ireland headquarters, six individuals were determined to be \"high priority\" victims of the error, after the company concluded that their profiles were likely viewed by potential terrorists in groups such as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], [[Hezbollah]] and the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]]. The bug itself, discovered in November 2016 and fixed two weeks later, was active for one month, and had also been retroactively exposing censored personal accounts from August 2016. One affected worker had fled Ireland, gone into hiding, and only returned to Ireland after five months due to a lack of money. Suffering from psychological distress, he filed a legal claim against Facebook and [[CPL Resources]], an [[outsourcing]] company, seeking compensation. A Facebook spokesperson stated that \"Our investigation found that only a small fraction of the names were likely viewed, and we never had evidence of any threat to the people impacted or their families as a result of this matter\", and Craig D\u2019Souza, Facebook's head of global investigations, said: \"Keep in mind that when the person sees your name on the list, it was in their activity log, which contains a lot of information [...] there is a good chance that they associate you with another admin of the group or a hacker\". Facebook offered to install a home-alarm monitoring system, provide transport to and from work, and counseling through its employee assistance program.

Especially for non-English speaking writers, Facebook does not have a proper support system to genuinely read the content and make decisions. Sometimes the content of a status did not have any \"abusive\" or defaming language, but it nevertheless got deleted on the basis that it had been secretly reported by a group of people as \"offensive\". For other languages than English, Facebook till now is not able to identify the group approach that is used to vilify humanitarian activism. In another incident, Facebook had to apologize after it deleted a free speech group's post about the abuse of human rights in Syria. In that case, a spokesman for Facebook said the post was \"mistakenly\" removed by a member of its moderation team, which receives a high volume of take-down requests.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/06/facebook-apologises-free-speech-syria |title=Facebook apologises for deleting free speech group's post on Syrian torture |website=Guardian.co.uk |date=July 6, 2013 |accessdate=June 4, 2013|location=London |first=Josh |last=Halliday}}</ref>\n\n===Enabling of harassment===\nFacebook instituted a policy by which it is now self-policed by the community of Facebook users.{{when|date=February 2015}} Some users have complained that this policy allows Facebook to empower abusive users to harass them by allowing them to submit reports on even benign comments and photos as being \"offensive\" or \"in violation of Facebook Rights and Responsibilities\" and that enough of these reports result in the user who is being harassed in this way getting their account blocked for a predetermined number of days or weeks, or even deactivated entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Jealous-Wives-Are-Getting-Courtney-Stodden-Banned-on-Facebook-227862.shtml |title=Jealous Wives Are Getting Courtney Stodden Banned on Facebook - Softpedia |website=News.softpedia.com |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFacebook UK policy director Simon Milner told [[Wired Magazine]] that \"Once the piece of content has been seen, assessed and deemed OK, (Facebook) will ignore further reports about it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/online-harassment |title= When good lulz go bad: unpicking the ugly business of online harassment |website=Wired.co.uk |date=January 27, 2014 |accessdate=August 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Lack of customer support===\nFacebook lacks live support, making it difficult to resolve issues that require the services of an administrator or are not covered in the FAQs, such as the enabling of a disabled account. The automated emailing system used when filling out a support form often refers users back to the help center or to pages that are outdated and cannot be accessed, leaving users at a dead end with no further support available.

Australian technologist [[Nik Cubrilovic]] discovered that when a user logs out of Facebook, the cookies from that login are still kept in the browser, allowing Facebook to track users on websites that include \"social widgets\" distributed by the social network. Facebook has denied the claims, saying they have 'no interest' in tracking users or their activity.

However, this setting was redundant to the existing \"Only Me\" privacy setting which was already available to hide addresses from timelines.

According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that for an initial fee of $1,000, entitles Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as additional 1% interest per each day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was ''Facemash'', the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name ''thefacebook.com'' until January 1, 2004. Facebook management has dismissed the lawsuit as \"completely frivolous\". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt issued a statement indicating that the counsel for Ceglia had unsuccessfully attempted to seek an out-of-court settlement. In an interview to ''[[ABC World News]]'', Zuckerberg stated he is confident of never signing such an agreement. At the time, Zuckerberg worked for Ceglia as a code developer on a project named \"StreetFax\". Judge Thomas Brown of Allegany Court issued a [[restraining order]] on all financial transfers concerning ownership of Facebook until further notice; in response, Facebook management successfully filed for the case to be moved to federal court.

By omitting this line, Facebook license extends to adopt users' content perpetually and irrevocably years after the content has been deleted.<ref name=\"PC World\" />\n\nMany users of Facebook voiced opinions against the changes to the Facebook Terms of Use, leading to an Internet-wide debate over the ownership of content. [[Electronic Privacy Information Center|The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)]] prepared a formal complaint with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. Many individuals were frustrated with the removal of the controversial clause. Facebook users, numbering more than 38,000, joined a user group against the changes, and a number of blogs and news sites have written about this issue.<ref name=\"PC World\" />\n\nAfter the change was brought to light in Walters's blog entry, in his blog on February 16, 2009, Zuckerberg addressed the issues concerning the recently made changes to Facebook's terms of use. Zuckerberg wrote \"Our philosophy is that people own their information and control who they share it with.\"<ref name=\"facebook4\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?blog_id=company&blogger=4|publisher=Facebook|title=Improving Your Ability to Share and Connect|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}</ref> In addition to this statement Zuckerberg explained the paradox created when people want to share their information (phone number, pictures, email address, etc.) with the public, but at the same time desire to remain in complete control of who has access to this info.<ref name=\"Facebook\" />\n\nIn order to calm criticism, Facebook returned to its original terms of use. However, on February 17, 2009, Zuckerberg wrote in his blog, that although Facebook reverted to its original terms of use, it is in the process of developing new terms in order to address the paradox. Zuckerberg stated that these new terms will allow Facebook users to \"share and control their information, and it will be written clearly in language everyone can understand.\" Zuckerberg invited users to join a group entitled \"Facebook Bill of Rights and Responsibilities\" to give their input and help shape the new terms.\n\nOn February 26, 2009, Zuckerberg posted a blog, updating users on the progress of the new Terms of Use. He wrote, \"We decided we needed to do things differently and so we're going to develop new policies that will govern our system from the ground up in an open and transparent way.\" Zuckerberg introduces the two new additions to Facebook: the Facebook Principles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=54964476066 |publisher=Facebook |title=Facebook Town Hall: Proposed Facebook Principles |accessdate=March 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227043045/http://www.facebook.com//group.php?gid=54964476066 |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> and the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=67758697570 |publisher=Facebook |title=Facebook Town Hall: Proposed Statement of Rights and Responsibilities |accessdate=March 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227043055/http://www.facebook.com//group.php?gid=67758697570 |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> Both additions allow users to vote on changes to the terms of use before they are officially released.

Users are not supposed to have the ability to post material to the Facebook Walls of other users unless they are approved friends of those users that they have posted material to. To prove that he was telling the truth, Shreateh posted material to Sarah Goodin's wall, a friend of Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. Following this, Shreateh contacted Facebook's security team with the proof that his bug was real, explaining in detail what was going on. Facebook has a bounty program in which it compensates people a $500+ fee for reporting bugs instead of using them to their advantage or selling them on the black market. However, it was reported that instead of fixing the bug and paying Shreateh the fee, Facebook originally told him that \"this was not a bug\" and dismissed him. Shreateh then tried a second time to inform Facebook, but they dismissed him yet again. On the third try, Shreateh used the bug to post a message to Mark Zuckerberg's Wall, stating \"Sorry for breaking your privacy&nbsp;... but a couple of days ago, I found a serious Facebook exploit\" and that Facebook's security team was not taking him seriously. Within minutes, a security engineer contacted Shreateh, questioned him on how he performed the move and ultimately acknowledged that it was a bug in the system. Facebook temporarily suspended Shreateh's account and fixed the bug after several days. However, in a move that was met with much public criticism and disapproval, Facebook refused to pay out the 500+ fee to Shreateh; instead, Facebook responded that by posting to Zuckerberg's account, Shreateh had violated one of their [[terms of service]] policies and therefore \"could not be paid.\" Included with this, the Facebook team strongly censured Shreateh over his manner of resolving the matter. In closing, they asked that Shreateh continue to help them find bugs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bort |first=Julie |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/researcher-facebook-ignored-bug-found-143418388.html |title=Researcher: Facebook Ignored the Bug I Found Until I Used It to Hack Zuckerberg - Yahoo!

Despite the significant increase in likes, Muller noticed his page has actually decreased in engagement \u2013 there were fewer people commenting, sharing, and liking his posts and updates despite the significant increase in \"likes\". Muller also noticed that the users that \"liked\" his page were users that liked hundreds of other pages, including competing pages such as [[AT&T]] and [[T-Mobile]]. He theorizes that users are purposely clicking \"like\" on any and every page in order to deter attention away from the pages they were paid to \"like\".

In 2016, [[ProPublica]] found that advertisers could target or exclude users from advertising based on an  \"Ethnic Affinity\"\u2014a demographic trait which is determined based on a user's interests and behaviors on Facebook, and not explicitly provided by the user.

Advertisers who attempt to create ads for housing, employment, or credit (HEC) opportunities would be blocked from using ethnic affinities (renamed \"multicultural affinities\" and now classified as behaviors) to target the ad. If an advertiser uses any other audience segment to target ads for HEC, they would be informed of the policies, and be required to affirm their compliance with relevant laws and policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/02/improving-enforcement-and-promoting-diversity-updates-to-ads-policies-and-tools/|title=Improving Enforcement and Promoting Diversity: Updates to Ads Policies and Tools|publisher=Facebook|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in November 2017, ProPublica found that automated enforcement of these new policies was inconsistent.

He continued by saying: \"It's a very significant, detailed and intense undertaking that will stretch over four or five days.\" In December 2011 the DPC published a first report on Facebook. This report was not legally binding but suggested changes that Facebook should undertake until July 2012. The DPC is planning to do a review about Facebook's progress in July 2012.\n\n====Changes====\nIn spring 2012, Facebook had to undertake many changes (e.g., having an extended download tool that should allow users to exercise the European right to access to all stored information or an update of the worldwide [[privacy policy]]). These changes were seen as not sufficient to comply with European law by europe-v-facebook.org. The download tool does not allow, for example, access to all data. The group has launched our-policy.org<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.our-policy.org/|title=Our-Policy.org - Annuity Payments Policies and Regulations|website=Our-policy.org|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}</ref> to suggest improvements to the new policy, which they saw as a backdrop for privacy on Facebook. Since the group managed to get more than 7.000 comments on Facebook's pages, Facebook had to do a worldwide vote on the proposed changes. Such a vote would have only been binding if 30% of all users would have taken part. Facebook did not promote the vote, resulting in only 0.038% participation with about 87% voting against Facebook's new policy.

This policy is in compliance with a United States law, the 1998 [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]], which requires minors aged 13 or younger to gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites. In jurisdictions where a similar law sets a lower minimum age, Facebook enforces the lower age. Of the 1,007 households surveyed for the study, 76% of parents reported that their child joined Facebook at an age younger than 13, the minimum age in the site's terms of service. The study also reported that Facebook removes roughly 20,000 users each day for violating its minimum age policy. The study's authors also note, \"Indeed, Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join.\" The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of United States federal law, but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors. Only 53% of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age; 35% of these parents believe that the minimum age is merely a recommendation or thought the signup age was 16 or 18, not 13.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/education/parents-children-facebook-privacy-age/ |title = Why Parents Help Their Children Lie to Facebook About Age: Unintended Consequences of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\n===Student-related issues===\n====Student privacy concerns====\nStudents who post illegal or otherwise inappropriate material have faced disciplinary action from their universities, colleges, and schools including expulsion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/10/06/fisher_college_expels_student_over_website_entries|work=The Boston Globe|title=Fisher College expels student over website entries|first=Sarah|last=Schweitzer|date=October 6, 2005}}</ref> Others posting libelous content relating to faculty have also faced disciplinary action.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=January 25, 2010|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/seventh-grade_north_syracuse_s.html|title=Seventh-grade North Syracuse student suspended, 25 others disciplined for Facebook page about teacher |work=[[The Post-Standard]]|date=January 24, 2010|author=O'Toole, Catie }}</ref> The ''Journal of Education for Business'' states that \"a recent study of 200 Facebook profiles found that 42% had comments regarding alcohol, 53% had photos involving alcohol use, 20% had comments regarding sexual activities, 25% had seminude or sexually provocative photos, and 50% included the use of profanity.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal | last1 = Peluchette | first1 = Joy | last2 = Karl | first2 = Katherine | year = 2010 | title = Examining Students' Intended Image on Facebook: \"what were they Thinking?!\". | url = | journal = Journal of Education for Business | volume = 85 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u20137 | doi=10.1080/08832320903217606}}</ref> It is inferred that negative or incriminating Facebook posts can affect alumni's and potential employers' perception of them.

Phishing takes the form of a message or Wall post that appears to come from someone on the user's Friend List but in actuality the message was sent by phishers using the friend's login information. The phishers are hoping the user takes the bait resulting in the phishers gaining access to the user's Facebook account. Soon afterwards, the user's other friends will start getting phishing messages from what appears to be the Facebook user. The point of the post is to get the users to visit a website with viruses and malware.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Unpublished photo disclosure bug ===\nIn September 2018, a software bug meant that photos that had been uploaded to Facebook accounts, but that had not been \"published\" (and which therefore should have remained private between the user and Facebook), were exposed to app developers.<ref name=\"guardian-2018-12-14\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/14/facebook-admits-bug-app-developers-hidden-photos|title=Facebook admits bug allowed apps to see hidden photos|first=Alex|last=Hern|date=December 14, 2018|accessdate=December 15, 2018|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> Approximately 6.8 million users and 1500 third-party apps were affected.<ref name=\"guardian-2018-12-14\"/>\n\n===Sharing private messages and contacts' details without consent===\nIn December 2018, it emerged that Facebook had, during the period 2010\u20132018, granted access to users' private messages, address book contents, and private posts, without the users' consent, to more than 150 third parties including Microsoft, Amazon, Yahoo, Netflix, and Spotify.

It is caused by the extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low user satisfaction, and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.<ref>Maier, C., Laumer, S., Eckhardt, A., and Weitzel, T.

The results showed that the frequency of Facebook use was moderately negatively related to general political knowledge. This was also the case when considering demographic, political-ideological variables and previous political knowledge. According to the latter, a causal relationship is indicated: the higher the Facebook use, the more the general political knowledge declines.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sangwon|last2=Xenos|first2=Michael|date=2019|title=Social distraction?

Students of high schools face a possibility of bullying and other adverse behaviors over Facebook every day. Many studies have attempted to discover whether Facebook has a positive or negative effect on children\u2019s and teenagers\u2019 social lives, and many of them have come to the conclusion that there are distinct social problems that arise with Facebook usage. British neuroscientist [[Susan Greenfield, Baroness Greenfield|Susan Greenfield]] stuck up for the issues that children encounter on social media sites. She said that they can rewire the brain, which caused some hysteria over whether or not social networking sites are safe. She did not back up her claims with research, but did cause quite a few studies to be done on the subject. When that self is then broken down by others by badmouthing, criticism, harassment, criminalization or vilification, intimidation, demonization, demoralization, belittlement, or attacking someone over the site it can cause much of the envy, anger, or depression.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Are social networking sites breeding antisocial young people? |first=Alanna |last=Bromley |journal=Journal of Digital Research and Publishing |year=2011 |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/8137/1/DRPJournal_5pm_S2_2011.pdf#page=7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WoP0y3SylQ|title=Students Take On Cyberbullying|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=My Best Day: Presentation of Self and Social Manipulation in Facebook and IM |first=Naomi S. |last=Baron |year=2007 |url=http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/5782/Baron%20-%20My%20Best%20Day.pdf?sequence=1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523064049/http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/5782/Baron%20-%20My%20Best%20Day.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=May 23, 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=A new addiction for teacher candidates: social networks |journal=The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=2012 |url=http://tojet.net/articles/v11i3/1132.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[Sherry Turkle]], in her book ''[[Sherry Turkle#Alone Together|Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other]]'', argues that social media bring people closer and further apart at the same time. One of the main points she makes is that there is a high risk in treating persons online with dispatch like objects. Although people are networked on Facebook, their expectations of each other tend to be lessened. According to Turkle, this could cause a feeling of loneliness in spite of being together.<ref>Turkle, Sherry (2011): Alone Together. Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other.

In its complaint, EPIC alleged that Facebook had deceived users by secretly conducting a psychological experiment on their emotions: \"At the time of the experiment, Facebook did not state in the Data Use Policy that user data would be used for research purposes. Facebook also failed to inform users that their personal information would be shared with researchers.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Guynn|first1=Jessica|title=Privacy watchdog files complaint over Facebook study|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/07/03/facebook-emotion-study-complaint-epic/12157471/|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=July 5, 2014|date=July 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBeyond the ethical concerns, other scholars criticized the methods and reporting of the study's findings. John Grohol, writing for [[Psych Central]], argued that despite its title and claims of \"[[emotional contagion]],\" this study did not look at emotions at all. Instead, its authors used an application (called \"Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count\" or LIWC 2007) that simply counted positive and negative words in order to infer users' sentiments. He wrote that a shortcoming of the LIWC tool is that it does not understand negations. Hence, the tweet \"I am not happy\" would be scored as positive: \"Since the LIWC 2007 ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication, so do the researchers.\" Grohol concluded that given these subtleties, the [[effect size]] of the findings are little more than a \"statistical blip.\"\n\n<blockquote>Kramer et al. (2014) found a 0.07%\u2014that's not 7 percent, that's 1/15th of one percent!!\u2014decrease in negative words in people's status updates when the number of negative posts on their Facebook news feed decreased.

The BBC found images and videos on social media of the bodies of fighters and civilians being desecrated by fighters from the self-styled Libyan National Army. The force, led by [[Khalifa Haftar|General Khalifa Haftar]], controls a swathe of territory in the east of Libya and is trying to seize the capital, Tripoli. BBC Arabic found almost one hundred images and videos from Libya shared on Facebook and YouTube, in violation of their companies\u2019 guidelines.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{Citation|title=Libyan conflict: Suspected war crimes shared online - BBC Newsnight|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp_dOW3LZ5w|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref> The UK Foreign Office said it took the allegations extremely seriously and is concerned about the impact the recent violence is having on the civilian population.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn 2017, a Facebook video of Libyan National Army (LNA) special forces commander, Mahmoud al-Werfalli was uploaded showing him shooting dead three captured fighters. The video was then shared on YouTube over ten thousand times. The International Criminal Court used it as evidence to indict al-Werfalli for the war crime of murder.<ref>https://www.icc-cpi.int/CaseInformationSheets/al-werfalliEng.pdf</ref> The BBC found the original video was still on Facebook 2 years after his indictment and also discovered videos showing the bodies of civilians being desecrated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} These were taken in Ganfouda, a district of Benghazi which was [[Battle of Benghazi (2014\u20132017)|under siege]] by the LNA between 2016-2017. More than 300 people, including dozens of children died during the siege. A video uncovered by BBC Arabic showed soldiers mocking a pile of corpses of dead civilians and trampling on bodies. Among them was a 77 year old woman, Alia Hamza. Her son, Ali Hamza had five family members killed in Ganfouda.\n\nAli Hamza told BBC Arabic, \u201cI sent links to lawyers to send to the ICC in the Hague against Khalifa Haftar and his military commanders regarding the massacres of civilians,\u201d said Hamza. In the video, the LNA soldiers label the civilians as terrorists. Human rights lawyer and war crimes specialist Rodney Dixon QC reviewed the evidence BBC Arabic found. \u201cIf groups are using those platforms to propagate their campaigns then those platforms should seriously look at their role because they could then be assisting in that process of further crimes being committed,\u201d he said.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} After presenting our findings to Facebook they removed all the videos that show a suspected war crime taking place. However, they opted not to suspend any of the accounts which we found linked to the images. Erin Saltman, Facebook's policy manager for Counterterrorism in Europe, Middle East and Africa, told BBC Arabic, \u201cSometimes there are very conflicting narratives of whether or not the victim is a terrorist, or whether it's a civilian over who's committing that act, we cannot be the pure arbiters of truth.\u201d<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> But Facebook and Youtube\u2019s own community guidelines

When it comes to alleged incitement, Facebook has been accused of being unfair, removing only posts and pages that attack [[Palestinians]], while turning a blind eye to similar posts that are violently [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]]. The NGO [[Shurat Hadin]]-Israel Law Center conducted an experiment over the incitement issue, which sought to expose what it viewed as double standards regarding anti-Israel sentiment vis-a-vis the simultaneous launch of two Facebook pages: \"Stop Palestinians\" and \"Stop Israel\". Following the launch of the two nearly identical pages, the NGO posted hateful content simultaneously on both pages. Next, Shurat Hadin's reported both faux-incitement pages to Facebook to see which, if either, would be removed. According to them, despite featuring nearly identical content, only one was removed from the online platform. They said the page inciting against Palestinians was closed by Facebook (on the same day that it was reported) for \"containing credible threat of violence\" which \"violated our [Facebook's] community standards\", but not the page inciting against Israelis. Shurat Hadin said that Facebook claimed that this page was \"not in violation of Facebook's rules\". Shurat Hadin's staged anti-Israel group \"Stop Israel\" still remains active on Facebook.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/When-it-comes-to-incitement-is-Facebook-biased-against-Israel-439436|title=When it comes to incitement, is Facebook biased against Israel? - Arab-Israeli Conflict - Jerusalem Post|website=Jpost.com|accessdate=December 16, 2018}}</ref> ProPublica stated in September 2017 that a website was able to target ads at Facebook users who were interested in \"how to burn Jew\" and \"Jew hater\".

After recruiting cell leaders on Facebook, Hezbollah and the recruits used encrypted communications to avoid detection, and the leaders continued to recruit other members.

It also develops new tools to aid in its efforts, including the use of [[artificial intelligence]] to match terrorist images and videos, detecting when content is shared across related accounts, and developing technologies to stop repeat offenders. The company stated that it has 150 people dedicated to terrorism countermeasures, and works with governments and industries in an effort to curb terrorist propaganda.

In Facebook's [[Dublin]], Ireland headquarters, six individuals were determined to be \"high priority\" victims of the error, after the company concluded that their profiles were likely viewed by potential terrorists in groups such as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], [[Hezbollah]] and the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]]. The bug itself, discovered in November 2016 and fixed two weeks later, was active for one month, and had also been retroactively exposing censored personal accounts from August 2016. One affected worker had fled Ireland, gone into hiding, and only returned to Ireland after five months due to a lack of money. Suffering from psychological distress, he filed a legal claim against Facebook and [[CPL Resources]], an [[outsourcing]] company, seeking compensation. A Facebook spokesperson stated that \"Our investigation found that only a small fraction of the names were likely viewed, and we never had evidence of any threat to the people impacted or their families as a result of this matter\", and Craig D\u2019Souza, Facebook's head of global investigations, said: \"Keep in mind that when the person sees your name on the list, it was in their activity log, which contains a lot of information [...] there is a good chance that they associate you with another admin of the group or a hacker\". Facebook offered to install a home-alarm monitoring system, provide transport to and from work, and counseling through its employee assistance program. As a result of the data leak, Facebook is reportedly testing the use of alternative, administrative accounts for workers reviewing content, rather than requiring workers to sign in with their personal profiles.<ref>{{cite web |first=Olivia |last=Solon |title=Revealed: Facebook exposed identities of moderators to suspected terrorists |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/16/facebook-moderators-identity-exposed-terrorist-groups |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=June 16, 2017 |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Joon Ian |last=Wong |title=The workers who police terrorist content on Facebook were exposed to terrorists by Facebook |url=https://qz.com/1008070/the-workers-who-police-terrorist-content-on-facebook-were-exposed-to-terrorists-by-facebook/ |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] |date=June 16, 2017 |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 2018 social network Facebook announced that it has deleted 82 accounts created in [[Iran]] that included posts advocating harsh issues such as race, [[immigration]], and U.S. President Donald Trump.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.radiofarda.com/a/facebook-deletes-iran-linked-accounts-followed-by-1-million-us-britain-political-divisive-sow-discord/29566728.html|title=Facebook Deletes Iran-Linked Accounts Followed By 1 Million In U.S., Britain|website=RFE/RL|accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Fake news===\n{{Main|Fake news website}}\nFacebook has been criticized for not doing enough to limit the spread of fake news stories on their site, especially after the [[2016 United States presidential election]], which some{{Like whom?|date=October 2019}} have claimed [[Donald Trump]] would not have won if Facebook had not helped spread what they claim to have been fake stories that were biased in his favor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/17/495827410/from-hate-speech-to-fake-news-the-content-crisis-facing-mark-zuckerberg |title=From Hate Speech To Fake News: The Content Crisis Facing Mark Zuckerberg |last=Shahani |first=Aarti |website=NPR |date=November 17, 2016}}</ref> Mark Zuckerberg has begun to take steps to eliminate the prevalence of fake news on Facebook as a result criticisms of Facebook's influence on the presidential election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/19/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-news-election/|title=Zuckerberg: Facebook will develop tools to fight fake news|last=Burke|first=Samuel|date=November 19, 2016|website=CNN Money|access-date=November 22, 2016}}</ref> At a conference called ''Techonomy'' Mark Zuckerberg stated in regards to Donald Trump, \"There's a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way that they did is because they saw some fake news\".

Especially for non-English speaking writers, Facebook does not have a proper support system to genuinely read the content and make decisions. Sometimes the content of a status did not have any \"abusive\" or defaming language, but it nevertheless got deleted on the basis that it had been secretly reported by a group of people as \"offensive\". For other languages than English, Facebook till now is not able to identify the group approach that is used to vilify humanitarian activism. In another incident, Facebook had to apologize after it deleted a free speech group's post about the abuse of human rights in Syria. In that case, a spokesman for Facebook said the post was \"mistakenly\" removed by a member of its moderation team, which receives a high volume of take-down requests.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/06/facebook-apologises-free-speech-syria |title=Facebook apologises for deleting free speech group's post on Syrian torture |website=Guardian.co.uk |date=July 6, 2013 |accessdate=June 4, 2013|location=London |first=Josh |last=Halliday}}</ref>\n\n===Enabling of harassment===\nFacebook instituted a policy by which it is now self-policed by the community of Facebook users.{{when|date=February 2015}} Some users have complained that this policy allows Facebook to empower abusive users to harass them by allowing them to submit reports on even benign comments and photos as being \"offensive\" or \"in violation of Facebook Rights and Responsibilities\" and that enough of these reports result in the user who is being harassed in this way getting their account blocked for a predetermined number of days or weeks, or even deactivated entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Jealous-Wives-Are-Getting-Courtney-Stodden-Banned-on-Facebook-227862.shtml |title=Jealous Wives Are Getting Courtney Stodden Banned on Facebook - Softpedia |website=News.softpedia.com |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFacebook UK policy director Simon Milner told [[Wired Magazine]] that \"Once the piece of content has been seen, assessed and deemed OK, (Facebook) will ignore further reports about it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/online-harassment |title= When good lulz go bad: unpicking the ugly business of online harassment |website=Wired.co.uk |date=January 27, 2014 |accessdate=August 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Lack of customer support===\nFacebook lacks live support, making it difficult to resolve issues that require the services of an administrator or are not covered in the FAQs, such as the enabling of a disabled account. The automated emailing system used when filling out a support form often refers users back to the help center or to pages that are outdated and cannot be accessed, leaving users at a dead end with no further support available.

Australian technologist [[Nik Cubrilovic]] discovered that when a user logs out of Facebook, the cookies from that login are still kept in the browser, allowing Facebook to track users on websites that include \"social widgets\" distributed by the social network. Facebook has denied the claims, saying they have 'no interest' in tracking users or their activity.

However, this setting was redundant to the existing \"Only Me\" privacy setting which was already available to hide addresses from timelines.

According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that for an initial fee of $1,000, entitles Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as additional 1% interest per each day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was ''Facemash'', the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name ''thefacebook.com'' until January 1, 2004. Facebook management has dismissed the lawsuit as \"completely frivolous\". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt issued a statement indicating that the counsel for Ceglia had unsuccessfully attempted to seek an out-of-court settlement. In an interview to ''[[ABC World News]]'', Zuckerberg stated he is confident of never signing such an agreement. At the time, Zuckerberg worked for Ceglia as a code developer on a project named \"StreetFax\". Judge Thomas Brown of Allegany Court issued a [[restraining order]] on all financial transfers concerning ownership of Facebook until further notice; in response, Facebook management successfully filed for the case to be moved to federal court.

By omitting this line, Facebook license extends to adopt users' content perpetually and irrevocably years after the content has been deleted.<ref name=\"PC World\" />\n\nMany users of Facebook voiced opinions against the changes to the Facebook Terms of Use, leading to an Internet-wide debate over the ownership of content. [[Electronic Privacy Information Center|The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)]] prepared a formal complaint with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. Many individuals were frustrated with the removal of the controversial clause. Facebook users, numbering more than 38,000, joined a user group against the changes, and a number of blogs and news sites have written about this issue.<ref name=\"PC World\" />\n\nAfter the change was brought to light in Walters's blog entry, in his blog on February 16, 2009, Zuckerberg addressed the issues concerning the recently made changes to Facebook's terms of use. Zuckerberg wrote \"Our philosophy is that people own their information and control who they share it with.\"<ref name=\"facebook4\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?blog_id=company&blogger=4|publisher=Facebook|title=Improving Your Ability to Share and Connect|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}</ref> In addition to this statement Zuckerberg explained the paradox created when people want to share their information (phone number, pictures, email address, etc.) with the public, but at the same time desire to remain in complete control of who has access to this info.<ref name=\"Facebook\" />\n\nIn order to calm criticism, Facebook returned to its original terms of use. However, on February 17, 2009, Zuckerberg wrote in his blog, that although Facebook reverted to its original terms of use, it is in the process of developing new terms in order to address the paradox. Zuckerberg stated that these new terms will allow Facebook users to \"share and control their information, and it will be written clearly in language everyone can understand.\" Zuckerberg invited users to join a group entitled \"Facebook Bill of Rights and Responsibilities\" to give their input and help shape the new terms.\n\nOn February 26, 2009, Zuckerberg posted a blog, updating users on the progress of the new Terms of Use. He wrote, \"We decided we needed to do things differently and so we're going to develop new policies that will govern our system from the ground up in an open and transparent way.\" Zuckerberg introduces the two new additions to Facebook: the Facebook Principles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=54964476066 |publisher=Facebook |title=Facebook Town Hall: Proposed Facebook Principles |accessdate=March 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227043045/http://www.facebook.com//group.php?gid=54964476066 |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> and the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=67758697570 |publisher=Facebook |title=Facebook Town Hall: Proposed Statement of Rights and Responsibilities |accessdate=March 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227043055/http://www.facebook.com//group.php?gid=67758697570 |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> Both additions allow users to vote on changes to the terms of use before they are officially released.

Users are not supposed to have the ability to post material to the Facebook Walls of other users unless they are approved friends of those users that they have posted material to. To prove that he was telling the truth, Shreateh posted material to Sarah Goodin's wall, a friend of Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. Following this, Shreateh contacted Facebook's security team with the proof that his bug was real, explaining in detail what was going on. Facebook has a bounty program in which it compensates people a $500+ fee for reporting bugs instead of using them to their advantage or selling them on the black market. However, it was reported that instead of fixing the bug and paying Shreateh the fee, Facebook originally told him that \"this was not a bug\" and dismissed him. Shreateh then tried a second time to inform Facebook, but they dismissed him yet again. On the third try, Shreateh used the bug to post a message to Mark Zuckerberg's Wall, stating \"Sorry for breaking your privacy&nbsp;... but a couple of days ago, I found a serious Facebook exploit\" and that Facebook's security team was not taking him seriously. Within minutes, a security engineer contacted Shreateh, questioned him on how he performed the move and ultimately acknowledged that it was a bug in the system. Facebook temporarily suspended Shreateh's account and fixed the bug after several days. However, in a move that was met with much public criticism and disapproval, Facebook refused to pay out the 500+ fee to Shreateh; instead, Facebook responded that by posting to Zuckerberg's account, Shreateh had violated one of their [[terms of service]] policies and therefore \"could not be paid.\" Included with this, the Facebook team strongly censured Shreateh over his manner of resolving the matter. In closing, they asked that Shreateh continue to help them find bugs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bort |first=Julie |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/researcher-facebook-ignored-bug-found-143418388.html |title=Researcher: Facebook Ignored the Bug I Found Until I Used It to Hack Zuckerberg - Yahoo!

Despite the significant increase in likes, Muller noticed his page has actually decreased in engagement \u2013 there were fewer people commenting, sharing, and liking his posts and updates despite the significant increase in \"likes\". Muller also noticed that the users that \"liked\" his page were users that liked hundreds of other pages, including competing pages such as [[AT&T]] and [[T-Mobile]]. He theorizes that users are purposely clicking \"like\" on any and every page in order to deter attention away from the pages they were paid to \"like\".

In 2016, [[ProPublica]] found that advertisers could target or exclude users from advertising based on an  \"Ethnic Affinity\"\u2014a demographic trait which is determined based on a user's interests and behaviors on Facebook, and not explicitly provided by the user.

Advertisers who attempt to create ads for housing, employment, or credit (HEC) opportunities would be blocked from using ethnic affinities (renamed \"multicultural affinities\" and now classified as behaviors) to target the ad. If an advertiser uses any other audience segment to target ads for HEC, they would be informed of the policies, and be required to affirm their compliance with relevant laws and policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/02/improving-enforcement-and-promoting-diversity-updates-to-ads-policies-and-tools/|title=Improving Enforcement and Promoting Diversity: Updates to Ads Policies and Tools|publisher=Facebook|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in November 2017, ProPublica found that automated enforcement of these new policies was inconsistent.

The various definitions can be broken down into four main categories: Historical/Archeological; Geological/Topographical; Ecological; and Cultural. In the 1930s and 1940s, many definitions of the Southwest included all or part of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah. As time has gone on, the definition of the Southwest as become more solidified and more compact. For example, in 1948 the [[National Geographic Society]] defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society's definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California.<ref name=UAtpncd /> Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include [[Erna Fergusson]], [[Charles Lummis]] (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer [[Raymond Gastil]], and ethnologist [[Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla]].<ref name=UAtpncd />\n\n===Historical/archeological===\nAs the [[Territorial evolution of the United States|US expanded westward]], the country's [[American frontier|western border]] also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Southwestern and [[Northwestern United States]]. In the early years of the United States, [[Overmountain Men|newly colonized lands]] lying immediately west of the Appalachian Mountains were [[State cessions|detached]] from North Carolina and given the name [[Southwest Territory]]. During the decades that followed, the [[Old Southwest|region known as \"the Southwestern United States\"]] covered much of the [[Deep South]] east of the Mississippi River.\n\nHowever, as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the geographical \"Southwest\" expanded, and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the South itself became \"increasingly unclear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\". Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris. University of North Carolina Press 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, archeologist, Erik Reed, gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the American Southwest, which runs from Durango, Colorado in the north, to Durango, Mexico, in the south, and from Las Vegas, Nevada in the west to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the East. Reed's definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the Learning Center of the American Southwest's definition, leaving out any portion of Kansas and Oklahoma, and much of Texas, as well as the eastern half of New Mexico. Since this article is about the Southwestern United States, the areas of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico will be excluded. The portion left includes Arizona and western New Mexico, the very southernmost part of Utah, southwestern Colorado, the very tip of west Texas, and triangle formed by the southern tip of Nevada.

Edited by Joseph Carlton Wilder. University of Arizona Press</ref> most of Texas and large parts of Oklahoma are often placed into a sub-region of the [[Southern United States|South]], which some consider southwestern in the general framework of the original application, meaning the \"Western South\". This is an area containing the basic elements of Southern [[Confederate States of America|history]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|culture]], [[Solid South|politics]], [[Bible Belt|religion]], and [[Southern American English|linguistic]] and settlement patterns, yet blended with traits of the frontier West. While this particular Southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic \"Old South\" or [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west.\n\nOne of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas\u2014in addition to being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]] during the Civil War\u2014is that Indigenous and Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Cultural Regions of the United States. Raymond Gastil. University of Washington Press 1975</ref> Although the present day state of Oklahoma was [[Indian Territory]] until the early 20th century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large American Indian populations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma\u2014unlike those in other \"southwestern\" states\u2014self-identify as living in the South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and westerners\u2014also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.<ref>Southern Focus Poll 1992\u20131999.

Although cacti is thought to only grow in Arizona and New Mexico, many native cacti grow throughout Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and west Texas. [[Steppe]] is also located all over the high plains areas in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The mountains of the southwestern states have large tracts of alpine trees.\n\n[[File:Curry County Eastern New Mexico 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] in [[Eastern New Mexico]], but also located in [[Colorado Eastern Plains|Eastern Colorado]] and [[West Texas]]]]\nLandscape features of the core southwestern areas include mountains, canyons, mesas, [[butte]]s, high broad basins, plateaus, desert lands, and some plains, characteristic of the [[Basin and Range Province]]. The entire southwestern region features semi-arid to arid terrain. The far eastern part of southwestern Texas, for example the [[Texas Hill Country]], consists of dry, tall, and rugged rocky hills of limestone and granite. [[South Texas]] and the [[Rio Grande Valley]] is mostly flat with many places consisting of scrub and bare topsoil, much like the deserts further west.\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe region has an extremely diverse bird population, with hundreds of species being found in the American Southwest.

The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" /> Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls occasionally in the winter time. Although it snows in this region, the snow in this part of the United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.\n\nNevada and Arizona are both generally arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive large amounts of snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all at lower elevations. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills. There are significant mountains as well in west Texas upon reaching the [[Trans-Pecos]] area.\n\nThe term \"High Desert\" is also synonymous with this region. The High Desert is generally defined as the [[Mojave Desert]], which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah. The High Desert also extends into other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], such as the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]] in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona, in the [[Sonoran Desert]]. This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation, much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly.\n\n[[File:CONM Independence monument 2.jpg|thumb|Monument Canyon, some of the high desert lands found in Colorado]]\n\nOther areas of the Southwest may also be referred to as the \"High Desert\" such as the [[Colorado Plateau]]. The desert lands found in Eastern Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico are usually referred to as the high desert. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in southern, southwestern, western, and the northwestern parts of the state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas such as, the [[Roan Plateau]], [[Dinosaur National Monument]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Royal Gorge]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Dove Creek, Colorado|Dove Creek]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Four Corners Monument]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. Besides the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico, they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay further north.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" />\n\n==National parks, monuments and forests==\n[[File:Grand Canyon Ao\u00fbt 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=3.65|center|<center>[[Grand Canyon]] from the South Rim</center>]]\nThe southwestern United States contains many well-known national parks including [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] in Arizona, [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] in California, [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] in Colorado, [[Arches National Park|Arches]] in Utah, [[Big Bend National Park|Big Bend]] in Texas, [[Great Basin National Park|Great Basin]] in Nevada, and [[White Sands National Park|White Sands]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[File:Dunes as White Sands NM.jpg|thumb|[[White Sands National Park]], New Mexico]]\nArizona parks and monuments include Grand Canyon, [[Monument Valley]] (a [[Navajo Nation]] park), [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], and [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro]] national parks; the national monuments of [[Agua Fria National Monument|Agua Fria]], [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]], [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], [[Chiricahua National Monument|Chiricahua]], [[Ironwood Forest National Monument|Ironwood Forest]], [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo]], [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument|Organ Pipe Cactus]], [[Pipe Spring National Monument|Pipe Spring]], [[Sonoran Desert National Monument|Sonoran Desert]], [[Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument|Sunset Crater]], [[Tonto National Monument|Tonto]], [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]], [[Vermilion Cliffs National Monument|Vermilion Cliffs]], [[Walnut Canyon National Monument|Walnut Canyon]], and [[Wupatki National Monument|Wupatki]].

He calls the first subregion \"[[Northern New Mexico]]\", and describes it as focused on [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. It extends from the [[San Luis Valley]] of southern Colorado to south of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]] and including the [[Manzano Mountains]], with an east-west breadth in the north stretching from the upper [[Canadian River]] to the upper [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]. The area around Albuquerque is sometimes called [[Central New Mexico]].\n\n\"Central Arizona\" is a vast metropolitan area spread across one contiguous sprawling oasis, essentially equivalent to the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]]. The city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] is the largest urban center, and located in the approximate center of the area that includes [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], and many others.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 103\u2013106</ref>\n\nMeinig calls the third subregion \"El Paso, Tucson, and the Southern Borderlands\". While [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] are distinctly different cities, they serve as anchor points to the hinterland between them. [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] occupies a large oasis at the western end of the El Paso-Tucson corridor. The region between the two cities is a major transportation trunk with settlements servicing both highway and railway needs. There are also large mining operations, ranches, and agricultural oases. Both El Paso and Tucson have large military installations nearby; [[Fort Bliss]] and [[White Sands Missile Range]] north of El Paso in New Mexico, and, near Tucson, the [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]]. About {{convert|70|mi|km}} to the southeast are the research facilities at [[Fort Huachuca]]. These military installations form a kind of hinterland around the El Paso-Tucson region, and are served by scientific and residential communities such as [[Sierra Vista, Arizona|Sierra Vista]], [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], and [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]]. El Paso's influence extends north into the [[Mesilla Valley]], and southeast along the Rio Grande into the [[Trans-Pecos]] region of Texas.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 112\u2013114</ref>\n\nThe fourth subregion Meinig calls the \"Northern Corridor and Navajolands\".

The various definitions can be broken down into four main categories: Historical/Archeological; Geological/Topographical; Ecological; and Cultural. In the 1930s and 1940s, many definitions of the Southwest included all or part of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah. As time has gone on, the definition of the Southwest as become more solidified and more compact. For example, in 1948 the [[National Geographic Society]] defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society's definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California.<ref name=UAtpncd /> Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include [[Erna Fergusson]], [[Charles Lummis]] (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer [[Raymond Gastil]], and ethnologist [[Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla]].<ref name=UAtpncd />\n\n===Historical/archeological===\nAs the [[Territorial evolution of the United States|US expanded westward]], the country's [[American frontier|western border]] also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Southwestern and [[Northwestern United States]]. In the early years of the United States, [[Overmountain Men|newly colonized lands]] lying immediately west of the Appalachian Mountains were [[State cessions|detached]] from North Carolina and given the name [[Southwest Territory]]. During the decades that followed, the [[Old Southwest|region known as \"the Southwestern United States\"]] covered much of the [[Deep South]] east of the Mississippi River.\n\nHowever, as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the geographical \"Southwest\" expanded, and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the South itself became \"increasingly unclear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\". Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris. University of North Carolina Press 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, archeologist, Erik Reed, gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the American Southwest, which runs from Durango, Colorado in the north, to Durango, Mexico, in the south, and from Las Vegas, Nevada in the west to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the East. Reed's definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the Learning Center of the American Southwest's definition, leaving out any portion of Kansas and Oklahoma, and much of Texas, as well as the eastern half of New Mexico. Since this article is about the Southwestern United States, the areas of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico will be excluded. The portion left includes Arizona and western New Mexico, the very southernmost part of Utah, southwestern Colorado, the very tip of west Texas, and triangle formed by the southern tip of Nevada. This will be the defined scope which is used in this article, unless otherwise specified in a particular area.<ref name=LCASDefine />\n\n===Geological/topographical===\nFrom this perspective, almost all of the region's physiographical traits, geological formations, and weather are contained within a box between 26\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 northern latitude, and 98\u00b0 30' and  124\u00b0 western longitude.<ref name=UAtsd>{{cite web | url=http://jsw.library.arizona.edu/3403/defined.html | publisher=University of Arizona | title=The Southwest Defined | editor-last=Wilder | editor-first=Joseph Carlton | accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Ecological===\nWhen looking at the fauna of the region, there is a broader definition of the American Southwest. The Southwestern Center for Herpetological Research defines the Southwest as being only the states of Arizona, New Mexico, with parts of California, Nevada, Texas, and Utah; although they include all of those six states in their map of the region, solely for ease of defining the border.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://southwesternherp.com/americansouthwestdefined.html | publisher=Southwestern Center for Herpetological Research | title=The American Southwest Defined | accessdate=July 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural===\n[[File:LCASMapoftheSouthwest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Southwestern United States as defined by the Learning Center of the American Southwest<ref name=LCASDefine/>]]\nParts of the other states make up the various areas which can be included in the Southwest, depending on the source.

Edited by Joseph Carlton Wilder. University of Arizona Press</ref> most of Texas and large parts of Oklahoma are often placed into a sub-region of the [[Southern United States|South]], which some consider southwestern in the general framework of the original application, meaning the \"Western South\". This is an area containing the basic elements of Southern [[Confederate States of America|history]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|culture]], [[Solid South|politics]], [[Bible Belt|religion]], and [[Southern American English|linguistic]] and settlement patterns, yet blended with traits of the frontier West. While this particular Southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic \"Old South\" or [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west.\n\nOne of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas\u2014in addition to being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]] during the Civil War\u2014is that Indigenous and Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Cultural Regions of the United States. Raymond Gastil. University of Washington Press 1975</ref> Although the present day state of Oklahoma was [[Indian Territory]] until the early 20th century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large American Indian populations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma\u2014unlike those in other \"southwestern\" states\u2014self-identify as living in the South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and westerners\u2014also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.<ref>Southern Focus Poll 1992\u20131999.

Although cacti is thought to only grow in Arizona and New Mexico, many native cacti grow throughout Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and west Texas. [[Steppe]] is also located all over the high plains areas in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.

The entire southwestern region features semi-arid to arid terrain.

The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" /> Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls occasionally in the winter time. Although it snows in this region, the snow in this part of the United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.\n\nNevada and Arizona are both generally arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive large amounts of snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all at lower elevations. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills. There are significant mountains as well in west Texas upon reaching the [[Trans-Pecos]] area.\n\nThe term \"High Desert\" is also synonymous with this region. The High Desert is generally defined as the [[Mojave Desert]], which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah. The High Desert also extends into other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], such as the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]] in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona, in the [[Sonoran Desert]]. This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation, much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly.\n\n[[File:CONM Independence monument 2.jpg|thumb|Monument Canyon, some of the high desert lands found in Colorado]]\n\nOther areas of the Southwest may also be referred to as the \"High Desert\" such as the [[Colorado Plateau]]. The desert lands found in Eastern Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico are usually referred to as the high desert. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in southern, southwestern, western, and the northwestern parts of the state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas such as, the [[Roan Plateau]], [[Dinosaur National Monument]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Royal Gorge]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Dove Creek, Colorado|Dove Creek]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Four Corners Monument]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. Besides the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico, they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay further north.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" />\n\n==National parks, monuments and forests==\n[[File:Grand Canyon Ao\u00fbt 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=3.65|center|<center>[[Grand Canyon]] from the South Rim</center>]]\nThe southwestern United States contains many well-known national parks including [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] in Arizona, [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] in California, [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] in Colorado, [[Arches National Park|Arches]] in Utah, [[Big Bend National Park|Big Bend]] in Texas, [[Great Basin National Park|Great Basin]] in Nevada, and [[White Sands National Park|White Sands]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[File:Dunes as White Sands NM.jpg|thumb|[[White Sands National Park]], New Mexico]]\nArizona parks and monuments include Grand Canyon, [[Monument Valley]] (a [[Navajo Nation]] park), [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], and [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro]] national parks; the national monuments of [[Agua Fria National Monument|Agua Fria]], [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]], [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], [[Chiricahua National Monument|Chiricahua]], [[Ironwood Forest National Monument|Ironwood Forest]], [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo]], [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument|Organ Pipe Cactus]], [[Pipe Spring National Monument|Pipe Spring]], [[Sonoran Desert National Monument|Sonoran Desert]], [[Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument|Sunset Crater]], [[Tonto National Monument|Tonto]], [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]], [[Vermilion Cliffs National Monument|Vermilion Cliffs]], [[Walnut Canyon National Monument|Walnut Canyon]], and [[Wupatki National Monument|Wupatki]].

The [[Mountain West Conference]] also has two teams, the [[UNLV Rebels]] and the [[New Mexico Lobos|University of New Mexico Lobos]]. [[Conference USA]] is represented by the [[UTEP Miners|University of Texas at El Paso Miners]]. The [[Big Sky Conference]] has two teams: the [[Northern Arizona Lumberjacks|Lumberjacks]] of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, and the [[Southern Utah Thunderbirds|Southern Utah University Thunderbirds]] in Cedar City, Utah. The [[Western Athletic Conference]] also has two representatives, the [[New Mexico State Aggies|New Mexico State University Aggies]] in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and the [[Grand Canyon Antelopes|Grand Canyon University Antelopes]] in Phoenix.\n\nLas Vegas is becoming the nexus for NCAA league basketball tournaments.

{"title_page": "List of optimization software", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{unreferenced|date=August 2013}}\nGiven a transformation between input and output values, described by a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] ''f'', [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] deals with generating and selecting a best solution from some set of available alternatives, by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set, computing the output of the function, and recording the best output values found during the process. Many real-world problems can be modeled in this way. For example, the inputs can be design parameters of a motor, the output can be the power consumption, or the inputs can be business choices and the output can be the obtained profit.\n\nAn [[optimization problem]], in this case a minimization problem, can be represented in the following way\n:''Given:'' a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' : ''A'' <math>\\to</math> '''R''' from some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' to the [[real number]]s\n:''Search for:'' an element ''x''<sub>0</sub> in ''A'' such that ''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>) \u2264 ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''A''.\n\nIn continuous optimization, ''A'' is some [[subset]] of the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, often specified by a set of ''[[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s'', equalities or inequalities that the members of ''A'' have to satisfy. In combinatorial optimization, ''A'' is some [[subset]] of a discrete space, like binary strings, permutations, or sets of integers.\n\nThe use of '''optimization software''' requires that the function ''f'' is defined in a suitable programming language and connected at compile or run time to the optimization software. The optimization software will deliver input values in ''A'', the software module realizing ''f'' will deliver the computed value ''f''(''x'') and, in some cases, additional information about the function like derivatives.\n\nIn this manner, a clear separation of concerns is obtained: different optimization software modules can be easily tested on the same function ''f'', or a given optimization software can be used for different functions ''f''.\n\nThe following tables provide a list of notable optimization software organized according to license and business model type.\n\n==Free and open-source software==\n;Applications\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Many real-world problems can be modeled in this way. For example, the inputs can be design parameters of a motor, the output can be the power consumption, or the inputs can be business choices and the output can be the obtained profit.\n\nAn [[optimization problem]], in this case a minimization problem, can be represented in the following way\n:''Given:'' a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' : ''A'' <math>\\to</math> '''R''' from some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' to the [[real number]]s\n:''Search for:'' an element ''x''<sub>0</sub> in ''A'' such that ''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>) \u2264 ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''A''.\n\nIn continuous optimization, ''A'' is some [[subset]] of the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, often specified by a set of ''[[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s'', equalities or inequalities that the members of ''A'' have to satisfy. In combinatorial optimization, ''A'' is some [[subset]] of a discrete space, like binary strings, permutations, or sets of integers.\n\nThe use of '''optimization software''' requires that the function ''f'' is defined in a suitable programming language and connected at compile or run time to the optimization software. The optimization software will deliver input values in ''A'', the software module realizing ''f'' will deliver the computed value ''f''(''x'') and, in some cases, additional information about the function like derivatives.\n\nIn this manner, a clear separation of concerns is obtained: different optimization software modules can be easily tested on the same function ''f'', or a given optimization software can be used for different functions ''f''.\n\nThe following tables provide a list of notable optimization software organized according to license and business model type.\n\n==Free and open-source software==\n;Applications\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
