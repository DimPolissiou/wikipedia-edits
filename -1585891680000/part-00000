La Salle is represented in the high school level by [[De La Salle Zobel]], and are known as the [[Zobel Junior Archers]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Athletic history==\nThe pre-[[World War II|war]] NCAA was established by a very sports-minded De La Salle Brother named Br. John Lynam, FSC. The De La Salle Green Archers were a founding member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|NCAA]] in 1924. La Salle participated in the league for 57 years until the 1980\u201381 NCAA Season winning five NCAA General Championships in the process (1972, 1974, 1976, 1977, and 1980). The high school (juniors' division) counterpart were the Greenies from De La Salle College High School until 1968 when the then High School in Taft Avenue, Manila was phased-out and transferred to the then new Green Hills Ortigas Campus in Mandaluyong City. The Greenies had won two General Championships. [[La Salle Green Hills]] (LSGH) was established in 1959 and was eventually made the high school counterpart of De La Salle College. It inherited the moniker Greenies and eventually became known as the Junior Archers. LSGH won eight General Championships until 1981 when La Salle withdrew from the NCAA.\n\nFrom 1981 through 1985 the school participated in the PICUAA, invitational meets, interclub tournaments, and the National Open. [[De La Salle University]] (DLSU) then joined the [[UAAP]] in 1986.<ref>Toring: UAAP Admits DLSU \u2013 When The Torch Was Lit. The La Sallian July, 1998.</ref>  La Salle chose the newly established [[De La Salle Santiago Zobel School]] (DLSZ) as their UAAP Juniors counterpart. LSGH was later asked by [[De La Salle\u2013College of Saint Benilde]] to compete as their juniors team in the NCAA when it applied and was accepted in 1998. Ever since joining the UAAP in 1986, DLSU has won three UAAP General Championships \u2013 Season 75 (2012\u201313),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/cbb/content/301025/dlsu-wins-first-uaap-general-championship/story/|title=DLSU wins first UAAP General Championship|work=GMA|access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref> Season 76 (2013\u201314),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/53456-la-salle-overall-champions-uaap-season|title=La Salle crowned UAAP Season 76 overall champions|work=Rappler|access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref> and Season 78 (2015\u201316),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/sports/2016/05/08/1581418/la-salle-overall-champ-uaap-ust-second|title=La Salle overall champ in UAAP; UST second|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref> giving the university a combined eight General Championship titles in the seniors' division in the NCAA and UAAP.

The school's golden era of football was from 1932 through 1940 when La Salle was the Senior division NCAA 9-peat champion, considered by some to be a highly unbreakable record. The golden era featured Virgilio Lobregat, Rafael Ygoa, Totit Valles,  Peping Campos, Ling Miranda, Mimi Heredia, Nono Crespo, Adi Manzano, Gorda de Larrazabal, Leo Prieto, Quinito Ortigas, Petuguis Herrera, Paulino Ugarte, Charlie Russel, Jiki Garcia, Jave Javellana, Bulilit Reyes, Richard Tillman, and Kastila Ynunciaga.  La Salle was also the Senior division 6-peat champion from 1971 through 1977.

The team was bannered by national team mainstay and league MVP Tuteng Marasigan, Jay Pascual, Tats Ramos, Panky Abijay, Carlo Blanco, Teo Ocampo, JM Pons, Javi Manticon, Dennis Villanueva, rookie standouts Christian Lozano, and Albe Aparilla, and coached by [[Hans Smit]].\n\nAs it was in the 1991\u201392 season, DLSU was declared joint UAAP champions with UST after a fight broke loose during the final minutes of the game with DLSU leading 2\u20131, both goals scored by Cocoy Rojas.  This team was bannered by veterans Gerard Araw, Mon Sandejas, Sammy Mubarak, Marbon Gonzales, Gurpreet Samrow, Paolo Relucio, Carlo Manalo, Tuteng Marasigan together with the most talented rookie class headed by Tats Ramos, Cocoy Rojas, Javi Legarda, and Rufino Gutierrez.\n\nIn the 1993\u201394 season, La Salle lost to UST 4\u20130 in the championship game but most of the awards were garnered by the Green Archers led by their rookie sensation, Panky Abijay who was voted as the Best Scorer for that season scoring 17 goals in 10 games, followed by Tats Ramos as the Best Goalie and Tuteng Marasigan as the Best Midfielder. The following season, La Salle dethroned UST to win its second UAAP championship title.\n\nIn the 1995\u201396 UAAP season, the team however failed to defend its championship losing to Ateneo de Manila University in a loss in the Finals. Ateneo entered the Finals with a twice-to-beat advantage by topping the eliminations round. La Salle took Game 1 of the Finals series 2\u20131 to arrange the final showdown, but lost 2\u20131 to the Vince Santos-powered Ateneo team.\n\nThe following year, Coach Hans revamped the DLSU lineup and enhanced the team with several rookies and sophomores. The team included rookies William Paradies, Torto Canga, Jon Chua, Joey Mapa, Dave Javellana, Jun Sola, Peter Amores and Dodee Molina to complement holdovers Alvin Ocampo, Christian Lozano, Norman Azarcon, JM Pons, Owens Sun, Albe Aparilla, Byron Rempillo, Theo Zaragoza and LJ Villanueva. The team topped the eliminations round and this time had the twice-to-beat advantage in the rematch with Ateneo in the Finals. DLSU however did not allow the Finals to reach a 2nd game and recaptured the 1996\u201397 crown via a 2\u20131 victory, courtesy of goals by midfielders Norman Azarcon and Albe Aparilla.\n\nWith a near intact line-up and key additions such as the comebacking Francis Feliciano and Dennis Villanueva to anchor the defense and rookie goal keeper Ted Guinto, DLSU successfully defended its crown in the 1997\u201398 season and captured back-to-back championships. This year DLSU again took the twice-to-beat advantage leading into the Finals, however Ateneo took Game 1 via a 2\u20131 victory. DLSU however regrouped in time for the deciding match. Ateneo took the lead early via a header from Ramon Espejo in the first half and kept the 1\u20130 lead at halftime. The second half was a completely different story, with DLSU unleashing its true scoring form, taking 5 straight goals in the second half to take the title once again via a 5\u20131 hammering of its arch-rival. Alvin Ocampo and Christian Lozano took co-MVP honors.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://goarchers.com/21613/legends-corner-an-oral-history-of-la-salles-four-uaap-mens-football-titles/|title= Legends Corner: An Oral History of La Salle\u2019s four UAAP Men\u2019s Football Titles|work=GoArchers |access-date=October 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Women's football====\n{{main|DLSU Lady Booters}}\n\n===Volleyball===\n\nLa Salle has a total of 42 volleyball championship titles in the NCAA and UAAP combined.

John Lynam, FSC. The De La Salle Green Archers were a founding member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|NCAA]] in 1924. La Salle participated in the league for 57 years until the 1980\u201381 NCAA Season winning five NCAA General Championships in the process (1972, 1974, 1976, 1977, and 1980). The high school (juniors' division) counterpart were the Greenies from De La Salle College High School until 1968 when the then High School in Taft Avenue, Manila was phased-out and transferred to the then new Green Hills Ortigas Campus in Mandaluyong City. The Greenies had won two General Championships. [[La Salle Green Hills]] (LSGH) was established in 1959 and was eventually made the high school counterpart of De La Salle College. It inherited the moniker Greenies and eventually became known as the Junior Archers. LSGH won eight General Championships until 1981 when La Salle withdrew from the NCAA.\n\nFrom 1981 through 1985 the school participated in the PICUAA, invitational meets, interclub tournaments, and the National Open.

La Salle took Game 1 of the Finals series 2\u20131 to arrange the final showdown, but lost 2\u20131 to the Vince Santos-powered Ateneo team.\n\nThe following year, Coach Hans revamped the DLSU lineup and enhanced the team with several rookies and sophomores.

The team topped the eliminations round and this time had the twice-to-beat advantage in the rematch with Ateneo in the Finals. DLSU however did not allow the Finals to reach a 2nd game and recaptured the 1996\u201397 crown via a 2\u20131 victory, courtesy of goals by midfielders Norman Azarcon and Albe Aparilla.\n\nWith a near intact line-up and key additions such as the comebacking Francis Feliciano and Dennis Villanueva to anchor the defense and rookie goal keeper Ted Guinto, DLSU successfully defended its crown in the 1997\u201398 season and captured back-to-back championships. This year DLSU again took the twice-to-beat advantage leading into the Finals, however Ateneo took Game 1 via a 2\u20131 victory. DLSU however regrouped in time for the deciding match. Ateneo took the lead early via a header from Ramon Espejo in the first half and kept the 1\u20130 lead at halftime. The second half was a completely different story, with DLSU unleashing its true scoring form, taking 5 straight goals in the second half to take the title once again via a 5\u20131 hammering of its arch-rival. Alvin Ocampo and Christian Lozano took co-MVP honors.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://goarchers.com/21613/legends-corner-an-oral-history-of-la-salles-four-uaap-mens-football-titles/|title= Legends Corner: An Oral History of La Salle\u2019s four UAAP Men\u2019s Football Titles|work=GoArchers |access-date=October 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Women's football====\n{{main|DLSU Lady Booters}}\n\n===Volleyball===\n\nLa Salle has a total of 42 volleyball championship titles in the NCAA and UAAP combined.

P. Matthen''', (1890\u20131960) CP Matthen was born in 1890 to a landed Christian family in central Travancore, in the Mavelikara district. It was unusual in that agricultural economy, even for landed families to educate their children beyond high school, but Matthen went to Madras after high school and took a degree in Arts and then in Law. After college at the age of 19, Matthen raised Rs 56,000 in capital and Rs 54,000 in deposits and started a bank that he called the Quilon Bank. In a relatively short space of 15 years, the bank\u2019s total working capital rose from Rs 156,000 to Rs 10,246,000. The success of the bank moved Matthen from a village in Travancore called Thiruvilla, to being a leading businessman in Madras with wide business\u00a0 interests - in banking, insurance, manufacturing and plantations.\n\nAnother leading Travancore businessman of that era was Mr K C Mammen Mapallay, whose interests were not only in banking - his bank was called the Travancore National Bank - but also in journalism, newspaper publishing and politics, his heart was actually in journalism, and his main job was being the Chief Editor of a Travancore newspaper called the Manorama. \n\nMammen and Matthen had started an insurance company together, and the great commercial success of this new venture led them to consider amalgamating their respective banks in 1936. Since the merged bank would become the largest bank in South India, the plan was to move the headquarters of the consolidated bank from Travancore to Madras, but at this point Sir CP encouraged them to establish the bank headquarters in Travancore, and as an incentive he offered to place Rs 7,000,000 of Travancore treasury money as a deposit with the merged bank. The temptation of the Travancore treasury money ensnared the two Travancore based businessmen to establish the consolidated bank\u2019s headquarters in Quilon (in Travancore) though Matthen - as the CEO and Managing Director - continued to live and operate the bank from Madras, and Mammen lived in Kottayam where he published his newspaper\n\n==Imprisonment==\nThe amalgamated Travancore National and Quilon Bank was established in 1936 with a new Quilon headquarters building which Matthen built at a cost of Rs. 140,000 (a very large sum of money at that time). To retain the business and deposits of the Travancore State, Matthen and Mammen had not only agreed to the headquarters in Travancore but that two of the bank\u2019s directors were the Dewan\u2019s appointees and also that the Bank\u2019s General Manager, a confidant of the Dewan named K. S. Ramanujam, was appointed at the specific recommendation of Sir CP. Despite this initial support from the Travancore Government, in a couple of years, rumors started making its rounds that the bank was insolvent, and by 1938 there was a run on the bank\u2019s assets \u2013 this was instigated not only by the Dewan but was publicized by the Travancore State\u2019s Department of Publicity. The bank\u2019s financial run concluded with 88% of the public\u2019s deposits being returned by the bank, and the bank becoming insolvent. At this point the trap was sprung, by Sir CP\u2019s administration demanding the extradition of Matthen and Mammen to from Madras Presidency to Travancore State to stand trial for defrauding the public. Sir CP also convinced the British Government in Madras that the bank and its directors had been financing the Congress party and the Independence movement, so appeals to the Madras High Court and the Privy Council in London to stay the extradition orders were rejected and 3 directors of the bank including Matthen, Mammen and Mammen\u2019s elder brother and Mammen\u2019s son, were transported in chains from Madras to Quilon to stand trial.\n\nAt the trial in Trivandrum, the erstwhile General Manager of the bank - K. S. Ramanujam, who was the nominee of the Maharaja's government - falsely testified that Mammen and Matthen had defrauded the bank and four directors (including Mammen\u2019s brother and son) were then awarded 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. The bank\u2019s remaining assets were liquidated by the State, and the bank\u2019s assets were distributed - mainly to confidants of Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyer, one of whom acquired the bank headquarters\u2019 building in Quilon for Rs 15,000 - approximately a tenth of what it had cost to build three years earlier. With the first year in jail, Mammen\u2019s imprisoned elder brother died a broken man. Soon afterwards, Sir CP, who had been an astute lawyer in the colonial administration, being keenly aware of the weaknesses in the Government\u2019s case \u2013 which depended on K. S. Ramanujam who vanished abroad after the trial - sent word to Mammen and Matthen that if they admitted their accused guilt and sought the Maharaja\u2019s mercy they could be pardoned. Mammen and his son, had other major family problems, so they agreed to sign the false declaration but Matthen continued to refuse. Sir CP initially declined to agree to the release without all of three of them admitting guilt, but finally released Mammen and his son on receiving their written \u201cconfessions\u201d. Matthen continued to hold out on his refusal to sign any false confession, despite heavy pressure brought on him through the Inspector General of Police, Mr Abdul Karim, visiting him regularly in jail and suggesting that he sign a letter \u2013 which the IG had drafted, requesting the Maharaja to pardon and release him.\nFinally, on 22nd January 1942, Mr. C. P. Matthen was unconditionally released by the Maharaja's Government without any written or verbal false admission of guilt. The IG, Mr. Abdul Karim, took Matthen in his official car from Travancore jail to his house where his family had waited patiently for his release from jail.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nMr. C. P. Matthen was a member of the First [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian Parliament) in 1952, representing [[Mavelikara]] Constituency of [[Kerala]].\n\n==Lok Sabha member and Ambassador==\nHe was elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1953, from Mavelikera constitutioncy in Kerala by one of the largest majorities of that election.  \n\nAfter completing his term in the [[Lok Sabha]], in 1957, he was appointed as the Indian Ambassador to [[Sudan]].

P. Matthen''', (1890\u20131960) CP Matthen was born in 1890 to a landed Christian family in central Travancore, in the Mavelikara district. It was unusual in that agricultural economy, even for landed families to educate their children beyond high school, but Matthen went to Madras after high school and took a degree in Arts and then in Law. After college at the age of 19, Matthen raised Rs 56,000 in capital and Rs 54,000 in deposits and started a bank that he called the Quilon Bank. In a relatively short space of 15 years, the bank\u2019s total working capital rose from Rs 156,000 to Rs 10,246,000. The success of the bank moved Matthen from a village in Travancore called Tiruvilla, to being a leading businessman in Madras with wide business\u00a0 interests - in banking, insurance, manufacturing and plantations.\n\nAnother leading Travancore businessman of that era was Mr K C Mammen Mapallay, whose interests were not only in banking - his bank was called the Travancore National Bank - but also in journalism, newspaper publishing and politics, his heart was actually in journalism, and his main job was being the Chief Editor of a Travancore newspaper called the Manorama. \n\nMammen and Matthen had started an insurance company together, and the great commercial success of this new venture led them to consider amalgamating their respective banks in 1936. Since the merged bank would become the largest bank in South India, the plan was to move the headquarters of the consolidated bank from Travancore to Madras, but at this point Sir CP encouraged them to establish the bank headquarters in Travancore, and as an incentive he offered to place Rs 7,000,000 of Travancore treasury money as a deposit with the merged bank. The temptation of the Travancore treasury money ensnared the two Travancore based businessmen to establish the consolidated bank\u2019s headquarters in Quilon (in Travancore) though Matthen - as the CEO and Managing Director - continued to live and operate the bank from Madras, and Mammen lived in Kottayam where he published his newspaper\n\n==Imprisonment==\nThe amalgamated Travancore National and Quilon Bank was established in 1936 with a new Quilon headquarters building which Matthen built at a cost of Rs. 140,000 (a very large sum of money at that time). To retain the business and deposits of the Travancore State, Matthen and Mammen had not only agreed to the headquarters in Travancore but that two of the bank\u2019s directors were the Dewan\u2019s appointees and also that the Bank\u2019s General Manager, a confidant of the Dewan named K. S. Ramanujam, was appointed at the specific recommendation of Sir CP. Despite this initial support from the Travancore Government, in a couple of years, rumors started making its rounds that the bank was insolvent, and by 1938 there was a run on the bank\u2019s assets \u2013 this was instigated not only by the Dewan but was publicized by the Travancore State\u2019s Department of Publicity. The bank\u2019s financial run concluded with 88% of the public\u2019s deposits being returned by the bank, and the bank becoming insolvent. At this point the trap was sprung, by Sir CP\u2019s administration demanding the extradition of Matthen and Mammen to from Madras Presidency to Travancore State to stand trial for defrauding the public. Sir CP also convinced the British Government in Madras that the bank and its directors had been financing the Congress party and the Independence movement, so appeals to the Madras High Court and the Privy Council in London to stay the extradition orders were rejected and 3 directors of the bank including Matthen, Mammen and Mammen\u2019s elder brother and Mammen\u2019s son, were transported in chains from Madras to Quilon to stand trial.\n\nAt the trial in Trivandrum, the erstwhile General Manager of the bank - K. S. Ramanujam, who was the nominee of the Maharaja's government - falsely testified that Mammen and Matthen had defrauded the bank and four directors (including Mammen\u2019s brother and son) were then awarded 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. The bank\u2019s remaining assets were liquidated by the State, and the bank\u2019s assets were distributed - mainly to confidants of Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyer, one of whom acquired the bank headquarters\u2019 building in Quilon for Rs 15,000 - approximately a tenth of what it had cost to build three years earlier. With the first year in jail, Mammen\u2019s imprisoned elder brother died a broken man. Soon afterwards, Sir CP, who had been an astute lawyer in the colonial administration, being keenly aware of the weaknesses in the Government\u2019s case \u2013 which depended on K. S. Ramanujam who vanished abroad after the trial - sent word to Mammen and Matthen that if they admitted their accused guilt and sought the Maharaja\u2019s mercy they could be pardoned. Mammen and his son, had other major family problems, so they agreed to sign the false declaration but Matthen continued to refuse. Sir CP initially declined to agree to the release without all of three of them admitting guilt, but finally released Mammen and his son on receiving their written \u201cconfessions\u201d. Matthen continued to hold out on his refusal to sign any false confession, despite heavy pressure brought on him through the Inspector General of Police, Mr Abdul Karim, visiting him regularly in jail and suggesting that he sign a letter \u2013 which the IG had drafted, requesting the Maharaja to pardon and release him.\nFinally, on 22nd January 1942, Mr. C. P. Matthen was unconditionally released by the Maharaja's Government without any written or verbal false admission of guilt. The IG, Mr. Abdul Karim, took Matthen in his official car from Travancore jail to his house where his family had waited patiently for his release from jail.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nMr. C. P. Matthen was a member of the First [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian Parliament) in 1952, representing [[Mavelikara]] Constituency of [[Kerala]].\n\n==Lok Sabha member and Ambassador==\nHe was elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1953, from Mavelikera constitutioncy in Kerala by one of the largest majorities of that election.  \n\nAfter completing his term in the [[Lok Sabha]], in 1957, he was appointed as the Indian Ambassador to [[Sudan]]. He retired a year later due to health reasons caused by his years of imprisonment in Trivandrum.\n\n==Death==\nDied on 2 June 1960 in [[Paris]], \u00cele-de-France, France and buried at [[Thiruvalla]], Kerala, India.<ref name=\"geni\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Chalakuzhy-Poulose-Matthen-C-P-Matthen/6000000006434764012|title=Matthen (1890 - 1960) - Genealogy|publisher=geni.com|accessdate=2015-11-09}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Hard Copy==\n# N.M.Mathew, ''History of the Mar Thoma Church'', (Malayalam), Vol 3, 2008. page 75\n#''Chalakuzhy Kudumba Charitram'', Thomas Mathew (ed.) 1987.\n\n==External links==\n#{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/10/07/stories/2009100759851300.htm|title=C.P.

It was released on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] on December 15, 2014. Early alpha and beta versions were browser-based and [[free-to-play]]. On October 14, 2018, the game was released for mobile [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platforms after a successful and long-supported [[Kickstarter]] fundraiser. On July 24, 2019, a beta [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] port for the Steam version of the game became available. The free-to-play, [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash]] browser version is still available but no longer supported since 2020, as the developers focus on porting the game to Unity. ''Town of Salem'' is reportedly the largest online version of the classic social deduction party game [[Mafia (party game)|''Werewolf'']].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/299329/Indie_Smash_Hit_Town_of_Salem_Gets_New_Expansion_The%0ACoven.php|title=Indie Smash Hit Town of Salem Gets New Expansion: The Coven|website=www.gamasutra.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> It has a player base of over 8 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Popular Online Game, Town of Salem, Hit with Massive Data Breach |url=https://evolvemga.com/town-of-salem/ |website=Evolve MGA |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game is inspired by the party games ''Werewolf'' and ''[[Mafia (party game)|Mafia]]'', in which players adopt different roles belonging to different teams, of an informed minority and uninformed majority, aiming to eliminate each other for control of the village or town. As the name implies, the game takes place in the historical town of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]], alluding to the infamous [[Salem witch trials|witch-hunt trials]] that killed innocent townspeople due to paranoia and superstition. The chief strategy of the game is to survive and accomplish win conditions. Players use a combination of role abilities, teamwork, communication, deduction and deception to achieve victory.\n\nThe game features 49 unique roles, including ones from the ''The Coven'' expansion pack.<ref name=\"the gamer 2019\">{{cite web |last1=Pellow |first1=Nichole |title=Town of Salem: 5 Best Roles To Play (& 5 Worst) |url=https://www.thegamer.com/town-of-salem-best-worst-roles/ |website=The Gamer |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> Seven game modes and one custom mode are available on the vanilla. The bespoke modes are Classic, Ranked Practice, Ranked, Rapid, All Any, Rainbow and Dracula's Palace. They are modes that have pre-selected roles for the match. Custom mode allows the host of the match to choose the roles available. All modes except Custom and Rapid require 15 players. Seven is the minimum number of players for Custom and Rapid modes. Once the match begins, the players will create their name for the match. If they did not type in a name, the game will automatically select a default name for them. Default names are based on the real-life figures of the Salem witch trials. After that, the game will designate each player a role according to an algorithm.<ref name=\"game skinny\" /> \n\nIn the vanilla game, there are three alignments: Town, Mafia and Neutral.<ref name=\"the gamer 2019\" /> Town and Mafia are two teams with their own win conditions. The win condition for Town is to \"lynch every criminal and evildoer.\" For Mafia it's to \"kill anyone that will not submit to the Mafia.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Roles |url=https://www.blankmediagames.com/roles/ |website=BlankMediaGames |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> Town players are uninformed, meaning they do not know the roles of other players. Mafia players are informed, meaning they know who other Mafia players are, but they do not know the roles of non-Mafia players. Using their role abilities and deduction, players discover the roles of other players to facilitate their victory. Town and Mafia can only win the game if the opposing team(s) perishes entirely.\n\nNeutrals have individual win conditions that must be achieved on their own. When a Neutral player dies without completing their win condition, they can no longer win the game even if another Neutral player completes their win condition. Some Neutral roles may survive and win with either Town or Mafia, as long as their win condition is completed. Neutral Killing roles, specifically, can only win when Town and Mafia are eliminated.\n\nA match goes through three main phases according to the time of day. Roles with nighttime abilities are active during the night. All murders are committed during the night; mafia can speak among themselves. When daytime arrives, the town will discover the bodies of townspeople who died the night before, their cause of death, their role, their [[Will and testament|will]], and a death note. (It is also possible that nobody dies during the night.) Other actions that did not cause death (e.g. a Medium speaking with the dead, a Blackmailer silencing another player, a Doctor healing another player) are not announced by the game, but may be discussed by the players. One unique exception is the Retributionist who resurrects a dead Town player from the graveyard during the night and, if they are not blocked or controlled, the target comes back alive the following day. The game does not announce who resurrected them. Another exception is the Amnesiac who can \"remember\" or assume the role of a dead player during the night. Like the Retributionist, the game will not announce who the Amnesiac is.\n\nDuring the day, all townspeople gather to meet in a circle, facing a [[Death_by_hanging|lynching stake]] at the center. Players enter a discussion phase via text communication in a chatbox. Players typically inform each other of what happened to them or other players during the night before, if they can. Since the game begins with a Town majority, the discussion will revolve around lynching potentially evil players. Though the central goal may ostensibly be eliminating the evil players, Mafia will attempt to deceive Town into lynching innocents (i.e. other Town players) and saving themselves. Neutrals typically deceive everyone since they are aligned to neither Town nor Mafia, though some may win with either team. \n\nKeeping a will is a prevalent [[Metagaming|metagame]] behavior, especially for Town players since they do not know each other's roles. The will does not bequeath anything despite its name. It is used as a form of [[testimony]] to prove a player's claims, typically a claim of their role. Players write information about what they know or did in their will, so that once they die or when asked to disclose information, other Town players can piece together information to identify the \"good\" and \"evil\" townspeople. The will is automatically revealed after the player dies. Evil players usually keep fraudulent wills to deceive Town players into believing they're good. \n\nIn Classic and Ranked modes, where the roles are assigned for competitive purposes, role claiming is an important metagame strategy for Town players to [[Process of elimination|eliminate possibilities]]. A list of available roles or role categories (e.g. Town Protective, Random Mafia, Neutral Killing) is included in every game, so by process of elimination Town players can figure out the roles of each player. This is not useful in Any mode, however, because in that mode the roles are randomized, not categorized, and simply named \"Any\" on the role list.\n\nAfter the discussion phase, townspeople can vote for a player to be placed on trial. They can vote for anyone but themselves. The vote to try must be a majority. Once a player is put on the stake, they have a moment to defend themselves, in which only they can speak. Then comes judgement phase in which the townspeople must decide to vote Guilty, Innocent or Abstain on lynching the player on trial. The vote to lynch must pass majority. Abstain votes are not counted. A tie will be considered an Innocent judgement. When a Guilty judgement passes, the player on trial will be lynched and the day immediately finishes, commencing the start of nighttime. This voting process may repeat as long as time allows, to a maximum of three trials per day. The day-and-night process repeats until one alignment survives and accomplishes their win condition, or if a Neutral Killing player eliminates all Town and Mafia players.\n\nThe expansion pack ''The Coven'' introduced a new alignment, the Coven, which has a team win condition like that of Town and Mafia. It also added three exclusive game modes: Rivals, Lovers and VIP. There are Coven equivalents to vanilla game modes, except Rainbow, Dracula's Palace and Rapid.\n\n== Development ==\nBlankMediaGames LLC was founded by Josh Brittain and Blake Burns on February 1, 2014 with a working staff of two programmers, two artists and one sound designer. Their mission was to bring a ''Werewolf'' and ''Mafia'' based online video game to the market. A [[Kickstarter]] campaign began on February 14, 2014 to develop ''Town of Salem''. After thirty days, the fundraiser raised $17,190 surpassing its $15,000 goal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mafia-style-browser-game|title=Town of Salem - Mafia-style Browser Game|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nAs development progressed with more donations, more features and mechanics were added. On September 13, 2014, the developers started a fundraiser for a Steam release, which would be its official release after alpha and beta versions. The fundraiser finished in 35 days, acquiring $114,197 from 7,506 backers. It surpassed its goal of $30,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mobile-steam-localization|title=Town of Salem - Mobile, Steam, Localization|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> The Steam version was released on December 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mobile-steam-localization/posts/1084755|title=Update 29: v1.0.0 release and Town of Salem comes to Steam! \u00b7 Town of Salem - Mobile, Steam, Localization|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Ports ===\nOn March 31, 2016, another Kickstarter fundraiser began after the release of a [[mobile game|mobile]] beta version of the game.

It raised $389,005 from 9,551 backers in 30 days, and had a pledged goal of $10,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-the-card-game|title=Town of Salem - The Card Game|website=Kickstarter}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blastawaythegamereview.com/2016/04/29/blankmediagames-turns-pc-game-town-of-salem-into-a-card-game/|title=BlankMediaGames Turns PC Game Town of Salem into a Card Game|first=Dustin|last=Murphy|date=April 30, 2016|website=Blast Away the Game Review}}</ref> Unlike the video game in which the computer moderates and generates roles for each player, the card game requires a Moderator role, whose function is that of the video game's computer, like switching the day-night cycles and assigning each player a role.

The expansion added one new faction, the Coven, and fifteen new roles. The original Witch role is now the Coven Leader. Other Coven roles include the Hex Master, Poisoner, Potion Master, Medusa and Necromancer. Town received four new roles: Crusader, Tracker, Trapper, and Psychic. Mafia received two new roles: Ambusher and Hypnotist. And Neutral received three new roles: Guardian Angel, Pirate, and Plaguebearer. Three new game modes were added: Coven VIP, Lover, and Rivals. Unlike the vanilla game, the expansion pack is not free-to-play. For players who paid for the Steam version of the game, the pack is half price. It was released through the Steam store on June 6.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nerdbacon.com/town-salem-coven-expansion-announced/|title=Town of Salem \"The Coven\" Expansion Announced|date=2017-05-20|website=Nerd Bacon Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blankmediagames.com/town-of-salem-the-coven-announcement/|title=Town of Salem: The Coven Announcement {{!}} BlankMediaGames|website=www.blankmediagames.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Data breach ===\nA [[data breach]] that affected over 7.6 million players of ''Town of Salem'' was disclosed in an email to security firm DeHashed on December 28, 2018.

A list of available roles or role categories (e.g. Town Protective, Random Mafia, Neutral Killing) is included in every game, so by process of elimination Town players can figure out the roles of each player. This is not useful in Any mode, however, because in that mode the roles are randomized, not categorized, and simply named \"Any\" on the role list.\n\nAfter the discussion phase, townspeople can vote for a player to be placed on trial. They can vote for anyone but themselves. The vote to try must be a majority. Once a player is put on the stake, they have a moment to defend themselves, in which only they can speak. Then comes judgement phase in which the townspeople must decide to vote Guilty, Innocent or Abstain on lynching the player on trial. The vote to lynch must pass majority. Abstain votes are not counted. A tie will be considered an Innocent judgement. When a Guilty judgement passes, the player on trial will be lynched and the day immediately finishes, commencing the start of nighttime. This voting process may repeat as long as time allows, to a maximum of three trials per day. The day-and-night process repeats until one alignment survives and accomplishes their win condition, or if a Neutral Killing player eliminates all Town and Mafia players.\n\nThe expansion pack ''The Coven'' introduced a new alignment, the Coven, which has a team win condition like that of Town and Mafia. It also added three exclusive game modes: Rivals, Lovers and VIP. There are Coven equivalents to vanilla game modes, except Rainbow, Dracula's Palace and Rapid.\n\n== Development ==\nBlankMediaGames LLC was founded by Josh Brittain and Blake Burns on February 1, 2014 with a working staff of two programmers, two artists and one sound designer. Their mission was to bring a ''Werewolf'' and ''Mafia'' based online video game to the market. A [[Kickstarter]] campaign began on February 14, 2014 to develop ''Town of Salem''. After thirty days, the fundraiser raised $17,190 surpassing its $15,000 goal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mafia-style-browser-game|title=Town of Salem - Mafia-style Browser Game|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nAs development progressed with more donations, more features and mechanics were added. On September 13, 2014, the developers started a fundraiser for a Steam release, which would be its official release after alpha and beta versions. The fundraiser finished in 35 days, acquiring $114,197 from 7,506 backers.

Other Coven roles include the Hex Master, Poisoner, Potion Master, Medusa and Necromancer. Town received four new roles: Crusader, Tracker, Trapper, and Psychic. Mafia received two new roles: Ambusher and Hypnotist. And Neutral received three new roles: Guardian Angel, Pirate, and Plaguebearer. Three new game modes were added: Coven VIP, Lover, and Rivals. Unlike the vanilla game, the expansion pack is not free-to-play. For players who paid for the Steam version of the game, the pack is half price. It was released through the Steam store on June 6.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nerdbacon.com/town-salem-coven-expansion-announced/|title=Town of Salem \"The Coven\" Expansion Announced|date=2017-05-20|website=Nerd Bacon Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blankmediagames.com/town-of-salem-the-coven-announcement/|title=Town of Salem: The Coven Announcement {{!}} BlankMediaGames|website=www.blankmediagames.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Data breach ===\nA [[data breach]] that affected over 7.6 million players of ''Town of Salem'' was disclosed in an email to security firm DeHashed on December 28, 2018.

From its founding as a [[Diocese|bishopric]] in 1000 until 1821, it was under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]]. From 1821 to 1930 it was subjected directly to the [[Apostolic See]]. Between 1821 and 1972 it was officially known as '''(Arch)Diocese of Breslau'''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early medieval era===\nChristianity was first introduced into [[Silesia]] by missionaries from [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]]. After the conversion of Duke [[Mieszko I]] of Poland and the conquest of Silesia, the work of bringing the people to the new faith went on more rapidly. Up to about the year 1000 Silesia had no bishop of its own, but was united with neighbouring dioceses. In this way, the connection of Silesia with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] continued. The upper part of the [[Oder River]] formed the boundary of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131138)|Kingdom of Poland]]. All the territory which is now Silesia \u2013 lying on the right-hand bank of the Oder \u2013 belonged, therefore, to the [[Diocese of Pozna\u0144]], which was [[suffragan]] to the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]]. This part of Silesia was thus under the jurisdiction of a priest named Jordan who was appointed first Bishop of Pozna\u0144 in 968. The part of Silesia lying on the left bank of the Oder belonged to the territory included in then [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and was consequently within the diocesan jurisdiction of [[Prague]]. The [[Bishopric of Prague]], founded in 973, was suffragan to the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]].\n\nDuke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], the son of Mieszko, obtained the Bohemian part of Silesia during his wars of conquest, and a change in the ecclesiastical dependence of the province followed. By a patent of Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] in 995, Silesia was attached to the [[Bishopric of Meissen]], which, like Pozna\u0144, was suffragan to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. Soon after, Boles\u0142aw, who had pledged allegiance to the empero Otto who ruled all of Silesia, founded the Diocese of Wroc\u0142aw, which, together with the Bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Bishopric of Ko\u0142obrzeg|Ko\u0142obrzeg]], was placed under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]], founded by Otto in 1000 during the [[Congress of Gniezno]]. The first Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw is said to have been named [[Jan (bishop of Wroc\u0142aw)|Johannes]], but nothing more than this is known of him, nor is there extant any official document giving the boundaries of the diocese at the time of its erection. However, they are defined in the Bulls of approval and protection issued by [[Pope Adrian IV]], 23 April 1155, and by [[Pope Innocent IV]], 9 August 1245.\n\nThe powerful Polish ruler Boles\u0142aw I was succeeded by his son [[Mieszko II Lambert]], who had but a short reign. After his death a revolt against Christianity and the reigning family broke out, the new Church organization of Poland disappeared from view, and the names of the Bishops of Wroc\u0142aw for the next half century are unknown. [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]], the son of Mieszko, and his mother were driven out of the country, but through German aid they returned and the affairs of the Church were brought into better order. A Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw from probably 1051 to 1062 was Hieronymus, said by later tradition to have been a [[Rome|Roman]] nobleman. He was followed by Johannes I (1062\u201372), who was succeeded by Petrus I (1071\u20131111). During the episcopate of Petrus, Count Peter Wlast entered upon the work of founding churches and monasteries which has preserved his name. Petrus was followed by: \u017byros\u0142aw I (1112\u201320); Heimo (1120\u201326), who welcomed [[Otto of Bamberg]] to Wroc\u0142aw in May 1124 when the saint was on his missionary journey to Pomerania; Robert I (1127\u201342), who was [[List of Roman Catholic bishops of Krak\u00f3w|Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]]; Robert II (1142\u201346); and Johannes II (1146\u201349), who became Archbishop of Gniezno.\n\n===Silesian duchies (Poland's fragmentation)===\nWith the episcopate of Bishop Walter (1149\u201369) the history of the diocese of Wroc\u0142aw begins to grow clearer. [[Pope Adrian IV]], at Walter's request in 1155, took the bishopric under his protection and confirmed to it the territorial possessions of which a list had been submitted to him. Among the rights which the Pope then confirmed was that of jurisdiction over the lands belonging to the castle of [[Otmuch\u00f3w]] (Ottmachau) which had been regarded as the patrimony of the diocese from its foundation. In 1163 the sons of the exiled Polish duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] returned from the Empire and, through the intervention of Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], received as an independent duchy the part of Silesia which was included at that date in the see of Wroc\u0142aw. Bishop Walter built a new, massively constructed cathedral, in which he was buried. \u017byros\u0142aw II (1170\u201398) encouraged the founding of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery of [[Lebus]] by Duke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Tall]]. In 1180 \u017byros\u0142aw took part in the national assembly at [[\u0141\u0119czyca]] at which laws for the protection of the Church and its property were promulgated. Jaros\u0142aw (1198\u20131201), the oldest son of Duke Boles\u0142aw, and Duke of [[Opole|Oppeln]], was the first prince to become Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw (see [[prince-bishop]]).\n\nCyprian (1201\u20137) was originally Abbot of the [[Premonstratensian]] monastery of St. Vincent near Wroc\u0142aw, then [[Bishop of Lebus]], and afterwards Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw. During Cyprian's episcopate Duke Heinrich I and his wife, [[Hedwig of Andechs|St. Hedwig]], founded the [[Cistercian convent at Trebnitz]]. The episcopate of Bishop Lorenz (1207\u201332) was marked by his efforts to bring colonies of Germans into the church territories, to effect the cultivation of waste lands. This introduction of German settlers by the bishop was in accordance with the example set by Heinrich I and St. Hedwig. The monasteries of the [[Augustinian Canons]], [[Premonstratensians]] and [[Cistercian]]s took an active part in carrying out the schemes of the rulers by placing great numbers of Germans, especially [[Thuringians]] and [[Franconia]]ns, on the large estates that had been granted them.\nOne of the most noted bishops of the diocese, Thomas I (1232\u201368), continued the work of German colonization with so much energy that even the marauding incursions of the [[Mongols]] (1241) made but a temporary break in the process. As German colonization in Silesia increased the city of Wroc\u0142aw began to be known by the German name of Breslau, leading to the diocese also becoming called the Bishopric of Breslau. Thomas's defence of the rights of the Church involved him in bitter conflicts with Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]]. Thomas began the construction of the present cathedral, the chancel being the first part erected. St. Hedwig died during his episcopate; and he lived until the process of her canonization was completed, but died before the final solemnity of her elevation to the altars of the Catholic Church. After Thomas I, Ladislaus, a grandson of Saint Hedwig, and [[Archbishop of Salzburg]], was Administrator of the Diocese of Breslau until his death in 1270.\n\nHe was followed by Thomas II (1270\u201392), who was involved for years in a violent dispute with Duke [[Henryk IV Probus|Henry IV]] as to the prerogatives of the Church in Silesia. In 1287 a reconciliation was effected between them at [[Regensburg]], and in 1288 the duke founded the collegiate church of the Holy Cross at Breslau. Before his death, on the Eve of St. John in 1290, the duke confirmed the rights of the Church to sovereignty over the territories of [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]] and Ottmachau. Thomas II consecrated the high altar of the cathedral; he was present at the [[First Council of Lyon]] (1274) and in 1279 held a diocesan synod. Johann III Romka (1292\u20131301), belonged to the Polish party in the [[cathedral chapter]]. His maintenance of the prerogatives of the Church brought him, also, into conflict with the temporal rulers of Silesia; in 1296 he called a synod for the defence of these rights.\n\nIn the election of Heinrich I of W\u00fcrben (1302\u201319), the German party in the cathedral chapter won, but this victory cost the new bishop the enmity of the opposing faction. He was made guardian of the youthful Dukes of Breslau, and this appointment, together with the factional disputes, led to the bringing of grave accusations against him. The researches of more recent times have proved the groundlessness of these attacks. He was kept in [[Avignon]] a number of years by a suit before the [[Curia]] which was finally settled in his favour. Notwithstanding the troubles of his life he was energetic in the performance of his duties. He carried on the construction of the cathedral, and in 1305 and 1316 held diocesan synods. The office of [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of Breslau dates from his episcopate. After his death a divided vote led to a vacancy of the see. The two candidates, Weit and Lutold, elected by the opposing factions, finally resigned, and [[Pope John XXII]] transferred Nanker of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to Breslau (1326\u201341).\n\n===Within Bohemia===\n\nThe constant division and subdivision of Silesian territory into small principalities for the members of the ruling families resulted in a condition of weakness that necessitated dependence on a stronger neighbour, and Silesia thus came under the control of Bohemia (first between 1289\u20131306; definitely from 1327 onwards), which itself was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. A quarrel broke out between Bishop Nanker and the suzerain of Silesia, King [[John I of Bohemia]], when the king seized the castle of [[Milicz|Militsch]] which belonged to the cathedral chapter. The bishop excommunicated the king and those members of the Council of Breslau who sided with him. On account of this he was obliged to flee from Breslau and take refuge in [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], where he died.\n\n[[File:Preczlaus de Pogrella.png|thumb|120px|right|Przec\u0142aw of Pogarell, 20th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nPrzec\u0142aw of Pogarell (1341\u20131376) was elected bishop while pursuing his studies at [[Bologna]], and was consecrated bishop at [[Avignon]]. Through his friendship with Charles, the son of King John, he was soon able to settle the discord that had arisen under his predecessor. The diocese prospered greatly under his rule. He bought the Duchy of [[Grodk\u00f3w]] (Grottkau) from Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Brzeg|Brieg]] and added it to the episcopal territory of Neisse. The Bishops of Breslau had, therefore, after this the titles of ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince) of Neisse and Duke of Grottkau, and took precedence over the other Silesian rulers who held principalities in fief.\n\nEmperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] wished to separate Breslau from the [[Archdiocese of Gniezno]] and to make it a suffragan of the newly erected [[Archbishopric of Prague]] (1344) but the plan failed, owing to the opposition of the Archbishop of Gniezno. Przec\u0142aw added to the cathedral the beautiful Lady Chapel, in which he was buried and where his tomb still exists. Dietrich, dean of the cathedral, who was elected as successor to Przec\u0142aw, could not obtain the papal confirmation, and the [[Bishop of Olomouc]] (Olm\u00fctz), who was chosen in his place, soon died. After a long contest with Charles, Bishop Wenzel of Lebus, Duke of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]], was transferred to Breslau (1382\u20131417). The new bishop devoted himself to repairing the damage<!-- ??? What damage exactly? It should be more specificated. --> inflicted on the Church in Silesia by the actions of Charles. He held two synods, in 1410 and 1415, with the object of securing a higher standard of ecclesiastical discipline; and he settled the right of inheritance in the territory under his dominion by promulgating the church decree called \"Wenzel's law\". Resigning his bishopric in 1417, Wenzel died in 1419.\n\nThe episcopate of Conrad, Duke of [[Ole\u015bnica]] (Oels), the next bishop (1417\u201347), was a trying time for Silesia during the [[Hussite wars]]. Conrad was placed at the head of the Silesian confederation formed to defend the country against hostile incursions. In 1435 the bishop issued a decree of which the chief intent was to close the prebends in the diocese of Breslau to foreigners, and thus prevent the Poles from obtaining these offices. The effort to shut out the Polish element and to loosen the connection with [[Gniezno]] was not a momentary one; it continued, and led gradually to a virtual separation from the Polish archdiocese some time before the formal separation took place. The troubles of the times brought the bishop and the diocese into serious pecuniary difficulties, and in 1444 Conrad resigned, but his resignation was not accepted and he resumed his office. In 1446 he held a diocesan synod and died in the following year.\n[[File:Biskup Piotr Nowak.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Peter Nowak, 23rd Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nConrad's successor was the provest of the cathedral of Breslau, Peter II Nowak (1447\u201356). By wise economy Bishop Peter succeeded in bringing the diocesan finances into a better condition and in redeeming the greater part of the church lands which his predecessor had been obliged to mortgage. At the diocesan synod of 1454 he endeavoured to suppress the abuses that had arisen in the diocese.\n\n[[File:Jodok z Ro\u017cemberku.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Jo\u0161t of Ro\u017emberk, 24th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nJodokus (Jo\u0161t) of Rosenberg (1456\u201367) was a [[Bohemian]] nobleman and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Knights of St. John]]. His love of peace made his position a very difficult one during the fierce ecclesiastic-political contention that raged between the [[Hussite]] King of Bohemia, [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], and the people of Breslau, who had taken sides with the German party. Jodokus was followed by a bishop from the region of the [[Rhine]], Rudolf von R\u00fcdesheim (1468\u201382). As [[papal legate]], Rudolf had become popular in Breslau through his energetic opposition to George of Podebrady; for this reason the cathedral chapter requested his transfer from the small [[Diocese of Lavant]] in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], after he had confirmed their privileges. From this time these privileges were called \"the Rudolfian statutes\". Under his leadership the party opposed to Podebrady obtained the victory, and Rudolf proceeded at once to repair the damage which had been occasioned to the Church during this strife; mortgaged church lands were redeemed; in 1473 and 1475 diocesan synods were held, at which the bishop took active measures in regard to church discipline.\n[[File:JanRoth.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Johann IV. Roth, 26th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nAs coadjutor, he had selected a [[Swabians|Swabian]], Johann IV Roth, [[Bishop of Lavant]], a man of humanistic training. Urged by King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of [[Hungary]], to whom Silesia was then subject, the cathedral chapter, somewhat unwillingly, chose the coadjutor as bishop (1482\u20131506). His episcopate was marked by violent quarrels with the cathedral chapter. But at the same time he was a promoter of art and learning, and strict in his conception of church rights and duties. He endeavoured to improve the spiritual life of the diocese by holding a number of synods. Before he died the famous worker in bronze, [[Peter Vischer of Nuremberg]], cast his monument, the most beautiful bishop's tomb in Silesia. His coadjutor with right of succession was Johann V (1506\u201320), a member of the noble [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] family of [[Thurzo]]. Johann V took an active part in the intellectual life of the time and sought at the diocesan synods to promote learning and church discipline, and to improve the schools. On the ruins of the old stronghold of [[Jauernig]] he built the castle called [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|Johannisberg]], later the summer residence of the Prince-Bishop of Breslau.\n\nThe religious disturbances of the 16th century began to be conspicuously apparent during this episcopate, and soon after Johann's death Protestantism began to spread in Silesia, which belonged to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] since 1526. Princes, nobles, and town councils were zealous promoters of the new belief; even in the episcopal principality of [[Neisse-Grottkau]] Protestant doctrines found approval and acceptance. The successors of Johann V were partly responsible for this condition of affairs. Jacob von Salza (1520\u201339) was personally a stanch adherent of the Church; yet the gentleness of his disposition caused him to shrink from carrying on a war against the powerful religious movement that had arisen. To an even greater degree than Jacob von Salza his successor, Balthasar von Promnitz (1539\u201363), avoided coming into conflict with Protestantism. He was more friendly in his attitude to the new doctrine than any other Bishop of Breslau. Casper von Logau (1562\u201374) showed at first greater energy than his predecessor in endeavouring to compose the troubles of his distracted diocese, but later in his episcopate his attitude towards Lutheranism and his slackness in defending church rights gave great offence to those who had remained true to the Faith. These circumstances make the advance of Protestantism easy to understand. At the same time it must be remembered that the bishops, although also secular rulers, had a difficult position in regard to spiritual matters. At the assemblies of the nobles and at the meetings of the diet, the bishops and the deputies of the cathedral chapter were, as a rule, the only Catholics against a large and powerful majority on the side of Protestantism. The [[Habsburg]] suzerains, who lived far from Silesia (in Vienna or Prague), and who were constantly preoccupied by the danger of a [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Turkish invasion]], were not in a position to enforce the edicts which they issued for the protection of the Church.\n\nThe Silesian clergy had in great measure lost their high concept of the priestly office, although there were honourable exceptions. Among those faithful were the majority of the canons of the cathedral of Breslau; they distinguished themselves not only by their learning, but also by their religious zeal. It was in the main due to them that the diocese did not fall into spiritual ruin. The chapter was the willing assistant of the bishops in the reform of the diocese. Martin von Gerstmann (1574\u201385) began the renovation of the diocese, and the special means by which he hoped to attain the desired end were: the founding of a seminary for clerics, visitations of the diocese, diocesan synods, and the introduction of the Jesuits.\n\nHis successor, Andreas von Jerin (1585\u201396), a Swabian who had educated at the German College at Rome, followed in his footsteps. At the diocesan synod of 1592 he endeavoured to improve church discipline. Besides his zeal in elevating the life of the Church, he was also a promoter of the arts and learning. The silver altar with which he adorned his cathedral still exists, and he brought the schools in the principality of Neisse into a flourishing condition. The bishop also rendered important services to the emperor, as [[papal legate|legate]] at various times.\n\nBonaventura Hahn, elected in 1596 as the successor of Andreas von Jerin, was not recognized by the emperor and was obliged to resign his position. The candidate of the emperor, Paul Albert (1599\u20131600), occupied the see only one year. Johann VI (1600\u20138), a member of a noble family of Silesia named von Sitsch, took more severe measures than his predecessors against Protestantism, in the hope of checking it, especially in the episcopal principality of Neisse-Grottkau.\n\nBishop Charles (1608\u201324), an Archduke of Austria, had greater success than his predecessor after the first period of the [[Thirty Years' War]] had taken a turn favourable to Austria and the Catholic party. Charles wanted to move under protection of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], hoping to avoid participation in the war which was ravaging the Holy Roman Empire. As Charles's bishopric was nominally subordinated to the Polish Archbishopric of Gniezno, he asked the Archbishop of Gniezno for mediation in talks with King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] of Poland about protection and subordination of his bishopric. In May 1619, Prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw (the future King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]]), invited by his uncle Charles, left [[Warsaw]] and started a trip to Silesia. During talks with W\u0142adys\u0142aw in mid-1619, the Habsburgs promised to agree to a temporary occupation of part of Silesia by Polish forces, which the unsuccessfully Vasas hoped would later allow the incorporation of those areas into Poland.\n\nIn July 1619 Czech Protestants rebelled against King [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] and offered the Bohemian crown to [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]. On 27 September 1619, probably on hearing the news, W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Charles left Silesia in a hurry and on 7 October 1619 arrived in Warsaw. In December 1619, young W\u0142adys\u0142aw's brother, Prince [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Opole]], was chosen by Charles as auxiliary bishop of Wroc\u0142aw, which was confirmed by the Polish episcopate. The [[Battle of the White Mountain]] (1620) broke the revolt in Bohemian Crown (i.e. including the opposition of the Protestants of Silesia). The Bishopric of Breslau returned to the rule of the Archbishopric of Gniezno in 1620, having before been practically independent. Bishop Charles began the restoration of the principality of Neisse to the Catholic faith. The work was completed by his successor, Charles Ferdinand, Prince of Poland (1625\u201355), who spent most of his time in his own country, but appointed excellent administrators for the diocese, such as the Coadjutor-Bishop Liesch von Hornau, and Archdeacon Gebauer. Imperial commissioners gave back to the Catholic Church those church buildings in the chief places of the principalities which had become the property of the sovereign through the extinction of vassal families. Until 1632 ''de facto'' rule was held in Warsaw by King Sigismund III and not by the bishop or archbishop.\n\nAccording to the terms of the 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]], the remaining churches, 693 in number, of such territories were secularized in the years 1653, 1654, and 1668. This led to a complete reorganization of the diocese. The person who effected it was Sebastian of Rostock, a man of humble birth who was [[vicar-general]] and administrator of the diocese under the bishops Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (1656\u201362) and Archduke Charles Joseph (1663\u201364), neither of whom lived in the territory of Breslau. After Sebastian of Rostock became bishop (1664\u201371) he carried on the work of reorganization with still greater success than before.\n\n[[File:Friedrich-Kardinal.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Friedrich of Hesse-Darmstadt, 41st Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\n[[Friedrich von Hessen-Darmstadt]], Cardinal and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of St. John]], was the next Bishop of Breslau (1671\u201382). The new bishop was of Protestant origin but had become a Catholic at Rome. Under his administration the rehabilitation of the diocese went on. He beautified the cathedral and elaborated its services. For the red cap and violet almutium of the canons he substituted the red [[mozzetta]]. He was buried in a beautiful chapel which he had added to the cathedral in honour of his ancestress, St. Elizabeth of Thuringia.\n\nAfter his death the chapter presented Carl von Liechtenstein, Bishop of Olomouc, for confirmation. Their choice was opposed by the emperor, whose candidate was the [[Count Palatine]] Wolfgang of the ruling family of [[Pfalz-Neuburg]]. Count Wolfgang died, and his brother Franz Ludwig (1683\u20131732) was made bishop. The new ruler of the diocese was at the same time [[Bishop of Worms]], Grand Master of the [[German Knights]], Provost of [[Ellwangen]] and [[Elector of Trier]], and later was made [[Elector of Mainz]]. He separated the ecclesiastical administration and that of the civil tribunals, and obtained the definition, in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1699, of the extent of the jurisdiction of the vicariate-general and the consistory. In 1675, upon the death of the last reigning duke, the Silesian Duchy of [[Liegnitz-Brieg-Wohlau]] lapsed to the emperor, and a new secularization of the churches begun. But when King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] secured for the Protestants the right to their former possessions in these territories, by the Treaty of [[Altranst\u00e4dt]], in 1707, the secularization came to an end, and the churches had to be returned. The Habsburg Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] endeavoured to repair the loss of these buildings to the Catholic faith by founding the so-called Josephine vicarships.\n\n===Within Prussia (main part) and Bohemia (lesser part)===\n[[File:Schaffgotsch portrait.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Prince-Bishop [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]], 45th bishop on the see.]] The next prince-bishop, [[Philipp Ludwig von Sinzendorf|Philip, Count von Sinzendorf]], Cardinal and [[Bishop of Raab]] (1732\u20131747), owed his elevation to the favour of the emperor. During his episcopate, the greater part of the diocese was added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the [[Silesian Wars]]. King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] (Frederick the Great) desired to erect a \"Catholic Vicariate\" at Berlin, to be the highest spiritual authority for the Catholics of Prussia. This would have been in reality a separation from Rome, and the project failed through the opposition of the Holy See. Bishop Sinzendorf had neither the acuteness to perceive the inimical intent of the king's scheme, nor sufficient decision of character to withstand it. The king desired to secure a successor to Sinzendorf who would be under royal influence. In utter disregard of the principles of the Church, and heedless of the protests of the cathedral chapter, he presented Count [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]] as coadjutor-bishop.\n\nAfter the death of Cardinal Sinzendorf the king succeeded in the placement of Schaffgotsch as Bishop of Breslau (1748\u201395). Although the method of his elevation caused the new bishop to be regarded with suspicion by many strict Catholics, he was zealous in the fulfilment of his duties. During the [[Seven Years' War]] he fell into discredit with Frederick on account of his firm maintenance of the rights of the Church, and the return of peace did not fully restore him to favour. In 1766 he fled to the [[Austrian Silesia|Austrian]] part of his diocese in order to avoid confinement in [[Opole|Oppeln]] which the king had decreed against him. After this Frederick made it impossible for him to rule the Prussian part of his diocese, and until the death of the bishop this territory was ruled by [[vicars Apostolic]].\n\nThe former coadjutor of von Schaffgotsch, Joseph Christian, Prince von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein (1795\u20131817), succeeded him as bishop. During his episcopate the temporal power of the Bishops of Breslau came to an end through the secularization, in 1810, of the church estates in Prussian Silesia \u2013 only the estates in [[Austrian Silesia]] remained to the see. The cathedral foundation, eight collegiate foundations, and over eighty monasteries were suppressed, and their property confiscated. Only those monastic institutions which were occupied with teaching or nursing were allowed to exist.\n\nBishop Joseph Christian was succeeded by his coadjutor, Emmanuel von Schimonsky. The affairs of the Catholic Church in Prussia had been brought into order by the Bull \"De salute animarum\", issued in 1821. Under its provisions the cathedral chapter elected Schimonsky, who had been administrator of the diocese, as Prince-Bishop of Breslau (1824\u20131832).\n\nThe bull disentangled Breslau diocese from Gniezno ecclesiastical province and made Breslau an [[Exemption (church)|exempt]] bishopric. The bull also reconfined the Breslau diocesan area which from then on remained unchanged until 1922. Breslau diocese then included the bulk of the Catholic parishes in the Prussian [[Province of Silesia]] with the exception of Catholic parishes in the districts of [[Racib\u00f3rz|Ratibor]] and [[Leobsch\u00fctz]], which until 1972 belonged to the [[Archdiocese of Olomouc]], and Catholic parishes in the Prusso-Silesian [[County of Klodzko|County of Glatz]], which were subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] within the [[Archdiocese of Prague]] until 1972. The Breslau Diocese included the Catholic parishes in the [[Duchy of Teschen]] and the Austrian part of the [[Principality of Neisse]]. The bull also assigned the Prussian-annexed parts of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Mei\u00dfen#Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen|Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen]] in [[Lower Lusatia]] (politically part of Prussian [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] since 1815<ref>This included \u2013 among others \u2013 [[Cottbus]], [[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie|Crossen]], [[Guben]], [[Neuzelle]], [[Schwiebus]] and [[Z\u00fcllichau]] etc.</ref>) and eastern [[Upper Lusatia]] (to Silesia province as of 1815) to Breslau diocese.\n\nWith the exception of the districts of [[Byt\u00f3w|B\u00fctow]] and [[L\u0119bork|Lauenburg (Pommern)]], until 1922 both part of the [[Bishopric of Culm (Che\u0142mno)|Diocese of Culm]], the rest of Brandenburg and [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania province]] were, since 1821, supervised by the [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]] ({{lang-de|link=no|F\u00fcrstbisch\u00f6fliche Delegatur f\u00fcr Brandenburg und Pommern}}, {{lang-pl|Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119co-biskupia Delegatura Brandenburgii i Pomorza}}).\n\nSchimonsky retained for himself and his successors the title of prince-bishop, although the episcopal rule in the Principality of Neisse had ended by its secularization. However, the rank of prince-bishop later included the [[ex officio member]]ship in the [[Prussian House of Lords]] (since 1854) and in the [[Reichsrat (Austria)#House of Lords|Austrian House of Lords]] (since 1861).\n\nSchimonsky combatted the rationalistic tendencies which were rife among his clergy in regard to celibacy and the use of Latin in the church services and ceremonies. During the episcopate of his predecessor the government had promulgated a law which was a source of much trouble to Schimonsky and his immediate successors; this was that in those places where Catholics were few in number, the parish should be declared extinct and the church buildings given to the newly founded [[Evangelical Church in Prussia]]. In spite of the protests of the episcopal authorities, over one hundred church buildings were lost in this way. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] put an end to this injustice, and sought to make good the injuries inflicted.\n\nFor several years after Schimonsky's death the see remained vacant. It was eventually filled by the election, through government influence, of Count [[Leopold von Sedlnitzky]] (1836\u201340). Prince-Bishop von Sedlnitzky was neither clear nor firm in his maintenance of the doctrines of the Church; on the question of [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s, which had become one of great importance, he took an undecided position. At last, upon the demand of [[Pope Gregory XVI]], he resigned his see in 1840. He went afterwards to Berlin, where he was made a privy-councillor, and where he became a Protestant in 1862. In 1871 he died in Berlin and was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Rankau (today's R\u0119k\u00f3w, a part of [[Sob\u00f3tka]]).\n\n[[File:Knauer.jpg|thumb|120px|Prince-Bishop Joseph Knauer, 49th bishop of the see|alt=]] The dean of the cathedral, Dr. Ritter, administered the diocese for several years until the election of Joseph Knauer (1843\u201344), earlier [[Grand Dean]] of the Silesian County of Glatz within the Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. The new prince-bishop, who was 79&nbsp;years old, lived only a year after his appointment.\n\nHis successor was Melchior, Freiherr von Diepenbrock (1845\u201353). This episcopate was the beginning of a new religious and ecclesiastical life in the diocese. During the revolutionary period the prince-bishop not only maintained order in his see, which was in a state of ferment, but was also a supporter of the government. He received unusual honours from the king and was made a cardinal by the Pope. He died 20 January 1853, at the [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] and was buried in the Breslau cathedral.\n\nHis successor, [[Heinrich F\u00f6rster]] (1853\u201381), carried on his work and completed it. Prince-Bishop F\u00f6rster gave generous aid to the founding of churches, monastic institutions, and schools. The strife that arose between the Church and the State brought his labours in the Prussian part of his diocese to an end. He was deposed by the State and was obliged to leave Breslau and retire to the Austrian Silesian castle of Johannisberg where he died, 20 October 1881; he was buried in the cathedral at Breslau.\n\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] appointed as his successor in the disordered diocese Robert Herzog (1882\u201386), who had been ''Prince-Episcopal Delegate for Brandenburg and Pomerania'' and provost of [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral|St. Hedwig's]] in Berlin. Prince-Bishop Herzog made every endeavour to bring order out of the confusion into which the quarrel with the State during the immediately preceding years had thrown the affairs of the diocese. Unfortunately, his episcopate was but of short duration; he died after a long illness, 26 December 1886.\n\nThe Holy See appointed as his successor a man who had done much to allay the strife between Church and State, the [[Bishop of Fulda]], [[Georg von Kopp|Georg Kopp]]. Prince-Bishop Kopp was born in 1837, at [[Duderstadt]] in the [[Diocese of Hildesheim]]; he was ordained to the priesthood (1862); consecrated and installed Bishop of Fulda in 1881; transferred to Breslau and installed 20 October 1887; later created a cardinal (1893).\n\n===Early 20th century===\nAccording to the census of 1 December 1905, the German part of Breslau diocesan area, including the prince-episcopal delegation, comprised 3,342,221 Catholics; 8,737,746 Protestants; and 204,749 Jews. It was the richest German diocese in revenues and [[offertories]]. There were actively employed in the diocese 1,632 secular and 121 regular, priests. The cathedral chapter included the two offices of provost and dean, and had 10 regular, and 6 honorary, canons.\n\nThe prince-bishopric was divided into 11 commissariates and 99 [[archipresbyterate]]s, in which there were 992 cures of various kinds (parishes, curacies, and stations), with 935 parish churches and 633 dependent and mother-churches. Besides the theological faculty of the [[Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t]] in Breslau, the diocese possessed, as episcopal institutions for the training of the clergy, 5 preparatory seminaries for boys, 1 home (recently much enlarged) for theological students attending the university, and 1 [[seminary]] for priests in Breslau.

However, the ecclesiastical affiliation remained unchanged, the Breslau diocese, a cross-border bilateral bishopric since 1742 between \u2013 at last \u2013 Germany and Austro-Hungary, thus turned into a trilateral Czechoslokian-German-Polish bishopric. Since 1770 the prince-bishop had appointed separate [[vicars general]] for the Bohemian (or Austrian, since 1918 partially Czechoslovakian and Polish, resp.) part of the diocese. Also the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Dioceses of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Olomouc|of Olomouc]] comprised cross-border diocesan territories in Czechoslovakian Bohemia and smaller parts in German Silesia (Hradec Kr. diocese: [[Bad Altheide]], [[K\u0142odzko|Glatz]], [[Habelschwerdt]] and [[Neurode]]; Olomouc archdiocese: [[Branice|Branitz]], [[Kietrz|Katscher]], [[Leobsch\u00fctz]] and [[Owsiszcze|Owsch\u00fctz]]). So also the Roman Catholic parishes in Czechoslovakian T\u011b\u0161\u00edn Silesia remained part of Breslau diocese.\n\nFollowing the ''German-Polish Accord on East Silesia'',<ref>[https://archive.is/20120802065927/http://www.bundesarchiv.de/foxpublic/B19017D80A0622120000000060376978/frame.jsp?detail=findmittelinfo.html&oben=findmittelinfo_oben.html Cf. Deutsch-polnisches Abkommen \u00fcber Ostschlesien (Genfer Abkommen)]</ref> signed in Geneva on 15 May 1922, also [[East Upper Silesia|eastern Upper Silesia]] was transferred from [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] to the [[Second Polish Republic]] on 20 June the same year and formed together with the Polish Cieszyn Silesia part of the new Polish [[Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship]]. On 7 November 1922 the Holy See disentangled the Catholic parishes in the new voivodeship from the Breslau diocese and subordinated them to an [[Apostolic Administrator]] on 17 December the same year. On 28 October 1925 [[Pope Pius XI]] elevated that apostolic administration to the new [[diocese of Katowice]] with Bishop [[August Hlond]], then a suffragan of [[Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]], by the papal Bull ''Vixdum Poloniae Unitas''.\n\nAccording to the ''Prussian [[Concordat]]'' of 1929 the prior exempt Bishopric of Breslau was elevated to the rank of archdiocese in 1930 and was henceforth known as the '''Archbishopric of Breslau''', then supervising the ''Eastern German [[ecclesiastical province|Ecclesiastical Province]]'' comprising Breslau proper and three [[suffragan]]s, to wit the new [[diocese of Berlin]], comprising the former [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]], the formerly exempt [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Warmia|Diocese of Ermland (Warmia)]], and the new [[Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl]].\n\n===Within Poland (main part), Czechoslovakia and East Germany (lesser parts)===\nAfter World War II, the city of Breslau was made part of Poland in 1945 and officially renamed Wroc\u0142aw. In 1972 the Archbishopric of Breslau was also renamed to the Archbishopric of Wroc\u0142aw, but still known as Vratislavia in the Latin of Rome. On 21 June 1945 [[Archbishop]] Cardinal [[Adolf Bertram]], while staying in the episcopal [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] in Czechoslovak [[Javorn\u00edk (Jesen\u00edk District)|Javorn\u00edk (Jauernig)]], appointed [[Franti\u0161ek Onderek]] (1888\u20131962) as [[vicar general]] for the Czechoslovak part of the archdiocese. Bertram died on 6 July 1945 in Johannisberg castle in Czechoslovakia, supposedly due to the Polish demands upon him (an ethnic German, who, however, had pleaded for German-Polish reconciliation during the time of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski|Pi\u0142sudski]]'s regime). Expelled, deported, German ex-Silesians from [[West Germany]] have since ca. 1946 entertained claims that Bertram was actually killed or brought near to death by Polish \"imperialists\" inside the Catholic Church of Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nOn 16 July 1945 the archdiocesan [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]], still comprising nine members, elected the Polish-speaking Ferdinand Piontek as [[capitular vicar]], whom the [[Gestapo]] had banned from Breslau in early February 1945. On his return to the town he was sworn in by the chapter on 23 July. On 12 August 1945 Cardinal [[August Hlond]] appeared and demanded Piontek to resign from his office for the archdiocesan territory east of the [[Oder-Nei\u00dfe line]], claiming to act on the authority of papal mandates, however, only applying to the pre-war territory of Poland.\n\nSo Piontek \u2013 not knowing of the restricted mandate \u2013 resigned for the Polish-held parts of the archdiocese, but not for the remaining parts in Czechoslovakia and Allied occupied Germany. Hlond divided the Polish-held archdiocesan area into the three administrative districts of [[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]], [[Opole]], and Wroc\u0142aw proper and appointed a [[diocesan administrator]] for each of them on 15 August, with effect of 1 September. Capitular Vicar Piontek confirmed Onderek on 18 August 1945 as vicar general for the Czechoslovakian part of the archdiocese.<ref name=\"Hartelt 2008 p. 231\">Konrad Hartelt, ''Ferdinand Piontek: (1878\u20131963); Leben und Wirken eines schlesischen Priesters und Bischofs'', Cologne et al.: B\u00f6hlau, 2008, (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 39), p. 231. {{ISBN|978-3-412-20143-2}}</ref> Piontek was asked to help Karol Milik, the new administrator in Wroc\u0142aw, and stayed. He could also take care of the Catholic clergy and laymen of German language, who were in the course of expulsion by the Polish authorities.\n\n[[Pope Pius XII]] did not recognise Hlond's overbearances. In order to strengthen Piontek's position Pius XII granted him the rights of a residing bishop on 28 February 1946. However, on 9 July the Polish authorities expelled Piontek and he was stranded in [[Peine]], then British zone of occupation. On 31 July Pius XII confirmed Onderek's appointment and advanced him to ''Apostolic Administrator of the Czechoslovak part of the Archdiocese of Breslau'' ({{lang-cz|[[:cs:Apo\u0161tolsk\u00e1 administratura \u010deskot\u011b\u0161\u00ednsk\u00e1|Apo\u0161tolsk\u00e1 administratura \u010deskot\u011b\u0161\u00ednsk\u00e1]]}}), seated in [[\u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn]], thus definitely divesting it from Breslau's jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Hartelt 2008 p. 231\"/><ref>''Biographisches Handbuch der Tschechoslowakei'', Heinrich Kuhn and Otto B\u00f6ss (compilators), Munich: Lerche, 1961, (=Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen des Collegium Carolinum), p. 115</ref> The Archdiocese of Breslau remained in existence [[de jure]]; however, de facto this only applied to the archdiocesan territory in the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied Occupation Zones]] in the remainder of German post-war territories. This also included big parts of the [[suffragan]] [[diocese of Berlin]], except for its areas east of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line. However, the territory of the other suffragans and the [[Bishopric of Ermland (1772-1945)|diocese of Ermland/Warmia]] had come under Polish and Soviet rule, respectively, and the Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl had become Polish.\n\nIn 1947 Piontek returned to the archdiocesan territory west of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line (then part of [[Soviet occupation zone]]) and officiated as capitular vicar at the local branch of the archdiocesan [[ordinariate]] in Silesian [[G\u00f6rlitz]], built up since October 1945. Despite the anticlerical Soviet policy he managed to build up a new [[seminary]] in [[Neuzelle]] in 1948, after the old seminary in Poland was inaccessible for candidates from west of the new border. In 1953 Pius XII invested Piontek with the right to bear a [[crosier]] and bestow episcopal [[blessing]]s. On 23 May 1959 Piontek became titular bishop of [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]].\n\nThe Holy See refused to acknowledge Polish Catholic Church claims, however, and only appointed auxiliary bishops to the Archdiocese of [[Krak\u00f3w]] in order to serve the Poles, who settled in Silesia or who went there to colonize. Legally the archdiocese was still considered part of the German ''[[Fulda Conference]] of Catholic Bishops'' inside Germany of the borders of 31 December 1937. In 1951, when the [[Holy See]] \u2013 similar to [[West Germany]] \u2013 still asserted that Silesia would be returned to Germany at a near date, the Holy See appointed Theodor Bensch (1903\u20131958), titular bishop of Tabuda, as auxiliary bishop of Breslau, also responsible for the Polish part of the diocese of Berlin.\n\n===Within Poland since 1972===\n[[File:Kominek1.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Boles\u0142aw Kominek, 2nd Archbishop (first postwar) of Wroc\u0142aw]] On 28 June 1972, however, \u2013 in response to West Germany's change in [[Ostpolitik]] \u2013 [[Pope Paul VI]] redrew the archdiocesan boundary along the post-war borders.

From its founding as a [[Diocese|bishopric]] in 1000 until 1821, it was under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]]. From 1821 to 1930 it was subjected directly to the [[Apostolic See]]. Between 1821 and 1972 it was officially known as '''(Arch)Diocese of Breslau'''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early medieval era===\nChristianity was first introduced into [[Silesia]] by missionaries from [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]]. After the conversion of Duke [[Mieszko I]] of Poland and the conquest of Silesia, the work of bringing the people to the new faith went on more rapidly. Up to about the year 1000 Silesia had no bishop of its own, but was united with neighbouring dioceses. In this way, the connection of Silesia with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] continued. The upper part of the [[Oder River]] formed the boundary of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131138)|Kingdom of Poland]]. All the territory which is now Silesia \u2013 lying on the right-hand bank of the Oder \u2013 belonged, therefore, to the [[Diocese of Pozna\u0144]], which was [[suffragan]] to the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]]. This part of Silesia was thus under the jurisdiction of a priest named Jordan who was appointed first Bishop of Pozna\u0144 in 968. The part of Silesia lying on the left bank of the Oder belonged to the territory included in then [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and was consequently within the diocesan jurisdiction of [[Prague]]. The [[Bishopric of Prague]], founded in 973, was suffragan to the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]].\n\nDuke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], the son of Mieszko, obtained the Bohemian part of Silesia during his wars of conquest, and a change in the ecclesiastical dependence of the province followed. By a patent of Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] in 995, Silesia was attached to the [[Bishopric of Meissen]], which, like Pozna\u0144, was suffragan to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. Soon after, Boles\u0142aw, who had pledged allegiance to the empero Otto who ruled all of Silesia, founded the Diocese of Wroc\u0142aw, which, together with the Bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Bishopric of Ko\u0142obrzeg|Ko\u0142obrzeg]], was placed under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]], founded by Otto in 1000 during the [[Congress of Gniezno]]. The first Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw is said to have been named [[Jan (bishop of Wroc\u0142aw)|Johannes]], but nothing more than this is known of him, nor is there extant any official document giving the boundaries of the diocese at the time of its erection. However, they are defined in the Bulls of approval and protection issued by [[Pope Adrian IV]], 23 April 1155, and by [[Pope Innocent IV]], 9 August 1245.\n\nThe powerful Polish ruler Boles\u0142aw I was succeeded by his son [[Mieszko II Lambert]], who had but a short reign. After his death a revolt against Christianity and the reigning family broke out, the new Church organization of Poland disappeared from view, and the names of the Bishops of Wroc\u0142aw for the next half century are unknown. [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]], the son of Mieszko, and his mother were driven out of the country, but through German aid they returned and the affairs of the Church were brought into better order. A Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw from probably 1051 to 1062 was Hieronymus, said by later tradition to have been a [[Rome|Roman]] nobleman. He was followed by Johannes I (1062\u201372), who was succeeded by Petrus I (1071\u20131111). During the episcopate of Petrus, Count Peter Wlast entered upon the work of founding churches and monasteries which has preserved his name. Petrus was followed by: \u017byros\u0142aw I (1112\u201320); Heimo (1120\u201326), who welcomed [[Otto of Bamberg]] to Wroc\u0142aw in May 1124 when the saint was on his missionary journey to Pomerania; Robert I (1127\u201342), who was [[List of Roman Catholic bishops of Krak\u00f3w|Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]]; Robert II (1142\u201346); and Johannes II (1146\u201349), who became Archbishop of Gniezno.\n\n===Silesian duchies (Poland's fragmentation)===\nWith the episcopate of Bishop Walter (1149\u201369) the history of the diocese of Wroc\u0142aw begins to grow clearer. [[Pope Adrian IV]], at Walter's request in 1155, took the bishopric under his protection and confirmed to it the territorial possessions of which a list had been submitted to him. Among the rights which the Pope then confirmed was that of jurisdiction over the lands belonging to the castle of [[Otmuch\u00f3w]] (Ottmachau) which had been regarded as the patrimony of the diocese from its foundation. In 1163 the sons of the exiled Polish duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] returned from the Empire and, through the intervention of Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], received as an independent duchy the part of Silesia which was included at that date in the see of Wroc\u0142aw. Bishop Walter built a new, massively constructed cathedral, in which he was buried. \u017byros\u0142aw II (1170\u201398) encouraged the founding of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery of [[Lebus]] by Duke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Tall]]. In 1180 \u017byros\u0142aw took part in the national assembly at [[\u0141\u0119czyca]] at which laws for the protection of the Church and its property were promulgated. Jaros\u0142aw (1198\u20131201), the oldest son of Duke Boles\u0142aw, and Duke of [[Opole|Oppeln]], was the first prince to become Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw (see [[prince-bishop]]).\n\nCyprian (1201\u20137) was originally Abbot of the [[Premonstratensian]] monastery of St. Vincent near Wroc\u0142aw, then [[Bishop of Lebus]], and afterwards Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw. During Cyprian's episcopate Duke Heinrich I and his wife, [[Hedwig of Andechs|St. Hedwig]], founded the [[Cistercian convent at Trebnitz]]. The episcopate of Bishop Lorenz (1207\u201332) was marked by his efforts to bring colonies of Germans into the church territories, to effect the cultivation of waste lands. This introduction of German settlers by the bishop was in accordance with the example set by Heinrich I and St. Hedwig. The monasteries of the [[Augustinian Canons]], [[Premonstratensians]] and [[Cistercian]]s took an active part in carrying out the schemes of the rulers by placing great numbers of Germans, especially [[Thuringians]] and [[Franconia]]ns, on the large estates that had been granted them.\nOne of the most noted bishops of the diocese, Thomas I (1232\u201368), continued the work of German colonization with so much energy that even the marauding incursions of the [[Mongols]] (1241) made but a temporary break in the process. As German colonization in Silesia increased the city of Wroc\u0142aw began to be known by the German name of Breslau, leading to the diocese also becoming called the Bishopric of Breslau. Thomas's defence of the rights of the Church involved him in bitter conflicts with Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]]. Thomas began the construction of the present cathedral, the chancel being the first part erected. St. Hedwig died during his episcopate; and he lived until the process of her canonization was completed, but died before the final solemnity of her elevation to the altars of the Catholic Church. After Thomas I, Ladislaus, a grandson of Saint Hedwig, and [[Archbishop of Salzburg]], was Administrator of the Diocese of Breslau until his death in 1270.\n\nHe was followed by Thomas II (1270\u201392), who was involved for years in a violent dispute with Duke [[Henryk IV Probus|Henry IV]] as to the prerogatives of the Church in Silesia. In 1287 a reconciliation was effected between them at [[Regensburg]], and in 1288 the duke founded the collegiate church of the Holy Cross at Breslau. Before his death, on the Eve of St. John in 1290, the duke confirmed the rights of the Church to sovereignty over the territories of [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]] and Ottmachau. Thomas II consecrated the high altar of the cathedral; he was present at the [[First Council of Lyon]] (1274) and in 1279 held a diocesan synod. Johann III Romka (1292\u20131301), belonged to the Polish party in the [[cathedral chapter]]. His maintenance of the prerogatives of the Church brought him, also, into conflict with the temporal rulers of Silesia; in 1296 he called a synod for the defence of these rights.\n\nIn the election of Heinrich I of W\u00fcrben (1302\u201319), the German party in the cathedral chapter won, but this victory cost the new bishop the enmity of the opposing faction. He was made guardian of the youthful Dukes of Breslau, and this appointment, together with the factional disputes, led to the bringing of grave accusations against him. The researches of more recent times have proved the groundlessness of these attacks. He was kept in [[Avignon]] a number of years by a suit before the [[Curia]] which was finally settled in his favour. Notwithstanding the troubles of his life he was energetic in the performance of his duties. He carried on the construction of the cathedral, and in 1305 and 1316 held diocesan synods. The office of [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of Breslau dates from his episcopate. After his death a divided vote led to a vacancy of the see. The two candidates, Weit and Lutold, elected by the opposing factions, finally resigned, and [[Pope John XXII]] transferred Nanker of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to Breslau (1326\u201341).\n\n===Within Bohemia===\n\nThe constant division and subdivision of Silesian territory into small principalities for the members of the ruling families resulted in a condition of weakness that necessitated dependence on a stronger neighbour, and Silesia thus came under the control of Bohemia (first between 1289\u20131306; definitely from 1327 onwards), which itself was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. A quarrel broke out between Bishop Nanker and the suzerain of Silesia, King [[John I of Bohemia]], when the king seized the castle of [[Milicz|Militsch]] which belonged to the cathedral chapter. The bishop excommunicated the king and those members of the Council of Breslau who sided with him. On account of this he was obliged to flee from Breslau and take refuge in [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], where he died.\n\n[[File:Preczlaus de Pogrella.png|thumb|120px|right|Przec\u0142aw of Pogarell, 20th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nPrzec\u0142aw of Pogarell (1341\u20131376) was elected bishop while pursuing his studies at [[Bologna]], and was consecrated bishop at [[Avignon]]. Through his friendship with Charles, the son of King John, he was soon able to settle the discord that had arisen under his predecessor. The diocese prospered greatly under his rule. He bought the Duchy of [[Grodk\u00f3w]] (Grottkau) from Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Brzeg|Brieg]] and added it to the episcopal territory of Neisse. The Bishops of Breslau had, therefore, after this the titles of ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince) of Neisse and Duke of Grottkau, and took precedence over the other Silesian rulers who held principalities in fief.\n\nEmperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] wished to separate Breslau from the [[Archdiocese of Gniezno]] and to make it a suffragan of the newly erected [[Archbishopric of Prague]] (1344) but the plan failed, owing to the opposition of the Archbishop of Gniezno. Przec\u0142aw added to the cathedral the beautiful Lady Chapel, in which he was buried and where his tomb still exists. Dietrich, dean of the cathedral, who was elected as successor to Przec\u0142aw, could not obtain the papal confirmation, and the [[Bishop of Olomouc]] (Olm\u00fctz), who was chosen in his place, soon died. After a long contest with Charles, Bishop Wenzel of Lebus, Duke of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]], was transferred to Breslau (1382\u20131417). The new bishop devoted himself to repairing the damage<!-- ??? What damage exactly? It should be more specificated. --> inflicted on the Church in Silesia by the actions of Charles. He held two synods, in 1410 and 1415, with the object of securing a higher standard of ecclesiastical discipline; and he settled the right of inheritance in the territory under his dominion by promulgating the church decree called \"Wenzel's law\". Resigning his bishopric in 1417, Wenzel died in 1419.\n\nThe episcopate of Conrad, Duke of [[Ole\u015bnica]] (Oels), the next bishop (1417\u201347), was a trying time for Silesia during the [[Hussite wars]]. Conrad was placed at the head of the Silesian confederation formed to defend the country against hostile incursions. In 1435 the bishop issued a decree of which the chief intent was to close the prebends in the diocese of Breslau to foreigners, and thus prevent the Poles from obtaining these offices. The effort to shut out the Polish element and to loosen the connection with [[Gniezno]] was not a momentary one; it continued, and led gradually to a virtual separation from the Polish archdiocese some time before the formal separation took place. The troubles of the times brought the bishop and the diocese into serious pecuniary difficulties, and in 1444 Conrad resigned, but his resignation was not accepted and he resumed his office. In 1446 he held a diocesan synod and died in the following year.\n[[File:Biskup Piotr Nowak.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Peter Nowak, 23rd Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nConrad's successor was the provest of the cathedral of Breslau, Peter II Nowak (1447\u201356). By wise economy Bishop Peter succeeded in bringing the diocesan finances into a better condition and in redeeming the greater part of the church lands which his predecessor had been obliged to mortgage. At the diocesan synod of 1454 he endeavoured to suppress the abuses that had arisen in the diocese.\n\n[[File:Jodok z Ro\u017cemberku.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Jo\u0161t of Ro\u017emberk, 24th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nJodokus (Jo\u0161t) of Rosenberg (1456\u201367) was a [[Bohemian]] nobleman and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Knights of St. John]]. His love of peace made his position a very difficult one during the fierce ecclesiastic-political contention that raged between the [[Hussite]] King of Bohemia, [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], and the people of Breslau, who had taken sides with the German party. Jodokus was followed by a bishop from the region of the [[Rhine]], Rudolf von R\u00fcdesheim (1468\u201382). As [[papal legate]], Rudolf had become popular in Breslau through his energetic opposition to George of Podebrady; for this reason the cathedral chapter requested his transfer from the small [[Diocese of Lavant]] in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], after he had confirmed their privileges. From this time these privileges were called \"the Rudolfian statutes\". Under his leadership the party opposed to Podebrady obtained the victory, and Rudolf proceeded at once to repair the damage which had been occasioned to the Church during this strife; mortgaged church lands were redeemed; in 1473 and 1475 diocesan synods were held, at which the bishop took active measures in regard to church discipline.\n[[File:JanRoth.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Johann IV. Roth, 26th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nAs coadjutor, he had selected a [[Swabians|Swabian]], Johann IV Roth, [[Bishop of Lavant]], a man of humanistic training. Urged by King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of [[Hungary]], to whom Silesia was then subject, the cathedral chapter, somewhat unwillingly, chose the coadjutor as bishop (1482\u20131506). His episcopate was marked by violent quarrels with the cathedral chapter. But at the same time he was a promoter of art and learning, and strict in his conception of church rights and duties. He endeavoured to improve the spiritual life of the diocese by holding a number of synods. Before he died the famous worker in bronze, [[Peter Vischer of Nuremberg]], cast his monument, the most beautiful bishop's tomb in Silesia. His coadjutor with right of succession was Johann V (1506\u201320), a member of the noble [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] family of [[Thurzo]]. Johann V took an active part in the intellectual life of the time and sought at the diocesan synods to promote learning and church discipline, and to improve the schools. On the ruins of the old stronghold of [[Jauernig]] he built the castle called [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|Johannisberg]], later the summer residence of the Prince-Bishop of Breslau.\n\nThe religious disturbances of the 16th century began to be conspicuously apparent during this episcopate, and soon after Johann's death Protestantism began to spread in Silesia, which belonged to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] since 1526. Princes, nobles, and town councils were zealous promoters of the new belief; even in the episcopal principality of [[Neisse-Grottkau]] Protestant doctrines found approval and acceptance. The successors of Johann V were partly responsible for this condition of affairs. Jacob von Salza (1520\u201339) was personally a stanch adherent of the Church; yet the gentleness of his disposition caused him to shrink from carrying on a war against the powerful religious movement that had arisen. To an even greater degree than Jacob von Salza his successor, Balthasar von Promnitz (1539\u201363), avoided coming into conflict with Protestantism. He was more friendly in his attitude to the new doctrine than any other Bishop of Breslau. Casper von Logau (1562\u201374) showed at first greater energy than his predecessor in endeavouring to compose the troubles of his distracted diocese, but later in his episcopate his attitude towards Lutheranism and his slackness in defending church rights gave great offence to those who had remained true to the Faith. These circumstances make the advance of Protestantism easy to understand. At the same time it must be remembered that the bishops, although also secular rulers, had a difficult position in regard to spiritual matters. At the assemblies of the nobles and at the meetings of the diet, the bishops and the deputies of the cathedral chapter were, as a rule, the only Catholics against a large and powerful majority on the side of Protestantism. The [[Habsburg]] suzerains, who lived far from Silesia (in Vienna or Prague), and who were constantly preoccupied by the danger of a [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Turkish invasion]], were not in a position to enforce the edicts which they issued for the protection of the Church.\n\nThe Silesian clergy had in great measure lost their high concept of the priestly office, although there were honourable exceptions. Among those faithful were the majority of the canons of the cathedral of Breslau; they distinguished themselves not only by their learning, but also by their religious zeal. It was in the main due to them that the diocese did not fall into spiritual ruin. The chapter was the willing assistant of the bishops in the reform of the diocese. Martin von Gerstmann (1574\u201385) began the renovation of the diocese, and the special means by which he hoped to attain the desired end were: the founding of a seminary for clerics, visitations of the diocese, diocesan synods, and the introduction of the Jesuits.\n\nHis successor, Andreas von Jerin (1585\u201396), a Swabian who had educated at the German College at Rome, followed in his footsteps. At the diocesan synod of 1592 he endeavoured to improve church discipline. Besides his zeal in elevating the life of the Church, he was also a promoter of the arts and learning. The silver altar with which he adorned his cathedral still exists, and he brought the schools in the principality of Neisse into a flourishing condition. The bishop also rendered important services to the emperor, as [[papal legate|legate]] at various times.\n\nBonaventura Hahn, elected in 1596 as the successor of Andreas von Jerin, was not recognized by the emperor and was obliged to resign his position. The candidate of the emperor, Paul Albert (1599\u20131600), occupied the see only one year. Johann VI (1600\u20138), a member of a noble family of Silesia named von Sitsch, took more severe measures than his predecessors against Protestantism, in the hope of checking it, especially in the episcopal principality of Neisse-Grottkau.\n\nBishop Charles (1608\u201324), an Archduke of Austria, had greater success than his predecessor after the first period of the [[Thirty Years' War]] had taken a turn favourable to Austria and the Catholic party. Charles wanted to move under protection of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], hoping to avoid participation in the war which was ravaging the Holy Roman Empire. As Charles's bishopric was nominally subordinated to the Polish Archbishopric of Gniezno, he asked the Archbishop of Gniezno for mediation in talks with King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] of Poland about protection and subordination of his bishopric. In May 1619, Prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw (the future King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]]), invited by his uncle Charles, left [[Warsaw]] and started a trip to Silesia. During talks with W\u0142adys\u0142aw in mid-1619, the Habsburgs promised to agree to a temporary occupation of part of Silesia by Polish forces, which the unsuccessfully Vasas hoped would later allow the incorporation of those areas into Poland.\n\nIn July 1619 Czech Protestants rebelled against King [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] and offered the Bohemian crown to [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]. On 27 September 1619, probably on hearing the news, W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Charles left Silesia in a hurry and on 7 October 1619 arrived in Warsaw. In December 1619, young W\u0142adys\u0142aw's brother, Prince [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Opole]], was chosen by Charles as auxiliary bishop of Wroc\u0142aw, which was confirmed by the Polish episcopate. The [[Battle of the White Mountain]] (1620) broke the revolt in Bohemian Crown (i.e. including the opposition of the Protestants of Silesia). The Bishopric of Breslau returned to the rule of the Archbishopric of Gniezno in 1620, having before been practically independent. Bishop Charles began the restoration of the principality of Neisse to the Catholic faith. The work was completed by his successor, Charles Ferdinand, Prince of Poland (1625\u201355), who spent most of his time in his own country, but appointed excellent administrators for the diocese, such as the Coadjutor-Bishop Liesch von Hornau, and Archdeacon Gebauer. Imperial commissioners gave back to the Catholic Church those church buildings in the chief places of the principalities which had become the property of the sovereign through the extinction of vassal families. Until 1632 ''de facto'' rule was held in Warsaw by King Sigismund III and not by the bishop or archbishop.\n\nAccording to the terms of the 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]], the remaining churches, 693 in number, of such territories were secularized in the years 1653, 1654, and 1668. This led to a complete reorganization of the diocese. The person who effected it was Sebastian of Rostock, a man of humble birth who was [[vicar-general]] and administrator of the diocese under the bishops Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (1656\u201362) and Archduke Charles Joseph (1663\u201364), neither of whom lived in the territory of Breslau. After Sebastian of Rostock became bishop (1664\u201371) he carried on the work of reorganization with still greater success than before.\n\n[[File:Friedrich-Kardinal.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Friedrich of Hesse-Darmstadt, 41st Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\n[[Friedrich von Hessen-Darmstadt]], Cardinal and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of St. John]], was the next Bishop of Breslau (1671\u201382). The new bishop was of Protestant origin but had become a Catholic at Rome. Under his administration the rehabilitation of the diocese went on. He beautified the cathedral and elaborated its services. For the red cap and violet almutium of the canons he substituted the red [[mozzetta]]. He was buried in a beautiful chapel which he had added to the cathedral in honour of his ancestress, St. Elizabeth of Thuringia.\n\nAfter his death the chapter presented Carl von Liechtenstein, Bishop of Olomouc, for confirmation. Their choice was opposed by the emperor, whose candidate was the [[Count Palatine]] Wolfgang of the ruling family of [[Pfalz-Neuburg]]. Count Wolfgang died, and his brother Franz Ludwig (1683\u20131732) was made bishop. The new ruler of the diocese was at the same time [[Bishop of Worms]], Grand Master of the [[German Knights]], Provost of [[Ellwangen]] and [[Elector of Trier]], and later was made [[Elector of Mainz]]. He separated the ecclesiastical administration and that of the civil tribunals, and obtained the definition, in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1699, of the extent of the jurisdiction of the vicariate-general and the consistory. In 1675, upon the death of the last reigning duke, the Silesian Duchy of [[Liegnitz-Brieg-Wohlau]] lapsed to the emperor, and a new secularization of the churches begun. But when King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] secured for the Protestants the right to their former possessions in these territories, by the Treaty of [[Altranst\u00e4dt]], in 1707, the secularization came to an end, and the churches had to be returned. The Habsburg Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] endeavoured to repair the loss of these buildings to the Catholic faith by founding the so-called Josephine vicarships.\n\n===Within Prussia (main part) and Bohemia (lesser part)===\n[[File:Schaffgotsch portrait.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Prince-Bishop [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]], 45th bishop on the see.]] The next prince-bishop, [[Philipp Ludwig von Sinzendorf|Philip, Count von Sinzendorf]], Cardinal and [[Bishop of Raab]] (1732\u20131747), owed his elevation to the favour of the emperor. During his episcopate, the greater part of the diocese was added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the [[Silesian Wars]]. King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] (Frederick the Great) desired to erect a \"Catholic Vicariate\" at Berlin, to be the highest spiritual authority for the Catholics of Prussia. This would have been in reality a separation from Rome, and the project failed through the opposition of the Holy See. Bishop Sinzendorf had neither the acuteness to perceive the inimical intent of the king's scheme, nor sufficient decision of character to withstand it. The king desired to secure a successor to Sinzendorf who would be under royal influence. In utter disregard of the principles of the Church, and heedless of the protests of the cathedral chapter, he presented Count [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]] as coadjutor-bishop.\n\nAfter the death of Cardinal Sinzendorf the king succeeded in the placement of Schaffgotsch as Bishop of Breslau (1748\u201395). Although the method of his elevation caused the new bishop to be regarded with suspicion by many strict Catholics, he was zealous in the fulfilment of his duties. During the [[Seven Years' War]] he fell into discredit with Frederick on account of his firm maintenance of the rights of the Church, and the return of peace did not fully restore him to favour. In 1766 he fled to the [[Austrian Silesia|Austrian]] part of his diocese in order to avoid confinement in [[Opole|Oppeln]] which the king had decreed against him. After this Frederick made it impossible for him to rule the Prussian part of his diocese, and until the death of the bishop this territory was ruled by [[vicars Apostolic]].\n\nThe former coadjutor of von Schaffgotsch, Joseph Christian, Prince von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein (1795\u20131817), succeeded him as bishop. During his episcopate the temporal power of the Bishops of Breslau came to an end through the secularization, in 1810, of the church estates in Prussian Silesia \u2013 only the estates in [[Austrian Silesia]] remained to the see. The cathedral foundation, eight collegiate foundations, and over eighty monasteries were suppressed, and their property confiscated. Only those monastic institutions which were occupied with teaching or nursing were allowed to exist.\n\nBishop Joseph Christian was succeeded by his coadjutor, Emmanuel von Schimonsky. The affairs of the Catholic Church in Prussia had been brought into order by the Bull \"De salute animarum\", issued in 1821. Under its provisions the cathedral chapter elected Schimonsky, who had been administrator of the diocese, as Prince-Bishop of Breslau (1824\u20131832).\n\nThe bull disentangled Breslau diocese from Gniezno ecclesiastical province and made Breslau an [[Exemption (church)|exempt]] bishopric. The bull also reconfined the Breslau diocesan area which from then on remained unchanged until 1922. Breslau diocese then included the bulk of the Catholic parishes in the Prussian [[Province of Silesia]] with the exception of Catholic parishes in the districts of [[Racib\u00f3rz|Ratibor]] and [[Leobsch\u00fctz]], which until 1972 belonged to the [[Archdiocese of Olomouc]], and Catholic parishes in the Prusso-Silesian [[County of Klodzko|County of Glatz]], which were subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] within the [[Archdiocese of Prague]] until 1972. The Breslau Diocese included the Catholic parishes in the [[Duchy of Teschen]] and the Austrian part of the [[Principality of Neisse]]. The bull also assigned the Prussian-annexed parts of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Mei\u00dfen#Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen|Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen]] in [[Lower Lusatia]] (politically part of Prussian [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] since 1815<ref>This included \u2013 among others \u2013 [[Cottbus]], [[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie|Crossen]], [[Guben]], [[Neuzelle]], [[Schwiebus]] and [[Z\u00fcllichau]] etc.</ref>) and eastern [[Upper Lusatia]] (to Silesia province as of 1815) to Breslau diocese.\n\nWith the exception of the districts of [[Byt\u00f3w|B\u00fctow]] and [[L\u0119bork|Lauenburg (Pommern)]], until 1922 both part of the [[Bishopric of Culm (Che\u0142mno)|Diocese of Culm]], the rest of Brandenburg and [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania province]] were, since 1821, supervised by the [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]] ({{lang-de|link=no|F\u00fcrstbisch\u00f6fliche Delegatur f\u00fcr Brandenburg und Pommern}}, {{lang-pl|Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119co-biskupia Delegatura Brandenburgii i Pomorza}}).\n\nSchimonsky retained for himself and his successors the title of prince-bishop, although the episcopal rule in the Principality of Neisse had ended by its secularization. However, the rank of prince-bishop later included the [[ex officio member]]ship in the [[Prussian House of Lords]] (since 1854) and in the [[Reichsrat (Austria)#House of Lords|Austrian House of Lords]] (since 1861).\n\nSchimonsky combatted the rationalistic tendencies which were rife among his clergy in regard to celibacy and the use of Latin in the church services and ceremonies. During the episcopate of his predecessor the government had promulgated a law which was a source of much trouble to Schimonsky and his immediate successors; this was that in those places where Catholics were few in number, the parish should be declared extinct and the church buildings given to the newly founded [[Evangelical Church in Prussia]]. In spite of the protests of the episcopal authorities, over one hundred church buildings were lost in this way. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] put an end to this injustice, and sought to make good the injuries inflicted.\n\nFor several years after Schimonsky's death the see remained vacant. It was eventually filled by the election, through government influence, of Count [[Leopold von Sedlnitzky]] (1836\u201340). Prince-Bishop von Sedlnitzky was neither clear nor firm in his maintenance of the doctrines of the Church; on the question of [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s, which had become one of great importance, he took an undecided position. At last, upon the demand of [[Pope Gregory XVI]], he resigned his see in 1840. He went afterwards to Berlin, where he was made a privy-councillor, and where he became a Protestant in 1862. In 1871 he died in Berlin and was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Rankau (today's R\u0119k\u00f3w, a part of [[Sob\u00f3tka]]).\n\n[[File:Knauer.jpg|thumb|120px|Prince-Bishop Joseph Knauer, 49th bishop of the see|alt=]] The dean of the cathedral, Dr. Ritter, administered the diocese for several years until the election of Joseph Knauer (1843\u201344), earlier [[Grand Dean]] of the Silesian County of Glatz within the Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. The new prince-bishop, who was 79&nbsp;years old, lived only a year after his appointment.\n\nHis successor was Melchior, Freiherr von Diepenbrock (1845\u201353). This episcopate was the beginning of a new religious and ecclesiastical life in the diocese. During the revolutionary period the prince-bishop not only maintained order in his see, which was in a state of ferment, but was also a supporter of the government. He received unusual honours from the king and was made a cardinal by the Pope. He died 20 January 1853, at the [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] and was buried in the Breslau cathedral.\n\nHis successor, [[Heinrich F\u00f6rster]] (1853\u201381), carried on his work and completed it. Prince-Bishop F\u00f6rster gave generous aid to the founding of churches, monastic institutions, and schools. The strife that arose between the Church and the State brought his labours in the Prussian part of his diocese to an end. He was deposed by the State and was obliged to leave Breslau and retire to the Austrian Silesian castle of Johannisberg where he died, 20 October 1881; he was buried in the cathedral at Breslau.\n\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] appointed as his successor in the disordered diocese Robert Herzog (1882\u201386), who had been ''Prince-Episcopal Delegate for Brandenburg and Pomerania'' and provost of [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral|St. Hedwig's]] in Berlin. Prince-Bishop Herzog made every endeavour to bring order out of the confusion into which the quarrel with the State during the immediately preceding years had thrown the affairs of the diocese. Unfortunately, his episcopate was but of short duration; he died after a long illness, 26 December 1886.\n\nThe Holy See appointed as his successor a man who had done much to allay the strife between Church and State, the [[Bishop of Fulda]], [[Georg von Kopp|Georg Kopp]]. Prince-Bishop Kopp was born in 1837, at [[Duderstadt]] in the [[Diocese of Hildesheim]]; he was ordained to the priesthood (1862); consecrated and installed Bishop of Fulda in 1881; transferred to Breslau and installed 20 October 1887; later created a cardinal (1893).\n\n===Early 20th century===\nAccording to the census of 1 December 1905, the German part of Breslau diocesan area, including the prince-episcopal delegation, comprised 3,342,221 Catholics; 8,737,746 Protestants; and 204,749 Jews. It was the richest German diocese in revenues and [[offertories]]. There were actively employed in the diocese 1,632 secular and 121 regular, priests. The cathedral chapter included the two offices of provost and dean, and had 10 regular, and 6 honorary, canons.\n\nThe prince-bishopric was divided into 11 commissariates and 99 [[archipresbyterate]]s, in which there were 992 cures of various kinds (parishes, curacies, and stations), with 935 parish churches and 633 dependent and mother-churches. Besides the theological faculty of the [[Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t]] in Breslau, the diocese possessed, as episcopal institutions for the training of the clergy, 5 preparatory seminaries for boys, 1 home (recently much enlarged) for theological students attending the university, and 1 [[seminary]] for priests in Breslau.

However, the ecclesiastical affiliation remained unchanged, the Breslau diocese, a cross-border bilateral bishopric since 1742 between \u2013 at last \u2013 Germany and Austro-Hungary, thus turned into a trilateral Czechoslokian-German-Polish bishopric. Since 1770 the prince-bishop had appointed separate [[vicars general]] for the Bohemian (or Austrian, since 1918 partially Czechoslovakian and Polish, resp.) part of the diocese. Also the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Dioceses of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Olomouc|of Olomouc]] comprised cross-border diocesan territories in Czechoslovakian Bohemia and smaller parts in German Silesia (Hradec Kr. diocese: [[Bad Altheide]], [[K\u0142odzko|Glatz]], [[Habelschwerdt]] and [[Neurode]]; Olomouc archdiocese: [[Branice|Branitz]], [[Kietrz|Katscher]], [[Leobsch\u00fctz]] and [[Owsiszcze|Owsch\u00fctz]]). So also the Roman Catholic parishes in Czechoslovakian T\u011b\u0161\u00edn Silesia remained part of Breslau diocese.\n\nFollowing the ''German-Polish Accord on East Silesia'',<ref>[https://archive.is/20120802065927/http://www.bundesarchiv.de/foxpublic/B19017D80A0622120000000060376978/frame.jsp?detail=findmittelinfo.html&oben=findmittelinfo_oben.html Cf. Deutsch-polnisches Abkommen \u00fcber Ostschlesien (Genfer Abkommen)]</ref> signed in Geneva on 15 May 1922, also [[East Upper Silesia|eastern Upper Silesia]] was transferred from [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] to the [[Second Polish Republic]] on 20 June the same year and formed together with the Polish Cieszyn Silesia part of the new Polish [[Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship]]. On 7 November 1922 the Holy See disentangled the Catholic parishes in the new voivodeship from the Breslau diocese and subordinated them to an [[Apostolic Administrator]] on 17 December the same year. On 28 October 1925 [[Pope Pius XI]] elevated that apostolic administration to the new [[diocese of Katowice]] with Bishop [[August Hlond]], then a suffragan of [[Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]], by the papal Bull ''Vixdum Poloniae Unitas''.\n\nAccording to the ''Prussian [[Concordat]]'' of 1929 the prior exempt Bishopric of Breslau was elevated to the rank of archdiocese in 1930 and was henceforth known as the '''Archbishopric of Breslau''', then supervising the ''Eastern German [[ecclesiastical province|Ecclesiastical Province]]'' comprising Breslau proper and three [[suffragan]]s, to wit the new [[diocese of Berlin]], comprising the former [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]], the formerly exempt [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Warmia|Diocese of Ermland (Warmia)]], and the new [[Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl]].\n\n===Within Poland (main part), Czechoslovakia and East Germany (lesser parts)===\nAfter World War II, the city of Breslau was made part of Poland in 1945 and officially renamed Wroc\u0142aw. In 1972 the Archbishopric of Breslau was also renamed to the Archbishopric of Wroc\u0142aw, but still known as Vratislavia in the Latin of Rome. On 21 June 1945 [[Archbishop]] Cardinal [[Adolf Bertram]], while staying in the episcopal [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] in Czechoslovak [[Javorn\u00edk (Jesen\u00edk District)|Javorn\u00edk (Jauernig)]], appointed [[Franti\u0161ek Onderek]] (1888\u20131962) as [[vicar general]] for the Czechoslovak part of the archdiocese. Bertram died on 6 July 1945 in Johannisberg castle in Czechoslovakia, supposedly due to the Polish demands upon him (an ethnic German, who, however, had pleaded for German-Polish reconciliation during the time of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski|Pi\u0142sudski]]'s regime). Expelled, deported, German ex-Silesians from [[West Germany]] have since ca. 1946 entertained claims that Bertram was actually killed or brought near to death by Polish \"imperialists\" inside the Catholic Church of Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nOn 16 July 1945 the archdiocesan [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]], still comprising nine members, elected the Polish-speaking Ferdinand Piontek as [[capitular vicar]], whom the [[Gestapo]] had banned from Breslau in early February 1945. On his return to the town he was sworn in by the chapter on 23 July. On 12 August 1945 Cardinal [[August Hlond]] appeared and demanded Piontek to resign from his office for the archdiocesan territory east of the [[Oder-Nei\u00dfe line]], claiming to act on the authority of papal mandates, however, only applying to the pre-war territory of Poland.\n\nSo Piontek \u2013 not knowing of the restricted mandate \u2013 resigned for the Polish-held parts of the archdiocese, but not for the remaining parts in Czechoslovakia and Allied occupied Germany. Hlond divided the Polish-held archdiocesan area into the three administrative districts of [[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]], [[Opole]], and Wroc\u0142aw proper and appointed a [[diocesan administrator]] for each of them on 15 August, with effect of 1 September. Capitular Vicar Piontek confirmed Onderek on 18 August 1945 as vicar general for the Czechoslovakian part of the archdiocese.<ref name=\"Hartelt 2008 p. 231\">Konrad Hartelt, ''Ferdinand Piontek: (1878\u20131963); Leben und Wirken eines schlesischen Priesters und Bischofs'', Cologne et al.: B\u00f6hlau, 2008, (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 39), p. 231. {{ISBN|978-3-412-20143-2}}</ref> Piontek was asked to help Karol Milik, the new administrator in Wroc\u0142aw, and stayed. He could also take care of the Catholic clergy and laymen of German language, who were in the course of expulsion by the Polish authorities.\n\n[[Pope Pius XII]] did not recognise Hlond's overbearances. In order to strengthen Piontek's position Pius XII granted him the rights of a residing bishop on 28 February 1946. However, on 9 July the Polish authorities expelled Piontek and he was stranded in [[Peine]], then British zone of occupation. On 31 July Pius XII confirmed Onderek's appointment and advanced him to ''Apostolic Administrator of the Czechoslovak part of the Archdiocese of Breslau'' ({{lang-cz|[[:cs:Apo\u0161tolsk\u00e1 administratura \u010deskot\u011b\u0161\u00ednsk\u00e1|Apo\u0161tolsk\u00e1 administratura \u010deskot\u011b\u0161\u00ednsk\u00e1]]}}), seated in [[\u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn]], thus definitely divesting it from Breslau's jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Hartelt 2008 p. 231\"/><ref>''Biographisches Handbuch der Tschechoslowakei'', Heinrich Kuhn and Otto B\u00f6ss (compilators), Munich: Lerche, 1961, (=Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen des Collegium Carolinum), p. 115</ref> The Archdiocese of Breslau remained in existence [[de jure]]; however, de facto this only applied to the archdiocesan territory in the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied Occupation Zones]] in the remainder of German post-war territories. This also included big parts of the [[suffragan]] [[diocese of Berlin]], except for its areas east of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line. However, the territory of the other suffragans and the [[Bishopric of Ermland (1772-1945)|diocese of Ermland/Warmia]] had come under Polish and Soviet rule, respectively, and the Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl had become Polish.\n\nIn 1947 Piontek returned to the archdiocesan territory west of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line (then part of [[Soviet occupation zone]]) and officiated as capitular vicar at the local branch of the archdiocesan [[ordinariate]] in Silesian [[G\u00f6rlitz]], built up since October 1945. Despite the anticlerical Soviet policy he managed to build up a new [[seminary]] in [[Neuzelle]] in 1948, after the old seminary in Poland was inaccessible for candidates from west of the new border. In 1953 Pius XII invested Piontek with the right to bear a [[crosier]] and bestow episcopal [[blessing]]s. On 23 May 1959 Piontek became titular bishop of [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]].\n\nThe Holy See refused to acknowledge Polish Catholic Church claims, however, and only appointed auxiliary bishops to the Archdiocese of [[Krak\u00f3w]] in order to serve the Poles, who settled in Silesia or who went there to colonize. Legally the archdiocese was still considered part of the German ''[[Fulda Conference]] of Catholic Bishops'' inside Germany of the borders of 31 December 1937. In 1951, when the [[Holy See]] \u2013 similar to [[West Germany]] \u2013 still asserted that Silesia would be returned to Germany at a near date, the Holy See appointed Theodor Bensch (1903\u20131958), titular bishop of Tabuda, as auxiliary bishop of Breslau, also responsible for the Polish part of the diocese of Berlin.\n\n===Within Poland since 1972===\n[[File:Kominek1.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Boles\u0142aw Kominek, 2nd Archbishop (first postwar) of Wroc\u0142aw]] On 28 June 1972, however, \u2013 in response to West Germany's change in [[Ostpolitik]] \u2013 [[Pope Paul VI]] redrew the archdiocesan boundary along the post-war borders. The [[Apostolic constitution]] ''Vratislaviensis \u2013 Berolinensis et aliarum'' disentangled the [[East Germany|East German]] archdiocesan territory (becoming the [[Exemption (church)|exempt]] new [[Apostolic Administration of G\u00f6rlitz]]), the diocesan district of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski (becoming the new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona G\u00f3ra-Gorz\u00f3w|Diocese of Gorz\u00f3w]]) and that of Opole (becoming the new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Opole|Diocese of Opole]]).<ref>Paulus VI: Const.
