The food is commonly eaten and known under different names in countries across the region. It is usually dry salt or [[brine]] [[curing (food preservation)|cured]].

Unlike lard, salo is not [[Rendering (food processing)|rendered]]. Unlike bacon, salo has little or no lean meat. It is similar to Italian ''[[lardo]]'', the main differences being the thickness of the cut (''lardo'' is often sliced very thinly) and seasoning. [[East Slav]]ic salo uses salt, garlic, black pepper and sometimes [[coriander]] in the curing process, while ''lardo'' is generally seasoned with [[rosemary]] and other herbs.\n\n==Preservation==\nFor preservation, salo is salted and sometimes also smoked and aged in a dark and cold place, where it will last for a year or more. The slabs of fat are first cut into manageable pieces, typically 15\u00d720&nbsp;cm. Then layers of fat slabs (skin side down) topped with one-centimetre layers of salt go into a wooden box or barrel for curing.  For added flavouring and better preservation, the salo may be covered with a thick layer of [[paprika]] (usually in the more Western lands; in Russian salo with paprika is called \"Hungarian\"), minced [[garlic]], or sometimes [[black pepper]].\n\nWhen salo has been aged too long or exposed to light, the fat may oxidize on the surface and become yellow and bitter-tasting. Though no longer fit for culinary use, the spoiled fat can be used as a water-repellent treatment for leather boots or bait for [[mouse trap]]s, or it can simply be turned into homemade [[soap]].\n\n==Culinary==\n[[File:Salo.JPG|200px|thumb|''La\u0161iniai'', a Lithuanian type of salo]]\n\nSalo is consumed both raw and cooked. It is often fried or finely chopped with garlic as a condiment for [[borscht]] (beet soup). Small pieces of salo are added to some types of [[sausage]]. Thinly sliced salo on [[rye bread]] rubbed with [[garlic]] is a traditional snack to accompany [[vodka]] in Russia and [[horilka]] in Ukraine, where it is a particular favorite.\n\nSalo is often chopped into small pieces and fried to render fat for [[cooking]], while the remaining [[Pork rind|cracklings]] ({{lang|uk-Latn|[[\u010cvarci|shkvarky]]}} in Ukrainian, {{lang|ru|shkvarki}} in Russian, {{lang|lt|spirgai}} in Lithuanian, {{lang|pl|skwarki}} in Polish, {{lang|ro|jum\u0103ri}} in Romanian, {{lang|et|k\u00f5rned}} in [[Estonian language|Estonian]], t\u00f6p\u00f6rty\u0171 in Hungarian), \u043f\u0440\u044a\u0436\u043a\u0438 or \u0434\u0436\u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0438 in Bulgarian are used as condiments for fried [[potatoes]] or [[varenyky]] or spread on bread as a snack.\n\nThe thick pork skin that remains after the fat has been consumed is often used to make stock for soup or borscht.

It is about Norman's uncle, Australian [[Track and field|track athlete]] [[Peter Norman]], specifically the actions he took at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film provides an insight into an incident at the 1968 Summer Olympics which saw two United States athletes, [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], give the [[black power]] salute [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|from the victory dais]] after the [[200 metres|200 metres final]]. The film focuses on the third man on the dais, [[silver medal]] winner Peter Norman, who showed his support for Smith and Carlos by donning an \"[[Olympic Project for Human Rights]]\" (OPHR) badge on his way to the podium. It was also Norman who suggested to Smith and Carlos that they share the black gloves used in their salute, after Carlos had left his gloves in the [[Olympic Village]]. This is the reason for Smith raising his right fist, while Carlos raised his left. Asked later about his support of Smith and Carlos' cause by the world's press, Norman said he opposed his country's government's [[White Australia policy]].\n\nThe film documents the subsequent reprimand of Norman by the Australian Olympic authorities, and his ostracism by the Australian media. Despite Norman running qualifying times for both the 100m and 200m during 1971/72, the Australian Olympic track team did not send him to the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. It also documents Norman's reunion with Smith and Carlos, shortly before his death in 2006.\n\nThe film debuted at the [[Sydney Film Festival]] on 8 June 2008.

As a result, Matt Norman realised that the full story of his famous uncle had never been told and began filming ''Salute'' at the end of 2002.\n\nWith the help of the [[Film Finance Corporation]] and his local funding body [[Film Victoria]], Norman raised close to two million dollars for post production of the film.\n\nIn 2008, Andrew Mackie and Richard Payton of Transmission films were signed on as Australian distributors and later brought on board [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Pictures Australia]] to release the film nationally in cinemas throughout Australia.\n\n==Awards==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n* 2009 \u2013 Won - Atlanta International Documentary Film Festival (aka Atlanta DocuFest): Best Social Documentary  <ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0874317/awards|title=Salute|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n* 2009 \u2013 Won - Santa Cruz Film Festival: Jury Award \u2013 Best Documentary Feature  <ref name=\"imdb.com\"/>\n* 2009 \u2013 Nominated - Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards: FCCA Award - Best Feature Documentary  <ref name=\"imdb.com\"/>\n* 2008 \u2013 Won - Sydney Film Festival: Audience Award - Best Australian Documentary  <ref name=\"imdb.com\"/>\n* 2008 \u2013 Won - Rhode Island Film Festival: Audience Award \u2013 Best Documentary  <ref name=\"imdb.com\"/>\n\n==Box office==\n''Salute'' grossed $233,411 at the box office in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/967/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf|title=Film Victoria // supporting Victoria's film television and games industry - Film Victoria|website=www.film.vic.gov.au}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cinema of Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0874317|Salute}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.salutethemovie.com/}}\n* {{cite news | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602021024/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23747461-2,00.html | title=In-flight film will urge Olympians to protest | newspaper=Sydney Daily Telegraph | date= 24 May 2008 | accessdate=18 October 2018}} \n* {{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/the-white-guy-becomes-a-hero-on-film/2008/05/07/1210131072250.html | newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | title='The white guy' becomes a hero on film | first=Garry | last=Maddox | date=8 May 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010 }}\n* {{Cite news | url=http://themindunleashed.org/2015/12/the-white-man-in-that-photo.html | publisher=[[The Mind Unleashed]] | title='The White Man in That Photo | first=Riccardo | last=Gazzaniga | date=31 December 2015 | accessdate=4 Jan 2016 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Salute}}\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:Australian films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about the Olympics]]\n[[Category:Australian documentary films]]\n[[Category:Black Power]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about historical events]]\n[[Category:Films about the 1968 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Hirschfelder]]\n[[Category:Australian sports films]]\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=March 2015}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Salute\n| image = Salute2008.jpg\n| caption =\n| director = [[Matt Norman (director)|Matt Norman]]\n| producer = [[Matt Norman (director)|Matt Norman]]\n| writer = [[Matt Norman (director)|Matt Norman]]\n| starring = [[Peter Norman]]<br>[[Tommie Smith]]<br>[[John Carlos]]\n| music = [[David Hirschfelder]]\n| cinematography =\n| editing =\n| distributor = [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Warner Brothers]]\n| released = {{Film date|df=y|2008|07|17}}\n| runtime =\n| country = Australia\n| language = English\n| budget = AU$2,000,000\n}}{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n'''''Salute''''' is a 2008 Australian documentary film written, directed and produced by [[Matt Norman (director)|Matt Norman]].

On 11 June 1476, the Burgundians commenced the siege of the well-prepared town, whose forces were commanded by the Bernese general [[Adrian von Bubenberg]].<ref>Vaughn pg. 389</ref> An initial assault was repulsed by a heavy barrage of fire from light guns mounted on the walls, but two great [[Bombard (weapon)|bombards]] used by the Burgundians were slowly reducing the walls to rubble. By 19 June the Confederate muster was near complete at their camp behind the [[Saane/Sarine|Sarine (Saane) River]]. Only a contingent of some 4,000 men from [[Z\u00fcrich]] had yet to arrive and these were not expected until 22 June.\n\nCharles in the meantime had been kept reasonably well informed of the approach of the Confederate army, though he did nothing to hinder their approach. This is not to say that he was unprepared for the arrival of the Swiss; indeed in typical fashion Charles had prepared an elaborate plan to meet the enemy on ground of his choosing, some {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Morat, dominating their anticipated line of approach. The terrain around the town is quite hilly and he had chosen to rest his left flank artillery on a steeply sloped gorge cut by the Burggraben stream. In the centre, behind an elaborate ditch and palisade entrenchment known as the Grunhag, stood the bulk of Charles' infantry and artillery that were not engaged in besieging Murten itself. These were to fight the Confederation [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] and [[halberd]] blocks to a halt while on the right the massed [[Gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]] would then flank the frontally engaged Swiss, thus creating a killing ground from which there was no escape.\n\nOn 21 June 1476, Charles expected the Confederation forces to attack. He arranged his army and prepared for the coming assault. However, the Swiss commanders decided to wait an additional day for the troops from Z\u00fcrich. After about six hours of waiting Charles ordered his troops to stand down and return to camp.<ref>Vaughan pg. 392</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Schilling battle morat.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the siege of Murten.

The orderly lines of the Burgundian army dissolved into chaos as soldiers scattered throughout the camp collecting their pay, eating their midday meal and seeking shelter from the rain. The skeleton force that remained at the Grunhag were surprised when the Swiss army, in battle order, emerged from the woods less than {{convert|1000|m|yd|abbr=on}} from their lines.<ref>Smith pg. 193</ref><ref>Vaughan pg. 392</ref> The Confederate vanguard of some 6,000 [[skirmishers]] and all the 1,200 cavalry present erupted out of [[Birchenwald]] Woods to the west of Morat, exactly where Charles had predicted they would appear.\n\nBehind the vanguard came the main body of pikemen, the ''gewalthut'' (centre). Some 10,000 to 12,000 strong, they formed a large wedge with the canton standards in the centre, flanked by halberdiers and an outer ring of pikemen. The rearguard of 6,000 to 8,000 more closely packed pikemen and halberdiers followed the ''gewalthut'' towards the now sparsely manned Grunhag.\n\nAs the Swiss charged downhill into the Burgundian position the artillery managed to fire a few salvoes, killing or maiming several hundred of the overeager Lorrainers. Against the odds the defenders in the Grunhag held the Swiss for some time before a contingent of Swiss found a way through the left flank of the defences near the Burggraben and turned the whole position. The Swiss formed up quickly beyond it and advanced towards Murten and the besieger's camp.\n\nIn the Burgundian camp, there was confusion after the Swiss were sighted, as men rushed to re-form ranks and prepare for battle. In the ducal tent on top of the [[Bois Du Domingue]], a hill overlooking Morat, Charles was quickly armed by his retainers before rushing on horseback to try to coordinate the defence of the camp. But as fast as any unit was formed and moved forward against the Swiss, it was swept aside as various uncoordinated attacks were made against the still compact Confederate battle formations.<ref>Smith pg. 195</ref> There was some resistance from the squadrons of the ducal household who routed the Lorrainers, including [[Ren\u00e9&nbsp;II, Duke of Lorraine]], who was saved only by the arrival of the pikes, against which the gendarmes could only retire, unable to make any impression against them.\n\nCharles managed to muster enough English archers to form a last line of defence before the camp, but these were routed before a bow could be bent, their commander shot by a Swiss skirmisher. Traditionally, the [[Duke of Somerset]] is identified as the commander of the English archers. However, the only Duke of Somerset, [[Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort]] who was known to have been in Burgundian service died in 1471 at [[Tewkesbury]] in England and therefore could not have been at Murten five years later.<ref>[http://www.jcbrunner.info/hist/1476_morat_somerset.html Jean Claude Brunner \u2013 The Mystery of the dead Duke's Charge] retrieved 10 October 2012</ref>  Then it was every man for himself as Charles ordered the army to fall back which was interpreted as a retreat, which in turn became a rout as all organized resistance ended.\n\nFor some three miles along the lakeside many Burgundians died that day in the rout. The Italian division of some 4,000\u20136,000 men besieging the southern part of Morat probably suffered the worst fate: cut off by the Swiss rearguard and attacked by a sally from the town, they were hunted down along the shore and driven into the lake. As promised, no quarter was granted.\n\nMore fortunate was the Savoyard division under [[Jacques of Savoy, Count of Romont]] which was posted in the northern half of the Morat siege works. Forming up and abandoning all their baggage they retreated east round the lake and eventually made good their escape to Romont.\n\nPart of the war booty captured at this battle is still retained at the castle of [[Gruy\u00e8res]] in [[Switzerland]], and includes three capes of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] which belonged to Charles the Bold, including one with the emblem of his father, [[Philip the Good]], which he had with him as he was marking the anniversary of the death of his father.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe French poet and chronicler [[Jean Molinet]] reported that Charles' army lost about 6,000 to 7,000 men.<ref>[[Jean Molinet]] (I:146-47) quoted in Smith pg. 196</ref>  Later writers have calculated a higher number, between 9,000 and 10,000.<ref>{{cite book | title=Histoire de l'organisation militaire sous les ducs de Bourgogne | author=Guillaume, Henri Louis Gustave | year=1848 | pages=158 | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=EX11UKTQNano2AXniYCABg&sqi=2&jtp=158&id=AGU_AAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nCharles\u2019 dream of revenge against the Confederates ended that day.

It was privately built in 1871 by the [[Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|3rd Duke of Buckingham]] as a [[Horsecar|horse tram]] line to help transport goods between his lands around [[Wotton House]] and the national rail network. Lobbying from the nearby village of [[Brill, Buckinghamshire|Brill]] led to its extension to Brill and conversion to passenger use in early 1872. Two locomotives were bought but trains still travelled at an average speed of {{convert|4|mph|km/h}}.\n\nIn 1883, the Duke of Buckingham planned to upgrade the route to main line standards and extend the line to [[Oxford]], creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite the backing of the wealthy [[Ferdinand de Rothschild]], investors were deterred by costly tunnelling. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling. In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad.\n\nThe existing line had been upgraded in 1894, but the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's [[Metropolitan Railway]] and Brill became one of its two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster. The population of the area remained low, and the primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms. Between 1899 and 1910 other lines were built in the area, providing more direct services to London and the north of England. The Brill Tramway went into financial decline.\n\nIn 1933 the Metropolitan Railway became the [[Metropolitan line]] of [[London Passenger Transport Board|London Transport]]. The Brill Tramway became part of the London Underground, despite Quainton Road being {{convert|40|mi|km}} from London and not underground. London Transport aimed to concentrate on electrification and improvement of passenger services in London and saw little possibility that passenger routes in Buckinghamshire could become viable. In 1935 the Brill Tramway closed. The infrastructure was dismantled and sold. Little trace remains other than the former [[junction station]] at [[Quainton Road railway station|Quainton Road]], now the [[Buckinghamshire Railway Centre]].\n[[File:Brill tramway system diagram.png|right|thumb|upright=1.8|The full extent of the Brill Tramway system.

Large numbers of bricks from Poore's Brickworks at Brill were shipped. By July 1877 the entire output of the brickworks was going to supply the Waddesdon Manor works, with 25,000 bricks a week being used.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} Additional bricks were also shipped via Quainton Road,{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} along with 7,000&nbsp;tons (7,100&nbsp;t) of [[Bath Stone]] from [[Corsham]].{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=78}} The manor also required power and in 1883 a [[gasworks]] was built to the west. A siding from Westcott station ran south to the gasworks, to carry coal.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} Waddesdon Manor chose not to use the Tramway for supplying coal to the gasworks and the siding was abandoned in 1886.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}\n\nWaddesdon Manor was complete in 1889, 13 years after construction began. The Winchendon Branch closed and the track was removed.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} The gasworks remained operational, although supplied by road, until its closure during the coal shortage of 1916. It was demolished shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} The track of the disused siding remained until at least 1916.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}\n\n===Brill Brick and Tile Works===\nAlthough Poore's Brickworks was well established, Jones believed there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=49}} Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10&nbsp;million bricks a year.{{sfn|Melton|1984|pp=49\u201350}} It was decided that 5&nbsp;million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=50}} Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.{{sfn|Melton|1984|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nFew records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, as it came to be called, but it was operational by 1895.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}}{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=21}} Jones (1974) says the siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=6}} This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}} The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}}\n\nBrill Brick and Tile Works could not compete with the larger and better-connected brickworks at [[Calvert, Buckinghamshire|Calvert]] and declined.{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=111}}{{refn|In 1899 the [[Great Central Railway]] mainline from London to Manchester was built, running directly past the brickworks at Calvert.

The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=19}} Relations deteriorated between Jones and J.&nbsp;G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A&B. The A&B's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road.{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=37}} Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence.{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=37}}\n\nJones sought legal advice and was told that the Duke would probably win a legal action against the A&BR. The A&BR was in such a precarious financial position that any successful legal action against them would likely have forced the line through Quainton Road to close, severing the Tramway's connection with the national network altogether.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=33}} Meanwhile, local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter, causing a drop in milk transport.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=33}} From its peak of 20,994&nbsp;tons carried in 1877, goods traffic fell in each of the next four years, dropping to 9,139&nbsp;tons (9,286&nbsp;t) in 1881.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=30}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=26em|salign=right|quote=Once the train had stopped {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} short of the station, and looking out after a long wait I saw the engine far away.

It was privately built in 1871 by the [[Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|3rd Duke of Buckingham]] as a [[Horsecar|horse tram]] line to help transport goods between his lands around [[Wotton House]] and the national rail network. Lobbying from the nearby village of [[Brill, Buckinghamshire|Brill]] led to its extension to Brill and conversion to passenger use in early 1872. Two locomotives were bought but trains still travelled at an average speed of {{convert|4|mph|km/h}}.\n\nIn 1883, the Duke of Buckingham planned to upgrade the route to main line standards and extend the line to [[Oxford]], creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite the backing of the wealthy [[Ferdinand de Rothschild]], investors were deterred by costly tunnelling. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling. In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad.\n\nThe existing line had been upgraded in 1894, but the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's [[Metropolitan Railway]] and Brill became one of its two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster. The population of the area remained low, and the primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms. Between 1899 and 1910 other lines were built in the area, providing more direct services to London and the north of England. The Brill Tramway went into financial decline.\n\nIn 1933 the Metropolitan Railway became the [[Metropolitan line]] of [[London Passenger Transport Board|London Transport]]. The Brill Tramway became part of the London Underground, despite Quainton Road being {{convert|40|mi|km}} from London and not underground. London Transport aimed to concentrate on electrification and improvement of passenger services in London and saw little possibility that passenger routes in Buckinghamshire could become viable. In 1935 the Brill Tramway closed. The infrastructure was dismantled and sold. Little trace remains other than the former [[junction station]] at [[Quainton Road railway station|Quainton Road]], now the [[Buckinghamshire Railway Centre]].\n[[File:Brill tramway system diagram.png|right|thumb|upright=1.8|The full extent of the Brill Tramway system.

The [[chalybeate spring]]s of [[Dorton Spa]] outside Brill were known for supposed healing powers,{{sfn|Sheahan|1862|p=376}} and a resort had been built around the Spa in the 1830s,{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=111}} featuring a modern pump house and eight baths, set in {{convert|12|acre}} of parkland.{{sfn|Sheahan|1862|p=377}} Despite the redevelopment and the building of modern hotels in Brill, Dorton Spa was unfashionable and by the late 19th century was little used.{{sfn|Sheahan|1862|p=377}} Jones and the Spa's owners hoped Queen Victoria would visit during her 1890 stay at Waddesdon Manor and thus boost Brill as a spa town. Although such a visit was arranged, Victoria changed her mind and visited the spa at [[Cheltenham]] instead.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}} The spa traffic never materialised.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}}\n\n===Waddesdon Manor===\n[[File:WaddesdonManor.JPG|right|thumb|The Tramway was heavily used during the construction of Waddesdon Manor.|alt=large two-storey brick building with a number of large pointed turrets on the roof]]\nIn 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild began work on Waddesdon Manor, a short distance south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road).{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into the hill to provide access to the construction site.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} Transport of materials was by horse, but the contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and [[Westcott railway station|Westcott]] stations and ran south to the foot of Lodge Hill. From there a [[cable tram]] ran on [[narrow gauge]] rails up the hill to a [[gully]] close to the building site.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}{{refn|The gully remains, but no other trace of the branch to Waddesdon Manor has survived.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}|group=note}} Materials were hauled along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch.{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=78}} The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, and from then on materials were hauled along the branch by horses.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}\n\nThe building of Waddesdon Manor generated huge business for the Tramway. Large numbers of bricks from Poore's Brickworks at Brill were shipped. By July 1877 the entire output of the brickworks was going to supply the Waddesdon Manor works, with 25,000 bricks a week being used.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} Additional bricks were also shipped via Quainton Road, {{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} along with 7,000&nbsp;tons (7,100&nbsp;t) of [[Bath Stone]] from [[Corsham]].{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=78}} The manor also required power and in 1883 a [[gasworks]] was built to the west. A siding from Westcott station ran south to the gasworks, to carry coal.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} Waddesdon Manor chose not to use the Tramway for supplying coal to the gasworks and the siding was abandoned in 1886.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}\n\nWaddesdon Manor was complete in 1889, 13 years after construction began. The Winchendon Branch closed and the track was removed.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} The gasworks remained operational, although supplied by road, until its closure during the coal shortage of 1916. It was demolished shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}} The track of the disused siding remained until at least 1916.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=29}}\n\n===Brill Brick and Tile Works===\nAlthough Poore's Brickworks was well established, Jones believed there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=49}} Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10&nbsp;million bricks a year.{{sfn|Melton|1984|pp=49\u201350}} It was decided that 5&nbsp;million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=50}} Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.{{sfn|Melton|1984|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nFew records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, as it came to be called, but it was operational by 1895.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}}{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=21}} Jones (1974) says the siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=6}} This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}} The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=51}}\n\nBrill Brick and Tile Works could not compete with the larger and better-connected brickworks at [[Calvert, Buckinghamshire|Calvert]] and declined.{{sfn|Simpson|2005|p=111}}{{refn|In 1899 the [[Great Central Railway]] mainline from London to Manchester was built, running directly past the brickworks at Calvert.

The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=19}} Relations deteriorated between Jones and J.&nbsp;G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A&B. The A&B's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road.{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=37}} Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence.{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=37}}\n\nJones sought legal advice and was told that the Duke would probably win a legal action against the A&BR. The A&BR was in such a precarious financial position that any successful legal action against them would likely have forced the line through Quainton Road to close, severing the Tramway's connection with the national network altogether.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=33}} Meanwhile, local dairy farmers began to switch to beef and butter, causing a drop in milk transport.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=33}} From its peak of 20,994&nbsp;tons carried in 1877, goods traffic fell in each of the next four years, dropping to 9,139&nbsp;tons (9,286&nbsp;t) in 1881.{{sfn|Melton|1984|p=30}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=26em|salign=right|quote=Once the train had stopped {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} short of the station, and looking out after a long wait I saw the engine far away.

According to a 1930 [[Federal Radio Commission]] listing, the station had a power of 100 watts and was licensed to the \"A. J. Kirby Music Company\".  Sometime in the 1930s the station's city of license was changed to Charlotte and the call sign was changed to WSOC, supposedly meaning \"We Serve Our City\".  The 1941 [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] (NARBA) mandated a change in frequency to 1240&nbsp;kHz.

As its last gasp, WIST tried Top 40 again in the early 1980s before signing off the air.\n\n===Switch to religious format===\nIn 1983, The station was purchased by George H. Buck, who at that time owned WHVN, which operated daytime-only at 1310&nbsp;kHz.  Originally, 1310 had been WKTC, Charlotte's first country station, before adopting a Christian format in 1971.  WHVN moved to the 1240 frequency, and sold its old frequency to Dick Tomlinson.

By this time the partnership between Munn and Consolidated Theaters was coming unraveled, and the theater company bought Munn out of the arrangement.\n\nIn the early 1980s, WIST gave country music its last serious attempt on the AM dial in Charlotte, becoming \"The Bright Spot.\"  The format was innovative, but most country listeners had switched to WSOC-FM and the format did not succeed.  As its last gasp, WIST tried Top 40 again in the early 1980s before signing off the air.\n\n===Switch to religious format===\nIn 1983, The station was purchased by George H. Buck, who at that time owned WHVN, which operated daytime-only at 1310&nbsp;kHz.  Originally, 1310 had been WKTC, Charlotte's first country station, before adopting a Christian format in 1971.  WHVN moved to the 1240 frequency, and sold its old frequency to Dick Tomlinson.  Tomlinson began [[WGSP (AM)|WGSP]] on 1310, which exists today as a [[Regional Mexican]] format.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nFor most of the years between 1996 and 2008, [[WAVO]] in [[Rock Hill, South Carolina]] simulcast WHVN.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Price |title=Christian Radio Tries to Offer Variety |work=The Charlotte Observer |date=1996-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Washburn |title=WAVO Moves to the Sounds of Sinatra, Ella |work=The Charlotte Observer |date=2008-07-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, WHVN's owner bought [[WCGC]] in [[Belmont, North Carolina|Belmont]].<ref>Audrey Y.

Klyosov''' (born 20 November 1946 in [[Chernyakhovsk]], [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of [[Russian SFSR]])<ref name=mgu/> is a scientist who worked in the fields of physical chemistry, enzyme catalysis, and industrial biochemistry. In 1989 Klyosov immigrated to the US.
