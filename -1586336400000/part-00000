It is beside the [[A638 road|A638 Doncaster Road]], approximately one mile south of Wakefield city centre.\n\n==History==\n=== Early years===\nWakefield Trinity originally played on Heath Common. In 1875/76 they moved to a ground near the Borough Market (near the current Trinity shopping centre.) They returned to the Belle Vue area of Wakefield played on a ground behind the Alexandra Hotel near Elm Street. This is on the opposite side of the road from the present ground.\n\n'''It is remains unconfirmed when Wakefield Trinity moved to the present ground.  The confusion appears to come from the fact that Belle Vue is both an area of Wakefield and the name of the ground and people can confuse a mention of one for another.'''\n\nReverend Marshall in \"Football - the Rugby Union Game\" (first published 1892) wrote, \"the club migrated to Belle Vue on the opposite side of the road to the present field, and where the first cup ties were played. In the following year a move was made to the present field.\"\n\nThe Cup referred to is the Yorkshire Cup which was first played during the 1877/78 season. Wakefield Trinity's first Yorkshire Cup game was played on 8 December 1877 during the 1877/78 season. If Trinity played the \"first cup ties\" on the Elm Street ground in 1877, the \"following year\" would have been 1878.\n\nHowever, in, \"The Grounds of Rugby League\" by Trevor R. Delaney <ref>The Grounds of Rugby League, {{ISBN|0950998222}}</ref> gives the opening of the present ground as Easter Monday, 14 April 1879. This is based on the evidence of former Wakefield Trinity treasurer Ernest Parker, who remembered that Trinity debuted their new (and now traditional) colours of blue and red on the same day and he was present at the match (He would have been approx. 10 years old).  There is no mention of the ground move in the local newspapers and Parker's recollection was many years later.\n\nD.W Armitage writing in J.C Lindley's \"100 years of Rugby - the history of Wakefield Trinity 1873-1973\" <ref name=\"ReferenceA\">100 years of Rugby - the history of Wakefield Trinity 1873-1973</ref> said \"From minutes of the committee it is evident that by the time the club was about ten years old [this would have been around 1883] the field on which Trinity still play had been occupied and was looked upon as the permanent home.\"\n\nIn J.C Lindley's \"100 years of Rugby - the history of Wakefield Trinity 1873-1973\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> states \"Their move to the arena which still forms their home did not come until late in 1892. In December of that year the club agreed to lease a field adjacent to the St Catherine's School and there they made their headquarters which have remained so throughout the rest of their history.\"\n\nLindley goes onto explain, \"But that move of playing area, obviously caused by their inability to continue the lease on two grounds on which they had progressed, bought severe problems. Here was a \"field\" - an area of grass which needed fencing and developing, in direct contrast to their previous home, enclosed with two stands, on which athletics, cycling, and lacrosse as well as rugby football, were given adequate facilities. In 1892 a completely fresh start had to be made, and until such developments, athletics (including the popular annual sports) had to be staged on Wakefield Cricket club's ground.\"\n\nIn 1892 newspaper reports <ref>Athletics News and Cyclist Journal 10/10/1892</ref> that Trinity may \"have to quit their present ground at Belle Vue at Belle Vue as it is required for building purposes.\" Delaney comments \"Fortunately, the only development was the building of St Catherine's Road which stopped at the present turnstiles.\"  This however may be incorrect and the reference to the \"present ground\" was actually a reference to the Elm Street ground and the redevelopment was a reference to the building of houses on Elm Street. \nLindley explains that in January 1895 \"some three years after taking the lease for this Belle Vue field\", the club planned ground developments and to finance these, a Limited liability company \"Wakefield Trinity Athletic Company Limited\", controlled by but separate from the rugby club, was formed to both by out the lease and raise finance to develop the ground. \nOn 24 September 1898 Lord Milton, Wakefield's MP official opened the re-constituted ground, which now included a cycle track around the perimeter of the rugby field, with a game between Wakefield Trinity and Halifax.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Finals played at the ground===\nBelle Vue was the venue of the [[1922\u201323 Northern Rugby Football League season|1922\u201323]] [[Challenge Cup]] final, in which [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] beat [[Hull F.C.]] 28\u20133 in front of a crowd of 29,335, the only occasion that Belle Vue was the venue for the Challenge Cup final.\n\nThe [[1937\u201338 Northern Rugby Football League season|1937\u201338]] [[Rugby Football League Championship]] Final was due to have taken place at Belle Vue, but as both finalists [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] were from [[Leeds]], the authorities switched the match to [[Elland Road]].<ref name=\"Club History, Facts and Figures \">{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/leeds-rhinos/club_history_facts_and_figures_1_2274590|title=Club History, Facts and Figures |work=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=31 December 2010|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1960-1995===\nScenes from ''[[This Sporting Life]]'' were filmed at the Belle Vue Stadium during Wakefield Trinity's third round Challenge Cup match against Wigan in 1962. In 1967, floodlights were erected for the first time, allowing games to be held on an evening.\n\nin 1986 the old wooden West Stand that had stood their since the construction of the ground in 1895 was dempolished. It was however never fully replaced and now houses the TV gantry.\n\nIn 1992 the old floodlights that were installed in 1967 were upgraded. New changing rooms were also added for the 1984/85 season in the South-East corner of the ground\n\n===1996-2009: Summer rugby===\nWith [[Super League]] being founded in 1996, [[Wakefield Trinity]], who then played in the Second Division, released plans for hospitality suites to be built at the South End of the ground to meet with Super League regulations. In the early 2000s a four-storey building was completed.\n\nThe capacity of the stadium was increased to 12,600 in 2008, to help with the application for a 2009 Super League licence, which was granted in July 2008. A roof was subsequently erected over the North Stand and a smaller roof was constructed in the South-West corner of the ground.\n\n===2010\u2013present: Redevelopment===\n[[Wakefield Trinity]] have long been in negotiation with the local council to find an alternative site, as the present Belle Vue stadium does not comply with the proposed standards required by the Super League. However, there have been difficulties in agreeing with the council on a suitable alternative site.\n\nOriginally plans for a [[Newmarket Stadium|12,000 seater stadium]] in Stanley were unveiled on 17 April 2009, with the development proposed by Yorkcourt Properties and a community trust, chaired by former [[Rugby Football League]] chairman Sir Rodney Walker.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/wakefield/8003727.stm |work=BBC Sport |title= Wakefield announce stadium plans|accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref> However the club, community trust and [[Wakefield Council]] could never find enough money to start the project.\n\nIn 2016, Belle Vue was purchased by 88m Group, who chairman wanted to redevelop the stadium. The following year, plans were released for a new 12,000 capacity stadium to be built on the current site of Belle Vue with the view for it to be completed by 2020.\n\n==Layout==\n===North Stand===\n[[File:Wakefield Football Club Doncaster Rd covered spion kop.jpg|thumb|right]]\n'''Capacity: ? (standing)'''<br>\nThe North Stand is the kop end of the ground. It is terraced and has bars at the top of the stand and in the North-East corner. Originally uncovered a roof was erected in 2012 to meet minimum requirements for Super League.\n\n===East Stand===\n[[File:Wakefield Football Club east stand and terrace.jpg|thumb|right]]\n'''Capacity: 5,333 (seating)'''<br>\nThe East stand is seen as the 'main' stand. it is the only part of the ground with covered seating which holds home fans and the media. At the front of the stand is a small amount of uncovered terracing.\n\n===Trinity Street End===\n[[File:Wakefield Trinity Wildcats hospitality suites (geograph 5814488).jpg|thumb|right]]\n'''Capacity: ? (standing)'''<br>\nThe Trinity Street End (Benidorm end) is situated at the South side of the ground. Originally it had been terracing but in the early 2000s Wakefield needed more and updated hospitality facilities so built a four-storey building similar to the South Bank at Bradford's [[Odsal Stadium]]. The South East corner houses the changing rooms, club shop and reception.\n\n===Arthur Street Side===\n[[File:WAKEFIELD FC ARTHUR STREET.jpg|thumb|right]]\n'''Capacity: ? (standing)'''<br>\nThe West side of the ground, known as the Arthur Street side, is mostly uncovered terracing. It houses TV gantry and dugouts. The stand mostly holds away fans and has a bar and big screen in the North-West corner.\n\n==Sponsors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Years!!Sponsor!!Name\n|-\n|2005||Atlantic Solutions||'''Atlantic Solutions Stadium'''\n|-\n|2009-2010||Hearwell||'''Hearwell Stadium'''\n|-\n|2011-2014||Rapid Solicitors||'''Rapid Solicitors Stadium'''\n|-\n|2017||Beaumont Legal||'''Beaumont Legal Stadium'''\n|-\n|2018-2019||Mobile Rocket||'''Mobile Rocket Stadium'''\n|}\n\n==Usage==\n===Rugby ===\nThe ground is primarily used for Rugby. It was originally a rugby union venue before the schism of 1895, although the occasional rugby union has been played on the ground after 1895. For example, in January 1899 it hosted the Yorkshire v Australia game.\n\nBelle Vue was the venue of the [[1922\u201323 Northern Rugby Football League season|1922\u201323]] [[Challenge Cup]] final, in which [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] beat [[Hull F.C.]] 28\u20133 in front of a crowd of 29,335, the only occasion that Belle Vue was the venue for the Challenge Cup final.\n\nThe [[1937\u201338 Northern Rugby Football League season|1937\u201338]] [[Rugby Football League Championship]] Final was due to have taken place at Belle Vue, but as both finalists [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] were from [[Leeds]], the authorities switched the match to [[Elland Road]].<ref name=\"Club History, Facts and Figures \"/>\n\nOn Saturday 16 September 2006 the stadium played host to the 'Battle of Belle Vue' when 11,000 fans from [[Wakefield Trinity]] and [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford]] watched the match which would decide who was relegated from [[Super League]]. Wakefield Trinity won the match 29\u201317 sending their nearest rivals Castleford down to the National League.\n\n[[Sheffield Eagles]] made Belle Vue their temporary home in 2017 after they were forced out of their home ground [[Don Valley Stadium]] two years earlier. The previous season they had played at Doncasters [[Keepmoat Stadium]].\n\n===Football===\nAfter [[Wakefield F.C.|Emley A.F.C.]] were relocated to Wakefield in 2000, they chose to play their home games at Belle Vue as it was the only sporting venue in the city big enough to accommodate them and the facilities were much better than their ground in Emley. The club's name changed three times after they moved to Wakefield, from Emley AFC to Wakefield & Emley FC to Wakefield-Emley and then just to Wakefield FC. They remained at Belle Vue until 2006 when they moved out to play at College Grove.\n\nAfter five years away the club returned to Belle Vue in 2012 but their return was short lived as they were wound up in 2014 after a move back to Emley failed and the club resigned from the Northern Counties League.\n\nLeeds United reserves also played at the ground <ref>https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/reserves-set-for-a-south-leeds-switch-1-2102246</ref>\n\n===Other sports===\nAfter the redevelopment of the late 1890s the venue included a cycling track.\n\nLacrosse has also been played at the ground.\n\n==International fixtures==\n===Rugby League Test matches===\nThe list of international rugby league matches played at Belle Vue is.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/venues/belle-vue/results.html Belle Vue at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!

Here was a \"field\" - an area of grass which needed fencing and developing, in direct contrast to their previous home, enclosed with two stands, on which athletics, cycling, and lacrosse as well as rugby football, were given adequate facilities. In 1892 a completely fresh start had to be made, and until such developments, athletics (including the popular annual sports) had to be staged on Wakefield Cricket club's ground.\"\n\nIn 1892 newspaper reports <ref>Athletics News and Cyclist Journal 10/10/1892</ref> that Trinity may \"have to quit their present ground at Belle Vue at Belle Vue as it is required for building purposes.\" Delaney comments \"Fortunately, the only development was the building of St Catherine's Road which stopped at the present turnstiles.\"  This however may be incorrect and the reference to the \"present ground\" was actually a reference to the Elm Street ground and the redevelopment was a reference to the building of houses on Elm Street. \nLindley explains that in January 1895 \"some three years after taking the lease for this Belle Vue field\", the club planned ground developments and to finance these, a Limited liability company \"Wakefield Trinity Athletic Company Limited\", controlled by but separate from the rugby club, was formed to both by out the lease and raise finance to develop the ground. \nOn 24 September 1898 Lord Milton, Wakefield's MP official opened the re-constituted ground, which now included a cycle track around the perimeter of the rugby field, with a game between Wakefield Trinity and Halifax.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Finals played at the ground===\nBelle Vue was the venue of the [[1922\u201323 Northern Rugby Football League season|1922\u201323]] [[Challenge Cup]] final, in which [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] beat [[Hull F.C.]] 28\u20133 in front of a crowd of 29,335, the only occasion that Belle Vue was the venue for the Challenge Cup final.\n\nThe [[1937\u201338 Northern Rugby Football League season|1937\u201338]] [[Rugby Football League Championship]] Final was due to have taken place at Belle Vue, but as both finalists [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] were from [[Leeds]], the authorities switched the match to [[Elland Road]].<ref name=\"Club History, Facts and Figures \">{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/leeds-rhinos/club_history_facts_and_figures_1_2274590|title=Club History, Facts and Figures |work=Yorkshire Evening Post|date=31 December 2010|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1960-1995===\nScenes from ''[[This Sporting Life]]'' were filmed at the Belle Vue Stadium during Wakefield Trinity's third round Challenge Cup match against Wigan in 1962. In 1967, floodlights were erected for the first time, allowing games to be held on an evening.\n\nin 1986 the old wooden West Stand that had stood their since the construction of the ground in 1895 was dempolished. It was however never fully replaced and now houses the TV gantry.\n\nIn 1992 the old floodlights that were installed in 1967 were upgraded. New changing rooms were also added for the 1984/85 season in the South-East corner of the ground\n\n===1996-2009: Summer rugby===\nWith [[Super League]] being founded in 1996, [[Wakefield Trinity]], who then played in the Second Division, released plans for hospitality suites to be built at the South End of the ground to meet with Super League regulations. In the early 2000s a four-storey building was completed.\n\nThe capacity of the stadium was increased to 12,600 in 2008, to help with the application for a 2009 Super League licence, which was granted in July 2008. A roof was subsequently erected over the North Stand and a smaller roof was constructed in the South-West corner of the ground.\n\n===2010\u2013present: Redevelopment===\n[[Wakefield Trinity]] have long been in negotiation with the local council to find an alternative site, as the present Belle Vue stadium does not comply with the proposed standards required by the Super League. However, there have been difficulties in agreeing with the council on a suitable alternative site.\n\nOriginally plans for a [[Newmarket Stadium|12,000 seater stadium]] in Stanley were unveiled on 17 April 2009, with the development proposed by Yorkcourt Properties and a community trust, chaired by former [[Rugby Football League]] chairman Sir Rodney Walker.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/wakefield/8003727.stm |work=BBC Sport |title= Wakefield announce stadium plans|accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref> However the club, community trust and [[Wakefield Council]] could never find enough money to start the project.\n\nIn 2016, Belle Vue was purchased by 88m Group, who chairman wanted to redevelop the stadium. The following year, plans were released for a new 12,000 capacity stadium to be built on the current site of Belle Vue with the view for it to be completed by 2020.\n\n==Layout==\n===North Stand===\n[[File:Wakefield Football Club Doncaster Rd covered spion kop.jpg|thumb|right]]\n{{Short description|<br>}}\n'''Capacity: ? (standing)'''<br>\nThe North Stand is the kop end of the ground. It is terraced and has bars at the top of the stand and in the North-East corner. Originally uncovered a roof was erected in 2012 to meet minimum requirements for Super League.\n\n===East Stand===\n[[File:Wakefield Football Club east stand and terrace.jpg|thumb|right]]\n{{Short description|<br>}}\n'''Capacity: 5,333 (seating)'''<br>\nThe East stand is seen as the 'main' stand. it is the only part of the ground with covered seating which holds home fans and the media.

(standing)'''<br>\nThe Trinity Street End (Benidorm end) is situated at the South side of the ground. Originally it had been terracing but in the early 2000s Wakefield needed more and updated hospitality facilities so built a four-storey building similar to the South Bank at Bradford's [[Odsal Stadium]]. The South East corner houses the changing rooms, club shop and reception.\n\n===Arthur Street Side===\n[[File:WAKEFIELD FC ARTHUR STREET.jpg|thumb|right]]\n{{Short description|<br>}}\n'''Capacity: ? (standing)'''<br>\nThe West side of the ground, known as the Arthur Street side, is mostly uncovered terracing. It houses TV gantry and dugouts.

It was originally a rugby union venue before the schism of 1895, although the occasional rugby union has been played on the ground after 1895. For example, in January 1899 it hosted the Yorkshire v Australia game.\n\nBelle Vue was the venue of the [[1922\u201323 Northern Rugby Football League season|1922\u201323]] [[Challenge Cup]] final, in which [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] beat [[Hull F.C.]] 28\u20133 in front of a crowd of 29,335, the only occasion that Belle Vue was the venue for the Challenge Cup final.\n\nThe [[1937\u201338 Northern Rugby Football League season|1937\u201338]] [[Rugby Football League Championship]] Final was due to have taken place at Belle Vue, but as both finalists [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] were from [[Leeds]], the authorities switched the match to [[Elland Road]].<ref name=\"Club History, Facts and Figures \"/>\n\nOn Saturday 16 September 2006 the stadium played host to the 'Battle of Belle Vue' when 11,000 fans from [[Wakefield Trinity]] and [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford]] watched the match which would decide who was relegated from [[Super League]]. Wakefield Trinity won the match 29\u201317 sending their nearest rivals Castleford down to the National League.\n\n[[Sheffield Eagles]] made Belle Vue their temporary home in 2017 after they were forced out of their home ground [[Don Valley Stadium]] two years earlier. The previous season they had played at Doncasters [[Keepmoat Stadium]].\n\n===Football===\nAfter [[Wakefield F.C.|Emley A.F.C.]] were relocated to Wakefield in 2000, they chose to play their home games at Belle Vue as it was the only sporting venue in the city big enough to accommodate them and the facilities were much better than their ground in Emley. The club's name changed three times after they moved to Wakefield, from Emley AFC to Wakefield & Emley FC to Wakefield-Emley and then just to Wakefield FC. They remained at Belle Vue until 2006 when they moved out to play at College Grove.\n\nAfter five years away the club returned to Belle Vue in 2012 but their return was short lived as they were wound up in 2014 after a move back to Emley failed and the club resigned from the Northern Counties League.\n\nLeeds United reserves also played at the ground <ref>https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/reserves-set-for-a-south-leeds-switch-1-2102246</ref>\n\n===Other sports===\nAfter the redevelopment of the late 1890s the venue included a cycling track.\n\nLacrosse has also been played at the ground.\n\n==International fixtures==\n===Rugby League Test matches===\nThe list of international rugby league matches played at Belle Vue is.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/venues/belle-vue/results.html Belle Vue at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!

Founded in 1984 by French engineers Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy as ''MVS (Manufacture de Voitures de Sport)'', the company's purpose was to compete in the \"[[Grand Tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" market.

Venturi did nonetheless manage to continue in production for nearly sixteen years, declaring bankruptcy in 2000. The same year, Monegasque [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] purchased Venturi, and decided to focus on electric-powered engines. This change of direction led to the limited-production [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]], the first electric sports car in the world. Following the public's enthusiasm for this first electric model, the brand developed 5 other innovative concept cars.\n\nThe first team to commit to the [[Formula E|Formula E World Championship]], Venturi competes under the name of [[Venturi Racing|ROKiT Venturi Racing]] with its drivers [[Felipe Massa]] and [[Edoardo Mortara]].\n\nToday, Venturi is specialised in the development of high performance electric vehicles destined to break records or to operate in extreme conditions. Through its [[Venturi Automobiles#Venturi Global Challenges|Venturi Global Challenges,]] Venturi aims at demonstrating the efficiency and durability of electric vehicles. \n\n== History ==\n\n=== From 1984 to 2000 ===\n[[Image:Venturi 300 Atlantique 3.4 front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venturi Atlantique|Venturi 300 Atlantique]]]]\nThe first Venturi came out in 1984, created by Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy, two former engineers at [[Heuliez]]. The goal was to present the only \"[[grand tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" French car capable of competing with the English [[Aston Martin]], the Italian [[Ferrari]], and the German [[Porsche]]. The first car shown had a [[Volkswagen Golf]] GTi engine and the name was originally spelled \"Ventury\", with a \"y\" at the end. In 1985, the car was shown with a {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Peugeot 505]] Turbo engine, but by the 1986 [[Paris Motor Show]] it had reached its definitive form with the [[PRV engine|PRV V6]] engine. Production began in 1987, with five cars built in the first year with production increasing in the subsequent years. The headquarters of the company was located in [[Cou\u00ebron]], [[Pays de Loire]], where almost 750 cars were produced in the forthcoming 20 years.\n\n[[File:Venturi 260 LM, \u00be front.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 260 LM]]\nFrom 1987 to the mid-1990s, they built mid-engined [[coup\u00e9s]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]] with [[turbocharged]] [[PRV engine]]s and [[Renault]] [[gearboxes]]. Engine power ranged from {{convert|200|to|260|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the then offered MVS Venturi Coup\u00e9 and Transcup series. The naturally aspirated Venturi 160 used the catalyzed 2849&nbsp;cc version of the PRV V6; this was meant to be sold in Japan and was therefore also available with an automatic transmsission. Only a handful were built. There was also the {{convert|185|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} Venturi 180, mainly developed for Italy, which used the turbocharged 1995-cc inline-four [[Douvrin engine]] from the [[Renault 21#Turbo|Renault 21 Turbo]].\n\nVenturi was also briefly involved with the [[Larrousse]] [[Formula One]] team. The team's 1992 car, which bore the Venturi name, was designed and built by Venturi Larousse UK, a British company formerly known as Fomet 1, which had previously designed the 1991 [[Fondmetal]] Formula One cars.<ref>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Autocourse: the World's Leading Grand Prix Annual 1992-93 | publisher = Motorbooks Intl | page=83 | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-905138-96-1 }}</ref>\n[[File:Venturi 400GT S\u00e9rie 2 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi 400 GT rear view]]\n[[File:Venturi_400_GT_Red.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 400 GT]]\nThe Venturi 400 GT remains one of the highest performing French cars ever produced, and it is in fact the very first car in the world to have standard carbon brakes.<ref name=collector04>{{cite web | url = http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/400gt.php | title = Guide d'achat: Venturi 400-GT | trans-title = Buyers' Guide | publisher = l'Automobile Sportive | first = Nicolas | last = Liszewski | language = French | date = 2004-12-23 |accessdate = 7 March 2018}}</ref> True to that claim, the Atlantique 400 GT with a {{cvt|2975|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve#Four-valve cylinder head|4 valve]]s per cylinder [[twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine]] rated at {{convert|300|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] with a [[compression ratio]] of 7.3:1, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1995-venturi-400gt/|website=supercars.net|title=1995 Venturi 400GT|editor=NIck D|date=December 20, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> delivered excellent performance to put it on par with Ferraris of the early 90s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The 400 GT could hit {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and {{convert|291|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed, while the [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300 Biturbo|Atlantique 300 Biturbo]] with a {{convert|310|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 could accelerate from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and could reach a top speed of {{convert|275|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/atlantique300.php|website=automobile-sportive.com|title=VENTURI ATLANTIQUE-300 (1996 - 2000)|editor=S\u00e9bastien Dupuis|language=fr-fr|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venturi Transcup 210.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi Transcup 210]]\nA limited-edition 400 GTR was built to satisfy the [[homologation]] requirements to compete [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. High-level competition has also brought fame to the brand. St\u00e9phane Ratel, who would later found the [[FIA GT Championship]], was at the origin of the Venturi Gentlemen Drivers Trophy, which gathered an impressive array of 75 drivers. Venturi has also won fame through its brilliant performances in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], particularly in 1993 with [[Christophe Dechavanne]] and [[Jacques Laffite]] on Venturi Jaccadi team, and in 1995 with [[Paul Belmondo]] racing on the 600 SLM.\n\nHowever, it was in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] races that Venturi established its pedigree defeating Porsche and Ferrari on several occasions. In 1994 in [[Dijon-Prenois]], with Fert\u00e9 and Neugarten on the 600 LM Jaccadi, at the 1000&nbsp;km of Paris with [[Henri Pescarolo]] and Jean-Claude Basso on the 600 LM, and finally at the 4 Hours Spa race, once again with Michel Fert\u00e9 and Michel Neugarten.\n\n=== From 2000 to the present day ===\n\n[[Image:Stand Venturi Mondial 2006.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Venturi F\u00e9tish]] at the 2006 [[Paris Motor Show]]]]\n\nIn 2000, the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] millionaire [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] bought Venturi and decided to focus on electric-powered engines,<ref>https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/made-in-monaco/made-in-monaco-venturi-automobiles-experts-in-the-most-advanced-technologies/</ref> leading to the [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]] model. More recent models are the [[Venturi Eclectic|Eclectic]], the world's first energy-autonomous vehicle, a low speed vehicle that has solar panels and a built-in wind charger and can be plugged in; and the [[Venturi Astrolab|Astrolab]], the world's first solar-electric hybrid car. There have been approximately 60-65 orders for the F\u00e9tish, but only about 30 have been delivered as of 2011.\n\nIn December 2009, Venturi announced its acquisition of French motorcycle manufacturer [[Voxan]]. The acquisition would effectively allow Venturi to enter the motorcycle market. In August 2011, Venturi announced the creation of Venturi North America, based in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Venturi North America was primarily created as a research and development center, and as such, maintains a close working relationship with the Center for Automotive Research.\n\n<br />\n\n== Venturi Global Challenges ==\nVenturi has launched a series of technological and human challenges aimed at demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of electric vehicles in extreme conditions. With its Global Challenges, the manufacturer is testing the technologies it develops in extraordinary conditions: excessive speeds, extreme weather conditions, difficult terrain in the most remote regions of the planet...

Founded in 1984 by French engineers Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy as ''MVS (Manufacture de Voitures de Sport)'', the company's purpose was to compete in the \"[[Grand Tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" market. This was only the most recent post-war attempt at building a sporty luxury car in France, following in the footsteps of [[Facel Vega]], [[Monica (automobile)|Monica]], and [[Ligier]].<ref name=\"Retroviseur302\">{{cite journal | journal = R\u00e9troviseur | title = Requiem pour un nom | trans-title = Requiem for a name | language = French | last = Decker | first = Jean-Paul | page = 70 | ref = XCrv |date= July 2014 | number = 302 | publisher = \u00c9ditions LVA | location = Fontainebleu, France | issn = 0992-5007 }}</ref> As with its predecessors, Venturi was immediately faced with many challenges ranging from an unknown name to its under-capitalized and under-staffed state. Venturi did nonetheless manage to continue in production for nearly sixteen years, declaring bankruptcy in 2000. The same year, Monegasque [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] purchased Venturi, and decided to focus on electric-powered engines. This change of direction led to the limited-production [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]], the first electric sports car in the world. Following the public's enthusiasm for this first electric model, the brand developed 5 other innovative concept cars.\n\nThe first team to commit to the [[Formula E|Formula E World Championship]], Venturi competes under the name of [[Venturi Racing|ROKiT Venturi Racing]] with its drivers [[Felipe Massa]] and [[Edoardo Mortara]].\n\nToday, Venturi is specialised in the development of high performance electric vehicles destined to break records or to operate in extreme conditions. Through its [[Venturi Automobiles#Venturi Global Challenges|Venturi Global Challenges,]] Venturi aims at demonstrating the efficiency and durability of electric vehicles. \n\n== History ==\n\n=== From 1984 to 2000 ===\n[[Image:Venturi 300 Atlantique 3.4 front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venturi Atlantique|Venturi 300 Atlantique]]]]\nThe first Venturi came out in 1984, created by Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy, two former engineers at [[Heuliez]]. The goal was to present the only \"[[grand tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" French car capable of competing with the English [[Aston Martin]], the Italian [[Ferrari]], and the German [[Porsche]]. The first car shown had a [[Volkswagen Golf]] GTi engine and the name was originally spelled \"Ventury\", with a \"y\" at the end. In 1985, the car was shown with a {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Peugeot 505]] Turbo engine, but by the 1986 [[Paris Motor Show]] it had reached its definitive form with the [[PRV engine|PRV V6]] engine. Production began in 1987, with five cars built in the first year with production increasing in the subsequent years. The headquarters of the company was located in [[Cou\u00ebron]], [[Pays de Loire]], where almost 750 cars were produced in the forthcoming 20 years.\n\n[[File:Venturi 260 LM, \u00be front.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 260 LM]]\nFrom 1987 to the mid-1990s, they built mid-engined [[coup\u00e9s]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]] with [[turbocharged]] [[PRV engine]]s and [[Renault]] [[gearboxes]]. Engine power ranged from {{convert|200|to|260|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the then offered MVS Venturi Coup\u00e9 and Transcup series. The naturally aspirated Venturi 160 used the catalyzed 2849&nbsp;cc version of the PRV V6; this was meant to be sold in Japan and was therefore also available with an automatic transmsission. Only a handful were built. There was also the {{convert|185|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} Venturi 180, mainly developed for Italy, which used the turbocharged 1995-cc inline-four [[Douvrin engine]] from the [[Renault 21#Turbo|Renault 21 Turbo]].\n\nVenturi was also briefly involved with the [[Larrousse]] [[Formula One]] team. The team's 1992 car, which bore the Venturi name, was designed and built by Venturi Larousse UK, a British company formerly known as Fomet 1, which had previously designed the 1991 [[Fondmetal]] Formula One cars.<ref>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Autocourse: the World's Leading Grand Prix Annual 1992-93 | publisher = Motorbooks Intl | page=83 | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-905138-96-1 }}</ref>\n[[File:Venturi 400GT S\u00e9rie 2 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi 400 GT rear view]]\n[[File:Venturi_400_GT_Red.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 400 GT]]\nThe Venturi 400 GT remains one of the highest performing French cars ever produced, and it is in fact the very first car in the world to have standard carbon brakes.<ref name=collector04>{{cite web | url = http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/400gt.php | title = Guide d'achat: Venturi 400-GT | trans-title = Buyers' Guide | publisher = l'Automobile Sportive | first = Nicolas | last = Liszewski | language = French | date = 2004-12-23 |accessdate = 7 March 2018}}</ref> True to that claim, the Atlantique 400 GT with a {{cvt|2975|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve#Four-valve cylinder head|4 valve]]s per cylinder [[twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine]] rated at {{convert|300|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] with a [[compression ratio]] of 7.3:1, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1995-venturi-400gt/|website=supercars.net|title=1995 Venturi 400GT|editor=NIck D|date=December 20, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> delivered excellent performance to put it on par with Ferraris of the early 90s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The 400 GT could hit {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and {{convert|291|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed, while the [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300 Biturbo|Atlantique 300 Biturbo]] with a {{convert|310|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 could accelerate from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and could reach a top speed of {{convert|275|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/atlantique300.php|website=automobile-sportive.com|title=VENTURI ATLANTIQUE-300 (1996 - 2000)|editor=S\u00e9bastien Dupuis|language=fr-fr|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venturi Transcup 210.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi Transcup 210]]\nA limited-edition 400 GTR was built to satisfy the [[homologation]] requirements to compete [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. High-level competition has also brought fame to the brand. St\u00e9phane Ratel, who would later found the [[FIA GT Championship]], was at the origin of the Venturi Gentlemen Drivers Trophy, which gathered an impressive array of 75 drivers. Venturi has also won fame through its brilliant performances in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], particularly in 1993 with [[Christophe Dechavanne]] and [[Jacques Laffite]] on Venturi Jaccadi team, and in 1995 with [[Paul Belmondo]] racing on the 600 SLM.\n\nHowever, it was in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] races that Venturi established its pedigree defeating Porsche and Ferrari on several occasions. In 1994 in [[Dijon-Prenois]], with Fert\u00e9 and Neugarten on the 600 LM Jaccadi, at the 1000&nbsp;km of Paris with [[Henri Pescarolo]] and Jean-Claude Basso on the 600 LM, and finally at the 4 Hours Spa race, once again with Michel Fert\u00e9 and Michel Neugarten.\n\n=== From 2000 to the present day ===\n\n[[Image:Stand Venturi Mondial 2006.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Venturi F\u00e9tish]] at the 2006 [[Paris Motor Show]]]]\n\nIn 2000, the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] millionaire [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] bought Venturi and decided to focus on electric-powered engines,<ref>https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/made-in-monaco/made-in-monaco-venturi-automobiles-experts-in-the-most-advanced-technologies/</ref> leading to the [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]] model. More recent models are the [[Venturi Eclectic|Eclectic]], the world's first energy-autonomous vehicle, a low speed vehicle that has solar panels and a built-in wind charger and can be plugged in; and the [[Venturi Astrolab|Astrolab]], the world's first solar-electric hybrid car. There have been approximately 60-65 orders for the F\u00e9tish, but only about 30 have been delivered as of 2011.\n\nIn December 2009, Venturi announced its acquisition of French motorcycle manufacturer [[Voxan]]. The acquisition would effectively allow Venturi to enter the motorcycle market. In August 2011, Venturi announced the creation of Venturi North America, based in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Venturi North America was primarily created as a research and development center, and as such, maintains a close working relationship with the Center for Automotive Research.\n\n<br />\n\n== Venturi Global Challenges ==\nVenturi has launched a series of technological and human challenges aimed at demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of electric vehicles in extreme conditions. With its Global Challenges, the manufacturer is testing the technologies it develops in extraordinary conditions: excessive speeds, extreme weather conditions, difficult terrain in the most remote regions of the planet... As part of these challenges, Venturi has obtained several records and world firsts since 2009.\n\n== List of models ==\n\n* [[MVS Venturi]] (includes Coup\u00e9 and Cabriolet versions)\n\n::1987-1990 &ndash; Coup\u00e9 160 automatic, Transcup, Transcup automatic (six built)\n::1987-1990 &ndash; Coup\u00e9 200, Transcup\n::1991 &ndash; Coup\u00e9 210, Transcup\n::1992 &ndash;Coup\u00e8 111 Cup<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amblog.it/2019/12/05/venturi-111-cup-lauto-fantasma/|title=Venturi 111 Cup, l'auto fantasma|last=Andrea|website=AMblog|language=it-IT|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref> (2-liter, four-cylinder export model, mainly for Italy)\n::1989-1996 &ndash; Coup\u00e9 260, Transcup (sold as the MVS 2.80 in 1989)\n::1991 &ndash; 260 Atlantique\n::1994-1996 &ndash; 260 LM\n::Trophy - 73 built for racing, ten later converted for street use by the factory<ref name=collector04/>\n[[File:VenturiConcept1.JPG|thumb|Venturi Eclectic]]\n*1994-1997 &ndash; 400 GT (15 built, 13 series 1 and two series 2)<ref name=collector04/>\n* [[Venturi Atlantique]] (rework of the MVS Venturi)\n::1996-1998 &ndash; [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300|Atlantique 300]]\n::1999-2000 &ndash; [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300 Biturbo|Atlantique 300 Biturbo]]\n::1999 &ndash; [[Venturi Atlantique#Venturi 300 GTR|Venturi 300 GTR]]\n* 500 LM - a limited number (~7) were produced and raced at Le Mans, Jarama and Zolder in 1993\n* 600 LM - further racing cars were produced later in 1993 with the newer engine<ref>[https://www.supercars.net/blog/1993-venturi-600-lm/ 1993 Venturi 600 LM] at supercars.net, accessed 29 March 2018</ref><ref>[https://columnm.com/venturi-lm600-supercar-lemans-country/ Abishek Dwaraknath, 4 July 2017 ''venture lm600 supercar lemans country''] at columnm.com, accessed 29 March 2018</ref>\n* 600 SLM - single example built in 1995, but other cars (originally 600 LM models) have been modified to similar specifications.

For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]] on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach - Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a particular recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of a particular work. This appears to be the case with the two sets by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] conducting the [[Monteverdi Choir]]. They recorded Bach's motets without {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} in 1980, but included it in their 2011 live recording.<ref>[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref>\n\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some historically informed performances of Bach. However, in these works OVPP recordings are rare. An exception is that of [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Thomanerchor]] has recorded the motets as have other choirs with boys voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]]\n\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used,\n\nThe first of the motets to be recorded was [[Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 227|''Jesu meine Freude'']] in 1927.
