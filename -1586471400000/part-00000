The album's lyrics discuss themes of female empowerment, confidence, love and unity. After having few to no writing credits on their previous two studio albums, the group assumed creative control over their third album and co-wrote more than half of its songs. The album features a guest appearance by American rapper [[Gucci Mane]] and collaborations with several notable [[Record producer|producer]]s such as [[Ammo (musician)|Ammo]], who contributed to their 2016 smash hit \"[[Work from Home]]\", along with [[Poo Bear]] and [[Skrillex]].\n\nThe lead single \"[[Down (Fifth Harmony song)|Down]]\", which features rapper Gucci Mane, was released on June 2, 2017, and received gold certification in the United States. The second single \"[[He Like That]]\" was released on digital and streaming platforms on August 25, 2017. As did the band's previous releases, the sound of ''Fifth Harmony'' is characterized primarily as [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and includes influences from other genres, including [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[tropical house]], [[reggae]],  [[dancehall]], [[synthpop]] and [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]]; it was described as \"versatile\". The song \"[[Angel (Fifth Harmony song)|Angel]]\" was released as the first promotional single on August 11, 2017. The group also released a music video for \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Fifth Harmony song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\" on May 18, 2018, as a goodbye note after their hiatus; it also explains a mysterious, untitled photograph Fifth Harmony uploaded on the social media platforms [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]].\n\nSome critics noted a resemblance between ''Fifth Harmony'' and the band's previous album ''[[7/27]]''. ''Fifth Harmony'' debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 46,000 copies in its first week and becoming Fifth Harmony's fourth top-ten entry and third top-five entry. It also debuted inside the top tens of several countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Ireland and the United Kingdom; in Mexico it debuted at number three and in Spain it debuted at number one. ''Fifth Harmony'' is the group's first album following the departure of [[Camila Cabello]], who left the group in December 2016 to pursue a solo career. The album was promoted with the PSA Tour, between September 2017 and May 2018.\n\n==Background and conception==\nIn 2016, [[Fifth Harmony]] released their second studio album, which is titled ''[[7/27]]''.<ref name=Billboard1>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7632422/camila-cabello-fifth-harmony-exit-inside|title=Inside Camila Cabello's Fifth Harmony Exit: Where Did It All Go Wrong?|magazine= Billboard|access-date= August 16, 2017}}</ref> To promote the album, they embarked on [[the 7/27 Tour]].

The album's lyrics discuss themes of female empowerment, confidence, love and unity. After having few to no writing credits on their previous two studio albums, the group assumed creative control over their third album and co-wrote more than half of its songs. The album features a guest appearance by American rapper [[Gucci Mane]] and collaborations with several notable [[Record producer|producer]]s such as [[Ammo (musician)|Ammo]], who contributed to their 2016 smash hit \"[[Work from Home]]\", along with [[Poo Bear]] and [[Skrillex]].\n\nThe lead single \"[[Down (Fifth Harmony song)|Down]]\", which features rapper Gucci Mane, was released on June 2, 2017, and received gold certification in the United States. The second single \"[[He Like That]]\" was released on digital and streaming platforms on August 25, 2017. As did the band's previous releases, the sound of ''Fifth Harmony'' is characterized primarily as [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and includes influences from other genres, including [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[tropical house]], [[reggae]],  [[dancehall]], [[synthpop]] and [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]]; it was described as \"versatile\". The song \"[[Angel (Fifth Harmony song)|Angel]]\" was released as the first promotional single on August 11, 2017. The group also released a music video for \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Fifth Harmony song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\" on May 18, 2018, as a goodbye note after their hiatus; it also explains a mysterious, untitled photograph Fifth Harmony uploaded on the social media platforms [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]].\n\nSome critics noted a resemblance between ''Fifth Harmony'' and the band's previous album ''[[7/27]]''. ''Fifth Harmony'' debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 46,000 copies in its first week and becoming Fifth Harmony's fourth top-ten entry and third top-five entry. It also debuted inside the top tens of several countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Ireland and the United Kingdom; in Mexico it debuted at number three and in Spain it debuted at number one. ''Fifth Harmony'' is the group's first album following the departure of [[Camila Cabello]], who left the group in December 2016 to pursue a solo career. The album was promoted with the PSA Tour, between September 2017 and May 2018.\n\n==Background and conception==\nIn 2016, [[Fifth Harmony]] released their second studio album, which is titled ''[[7/27]]''.<ref name=Billboard1>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7632422/camila-cabello-fifth-harmony-exit-inside|title=Inside Camila Cabello's Fifth Harmony Exit: Where Did It All Go Wrong?|magazine= Billboard|access-date= August 16, 2017}}</ref> To promote the album, they embarked on [[the 7/27 Tour]].

Following the repercussion of Cabello's departure and speculations about the group's future, the members published another statement saying, \"We have spent the past year and a half (since her initial solo endeavor) trying to communicate to her and her team all of the reasons why we felt Fifth Harmony deserved at least one more album of her time.
