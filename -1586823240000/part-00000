He comes off as cocky and arrogant, but is actually very insecure and craves acceptance. His upgrades have enhanced his [[dental braces|braces]], allowing them to transform into any gadget he can think of, the downside being they stay attached to his teeth the entire time. There also seems to be a mutual attraction between him and Mindy \"The Hyena\". \n*'''Duncan \"Gluestick\" Dewey''' - A chubby [[African-American]] boy who is friendly to most people and is the protagonist of the second book. His main trait is that he loves eating paste, a habit that started after he was dared into drinking a jar of paste in art class. His upgrades have enhanced the paste he loves to eat, enabling him to stick to any surface, and fire glue from his hands. He is shown to love technology, even using it in his family. \n*'''Matilda \"Wheezer\" Choi''' - A spunky Korean-American tomboy with a unibrow who's the protagonist of the third book. She suffers from bronchial asthma and cannot even walk around the block without getting winded; as such, her upgrades are two nano-enhanced inhalers that enable her to fly and blast enemies, along with blowtorches. During the third book she received two other inhalers, one to increase her jumping height while using stealth, the other to allow her to breathe underwater. She is also proficient in fighting, as she loves professional [[wrestling]] and can use anything as a weapon. She has a small crush on her teammate Gluestick. \n*'''Julio \"Flinch\" Escala''' -  A [[hyperactive]] [[Mexican-American]] boy who's the protagonist of the fourth book. Described as a walking ball of energy spiked by the large numbers of sugary items he consumes everyday, his upgrade is a special harness that converts his hyperactive energy into superhuman speed and strength; without the harness he is visibly shaking non-stop. His catchphrase is \"I am mighty!\" and usually following this he is banging his fists on his chest. \n*'''Ruby \"Pufferfish\" Peet''' -  A stubborn but smart [[Jewish]] girl who is the protagonist of the last book. She suffers from a wide variety of allergies; as such her upgrades have enhanced her [[allergies]] to the point where they border on psychic abilities, allowing her to detect danger, dishonesty, etc. She is the current leader of the team.\n\n===Other agents===\n*'''Agent Alexander Brand''' - Known as one of the best secret agents in the world and the leader of the N.E.R.D.S. He has a white cane because of an injury from a mission that left him partially crippled. He often doubts that the team can do the job right and has threatened to disband the team several times, however he is ultimately proud of the team. He had a romantic relationship with his assistant Ms. Holiday. He quit the team by the end of the fourth book after Ms. Holiday was revealed to be a spy, but was subsequently reinstated by Pufferfish during the climax of the fifth book.\n*'''The Lunch Lady''' - A man disguised as a lunch lady who flies the N.E.R.D.S. rocket/jet, dubbed \"The School Bus.\" He is extremely loyal to the N.E.R.D.S., going as far as to lock himself up when he believed he was being affected by the Villain Virus. He became the de facto leader of the group at the start of the fifth book.\n*'''Benjamin''' - A blue floating orb that is the N.E.R.D.S. supercomputer. He takes on the holographic form of [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the world's earliest spies. He is the one who gives the N.E.R.D.S. their upgrades and briefs them on missions.\n*'''Mindy \"The Hyena\" Beauchamp''' - A former junior beauty [[Beauty contest|pageant]] [[Beauty queen|queen]], and skilled martial artist who wanted to become a professional assassin. She works for N.E.R.D.S. on a currently classified project and is the leader of the Troublemakers, a group of boys who formerly bullied Flinch. She does not have an upgrade, but she naturally possesses an obnoxious laugh that causes anyone that hears it to laugh as well. She seems to have a romantic interest in Braceface.\n*'''Gerdie \"Mathlete\" Baker''' a former member of N.E.R.D.S. and a prodigy at math. Her upgrades allow her to process complex problems at lightning speed. In the third book she was able to create a machine that takes her to other worlds for ten minutes, which she uses to her advantage. She then helped Heathcliff travel to a different dimension, where he proceeded to trap her after receiving new upgrades. After this, she started working with that dimension's Benjamin to save that Earth's population from aliens.\n\n===Antagonists===\n*'''Heathcliff \"Choppers/Simon/Screwball/Brainstorm\" Hodges''' - A very intelligent but frequently bullied [[boy]] who is the main antagonist of the series. His upgrade in the first two books is a specially designed psycho-hallucinogenic whitening treatment which is further enhanced by a special [[toothpaste]] that allows him to [[hypnosis|hypnotize]] people with his buck teeth. He betrays the group at the end of the first book, stating that he wants to rule a world where knowledge and learning is important stemming from a hatred for bullies and the years of humiliation that he suffered under Jackson, who formerly bullied him when he was still popular. He is eventually defeated, but he continued to cause trouble for the team throughout the series. His two front teeth were knocked out in the second book; however, in an alternate dimension he was able to receive new upgrades which increased the size of his brain and skull, affording him psychokinetic powers including telekinesis and heat vision.  He used this upgrade to disable the N.E.R.D.'s upgrades saved for Wheezer, who proceeded to knock him unconscious. After Flinch disabled his upgrades, which had created a virus that corrupted people, Heathcliff woke up with amnesia, and was subsequently reinstated to the team even though he later regained his memory. His final upgrade was never officially revealed, although it is implied that it helped his parents remember him after the agents removed Heathcliff from their memories.\n*''' Ms. Lisa Holiday/Miss Information''' - The librarian at Nathan Hale Elementary who was Agent Brand's assistant and the main antagonist of the fifth book. She is known to bake awful-tasting cookies for the children, and is surprisingly useful for combat. In ''The Villain Virus'' she was the only person who remained evil after the virus was destroyed. It was later revealed that she was actually a spy from Siberia named Viktoriya Deprankova. She became the leader of the B.U.L.L.I.E.S. and traveled back in time to destroy the N.E.R.D.S. once and for all, but was stopped by Agent Brand, Pufferfish, and Heathcliff, who fixed the corrupted timeline and changed Ms. Holiday back into an ally.\n*'''Dr. Jigsaw''' - A mad scientist who was the main antagonist of the first book. He wished to recreate [[Pangaea]] because he believed it will help create unity, and he worked together with Simon to create a tractor beam. At the end of the book, he was killed as his lair fell apart.\n*'''Dumb Vinci/The Antagonist''' - A goon who worked for Dr. Jigsaw and Simon. He lost his hand in the first book and has a hook to replace it. In the third book, he is sprayed with poison in the face by a giant grasshopper, severely damaging his face; as a result, after he was corrupted by the Villain Virus, he dons a mask and calls himself \"The Antagonist\".\n*'''Albert Nesbitt/Captain Justice/Captain Upgrade''' - A 37-year-old overweight computer genius who is solely interested in comic books and superheroes. He becomes one of Simon's minions in the second book, and received upgrades that gave him new powers by adapting technology implanted into his body. He was eventually killed by Gluestick, who overloaded his brain.\n*'''Gertrude \"Mama\" Nesbitt''' - Albert's 67-year-old mother who encourages him to become a scientist despite his comic book addiction. Whenever he became a villain, she went with the idea, and tried to help him by nearly killing Duncan when she rammed her car into him. She fell from a rocket at the end of the second book and was presumably killed.\n\n===Other characters===\n*'''General Savage''' - A general described as a hulk of [[muscle]] who had fought in 14 wars, starting ten of them just to stay in shape. He was the one who introduced Agent Brand to the N.E.R.D.S.\n*'''Principal Dehaven''' - The Nathan Hale Elementary principal who dislikes Braceface because of his delinquency.\n*'''Ms. Dove''' - The former principle of Thomas Knowltown Middle School who took a disliking to Flinch, who she classified as a juvenile delinquent and tried to expel. She became infected with the Villain Virus and called herself Colonel Cuckoo. At the end of the epidemic, she returned to normal and was ironically transferred to another school in Siberia.\n*'''Brett Bealer''' - A popular kid who was formerly one of Jackson's best friends. His betrayal helped introduce Jackson to the N.E.R.D.S.\n*'''Dr. Lunich''' - A brave athlete and scientist. He stood up to Dr. Jigsaw when he was creating a superweapon, but Dr. Jigsaw killed him by making him fall into a fire pit. Dr. Lunich also made a tractor beam that Dr. Jigsaw was very interested in.\n\n==Plot synopses==\n===''N.E.R.D.S.: National Espionage, Rescue, and Defense Society'' (2009)===\nDr. Jigsaw and Simon or Heathcliff \"Choppers\"  hatches a plot to change the surface of the earth.

Ingersoll and Zobel describe the work of Kelvin and Fourier in their book<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 9\u201314.</ref> and Kelvin's approach to the representation of [[propagation constant|transmission function]]s would consequently have been very familiar to Zobel.  It is therefore no surprise that in Zobel's paper on the electric wave filter<ref>Zobel, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> a very similar representation is found for the transmission function of filters.\n\nSolutions to the Fourier equation can be provided by [[Fourier series]].<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Ingersoll and Zobel state that in many cases the calculation involved makes the solution \"well-nigh impossible\" by analytical means.  With modern technology such a calculation is trivially easy, but Ingersoll and Zobel recommend the use of harmonic analysers, which are the mechanical counterpart of today's [[spectrum analyser]]s.  These machines add together mechanical oscillations of various frequencies, phases and amplitudes by combining them through a set of pulleys or springs: one for each oscillator.  The reverse process is also possible, driving the machine with the function and measuring the Fourier components as output.<ref>Ingersoll and Zobel, pp. 62\u201364.</ref>\n\n==Background to AT&T research==\nAfter the work of [[John R. Carson]] in 1915<ref>Carson, J R, ''Electric Circuit Theory and Operational Calculus'', 1926, McGraw-Hill, New York.</ref> it became clear that [[multiplexed]] telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of [[single sideband]] suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the [[frequency domain]] consists of a [[Carrier wave|carrier]] and two [[sidebands]]. The [[carrier wave]] in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple [[tuned circuit]]s. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum [[Selectivity (electronic)|rejection]] of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent [[crosstalk]]. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.<ref>Bray, pp. 61,&nbsp;63.</ref>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; ; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:20em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''Electric wave filters'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 90%;\" | The term ''electric wave filter'' was much used around Zobel's time to mean a filter designed to pass or reject waves of specified frequencies across the band. It appears in numerous papers published in the early 20th century. Sometimes used to distinguish these more advanced designs from the simple tuned circuits which preceded them. In modern usage the simpler term ''filter'' would be used and is unambiguous within the field of electronics.\n|}\n[[George A. Campbell]] and Zobel worked on this problem of extracting a single sideband from an amplitude-modulated composite wave for use in [[multiplexing]] telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal at the far end of the transmission.<ref name=Bray62/><ref name=\"White, 2000\"/>\n\nInitially, the [[baseband]] pass range used was 200&nbsp;Hz to 2500&nbsp;Hz but later the [[International Telecommunication Union]] set a standard of 300&nbsp;Hz to 3.4&nbsp;kHz with 4&nbsp;kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop in the space of 900&nbsp;Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.<ref>Bray, pp. 62, 64.</ref>\n\nCampbell had previously utilised the [[Heaviside condition|condition]] discovered in the work of [[Oliver Heaviside]] for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using [[lumped component]] inductors ([[loading coils]]). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using [[ladder network]] topology using capacitors and inductors. [[Low-pass filter|Low-pass]], [[high-pass]] and [[band-pass]] filters were designed. Sharper [[Cutoff frequency|cut-offs]] and higher [[stop-band]] rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell<ref>Campbell, G A, \"Physical Theory of the Electric Wave-Filter\", ''Bell System Tech J'', November 1922, vol 1, no 2, pp. 1\u201332.</ref> were described by Zobel as [[constant k filters]] although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.<ref>Bray, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Innovations==\nAfter Zobel arrived at the Engineering Department of AT&T he used his mathematical skills to further improve the design of electric wave filters. Carson and Zobel developed the mathematical method of analyzing the behavior of filters now known as the [[Image impedance|image]] method whereby the impedance and transmission parameters of each section are calculated as if it is part of an infinite chain of identical sections.<ref>Chu, W, Chung-Kwei Chang, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1686520 ''Transients of Resistance-Terminated Dissipative Low-Pass and High-Pass Electric Wave Filters''], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 26, no 10, pp. 1266\u20131277, October 1938</ref>\n\n===Wave filters===\n[[Image:Zobel original drawing.PNG|thumbnail|right|450 px|An original drawing by Zobel of a band-pass filter used for impedance matching|alt=A circuit consisting of a series resonator (i.e., an inductor and capacitor in series), a shunt anti-resonator (i.e., the same devices in parallel), another series resonator in parallel with an inductor and a capacitor, and a terminating resistor. Component values are marked as multiples of the components of a prototype filter (not shown).]]\nZobel invented the [[M-derived filter|m-derived (or m-type) filter]] section in 1920, the distinguishing feature of this design being a [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] of attenuation close to the filter [[cut-off frequency]]. The result of this design is a filter response which falls very rapidly past the cut-off frequency. A fast transition between [[pass-band]] and [[stop-band]] was one of the primary requirements for cramming as many telephone channels as possible into one cable.<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/><ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', p. 65.</ref>\n\nOne disadvantage of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, the response of the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again.<ref>Ghosh, Smarajit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbP7rfG2YYC ''Network Theory: Analysis and Synthesis''], Prentice Hall of India, pp. 564\u2013569.</ref> Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel the advantages of both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.<ref>Zobel, pp. 26\u201328.</ref>\n\nBy 1921 Zobel had further perfected his composite filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections at the ends of his composite filters to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load,<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/> a technique in which he held a patent.<ref name=\"aniseed ball\">Zobel, O J, ''Terminating network for filters'', {{US patent|1557229}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> The difficulty that he was trying to overcome was that the [[image impedance]] techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6<ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', pp. 72\u201374.</ref><ref>''Redifon Radio Diary, 1970'', p. 47, William Collins Sons & Co, 1969</ref> for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.<ref name=Bray62/><ref>Shea, T E, ''Transmission Networks and Wave Filters'', 1929, Bell Telephone Laboratories.</ref>\n\nAround 1923, Zobel's filter designs were reaching the peak of their complexity. He now had a filter section to which he had doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the [[constant k filter|k-type]]. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with [[Passivity (engineering)#Passive filter|conventional LC technology]]. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.<ref name=\"humbug\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1850146}}, filed 25 Nov 1930, issued 22 March 1932.</ref>\n\n===Transmission line simulation===\nZobel directed much of his effort in the 1920s to constructing networks which could simulate transmission lines. These networks were derived from filter sections, which themselves had been derived from transmission line theory and the filters were used on transmission line signals.  In turn, these artificial lines were used to develop and test better filter sections.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical network'', {{US patent|1760973}}, filed 27 March 1928, issued 3 June 1930.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1720777}}, filed 9 Sept 1926, issued 16 July 1929.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1591073}}, filed 15 Dec 1922, issued 6 July 1926.</ref>\nZobel used a design technique based on his theoretical discovery that the impedance looking into the end of a filter chain was practically the same (within the limits of component tolerances) as the theoretical impedance of an infinite chain after only a small number of sections had been added to the chain. These \"image\" impedances have a mathematical characterization impossible to construct simply out of discrete components, and can only ever be approximated. Zobel found that using these impedances constructed out of small filter chains as components in a greater network allowed him to build realistic line simulators. These were not in any sense intended as practical filters in the field, but rather the intention was to construct good controllable line simulators without having the inconvenience of miles of cable to contend with.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Selective Constant-Resistance Network'', {{US patent|1724987}}, filed 13 April 1928, issued 20 Aug 1929.</ref>\n\n===Equalisers===\nZobel invented several filters whose defining characteristic was a [[constant-resistance network|constant resistance]] as the input impedance. The resistance remained constant through the pass band and the stop band. With these designs Zobel had completely solved the impedance matching problem.  The main application of these sections has been not so much for filtering out unwanted frequencies, the k-type and m-type filters remained best for this, but rather to equalize the response in the pass band to a flat response.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network and Method of Transmitting Electric Currents'', {{US patent|1603305}}, filed 9 Aug 1922, issued 19 Oct 1926.</ref>\n\nPerhaps one of Zobel's most fascinating inventions is the [[Lattice phase equaliser|lattice filter]] section. This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, yet it is constructed out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is the phase of the signal at different frequencies.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Phase-shifting network'', {{US patent|1792523}}, filed 12 March 1927, issued 17 Feb 1931.</ref>\n\n===Impedance matching===\nA common theme throughout Zobel's work is the issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.<ref name=\"humbug\"/>\n\nThis impedance matching approach not only led to better filters but the techniques developed could be used to construct circuits whose sole purpose was to match together two disparate impedances.<ref name=\"chewing gum\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1615252}}, filed 9 June 1923, issued 25 Jan 1927.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Complementary filter'', {{US patent|1557230}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> Zobel continued to invent impedance matching networks throughout his career. During [[World War II]] he moved on to [[waveguide filter]]s for use in the newly developed [[radar]] technology.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Little was published during the war for obvious reasons but towards the end with Bell Labs in the 1950s, Zobel designs for sections to match physically different waveguide sizes appear.<ref name=\"lemon drop\"/><ref name=\"pear drop\"/>  However, the circuit noted above which still bears Zobel's name today, the constant-resistance network, can be viewed as an impedance matching circuit and remains Zobel's finest achievement in this regard.<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/>\n\n==Loudspeaker equalisation==\nThe name of Zobel is, perhaps, most well known with regard to impedance compensation networks for loudspeakers and his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to this is where he speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable,<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/> or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the [[hybrid transformer]] which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a [[phantom circuit]].<ref name=\"chewing gum\"/>\n\n==Noise==\nWhile Carson led the way theoretically, Zobel was involved in the design of filters for the purpose of noise reduction on transmission systems.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 5\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Background===\nAt the beginning of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external [[Static (radio)|static]]. In modern terminology, this would include random ([[thermal noise|thermal]] and [[shot noise|shot]]) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] in 1918 on shot noise.<ref>Schottky, W, \"\u00dcber spontane Stromschwankungen in verschiedenen Elecktrizit\u00e4tsleitern\", ''Annalen der Physik'', verte folge, Band 57, 1918, pp. 541\u2013567.</ref> To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing [[directional antenna]]e and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 3\u20135.</ref>\n\nFor telephone engineers, what was then called \"fluctuating noise\", and would now be described as random noise, i.e. shot and thermal noise, was much more noticeable than with early radio systems. Carson broadened the radio engineers' concept of signal-to-static ratio to a more general [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and introduced a figure of merit for noise.<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1666797 \"Signal-to-Static-Interference Ratio in Radio Telephony\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol 11, June 1923, pp. 271\u2013274.</ref><ref>Schwartz, pp. 1, 5.</ref>\n\n===Impossibility of noise cancellation===\nThe radio engineers' preoccupation with static and the techniques being used to reduce it led to the idea that noise could be totally eliminated by, in some way, compensating for it or canceling it out. The culmination of this viewpoint was expressed in a 1928 paper by [[Edwin Armstrong]].<ref>Armstrong, E H, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1669871 \"Methods of Reducing the Effect of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol. 16 no 1, January 1928, pp. 15\u201326.</ref> This led to a famous retort by Carson in a subsequent paper, \"Noise, like the poor, will always be with us\".<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1670079 \"The Reduction of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 16 no 7, July 1928, pp. 966\u2013975.</ref>  Armstrong was technically in the wrong in this exchange, but in 1933, ironically and paradoxically, went on to invent wide-band [[FM broadcasting|FM]] which enormously improved the noise performance of radio by ''increasing'' the bandwidth.<ref>Armstrong, A H, ''Radiosignaling'', {{US Patent|1941069}}, filed 24 January 1933, issued 26 December 1933</ref>\n\nCarson and Zobel in 1923 had conclusively shown that filtering cannot remove noise to the same degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of [[Fourier analysis]] to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call [[White noise|band-limited white noise]]. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.<ref name=TransientOscillation>Carson, J R and Zobel, O J, \"Transient Oscillation in Electric Wave Filters\", ''Bell System Technical Journal'', vol. 2, July 1923, pp. 1\u201329.</ref>\n\nAlthough this work by Carson and Zobel was very early, it was not universally accepted that noise could be analyzed in the frequency domain in this way. For this reason, the aforementioned  exchange between Carson and Armstrong was still possible years later. The precise mathematical relationship between noise power and bandwidth for random noise was finally determined by [[Harry Nyquist]] in 1928 thus giving a theoretical limit to what could be achieved by filtering.<ref>Nyquist, H, \"Thermal Agitation of Electric Charges in Conductors\", ''Physical Review'', vol. 32, July 1928, pp. 110\u2013113. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRev.32.110}}</ref>\n\nThis work on noise produced the concept, and led Zobel to pursue the design, of [[matched filter]]s.  In this context matched means that the filter is chosen to match the signal's characteristics in order to admit all of the available signal without admitting any noise that could have been excluded. The underlying insight is that admitting as much signal as is available without admitting any noise that could be excluded will maximize the signal to noise ratio. When the signal to noise ratio is maximized, the noise performance of the equipment is optimal. This conclusion was the culmination of theoretical research into removing noise by the application of [[linear filters]].  This became important in the development of radar during the Second World War in which Zobel played a part.<ref>Schwartz, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Use of work in genetic programming research==\nZobel's work has recently found an application in research into [[genetic programming]]. The purpose of this research is to attempt to demonstrate that the results obtained from genetic programming are comparable to human achievements. Two of the measures that are used to determine whether a genetic programming result is human-competitive are:<ref name=\"polo\">{{cite book|author=Koza, Bennet|author2=Andre, Keane|title=Genetic Programming III: Darwinian Invention and Problem Solving|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=San Francisco|year=1999|url=http://www.genetic-programming.com/hc/zobelcrossoverfilter.html}}</ref>\n*The result is a patented invention.\n*The result is equal to or better than a result that was considered an achievement in its field at the time of discovery.\n\nOne such problem set as a task for a genetic program was to design a [[Audio crossover|crossover filter]] for [[woofer]] and [[tweeter]] loudspeakers. The output design was identical in [[Electronic filter topology|topology]] to a design found in a patent of Zobel's<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1538964}}, filed 15 Jan 1921, issued 26 May 1925.</ref> for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line. This was judged to be human-comparable, not only because of the patent, but also because the high-pass and low-pass sections were \"[[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposed]]\" as in Zobel's design, but not specifically required to be so in the programs parameters.<ref name=\"polo\"/> Whether or not Zobel's filter design would be good for a [[hi-fi]] system is another question.

[[Lord Kelvin]] in his early work on the transmission line<ref>Thomson, William, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1854RSPS....7..382T \"On the Theory of the Electric Telegraph\"], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', '''Vol 7''', pp. 382\u2013399. {{doi|10.1098/rspl.1854.0093}}</ref> derived the properties of the electric line by analogy with heat conduction.<ref>Hunt, B J, [https://books.google.com/books?id=23rBH11Q9w8C&pg=PA63 ''The Maxwellians''], p. 63, Cornell University Press, 2005 {{ISBN|0-8014-8234-8}}.</ref>  This is based on [[Conduction (heat)#Fourier's law|Fourier's law]] and the [[Heat equation|Fourier conduction equation]].  Ingersoll and Zobel describe the work of Kelvin and Fourier in their book<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 9\u201314.</ref> and Kelvin's approach to the representation of [[propagation constant|transmission function]]s would consequently have been very familiar to Zobel.  It is therefore no surprise that in Zobel's paper on the electric wave filter<ref>Zobel, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> a very similar representation is found for the transmission function of filters.\n\nSolutions to the Fourier equation can be provided by [[Fourier series]].<ref>Leonard ''et al.'', pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Ingersoll and Zobel state that in many cases the calculation involved makes the solution \"well-nigh impossible\" by analytical means.  With modern technology such a calculation is trivially easy, but Ingersoll and Zobel recommend the use of harmonic analysers, which are the mechanical counterpart of today's [[spectrum analyser]]s.  These machines add together mechanical oscillations of various frequencies, phases and amplitudes by combining them through a set of pulleys or springs; one for each oscillator.  The reverse process is also possible, driving the machine with the function and measuring the Fourier components as output.<ref>Ingersoll and Zobel, pp. 62\u201364.</ref>\n\n==Background to AT&T research==\nAfter the work of [[John R. Carson]] in 1915<ref>Carson, J R, ''Electric Circuit Theory and Operational Calculus'', 1926, McGraw-Hill, New York.</ref> it became clear that [[multiplexed]] telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of [[single sideband]] suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the [[frequency domain]] consists of a [[Carrier wave|carrier]] and two [[sidebands]]. The [[carrier wave]] in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple [[tuned circuit]]s. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum [[Selectivity (electronic)|rejection]] of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent [[crosstalk]]. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.<ref>Bray, pp. 61,&nbsp;63.</ref>\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; ; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:20em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''Electric wave filters'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 90%;\" | The term ''electric wave filter'' was much used around Zobel's time to mean a filter designed to pass or reject waves of specified frequencies across the band. It appears in numerous papers published in the early 20th century. Sometimes used to distinguish these more advanced designs from the simple tuned circuits which preceded them. In modern usage the simpler term ''filter'' would be used and is unambiguous within the field of electronics.\n|}\n[[George A. Campbell]] and Zobel worked on this problem of extracting a single sideband from an amplitude-modulated composite wave for use in [[multiplexing]] telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal at the far end of the transmission.<ref name=Bray62/><ref name=\"White, 2000\"/>\n\nInitially, the [[baseband]] pass range used was 200&nbsp;Hz to 2500&nbsp;Hz but later the [[International Telecommunication Union]] set a standard of 300&nbsp;Hz to 3.4&nbsp;kHz with 4&nbsp;kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop in the space of 900&nbsp;Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.<ref>Bray, pp. 62, 64.</ref>\n\nCampbell had previously utilised the [[Heaviside condition|condition]] discovered in the work of [[Oliver Heaviside]] for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using [[lumped component]] inductors ([[loading coils]]). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using [[ladder network]] topology using capacitors and inductors. [[Low-pass filter|Low-pass]], [[high-pass]] and [[band-pass]] filters were designed. Sharper [[Cutoff frequency|cut-offs]] and higher [[stop-band]] rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell<ref>Campbell, G A, \"Physical Theory of the Electric Wave-Filter\", ''Bell System Tech J'', November 1922, vol 1, no 2, pp. 1\u201332.</ref> were described by Zobel as [[constant k filters]] although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.<ref>Bray, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Innovations==\nAfter Zobel arrived at the Engineering Department of AT&T he used his mathematical skills to further improve the design of electric wave filters. Carson and Zobel developed the mathematical method of analyzing the behavior of filters now known as the [[Image impedance|image]] method whereby the impedance and transmission parameters of each section are calculated as if it is part of an infinite chain of identical sections.<ref>Chu, W, Chung-Kwei Chang, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1686520 ''Transients of Resistance-Terminated Dissipative Low-Pass and High-Pass Electric Wave Filters''], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 26, no 10, pp. 1266\u20131277, October 1938</ref>\n\n===Wave filters===\n[[Image:Zobel original drawing.PNG|thumbnail|right|450 px|An original drawing by Zobel of a band-pass filter used for impedance matching|alt=A circuit consisting of a series resonator (i.e., an inductor and capacitor in series), a shunt anti-resonator (i.e., the same devices in parallel), another series resonator in parallel with an inductor and a capacitor, and a terminating resistor. Component values are marked as multiples of the components of a prototype filter (not shown).]]\nZobel invented the [[M-derived filter|m-derived (or m-type) filter]] section in 1920, the distinguishing feature of this design being a [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] of attenuation close to the filter [[cut-off frequency]]. The result of this design is a filter response which falls very rapidly past the cut-off frequency. A fast transition between [[pass-band]] and [[stop-band]] was one of the primary requirements for cramming as many telephone channels as possible into one cable.<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/><ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', p. 65.</ref>\n\nOne disadvantage of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, the response of the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again.<ref>Ghosh, Smarajit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbP7rfG2YYC ''Network Theory: Analysis and Synthesis''], Prentice Hall of India, pp. 564\u2013569.</ref> Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel the advantages of both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.<ref>Zobel, pp. 26\u201328.</ref>\n\nBy 1921 Zobel had further perfected his composite filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections at the ends of his composite filters to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load,<ref name=\"White, 2000\"/> a technique in which he held a patent.<ref name=\"aniseed ball\">Zobel, O J, ''Terminating network for filters'', {{US patent|1557229}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> The difficulty that he was trying to overcome was that the [[image impedance]] techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6<ref>Matthaei ''et al.'', pp. 72\u201374.</ref><ref>''Redifon Radio Diary, 1970'', p. 47, William Collins Sons & Co, 1969</ref> for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.<ref name=Bray62/><ref>Shea, T E, ''Transmission Networks and Wave Filters'', 1929, Bell Telephone Laboratories.</ref>\n\nAround 1923, Zobel's filter designs were reaching the peak of their complexity. He now had a filter section to which he had doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the [[constant k filter|k-type]]. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with [[Passivity (engineering)#Passive filter|conventional LC technology]]. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.<ref name=\"humbug\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1850146}}, filed 25 Nov 1930, issued 22 March 1932.</ref>\n\n===Transmission line simulation===\nZobel directed much of his effort in the 1920s to constructing networks which could simulate transmission lines. These networks were derived from filter sections, which themselves had been derived from transmission line theory and the filters were used on transmission line signals.  In turn, these artificial lines were used to develop and test better filter sections.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical network'', {{US patent|1760973}}, filed 27 March 1928, issued 3 June 1930.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1720777}}, filed 9 Sept 1926, issued 16 July 1929.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network'', {{US patent|1591073}}, filed 15 Dec 1922, issued 6 July 1926.</ref>\nZobel used a design technique based on his theoretical discovery that the impedance looking into the end of a filter chain was practically the same (within the limits of component tolerances) as the theoretical impedance of an infinite chain after only a small number of sections had been added to the chain. These \"image\" impedances have a mathematical characterization impossible to construct simply out of discrete components, and can only ever be approximated. Zobel found that using these impedances constructed out of small filter chains as components in a greater network allowed him to build realistic line simulators. These were not in any sense intended as practical filters in the field, but rather the intention was to construct good controllable line simulators without having the inconvenience of miles of cable to contend with.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Selective Constant-Resistance Network'', {{US patent|1724987}}, filed 13 April 1928, issued 20 Aug 1929.</ref>\n\n===Equalisers===\nZobel invented several filters whose defining characteristic was a [[constant-resistance network|constant resistance]] as the input impedance. The resistance remained constant through the pass band and the stop band. With these designs Zobel had completely solved the impedance matching problem.  The main application of these sections has been not so much for filtering out unwanted frequencies, the k-type and m-type filters remained best for this, but rather to equalize the response in the pass band to a flat response.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Network and Method of Transmitting Electric Currents'', {{US patent|1603305}}, filed 9 Aug 1922, issued 19 Oct 1926.</ref>\n\nPerhaps one of Zobel's most fascinating inventions is the [[Lattice phase equaliser|lattice filter]] section. This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, yet it is constructed out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is the phase of the signal at different frequencies.<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Phase-shifting network'', {{US patent|1792523}}, filed 12 March 1927, issued 17 Feb 1931.</ref>\n\n===Impedance matching===\nA common theme throughout Zobel's work is the issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.<ref name=\"humbug\"/>\n\nThis impedance matching approach not only led to better filters but the techniques developed could be used to construct circuits whose sole purpose was to match together two disparate impedances.<ref name=\"chewing gum\">Zobel, O J, ''Electrical Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1615252}}, filed 9 June 1923, issued 25 Jan 1927.</ref><ref>Zobel, O J, ''Complementary filter'', {{US patent|1557230}}, filed 30 April 1920, issued 13 Oct 1925.</ref> Zobel continued to invent impedance matching networks throughout his career. During [[World War II]] he moved on to [[waveguide filter]]s for use in the newly developed [[radar]] technology.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Little was published during the war for obvious reasons but towards the end with Bell Labs in the 1950s, Zobel designs for sections to match physically different waveguide sizes appear.<ref name=\"lemon drop\"/><ref name=\"pear drop\"/>  However, the circuit noted above which still bears Zobel's name today, the constant-resistance network, can be viewed as an impedance matching circuit and remains Zobel's finest achievement in this regard.<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/>\n\n==Loudspeaker equalisation==\nThe name of Zobel is, perhaps, most well known with regard to impedance compensation networks for loudspeakers and his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to this is where he speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable,<ref name=\"chocolate mouse\"/> or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the [[hybrid transformer]] which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a [[phantom circuit]].<ref name=\"chewing gum\"/>\n\n==Noise==\nWhile Carson led the way theoretically, Zobel was involved in the design of filters for the purpose of noise reduction on transmission systems.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 5\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Background===\nAt the beginning of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external [[Static (radio)|static]]. In modern terminology, this would include random ([[thermal noise|thermal]] and [[shot noise|shot]]) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] in 1918 on shot noise.<ref>Schottky, W, \"\u00dcber spontane Stromschwankungen in verschiedenen Elecktrizit\u00e4tsleitern\", ''Annalen der Physik'', verte folge, Band 57, 1918, pp. 541\u2013567.</ref> To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing [[directional antenna]]e and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.<ref>Schwartz, pp. 3\u20135.</ref>\n\nFor telephone engineers, what was then called \"fluctuating noise\", and would now be described as random noise, i.e. shot and thermal noise, was much more noticeable than with early radio systems. Carson broadened the radio engineers' concept of signal-to-static ratio to a more general [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and introduced a figure of merit for noise.<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1666797 \"Signal-to-Static-Interference Ratio in Radio Telephony\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol 11, June 1923, pp. 271\u2013274.</ref><ref>Schwartz, pp. 1, 5.</ref>\n\n===Impossibility of noise cancellation===\nThe radio engineers' preoccupation with static and the techniques being used to reduce it led to the idea that noise could be totally eliminated by, in some way, compensating for it or canceling it out. The culmination of this viewpoint was expressed in a 1928 paper by [[Edwin Armstrong]].<ref>Armstrong, E H, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1669871 \"Methods of Reducing the Effect of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', vol. 16 no 1, January 1928, pp. 15\u201326.</ref> This led to a famous retort by Carson in a subsequent paper, \"Noise, like the poor, will always be with us\".<ref>Carson, J R, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1670079 \"The Reduction of Atmospheric Disturbances\"], Proceedings of the IRE, vol 16 no 7, July 1928, pp. 966\u2013975.</ref>  Armstrong was technically in the wrong in this exchange, but in 1933, ironically and paradoxically, went on to invent wide-band [[FM broadcasting|FM]] which enormously improved the noise performance of radio by ''increasing'' the bandwidth.<ref>Armstrong, A H, ''Radiosignaling'', {{US Patent|1941069}}, filed 24 January 1933, issued 26 December 1933</ref>\n\nCarson and Zobel in 1923 had conclusively shown that filtering cannot remove noise to the same degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of [[Fourier analysis]] to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call [[White noise|band-limited white noise]]. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.<ref name=TransientOscillation>Carson, J R and Zobel, O J, \"Transient Oscillation in Electric Wave Filters\", ''Bell System Technical Journal'', vol. 2, July 1923, pp. 1\u201329.</ref>\n\nAlthough this work by Carson and Zobel was very early, it was not universally accepted that noise could be analyzed in the frequency domain in this way. For this reason, the aforementioned  exchange between Carson and Armstrong was still possible years later. The precise mathematical relationship between noise power and bandwidth for random noise was finally determined by [[Harry Nyquist]] in 1928 thus giving a theoretical limit to what could be achieved by filtering.<ref>Nyquist, H, \"Thermal Agitation of Electric Charges in Conductors\", ''Physical Review'', vol. 32, July 1928, pp. 110\u2013113. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRev.32.110}}</ref>\n\nThis work on noise produced the concept, and led Zobel to pursue the design, of [[matched filter]]s.  In this context matched means that the filter is chosen to match the signal's characteristics in order to admit all of the available signal without admitting any noise that could have been excluded. The underlying insight is that admitting as much signal as is available without admitting any noise that could be excluded will maximize the signal to noise ratio. When the signal to noise ratio is maximized, the noise performance of the equipment is optimal. This conclusion was the culmination of theoretical research into removing noise by the application of [[linear filters]].  This became important in the development of radar during the Second World War in which Zobel played a part.<ref>Schwartz, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Use of work in genetic programming research==\nZobel's work has recently found an application in research into [[genetic programming]]. The purpose of this research is to attempt to demonstrate that the results obtained from genetic programming are comparable to human achievements. Two of the measures that are used to determine whether a genetic programming result is human-competitive are:<ref name=\"polo\">{{cite book|author=Koza, Bennet|author2=Andre, Keane|title=Genetic Programming III: Darwinian Invention and Problem Solving|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=San Francisco|year=1999|url=http://www.genetic-programming.com/hc/zobelcrossoverfilter.html}}</ref>\n*The result is a patented invention.\n*The result is equal to or better than a result that was considered an achievement in its field at the time of discovery.\n\nOne such problem set as a task for a genetic program was to design a [[Audio crossover|crossover filter]] for [[woofer]] and [[tweeter]] loudspeakers. The output design was identical in [[Electronic filter topology|topology]] to a design found in a patent of Zobel's<ref>Zobel, O J, ''Wave Filter'', {{US patent|1538964}}, filed 15 Jan 1921, issued 26 May 1925.</ref> for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line. This was judged to be human-comparable, not only because of the patent, but also because the high-pass and low-pass sections were \"[[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposed]]\" as in Zobel's design, but not specifically required to be so in the programs parameters.<ref name=\"polo\"/> Whether or not Zobel's filter design would be good for a [[hi-fi]] system is another question. The design does not actually cross over, but rather, there is a gap between the two pass-bands where the signal is not transmitted to either output. Essential for multiplexing, but not so desirable for sound reproduction.<ref>Zobel's {{US patent|1538964}} (p.4, l.23) enumerates the gap as 400 Hz</ref>\n\nA later genetic programming<ref>Chakrabarti, A, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUiTdfVxJHwC&pg=PA328 ''Engineering Design Synthesis: Understanding, Approaches, and Tools''], p. 328, Springer, 2002.</ref> experiment produced a filter design which consisted of a chain of constant k sections terminated in an m-type half section. This was also determined to have been a design patented by Zobel.<ref name=\"aniseed ball\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*[[John Bray (communications engineer)|Bray, J]], ''Innovation and the Communications Revolution'', [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]], 2002 {{ISBN|0-85296-218-5}}.\n*Leonard, R, Zobel, O J, Ingersoll, A C, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cjyREwANqwUC&pg=PP1 ''An Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Heat Conduction with Engineering and Geological Applications''], 1913, Ginn and Co, Boston, New York.\n*Matthaei, G L; Young, L; Jones, E M T, ''Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures'' McGraw-Hill 1964 (1980 edition is {{ISBN|0-89006-099-1}}).\n*Schwartz, M, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090420124216/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/symposiums/SchwartzM-paper.pdf Improving the Noise Performance of Communication Systems: 1920s to early 1930s]\", ''Technologies, Technologists & Networks: A Symposium on the History of Communication Technologies'', October 17, 2007, Smithsonian National Postal Museum.\n*Zobel, O J, ''Theory and Design of Uniform and Composite Electric Wave Filters'', Bell System Technical Journal, '''Vol. 2''' (1923), pp.&nbsp;1\u201346.\n\n{{Authority control}}<!--old VIAF number; no longer works: 228155844; another cluster at: 218312213-->\n\n{{featured article}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Biography|Electronics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zobel, Otto Julius}}\n[[Category:1887 births]]\n[[Category:1970 deaths]]\n[[Category:American electrical engineers]]\n[[Category:American electronics engineers]]\n[[Category:Engineers from Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:People from Ripon, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:People from Morristown, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Radio pioneers]]\n[[Category:Ripon College (Wisconsin) alumni]]\n[[Category:Scientists at Bell Labs]]\n[[Category:University of Minnesota faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison alumni]]\n[[Category:Engineers from New Jersey]]\n[[Category:20th-century American inventors]]\n", "name_user": "Eisfbnore", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThermal conduction:orto", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Julius_Zobel"}

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech may also be introduced using special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example: while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example: two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; they demonstrate something that another person said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005. p.222. </ref> In conversation, the use of ''\"say\"'' and ''\"be like\"'' are about the same frequency <ref> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005. p.240. </ref> ; yet, in more normal situation, for instance office hours between professors and students, will more like to use ''\"say\"'' than ''\"be like\"''. <ref> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005. p.242. </ref> \n\nHere are some examples of ''\"be like\"'': <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech may also be introduced using special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example: while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example: two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; they demonstrate something that another person said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

These differ from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential primaries and caucuses in that they do not appoint delegates to represent a candidate at the party's convention to select the party's presidential nominee. The party's nominee will be chosen directly by registered delegates at the [[2020 Libertarian National Convention]] from May 21\u201325, 2020 in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[2020 United States Presidential election]] will be the thirteenth contested presidential election that the Libertarian Party will participate in. The [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]] saw the highest vote total and percentage of votes for a Libertarian presidential ticket ever, with former [[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico governor]] [[Gary Johnson]] and his [[running mate]], former [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts governor]] [[Bill Weld]], receiving over four million votes and 3.28% of the total vote. During [[Gary Johnson 2016 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]] in 2016, Johnson often stated that it would be his last run for the presidency.<ref>{{cite web

The screenplay concerns an idealistic [[lawyer]] who teams with a veteran [[police officer|cop]] to find out the truth in a possible police corruption scandal.\n\n==Plot==\nRoland Dalton (Weller) is a burned-out, mild-mannered Manhattan [[public defender]], and his last case before leaving [[legal aid]] is [[Crack cocaine|crack]] [[Drug dealer|dealer]] Michael Jones ([[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]]), accused of shooting to death police officer Patrick O'Leary in [[Central Park]]. According to Jones, the shooting was in [[Castle Doctrine in the US|self-defense]] and that officer O'Leary was a \"''Blue Jean Cop''\" (an opportunistic police officer who robs drug dealers).\n\nBeing a creature of habit, Dalton seeks the truth to his mysterious case and looks to Richie Marks ([[Sam Elliott]]), a renegade loner [[NYPD]] [[Special agent|narcotics agent]]. Dalton realizes the [[prosecutor]] in his last case is a former love interest, the smart and sexy Susan Cantrell ([[Patricia Charbonneau]]). Throughout the trial Roland rekindles this former affair with Susan unbeknown to his fianc\u00e9e Gail ([[Blanche Baker]]).\n\nRoland and Marks eventually learn that O'Leary was working with a large number of dirty cops who purchased blue jeans and an expensive car. The dirty cops were working with drug lord Nicky \"N.C.\" Carr ([[Antonio Fargas]]). Roland at one point breaks into the police station's evidence locker to locate the cassette tape that Jones had in a boom box radio at the time of his shooting. The tape recorded the entire incident and when Roland attempts to get the tape he is taken hostage by the team of dirty cops. Just before Roland is going to be killed, Marks bursts into the room and shoots the cops, saving Roland.\n\nAlthough Roland makes it to court, with the assistance of an insane cab driver ([[Tom Mardirosian]]) the judge refuses to allow the tape into evidence. After making an impassioned closing statement, the jury acquits Jones of the shooting. Marks then shows up in a Porsche purchased by O'Leary and they go to the airport to hunt down Carr and the last of the dirty cops. Richie jumps onto the plane's landing gear and after shooting out an engine and tossing a hand grenade into the landing gear compartment, he jumps to safety just as the plane explodes.\n\nThe movie ends with Roland again working as a public defender, he's broken up with Gail and is once again dating Susan.\n\n== Selected cast==\n* [[Peter Weller]] - Roland Dalton\n* [[Sam Elliott]] - Detective Richie Marks\n* [[Patricia Charbonneau]] - Susan Cantrell\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] - Patrick O'Leary\n* [[Blanche Baker]] - Gail Feinberger\n* [[Antonio Fargas]] - Nicky Carr\n* [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]] - Michael Jones\n* [[John C.

The screenplay concerns an idealistic [[lawyer]] who teams with a veteran [[police officer|cop]] to find out the truth in a possible police corruption scandal.\n\n==Plot==\nRoland Dalton (Weller) is a burned-out, mild-mannered Manhattan [[public defender]], and his last case before leaving [[legal aid]] is [[Crack cocaine|crack]] [[Drug dealer|dealer]] Michael Jones ([[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]]), accused of shooting to death police officer Patrick O'Leary in [[Central Park]]. According to Jones, the shooting was in [[Castle Doctrine in the US|self-defense]] and that officer O'Leary was a <nowiki>'</nowiki>''Blue Jean Cop''<nowiki>'</nowiki> (an opportunistic police officer who robs drug dealers).\n\nBeing a creature of habit, Dalton seeks the truth to his mysterious case and looks to Richie Marks ([[Sam Elliott]]), a renegade loner [[NYPD]] [[Special agent|narcotics agent]]. Dalton realizes the [[prosecutor]] in his last case is a former love interest, the smart and sexy Susan Cantrell ([[Patricia Charbonneau]]). Throughout the trial Roland rekindles this former affair with Susan unbeknown to his fianc\u00e9e Gail ([[Blanche Baker]]).\n\nRoland and Marks eventually learn that O'Leary was working with a large number of dirty cops who purchased blue jeans and an expensive car. The dirty cops were working with drug lord Nicky \"N.C.\" Carr ([[Antonio Fargas]]). Roland at one point breaks into the police station's evidence locker to locate the cassette tape that Jones had in a boom box radio at the time of his shooting. The tape recorded the entire incident and when Roland attempts to get the tape he is taken hostage by the team of dirty cops. Just before Roland is going to be killed, Marks bursts into the room and shoots the cops, saving Roland.\n\nAlthough Roland makes it to court, with the assistance of an insane cab driver ([[Tom Mardirosian]]) the judge refuses to allow the tape into evidence. After making an impassioned closing statement, the jury acquits Jones of the shooting. Marks then shows up in a Porsche purchased by O'Leary and they go to the airport to hunt down Carr and the last of the dirty cops. Richie jumps onto the plane's landing gear and after shooting out an engine and tossing a hand grenade into the landing gear compartment, he jumps to safety just as the plane explodes.\n\nThe movie ends with Roland again working as a public defender, he's broken up with Gail and is once again dating Susan.\n\n== Selected cast==\n* [[Peter Weller]] - Roland Dalton\n* [[Sam Elliott]] - Detective Richie Marks\n* [[Patricia Charbonneau]] - Susan Cantrell\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] - Patrick O'Leary\n* [[Blanche Baker]] - Gail Feinberger\n* [[Antonio Fargas]] - Nicky Carr\n* [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]] - Michael Jones\n* [[John C.
