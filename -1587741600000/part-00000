In the \"Mrs. Wiggins\" sketch titled ''Flashbacks'', Mr. Tudball (Conway) is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback to when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins (Burnett); and in \"The Family\" sketch ''The Psychiatrist'', [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]] (Burnett) and [[Thelma Harper|Mama]] (Lawrence) visit a psychiatrist ([[Craig Richard Nelson]]) as Eunice is trying to figure out what went wrong with her life. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre. With the changes in cast (Harvey Korman left the series after the 1976\u201377 season and was replaced by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) along with the mediocre ratings (finishing its last season in 66th place), she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later.\n\nThe celebrities in the audience for the final episode included [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Betty White]] and then-husband [[Allen Ludden]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Jim Nabors]] and screen legend [[Lillian Gish]].\n\n''The Carol Burnett Show'' was one of the longest-running variety shows in television history; its conclusion marked the closing of another chapter in television as Burnett was the last of the great comedic talents heading a variety show, and hers was the last offering live entertainment before an audience.\n\n==Featured segments==\n*Introduction: [[Q&A]] (Carol Burnett)\n*Duets: [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]\n*\"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" ([[Burt Reynolds]])\n*\"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" \u2013 ''Flashbacks'' (Carol Burnett and Tim Conway) \n*\"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\" ([[James Stewart]])\n*Water Gimmicks:\n**\"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\" ([[Harvey Korman]])\n**\"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Solo Montage:\n**\"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n**\"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Movie Parodies:\n**''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (Carol Burnett and Steve Lawrence)\n**''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Steve Lawrence)\n*\"The Doily Sisters\" (Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence)\n*Favorite Moments:\n**\"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"S-P-L-I-T\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"The Brown Derby\" (Carol Burnett, [[Bob Hope]] and Bing Crosby)\n**\"Newscaster\" (Tim Conway)\n**\"Cobumble\" \u2013 a spoof of ''[[Columbo]]'' (Tim Conway)\n**\"Hand Insurance\" (Carol Burnett and [[Dick Van Dyke]])\n*\"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" \u2013 ''The Psychiatrist'' (Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence and [[Craig Richard Nelson]])\n*Scrapbook: \"[[Salsoul Orchestra|Magic Bird of Fire]]\" (The Ernie Flatt Dancers)\n*Bloopers and Outtakes\n*\"The Charwoman\" (Carol Burnett) \n*Finale: \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\" (Carol Burnett)\n\n==DVD release==\nOn October 3, 2017, [[Time Life]] released ''The Best of The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Final Show'' as a single disc [[DVD]] in Region 1 to commemorate the show's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Carol Burnett Show - The Final Show|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Carol-Burnett-Volume-Release/17604}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|0536584}}\n*[https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=liza+minnelli+&f=all&c=tv&advanced=1&p=4&item=T80:0730 \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at the [[Paley Center for Media]]\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}} \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Special Evening with Carol Burnett, A}}\n[[Category:1978 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:American television series finales]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\n| series       = [[The Carol Burnett Show]]\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| season       = 11\n| episode      = 24 (279th overall)\n| airdate      = {{Start date|1978|03|29}}\n| production   = 0124\n| writer       = Roger Beatty<br>Rick Hawkins<br>Liz Sage<br>[[Robert Illes]]<br>[[James R.

With the changes in cast (Harvey Korman left the series after the 1976\u201377 season and was replaced by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) along with the mediocre ratings (finishing its last season in 66th place), she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later.\n\nThe celebrities in the audience for the final episode included [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Betty White]] and then-husband [[Allen Ludden]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Jim Nabors]] and screen legend [[Lillian Gish]].\n\n''The Carol Burnett Show'' was one of the longest-running variety shows in television history; its conclusion marked the closing of another chapter in television as Burnett was the last of the great comedic talents heading a variety show, and hers was the last offering live entertainment before an audience.\n\n==Featured segments==\n*Introduction: [[Q&A]] (Carol Burnett)\n*Duets: [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]\n*\"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" ([[Burt Reynolds]])\n*\"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" \u2013 ''Flashbacks'' (Carol Burnett and Tim Conway) \n*\"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\" ([[James Stewart]])\n*Water Gimmicks:\n**\"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\" ([[Harvey Korman]])\n**\"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Solo Montage:\n**\"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n**\"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Movie Parodies:\n**''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (Carol Burnett and Steve Lawrence)\n**''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Steve Lawrence)\n*\"The Doily Sisters\" (Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence)\n*Favorite Moments:\n**\"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"S-P-L-I-T\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"The Brown Derby\" (Carol Burnett, [[Bob Hope]] and Bing Crosby)\n**\"Newscaster\" (Tim Conway)\n**\"Cobumble\" \u2013 a spoof of ''[[Columbo]]'' (Tim Conway)\n**\"Hand Insurance\" (Carol Burnett and [[Dick Van Dyke]])\n*\"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" \u2013 ''The Psychiatrist'' (Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence and [[Craig Richard Nelson]])\n*Scrapbook: \"[[Salsoul Orchestra|Magic Bird of Fire]]\" (The Ernie Flatt Dancers)\n*Bloopers and Outtakes\n*\"The Charwoman\" (Carol Burnett) \n*Finale: \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\" (Carol Burnett)\n\n==DVD release==\nOn October 3, 2017, [[Time Life]] released ''The Best of The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Final Show'' as a single disc [[DVD]] in Region 1 to commemorate the show's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Carol Burnett Show - The Final Show|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Carol-Burnett-Volume-Release/17604}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|0536584}}\n*[https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=liza+minnelli+&f=all&c=tv&advanced=1&p=4&item=T80:0730 \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at the [[Paley Center for Media]]\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}} \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Special Evening with Carol Burnett, A}}\n[[Category:1978 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:American television series finales]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Special_Evening_with_Carol_Burnett"}

He was commissioned to build the [[Tomb of Pope Julius II|Pope's tomb]], which was to include forty statues and be finished in five years.\n\nUnder the patronage of the Pope, Michelangelo experienced constant interruptions to his work on the tomb in order to accomplish numerous other tasks. Although Michelangelo worked on the tomb for 40 years, it was never finished to his satisfaction.<ref name=\"Goldcheider14\">Goldscheider, pp. 14\u201316.</ref> It is located in the [[San Pietro in Vincoli|Church of S.

The work is part of a larger scheme of decoration within the chapel which represents much of the doctrine of the Catholic Church.<ref name= Goldscheider12/>\n\nThe composition stretches over 500 square metres of ceiling,<ref>Bartz and K\u00f6nig, p. 43.</ref> and contains over 300 figures.<ref name= Goldscheider12/>  At its centre are nine episodes from the [[Book of Genesis]], divided into three groups: God's Creation of the Earth; God's Creation of Humankind and their fall from God's grace; and lastly, the state of Humanity as represented by [[Noah]] and his family. On the pendentives supporting the ceiling are painted twelve men and women who prophesied the coming of Jesus; seven [[prophet]]s of Israel and five [[Sibyl]]s, prophetic women of the Classical world.<ref name= Goldscheider12/>  Among the most famous paintings on the ceiling are ''The Creation of Adam'', ''[[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]]'', the [[Deluge myth|''Deluge'']], the ''Prophet [[Jeremiah]]'' and the ''[[Cumaean Sibyl]]''.\n\n==Composition==\n[[Image:'Adam's Creation Sistine Chapel ceiling' by Michelangelo JBU33cut.jpg|right|600px]]\nGod is depicted as an elderly white-bearded caucasian man wrapped in a swirling cloak while Adam, on the lower left, is completely [[naked]]. God's right arm is outstretched to impart the spark of life from his own finger into that of Adam, whose left arm is extended in a pose mirroring God's, a reminder that man is created in the image and likeness of God ({{Bibleref2|Gen.|1:26|NRSV}}). Another point is that Adam's finger and God's finger aren't touching. It gives the impression that God, the giver of life, is reaching out to Adam who has yet to receive it; they [God and Adam] are not on \"the same level\" as would be two humans shaking hands, for instance.\n\nMany hypotheses have been formulated regarding the identity and meaning of the twelve figures around God. According to an interpretation that was first proposed by the English art critic [[Walter Pater]] (1839\u20131894) and is now widely accepted, the person protected by God's left arm represents [[Eve]], due to the figure's feminine appearance and gaze towards Adam,<ref name=\"Givens2009\">{{cite book |last=Givens |first=Terryl L. |authorlink=Terryl Givens |date=2009 |chapter=Prologue |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=nZNODwAAQBAJ&pg=PT8&dq=Prologue |title=When Souls Had Wings.

Michelangelo employed a male model to capture this effortful pose and used his red chalk to develop thick contours, in order to establish a definitive form, so every [[Sistine Chapel|chapel]] visitor could clearly recognize the muscular body from standing on the floor, 68 feet below the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|ceiling]]<ref name=\":3\" />. \n\nIn Michelangelo\u2019s final fresco on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|ceiling]], Adam is physically beautiful, but spiritually still incomplete.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barolsky|first=Paul|date=2001|journal=Source: Notes in the History of Art|volume=20|issue=4|pages=6\u20138|issn=0737-4453|jstor=23206730|title=The Imperfection of Michelangelo's Adam|doi=10.1086/sou.20.4.23206730}}</ref> The sketch prefaces this story, as it is also incomplete in the sense that the only complete component of the drawing is Adam\u2019s twisted torso.

In that languid figure there is something rude and [[satyr]]-like, something akin to the rugged hillside on which it lies. His whole form is gathered into an expression of mere expectation and reception; he has hardly strength enough to lift his finger to touch the finger of the creator; yet a touch of the finger-tips will suffice.|author=[[Walter Pater]]|title=''The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry''|source=\"The Poetry of Michelangelo\"}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n*{{slink|Apophatic theology#Western Christianity}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category inline|Sistine Chapel ceiling - Creation of Adam|Sistine Chapel ceiling - ''Creation of Adam''}}\n* [http://www.michelangelomodels.com Models of wax and clay used by Michelangelo in making his sculpture and paintings]\n\n{{Sistine Chapel}}\n{{Michelangelo}}\n{{Adam and Eve}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Creation Of Adam}}\n[[Category:1512 paintings]]\n[[Category:Paintings depicting Adam and Eve]]\n[[Category:Paintings of gods]]\n[[Category:Sistine Chapel ceiling]]\n", "name_user": "84.64.47.123", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eComposition)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_of_Adam"}
