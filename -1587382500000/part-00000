Generally each carrier has an advanced (police) driver, five constables and a sergeant. Territorial Support Groups often comprise three carriers, eighteen constables, and three sergeants reporting to an Inspector. They separately patrol designated patches. When deployed, it is by the MPS Information Room. Due to the public order nature of their role often numerous carriers will be assigned, a common situation being drunken rowdiness at public house closing time. TSG officers can be identified as TSG from the distinctive \"U\" in their [[collar number|shoulder numbers]].\n\n==Role==\n\nToday the TSG has three main tasks in the policing of the [[Metropolitan Police District]]:<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n* Securing the capital against [[terrorism]].\n* Responding to [[public order|disorder]] anywhere within London.\n* Reducing priority crime through [[London borough|borough]] support.\n\n===Public order===\nAlthough public order is not the TSG's only role, it is certainly their most visible and well-known. Like most [[Police Support Unit]] vehicles, TSG vans are equipped with mesh window shields and officers are equipped with [[acrylic glass]] [[riot shield]]s, visored [[Riotsquad helmet|'NATO' helmets]], shin and elbow guards, along with fireproof coveralls when required. This level of protection allows them to deal with many violent situations, including [[riot]]s, football violence and suspects armed with a variety of weapons. TSG officers are trained to a higher standard of operational readiness in their public order role than most other Police Support Units outside London; TSG training is refreshed every five weeks as a matter of routine. Exercises are conducted predominantly at the [[Metropolitan Police Specialist Training Centre|MPS Specialist Training Centre]] in [[Gravesend, Kent]], though other sites are used as required, and encompass all public order scenarios; officers will undergo extensive riot training including being petrol bombed in large-scale engagements, prison clearance tactics, [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] scenarios, night club scenarios, aircraft, rail and various 'angry-man' scenarios, as well as additional specialist training. TSG units spend considerable time training with other specialist police teams as well as certain [[military]] units. Also, if a siege situation is present, but firearms are not involved, TSG will often be deployed to counter the threat.<ref name=\"waldren\">{{Cite book|title= Armed Police, The Police Use of Firearms since 1945 |last=Waldren |first=Michael J. |authorlink= |year= 2007 |publisher= Sutton |location= England |isbn= 0-7509-4637-7 |page= 224}}</ref> Reflecting this role the unit's former head, Commander Michael Johnson, was [[Gold-silver-bronze command structure#Silver|tactical]] commander for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]].<ref name=\"MPA0915\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.mpa.gov.uk/committees/mpa/2011/0915/05/| title=Acting Commissioner\u2019s Report| accessdate=13 March 2012| last= | first= |date=15 September 2011 |work=MPA Committee Reports | publisher=MPA }}</ref>\n\n===Borough support===\nTSG provides support to regular divisional officers through high-visibility patrols, surveillance and decoy operations while also providing a presence on the streets. [[London borough|Borough]]s are also supported through the provision of a 'Commissioner's Reserve' a section of TSG that is on standby all year round; it is designed so such units are always available for rapid response of a sizeable number of officers anywhere within the Metropolis to quell public order problems, from a bar brawl to large-scale public disorder. Day to day TSG assist the boroughs in handling and relocating particularly violent prisoners.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n===Terrorism response===\nTSG is equipped and trained to deal with the aftermath or evacuation during or after a terrorism emergency in London, and the unit includes a [[CBRN]] (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) trained team. Working closely with SO15 (the Metropolitan Police [[Counter Terrorism Command]]) TSG also has counter-terrorism responsibilities.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Recruitment==\n\nPotential TSG candidates are selected from mainstream divisional officers. Officers are selected on merit and much emphasis is placed upon their personal policing ability, motivation, resilience and good communication skills. Fitness and stamina are also seen as essential attributes of TSG personnel. Applicants must be recommended by a senior officer (minimum rank of [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Inspector]]) whilst on division.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n[[File:TSG Van123.jpg|thumb|right|TSG Public Order Vehicle (Carrier)]]\n[[Mercedes Sprinter]]s are the standard vehicle of TSG and each van transports six [[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|Constable]]s and a [[Sergeant#Police 7|Sergeant]].

TSG does, however, have its own firearms capability with some officers being trained as [[Authorised Firearms Officer]]s (AFOs) on standard-issue firearms such as the [[Glock 17]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] semi-automatic carbine, as well as less-lethal weaponry such as the [[Riot gun|L104A1 Baton Gun]] and [[Taser|X26 Taser]].

He argues this because of their use of shields, batons and helmets, their centralised command structure, their willingness to use force and their squad-like formations. [[Peter Waddington]] counters this conclusion in the [[British Journal of Criminology]] by pointing out that their equipment is mainly defensive. As employees, the police force have a duty to protect them from harm, he also notes that [[paramedic]]s in riot situations also wear similar helmets and armour. Jefferson argues that by the police preparing for an event, such as a march or protest where they expect there to be violence, they create a self-fulfilling prophecy and that violence will occur. Waddington responds to this by pointing out that the TSG were deployed at the [[Notting Hill Carnival]] every year and yet there was not always violence. Jefferson also believes that by controlling the ground the TSG incites violence, Waddington cites examples (including the [[Battle of the Beanfield]]) where problems were caused by the police not controlling the ground and that when they have then tried to gain control violence ensued.\n\nWaddington states that if the presence of the TSG caused violence, then violence would not occur if they were not deployed. Waddington uses examples from three [[Poll Tax Riots]] to illustrate that the assumption that their deployment causes violence is not correct. When the TSG were not deployed, serious disorder occurred, including a fully-fledged riot. In contrast when the TSG, including specialists in riot control, were deployed there was less violence. What is more he found that the more the police planned for the 'worst-case scenario' the less disorder there was. When they controlled the space and the crowd was at its greatest, violence was lowest. Waddington states that whilst the deployment of the TSG in a riot situation is never desirable, it is often essential to maintain order and limit violence. However, he also believes that the use of force should be as minimal as possible and that it should only be used to achieve publicly acceptable purposes.<ref name=\"BJC\">{{Cite journal|last=Waddington|first=P.

Day to day TSG assist the boroughs in handling and relocating particularly violent prisoners.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n===Terrorism response===\nTSG is equipped and trained to deal with the aftermath or evacuation during or after a terrorism emergency in London, and the unit includes a [[CBRN]] (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) trained team. Working closely with SO15 (the Metropolitan Police [[Counter Terrorism Command]]) TSG also has counter-terrorism responsibilities.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Recruitment==\n\nPotential TSG candidates are selected from mainstream divisional officers. Officers are selected on merit and much emphasis is placed upon their personal policing ability, motivation, resilience and good communication skills. Fitness and stamina are also seen as essential attributes of TSG personnel. Applicants must be recommended by a senior officer (minimum rank of [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Inspector]]) whilst on division.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n[[File:TSG Van123.jpg|thumb|right|TSG Public Order Vehicle (Carrier)]]\n[[Mercedes Sprinter]]s are the standard vehicle of TSG and each van transports six [[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|Constable]]s and a [[Sergeant#Police 7|Sergeant]].

TSG does, however, have its own firearms capability with some officers being trained as [[Authorised Firearms Officer]]s (AFOs) on standard-issue firearms such as the [[Glock 17]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] semi-automatic carbine, as well as less-lethal weaponry such as the [[Riot gun|L104A1 Baton Gun]] and [[Taser|X26 Taser]].

He argues this because of their use of shields, batons and helmets, their centralised command structure, their willingness to use force and their squad-like formations. [[Peter Waddington]] counters this conclusion in the [[British Journal of Criminology]] by pointing out that their equipment is mainly defensive. As employees, the police force have a duty to protect them from harm, he also notes that [[paramedic]]s in riot situations also wear similar helmets and armour. Jefferson argues that by the police preparing for an event, such as a march or protest where they expect there to be violence, they create a self-fulfilling prophecy and that violence will occur. Waddington responds to this by pointing out that the TSG were deployed at the [[Notting Hill Carnival]] every year and yet there was not always violence. Jefferson also believes that by controlling the ground the TSG incites violence, Waddington cites examples (including the [[Battle of the Beanfield]]) where problems were caused by the police not controlling the ground and that when they have then tried to gain control violence ensued.\n\nWaddington states that if the presence of the TSG caused violence, then violence would not occur if they were not deployed. Waddington uses examples from three [[Poll Tax Riots]] to illustrate that the assumption that their deployment causes violence is not correct. When the TSG were not deployed, serious disorder occurred, including a fully-fledged riot. In contrast when the TSG, including specialists in riot control, were deployed there was less violence. What is more he found that the more the police planned for the 'worst-case scenario' the less disorder there was. When they controlled the space and the crowd was at its greatest, violence was lowest. Waddington states that whilst the deployment of the TSG in a riot situation is never desirable, it is often essential to maintain order and limit violence. However, he also believes that the use of force should be as minimal as possible and that it should only be used to achieve publicly acceptable purposes.<ref name=\"BJC\">{{Cite journal|last=Waddington|first=P.

It is also weakly glottalized in initial position.\n\n{{IPA|/k\u02b0 p\u02b0 t\u02b0/}} are more strongly aspirated in final position.\n\n{{IPA|/w d f \u0261/}} occur but only in loanwords, such as ''bweno'' from Spanish ''bueno''.\n\nAspirated and ejective consonants form [[phonemic]] contrasts: kok, kok\u02bc and k\u02bcok\u02bc all have different meanings: ('my leg', 'my tongue' and 'fire', respectively).\n\n===Syllable structure===\nAll words in Tzotzil begin with a consonant, which may be a glottal stop. Consonant clusters are almost always at the beginning of a word, with a prefix and a root. Roots in Tzotzil occur in the forms CVC (''t\u02bcul'' \"rabbit\"), CV (''to'' \"still\"), CVCVC (''bik\u02bcit'' \"small\"), CV(C)VC (''xu(v)it'' \"worm\", the second consonant disappears in some dialects), CVC-CVC (''\u02bcajnil'' \"wife\"), CVCV (''\u02bcama'' \"flute\") or CVC-CV (''vo\u02bcne'' \"long ago\"). The most common root is CVC.\n\nAlmost all Tzotzil words can be analyzed as a CVC root together with certain affixes.\n\n===Stress and intonation===\nIn normal speech, stress falls on the first syllable of the root in each word, and the last word in a phrase is heavily stressed. For words in isolation, primary stress falls on the final syllable except in affective verbs with ''-luh'', first person plural exclusive suffixes, and reduplicated stems of two syllables. Then, the stress is unpredictable and so is indicated with an acute accent. The Tzotzil variant of San Bartolom\u00e9 de Los Llanos, in the Venustiano Carranza region, was analyzed as having two phonemic [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] by Sarles 1966.<ref>Sarles, Harvey B. 1966. ''A descriptive grammar of the Tzotzil language as spoken in San Bartolom\u00e9 de Los Llanos, Chiapas, M\u00e9xico''. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Chicago.</ref> Research by Heriberto Avelino in 2009 was not able to confirm more than an unstable and incipient tone contrast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Avelino|first=Heriberto|last2=Shin|first2=Eurie|last3=Tilsen|first3=Sam|chapter=Chapter I The Phonetics of Laryngealization in Yucatec Maya|editor-last=Avelino|editor-first=Heriberto|editor2-first=Jessica|editor2-last=Coon|editor3-first=Elisabeth|editor3-last=Norcliffe|title=New perspectives in Mayan linguistics|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|url=http://www.cambridgescholars.com/new-perspectives-in-mayan-linguistics-16|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Phonological processes===\n* When intervocalic, /b/ is pre-glottalized and when it is followed by a consonant, b becomes a voiced m preceded by a glottal stop. In final position, b becomes a voiceless m preceded by a glottal stop so ''tzeb'' \"girl\" is pronounced {{IPA|[tse\u0294m\u0325]}}.\n* When adding an affix results in double fricative consonants, only one is pronounced so xx, ss, nn, or jj should be pronounced as x '''[\u0283]''', s.'''[s]''', n '''[n]''', or j '''[h]'''. For example, ''ta ssut'' \"He is returning\" is pronounced [ta sut] . Other double consonants are pronounced twice, like tztz or chch, in verbal construction or in words with the same two consonants appearing in conjoining syllables: ''chchan'' \"He learns it\" is pronounced [t\u0283-t\u0283an].\n* s changes to x when prefixed to a stem beginning with ch, ch\u02bc, or x.\n* x changes to s when prefixed to a stem with an initial or final tz or s.\n\n==Morphology==\nIn Tzotzil, only nouns, verbs, and attributives can be inflected.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns can take affixes of possession, reflexive relation, independent state (absolutive suffix), number, and exclusion, as well as agentives and nominalizing formatives.  Compounds can be formed in three ways:\n\n*nominal root+nominal root ''jol-vitz'' \"summit\" (head-hill)\n*verbal root+nominal root ''k\u02bcat-in-bak'' \"inferno\" (to burn-bone)\n*attributive root/particle+nominal root ''unen-vinik'' \"dwarf\" (small-man)\n\nAn example of a prefix for nouns is ''x-'', an indicator of a non-domesticated animal:  ''x-t\u02bcel'' \"large lizard\"\n\nThe plural suffixes for a noun change based on whether or not the noun is possessed:\n\n*''-t-ik, -ik''.  Plural suffix for possessed nouns, linked with possessive prefixes:  ''s-chikin-ik'' \"his/her/their ears\", ''k-ich\u02bcak-t-ik'' \"our fingernails\"\n*''-et-ik''.  Plural suffix for non-possessed nouns:  ''vitz-et-ik'' \"hills\", ''mut-et-ik'' \"birds\"\n*''-t-ak''.  Plural suffix for objects that come in pairs, or when it is necessary to indicate the plural of both the noun and the possessor: ''j-chikin-t-ak'' \"my (two) ears\", ''s-bi-t-ak'' \"their names\"\n\nSome nouns, such as words for body parts and kinship terms, must always be possessed.  They cannot be used without a possessive prefix, or otherwise must be used with an absolute suffix to express an indefinite possessor.  The possessive prefixes are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| k- / j-\n| k- / j-...-t-ik\n|-\n| av- / a-\n| av- / a-...-ik\n|-\n| y- / s-\n| y- / s-...-ik\n|}\n\nThe prefix listed first is the one used before a root starting with a vowel, the prefix listed second is the one used before a root starting with a consonant.  For example, k+ok ''kok'' \"my foot\", j+ba ''jba'' \"my face\"\n\nThe absolute suffix is usually ''il'' but can also have the form ''el'', ''al'', or ''ol'': ''k\u02bcob-ol'' \"hand (of some unspecified person)\"<ref name=\"Leon\">{{cite book | last = Garc\u00eda de Le\u00f3n | title = ''op. cit.''| year = 1971}}</ref>\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs receive affixes of aspect, tense, pronominal subject and object and formatives of state, voice, mood and number.  They can also form compounds in three ways:\n\n*verb+noun ''tzob-tak\u02bcin'' \"to raise money\"\n*verb+verb ''mukul-milvan'' \"to murder\"\n*attributive+verb ''ch\u02bcul-totin'' \"to become a godfather\"<ref name=\"Leon\"/>\n\n===Attributives===\nAttributives are words that can function as predicates, but are neither verbs nor nouns.  Often they can be translated into English as adjectives.  Unlike verbs, they do not inflect for aspect, and unlike nouns, they cannot head a noun phrase or combine with possessive affixes.  The composition of attributives occurs in three ways:\n\n*verbal root+noun ''ma\u02bc-sat'' \"blind\" (negative-eye)\n\nFor colors:\n\n*attributive of color+verbal root+formative ''-an'' \"shadow, shade (of color)\"   ''k\u02bcan-set\u02bc-an'' \"shade of yellow\"\n*attributive of color reduplicated+t-ik \"type of plural\"   ''tzoj-tzoj-t-ik'' < ''tzoj'' \"red\"  This construction implies intensity in the color.<ref name=\"Leon\"/>\n\n==Syntax==\nThe basic word order of Tzotzil is [[Verb\u2013object\u2013subject|VOS]] (verb-object-subject).  Subjects and direct objects are not marked for case.  The predicate agrees in person, and sometimes in number, with its subject and direct object.  Non-emphatic personal pronouns are always left out.<ref name=\"Aissen\">{{cite book | last = Aissen | year = 1987 | title = ''op. cit.'' }}</ref>\n\n===Verb agreement===\nSince the agreement system in Tzotzil is [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative-absolutive]], the subject of an intransitive verb and the direct object of a transitive verb are marked by the same set of affixes, while the subject of a transitive is marked with a different set of affixes.  For example, compare the affixes in the following sentences:\n\n*l- '''i-''' ''tal'' '''-otik''' \"We ([[clusivity|inclusive]]) came.\"\n*\u02bci '''j-''' ''pet'' '''-tik''' lok\u02bcel ti vinik -e \"We ([[clusivity|inclusive]]) carried away the man.\"\n\nIn the first sentence, the intransitive verb ''tal'' (\"come\") is affixed by '''-i-...-otik''' to show that the subject is the 1st person plural inclusive \"we,\" but in the second sentence, since the verb  ''pet'' (\"carry\") is transitive, it is affixed by '''j-...-tik''' to mark the subject as the 1st person plural inclusive \"we.\"\n\n*l- '''i-''' s- ''pet'' '''-otik''' \"He carried us ([[clusivity|inclusive]])\"\n\nFrom this sentence we can see that the 1st person plural inclusive object \"us\" is being marked the same as the 1st person plural inclusive intransitive subject \"we\" using '''-i-...-otik'''.  Thus, '''-i-...-otik''' is the [[ergative-absolutive language|absolutive]] marker for 1st person plural inclusive and '''j-...-tik''' is the [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] marker for 1st person plural inclusive.\n\nAlso from the sentence l- '''i-''' s- ''pet'' '''-otik''' \"He carried us ([[clusivity|inclusive]])\" it is possible to see the 3rd person ergative marking s-, which contrasts with the 3rd person absolutive marking \u00d8 in the sentence \u02bci- ''tal'' \"He/she/it/they came.\"<ref name=\"Aissen\"/>\n\n===Enumeration===\nWith many nouns, numbers must be compounded to numeral classifiers that correspond to the physical nature of the object being counted.  This precedes the noun being counted.  For example, in ''vak-p\u02bcej na'' \"six houses\" the classifier ''-p\u02bcej'' \"round things, houses, flowers, etc.\" is compounded to the number ''vak'' \"six\" and precedes the noun ''na'' \"house(s).\"<ref name=\"Haviland\">{{cite book | last = Haviland | year = 1981 | title = ''op. cit.'' }}</ref>\n\n==Sample lexicon==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The most common root is CVC.\n\nAlmost all Tzotzil words can be analyzed as a CVC root together with certain affixes.\n\n===Stress and intonation===\nIn normal speech, stress falls on the first syllable of the root in each word, and the last word in a phrase is heavily stressed. For words in isolation, primary stress falls on the final syllable except in affective verbs with ''-luh'', first person plural exclusive suffixes, and reduplicated stems of two syllables. Then, the stress is unpredictable and so is indicated with an acute accent. The Tzotzil variant of San Bartolom\u00e9 de Los Llanos, in the Venustiano Carranza region, was analyzed as having two phonemic [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] by Sarles 1966.<ref>Sarles, Harvey B. 1966. ''A descriptive grammar of the Tzotzil language as spoken in San Bartolom\u00e9 de Los Llanos, Chiapas, M\u00e9xico''. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Chicago.</ref> Research by Heriberto Avelino in 2009 was not able to confirm more than an unstable and incipient tone contrast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Avelino|first=Heriberto|last2=Shin|first2=Eurie|last3=Tilsen|first3=Sam|chapter=Chapter I The Phonetics of Laryngealization in Yucatec Maya|editor-last=Avelino|editor-first=Heriberto|editor2-first=Jessica|editor2-last=Coon|editor3-first=Elisabeth|editor3-last=Norcliffe|title=New perspectives in Mayan linguistics|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|url=http://www.cambridgescholars.com/new-perspectives-in-mayan-linguistics-16|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Phonological processes===\n* When intervocalic, /b/ is pre-glottalized and when it is followed by a consonant, b becomes a voiced m preceded by a glottal stop. In final position, b becomes a voiceless m preceded by a glottal stop so ''tzeb'' \"girl\" is pronounced {{IPA|[tse\u0294m\u0325]}}.\n* When adding an affix results in double fricative consonants, only one is pronounced so xx, ss, nn, or jj should be pronounced as x '''[\u0283]''', s.'''[s]''', n '''[n]''', or j '''[h]'''. For example, ''ta ssut'' \"He is returning\" is pronounced [ta sut] . Other double consonants are pronounced twice, like tztz or chch, in verbal construction or in words with the same two consonants appearing in conjoining syllables: ''chchan'' \"He learns it\" is pronounced [t\u0283-t\u0283an].\n* s changes to x when prefixed to a stem beginning with ch, ch\u02bc, or x.\n* x changes to s when prefixed to a stem with an initial or final tz or s.\n\n==Morphology==\nIn Tzotzil, only nouns, verbs, and attributives can be inflected.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns can take affixes of possession, reflexive relation, independent state (absolutive suffix), number, and exclusion, as well as agentives and nominalizing formatives.  Compounds can be formed in three ways:\n\n*nominal root+nominal root ''jol-vitz'' \"summit\" (head-hill)\n*verbal root+nominal root ''k\u02bcat-in-bak'' \"inferno\" (to burn-bone)\n*attributive root/particle+nominal root ''unen-vinik'' \"dwarf\" (small-man)\n\nAn example of a prefix for nouns is ''x-'', an indicator of a non-domesticated animal:  ''x-t\u02bcel'' \"large lizard\"\n\nThe plural suffixes for a noun change based on whether or not the noun is possessed:\n\n*''-t-ik, -ik''.  Plural suffix for possessed nouns, linked with possessive prefixes:  ''s-chikin-ik'' \"his/her/their ears\", ''k-ich\u02bcak-t-ik'' \"our fingernails\"\n*''-et-ik''.  Plural suffix for non-possessed nouns:  ''vitz-et-ik'' \"hills\", ''mut-et-ik'' \"birds\"\n*''-t-ak''.  Plural suffix for objects that come in pairs, or when it is necessary to indicate the plural of both the noun and the possessor: ''j-chikin-t-ak'' \"my (two) ears\", ''s-bi-t-ak'' \"their names\"\n\nSome nouns, such as words for body parts and kinship terms, must always be possessed.  They cannot be used without a possessive prefix, or otherwise must be used with an absolute suffix to express an indefinite possessor.  The possessive prefixes are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| k- / j-\n| k- / j-...-t-ik\n|-\n| av- / a-\n| av- / a-...-ik\n|-\n| y- / s-\n| y- / s-...-ik\n|}\n\nThe prefix listed first is the one used before a root starting with a vowel, the prefix listed second is the one used before a root starting with a consonant.  For example, k+ok ''kok'' \"my foot\", j+ba ''jba'' \"my face\"\n\nThe absolute suffix is usually ''il'' but can also have the form ''el'', ''al'', or ''ol'': ''k\u02bcob-ol'' \"hand (of some unspecified person)\"<ref name=\"Leon\">{{cite book | last = Garc\u00eda de Le\u00f3n | title = ''op. cit.''| year = 1971}}</ref>\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs receive affixes of aspect, tense, pronominal subject and object and formatives of state, voice, mood and number.  They can also form compounds in three ways:\n\n*verb+noun ''tzob-tak\u02bcin'' \"to raise money\"\n*verb+verb ''mukul-milvan'' \"to murder\"\n*attributive+verb ''ch\u02bcul-totin'' \"to become a godfather\"<ref name=\"Leon\"/>\n\n===Attributives===\nAttributives are words that can function as predicates, but are neither verbs nor nouns.  Often they can be translated into English as adjectives.  Unlike verbs, they do not inflect for aspect, and unlike nouns, they cannot head a noun phrase or combine with possessive affixes.  The composition of attributives occurs in three ways:\n\n*verbal root+noun ''ma\u02bc-sat'' \"blind\" (negative-eye)\n\nFor colors:\n\n*attributive of color+verbal root+formative ''-an'' \"shadow, shade (of color)\"   ''k\u02bcan-set\u02bc-an'' \"shade of yellow\"\n*attributive of color reduplicated+t-ik \"type of plural\"   ''tzoj-tzoj-t-ik'' < ''tzoj'' \"red\"  This construction implies intensity in the color.<ref name=\"Leon\"/>\n\n==Syntax==\nThe basic word order of Tzotzil is VOS (verb-object-subject).  Subjects and direct objects are not marked for case.  The predicate agrees in person, and sometimes in number, with its subject and direct object.  Non-emphatic personal pronouns are always left out.<ref name=\"Aissen\">{{cite book | last = Aissen | year = 1987 | title = ''op. cit.'' }}</ref>\n\n===Verb agreement===\nSince the agreement system in Tzotzil is [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative-absolutive]], the subject of an intransitive verb and the direct object of a transitive verb are marked by the same set of affixes, while the subject of a transitive is marked with a different set of affixes.  For example, compare the affixes in the following sentences:\n\n*l- '''i-''' ''tal'' '''-otik''' \"We ([[clusivity|inclusive]]) came.\"\n*\u02bci '''j-''' ''pet'' '''-tik''' lok\u02bcel ti vinik -e \"We ([[clusivity|inclusive]]) carried away the man.\"\n\nIn the first sentence, the intransitive verb ''tal'' (\"come\") is affixed by '''-i-...-otik''' to show that the subject is the 1st person plural inclusive \"we,\" but in the second sentence, since the verb  ''pet'' (\"carry\") is transitive, it is affixed by '''j-...-tik''' to mark the subject as the 1st person plural inclusive \"we.\"\n\n*l- '''i-''' s- ''pet'' '''-otik''' \"He carried us ([[clusivity|inclusive]])\"\n\nFrom this sentence we can see that the 1st person plural inclusive object \"us\" is being marked the same as the 1st person plural inclusive intransitive subject \"we\" using '''-i-...-otik'''.  Thus, '''-i-...-otik''' is the [[ergative-absolutive language|absolutive]] marker for 1st person plural inclusive and '''j-...-tik''' is the [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] marker for 1st person plural inclusive.\n\nAlso from the sentence l- '''i-''' s- ''pet'' '''-otik''' \"He carried us ([[clusivity|inclusive]])\" it is possible to see the 3rd person ergative marking s-, which contrasts with the 3rd person absolutive marking \u00d8 in the sentence \u02bci- ''tal'' \"He/she/it/they came.\"<ref name=\"Aissen\"/>\n\n===Enumeration===\nWith many nouns, numbers must be compounded to numeral classifiers that correspond to the physical nature of the object being counted.  This precedes the noun being counted.  For example, in ''vak-p\u02bcej na'' \"six houses\" the classifier ''-p\u02bcej'' \"round things, houses, flowers, etc.\" is compounded to the number ''vak'' \"six\" and precedes the noun ''na'' \"house(s).\"<ref name=\"Haviland\">{{cite book | last = Haviland | year = 1981 | title = ''op. cit.'' }}</ref>\n\n==Sample lexicon==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It is loosely based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[Casino Royale (novel)|first James Bond novel]]. The film stars [[David Niven]] as the \"original\" Bond, [[James Bond filmography|Sir James Bond 007]]. Forced out of retirement to investigate the deaths and disappearances of international spies, he soon battles the mysterious Dr. Noah and [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]]. The film's tagline: \"Casino Royale is too much... for one James Bond!\" refers to Bond's ruse to mislead SMERSH in which six other agents are pretending to be \"James Bond\", namely, [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] master Evelyn Tremble ([[Peter Sellers]]); millionaire spy [[Vesper Lynd]] ([[Ursula Andress]]); Bond's secretary [[Miss Moneypenny]] ([[Barbara Bouchet]]); Bond's daughter by [[Mata Hari]], Mata Bond ([[Joanna Pettet]]); and British agents Coop ([[Terence Cooper]]) and The Detainer ([[Daliah Lavi]]).\n\n[[Charles K. Feldman]], the producer, had acquired the film rights in 1960 and had attempted to get ''Casino Royale'' made as an [[Eon Productions]] [[James Bond in film|Bond film]]; however, Feldman and the producers of the Eon series, [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], failed to come to terms. Believing that he could not compete with the Eon series, Feldman resolved to produce the film as a satire. The budget escalated as various directors and writers became involved in the production, and actors expressed dissatisfaction with the project.\n\n''Casino Royale'' was released on 13 April 1967, two months prior to Eon's fifth Bond movie, ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''. The film was a financial success, grossing over $41.7 million worldwide, and  [[Burt Bacharach]]'s musical score was praised, earning him an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for the song \"[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]\". Critical reception to ''Casino Royale'', however, was generally negative, with many reviewers regarding it as a baffling, disorganised affair. Since 1999, the film's rights have been held by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], distributors of the official Bond movies by Eon Productions.\n\n==Plot==\nSir James Bond 007, a legendary British [[spy]] who retired from the secret service 20 years previously, is visited by the head of British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], [[M (James Bond)|M]], [[CIA]] representative Ransome, [[KGB]] representative Smernov, and [[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]] representative Le Grand. All implore Bond to come out of retirement to deal with [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] who have been eliminating agents: Bond spurns all their pleas. When Bond continues to stand firm, his mansion is destroyed by a mortar attack at the orders of M, who is, however, killed in the explosion.\n\nBond travels to Scotland to return M's remains to his grieving widow, Lady Fiona McTarry.  However, the real Lady Fiona has been replaced by SMERSH's Agent Mimi.  The rest of the household have been likewise replaced, with SMERSH's aim to discredit Bond by destroying his \"celibate image\". Attempts by a bevy of beauties to seduce Bond fail, but Mimi/Lady Fiona becomes so impressed with Bond that she changes loyalties and helps Bond to foil the plot against him.  On his way back to London, Bond survives another attempt on his life.\n\nBond is promoted to the head of MI6. He learns that many British agents around the world have been eliminated by enemy spies because of their inability to resist sex. Bond is also told that the \"sex maniac\" who was given the name of \"James Bond\" when the original Bond retired has gone to work in television. He then orders that all remaining MI6 agents will be named \"James Bond 007\", to confuse SMERSH. He also creates a rigorous programme to train male agents to ignore the charms of women. Moneypenny recruits Coop, a karate expert who begins training to resist seductive women: he also meets an exotic agent known as the Detainer.\n\nBond then hires Vesper Lynd, a retired agent turned millionaire, to recruit [[baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] expert Evelyn Tremble, whom he intends to use to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre. Having embezzled SMERSH's money, Le Chiffre is desperate for money to cover up his theft before he is executed.\n\nFollowing up a clue from agent Mimi, Bond persuades his estranged daughter Mata Bond to travel to West Berlin to infiltrate International Mothers' Help, an [[au pair]] service that is a cover for a SMERSH training center. Mata uncovers a plan to sell compromising photographs of military leaders from the US, USSR, China and Great Britain at an \"art auction\", another scheme Le Chiffre hopes to use to raise money. Mata destroys the photos. Le Chiffre's only remaining option is to raise the money by playing baccarat.\n\nTremble arrives at the Casino Royale accompanied by Lynd, who foils an attempt to disable him by seductive SMERSH agent Miss Goodthighs. Later that night, Tremble observes Le Chiffre playing at the casino and realises that he is using infrared sunglasses to cheat. Lynd steals the sunglasses, allowing Evelyn to eventually beat Le Chiffre in a game of baccarat. Lynd is apparently abducted outside the casino, and Tremble is also kidnapped while pursuing her. Le Chiffre, desperate for the winning cheque, [[hallucinogenic]]ally tortures Tremble. Lynd rescues Tremble, only to subsequently kill him. Meanwhile, SMERSH agents raid Le Chiffre's base and kill him.\n\nIn London, Mata is kidnapped by SMERSH in a giant [[flying saucer]], and Sir James and Moneypenny travel to Casino Royale to rescue her. They discover that the casino is located atop a giant underground headquarters run by the evil Dr. Noah, secretly Sir James's nephew Jimmy Bond, a former MI6 agent who defected to SMERSH to spite his famous uncle. Jimmy reveals that he plans to use [[biological warfare]] to make all women beautiful and kill all men over {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|adj=on}} tall, leaving him as the \"big man\" who gets all the girls. Jimmy has already captured The Detainer, and he tries to convince her to be his partner; she agrees, but only to dupe him into swallowing one of his atomic time pills, turning him into a walking atomic bomb.\n\nSir James, Moneypenny, Mata and Coop manage to escape from their cell and fight their way back to the casino director's office where Sir James establishes Lynd is a double agent. The casino is then overrun by secret agents and a battle ensues. American and French support arrive, but just add to the chaos.

Feldman]] represented Ratoff's widow and bought the ''Casino Royale'' rights.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" />{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=56}} [[Albert R. Broccoli]], who had held an interest in adapting James Bond for some years, offered to purchase the ''Casino Royale'' rights from Feldman, but he declined.<ref>{{cite book|title=When the Snow Melts: The Autobiography of Cubby Broccoli|author1=Broccoli, Albert R. |author2=Zec, Donald |page=199|publisher=Boxtree|year=1998|ISBN=0752211625}}</ref> Feldman and his friend, the director [[Howard Hawks]], had an interest in adapting ''Casino Royale'', considering [[Leigh Brackett]] as a writer and [[Cary Grant]] as James Bond. They eventually gave up once they saw the film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), the first Bond adaptation made by Broccoli and his partner [[Harry Saltzman]] through their company [[Eon Productions]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood|pp=595, 629|author=McCarthy, Todd|publisher=Grove Press|year=2007|ISBN=0802196403}}</ref>\n\nBy 1964, with Feldman having invested nearly $550,000 of his own money into pre-production of ''Casino Royale'', he decided to try a deal with Eon Productions and its distributor [[United Artists]]. The attempt at a co-production eventually fell through as Feldman frequently argued with Broccoli and Saltzman, especially regarding the profit divisions and when the ''Casino Royale'' adaptation would start production. Feldman approached [[Sean Connery]] to play Bond, but rejected Connery's offer to do the film for one million dollars.<ref>Sellers, Robert ''Sean Connery: A Celebration'' Robert Hale, 1 December 1999, p. 62</ref> Feldman eventually decided to offer his project to [[Columbia Pictures]] through a script written by [[Ben Hecht]], and the studio accepted. Given Eon's series led to spy films being in vogue at the time, Feldman opted to make his film a spoof of the Bond series instead of a straightforward adaptation.<ref name= Missing/>\n\n===Screenplay development===\nBen Hecht's contribution to the project, if not the final result, was in fact substantial and he wrote several complete drafts. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported in May 1966 that Hecht had \"three bashes\" at completing a script, while his papers contain material from four surviving screenplays by Hecht.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" /> His treatments were almost entirely \"straight\" adaptations, far closer to the original source novel than the spoof which the final production became. A draft from 1957 discovered in Hecht's papers \u2013 but which does not identify the screenwriter \u2013 is a direct adaptation of the novel, albeit with the Bond character absent, instead being replaced by a poker-playing American gangster.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" />\n\nLater drafts see [[vice]] made central to the plot, with the Le Chiffre character becoming head of a network of [[brothel]]s (as he is in the novel) whose patrons are then [[blackmail]]ed by Le Chiffre to fund Spectre (an invention of the screenwriter). The racy plot elements opened up by this change of background include a chase scene through [[Hamburg]]'s red light district that results in Bond escaping whilst disguised as a female [[mud wrestler]]. New characters appear such as Lili Wing, a brothel [[Pimp|madam]] and former lover of Bond whose ultimate fate is to be crushed in the back of a garbage truck, and Gita, wife of Le Chiffre. The beautiful Gita, whose face and throat are hideously disfigured as a result of Bond using her as a shield during a gunfight in the same sequence which sees Wing meet her fate, goes on to become the prime protagonist in the torture scene that features in the book, a role originally Le Chiffre's.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" />\n\nVirtually nothing from Hecht's scripts was ever filmed, although a draft dated to February 1964 has a line of dialogue containing the idea of MI6 having giving multiple agents the name of James Bond after Bond has died to confuse the other side.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" /> Hecht died from a heart attack in April 1964, two days after finishing his script and before he was able to present it to Feldman. [[Joseph Heller]] (and his friend [[George Mandel]]) worked on the project for a few weeks in early 1965 submitting  more than 100 pages after Feldman offered Heller $150,000. Heller later wrote about this episode in ''How I found James Bond, lost my self-respect and almost made $150,000 in my spare time''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Duns|first=Jeremy|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/catch-007-how-joseph-heller-almost-wrote-casino-royale-wc5hnv0h9|title=Catch 007: how Joseph Heller almost wrote Casino Royale|work=The Times|location=London|date=20 April 2020|access-date=20 April 2020}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported in 1966 that the script had been completely re-written by [[Billy Wilder]], and by the time the film reached production only the idea that the name James Bond should be given to a number of other agents remained. This key [[plot device]] in the finished film, in the case of Hecht's version, occurs after the demise of the original James Bond (an event which happened prior to the beginning of his story) which, as Hecht's M puts it, \"not only perpetuates his memory, but confuses the opposition.\"<ref name=\"Duns2011\" />\n\nPeter Sellers hired [[Terry Southern]] to write his dialogue (and not the rest of the script) to \"outshine\" Orson Welles and Woody Allen.<ref>Gerber, Gail & Lisanti, Tom.

Extensive sequences also featured London, notably [[Trafalgar Square]] and the exterior of [[10 Downing Street]]. [[Mereworth Castle]] in [[Kent]] was used as the home of Sir James Bond, which is blown up at the start of the film.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1967/03/casino-royale-1967/|title=Kent Film Office Casino Royal Film Focus|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185440/http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1967/03/casino-royale-1967/|archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref> Much of the filming for M's Scottish castle was actually done on location in [[County Meath]], [[Ireland]], with [[Killeen Castle, Dunsany|Killeen Castle]] as the focus.<ref>{{cite web |title=Casino Royale |url=http://www.british-film-locations.com/Casino-Royale-1967 |publisher=British-Film-Locations.com |date=2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413234451/http://www.british-film-locations.com/Casino-Royale-1967 |archivedate=13 April 2015  }}</ref> However, the car chase sequences where Bond leaves the castle were shot in the [[Perthshire]] village of [[Killin]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Casino Royale |url=http://www.scotlandthemovie.com/movies/caskill.html |publisher=Scotland: the Movie Location Guide |date=2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095437/http://www.scotlandthemovie.com/movies/caskill.html |archivedate=24 September 2015  }}</ref> with further sequences in [[Berkshire]] (specifically [[Old Windsor]] and [[Bracknell]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britmovie.co.uk/forums/film-locations/115229-sixties-casino-royale-car-chase-locations-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 July 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816154900/http://www.britmovie.co.uk/forums/film-locations/115229-sixties-casino-royale-car-chase-locations-2.html |archivedate=16 August 2016  }}</ref>\n\nThe production proved to be rather troubled, with five different directors helming different segments of the film and with stunt co-ordinator [[Richard Talmadge]] co-directing the final sequence. In addition to the credited writers, Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, [[Val Guest]], [[Ben Hecht]], [[Joseph Heller]], Terry Southern, and Billy Wilder are all believed to have contributed to the screenplay to varying degrees. Val Guest was given the responsibility of splicing the various \"chapters\" together, and was offered the unique title of co-ordinating director but declined, claiming the chaotic plot would not reflect well on him if he were so credited. His extra credit was labelled 'additional sequences' instead.<ref name=Pictures>Guest, Val. ''So you want to be in Pictures'', Reynolds & Hearn, 2001, {{ISBN|1-903111-15-3}}</ref>\n\nPart of the behind-the-scenes drama of this film's production concerned the filming of the segments involving [[Peter Sellers]]. Screenwriter [[Wolf Mankowitz]] declared that Sellers felt intimidated by [[Orson Welles]] to the extent that, except for a couple of shots, neither was in the studio simultaneously. Other versions of the legend depict the drama stemming from Sellers being slighted, in favour of Welles, by [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] (whom Sellers knew) during her visit to the set. Welles also insisted on performing magic tricks as Le Chiffre, and the director obliged. Director Val Guest wrote that Welles did not think much of Sellers, and had refused to work with \"that amateur\". Director [[Joseph McGrath (film director)|Joseph McGrath]], a personal friend of Sellers, was punched by the actor when he complained about Sellers's behaviour on the set.<ref>Sikov, Ed. ''Mr Strangelove: A Biography of Peter Sellers''. Pan Macmillan, 2011. {{ISBN|1447207149}}. pp. 310\u20133</ref>\n\nSome biographies of Sellers suggest that he took the role of Bond to heart, and was annoyed at the decision to make ''Casino Royale'' a comedy, as he wanted to play Bond straight. This is illustrated in somewhat fictionalised form in the film ''[[The Life and Death of Peter Sellers]]'', based on the biography by [[Roger Lewis]], who has claimed  that Sellers kept re-writing and improvising scenes to make them play seriously. This story is in agreement with the observation that the only parts of the film close to the book are the ones featuring Sellers and Welles.<ref name=Sellers>Lewis, Roger. ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers'', Applause Books, 2000, {{ISBN|1-55783-248-X}}</ref> In the end, Sellers's involvement with the film was cut abruptly short.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n[[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] and [[George Raft]] received [[opening credits|major billing]], even though each actor appears only briefly. Both appear during the climactic brawl at the end, Raft flipping his trademark coin and promptly shooting himself dead with a backward-firing pistol, while Belmondo appears wearing a fake moustache as the [[French Foreign Legion]] officer who requires an English phrase book to translate ''\"[[Shit|merde]]!\"'' into \"ooch!\" during his fistfight.<ref name=Playboy/> Raft's coin flip, which originally appeared in ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), had been spoofed a few years earlier in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959).<ref>{{cite book|title=Gangster Films|author=Smith, Jim|publisher=Virgin Books|year=2004|ISBN=0753508389|page=34}}</ref>\n\nAt the Intercon science fiction convention held in [[Slough]] in 1978, [[David Prowse]] commented on his part in this film, apparently his big-screen debut. He claimed that he was originally asked to play \"Super Pooh\", a giant [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] in a superhero costume who attacks Tremble during the Torture of The Mind sequence. This idea, as with many others in the film's script, was rapidly dropped, and Prowse was re-cast as a [[Frankenstein]]-type monster for the closing scenes. The final sequence was principally directed by former actor and stuntman [[Richard Talmadge]].<ref name=Missing />\n\n'''Director credits:'''{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=63}}\n{{unbulleted list\n| Val Guest (additional sequences; scenes with Woody Allen and additional scenes with David Niven)\n| [[Ken Hughes]] (Berlin scenes)\n| John Huston (scenes at Sir James Bond's house and scenes at Scottish castle)\n| [[Joseph McGrath (film director)|Joseph McGrath]] (scenes with Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress and Orson Welles)\n| [[Robert Parrish]] (some casino scenes with Peter Sellers and Orson Welles)\n| [[Richard Talmadge]] (second unit)\n}}\n\n===Unfinished scenes===\nSellers went absent for days or weeks at a time, refused to appear in his scenes with Welles<ref name=Sellers /> and left the production before all of his scenes had been shot.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stafford |first=Jeff |title=Casino Royale |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/21301%7C0/Casino-Royale.html |website=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref> As a result, Sellers was unavailable for the filming of an ending and other interlinking scenes, leaving the filmmakers to devise a way to make the existing footage work without him.

Evelyn Tremble is not captured on camera; an outtake of Sellers entering a racing car was substituted. In this outtake, he calls for the car, \u00e0 la ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'', to chase down Vesper and her kidnappers; the next thing that is shown is Tremble being tortured. Out-takes of Sellers were also used for Tremble's dream sequence (pretending to play the piano on [[Ursula Andress]]' torso), in the finale \u2013 blowing out the candles whilst in highland dress \u2013 and at the end of the film when all the various \"James Bond doubles\" are together. In the kidnap sequence, Tremble's death is also very abruptly inserted; it consists of pre-existing footage of Tremble being rescued by Vesper, followed by a later-filmed shot of her abruptly deciding to shoot him, followed by a freeze-frame over some of the previous footage of her surrounded by bodies (noticeably a zoom-in on the previous shot).<ref name=Missing />\n\nAs well as this, an entire sequence involving Tremble going to the front for the underground James Bond training school (which turns out to be under [[Harrods]], of which the training area was the lowest level) was never shot, thus creating an abrupt cut from Vesper announcing that Tremble will be James Bond to Tremble exiting the lift into the training school.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nMany sequences from the film were dropped, so that several actors never appeared in the final cut, including [[Ian Hendry]] (as 006, the agent whose body is briefly seen being disposed of by Vesper), [[Mona Washbourne]] and [[Arthur Mullard]].<ref name=Missing />\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Casino Royale\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Burt Bacharach]], [[Herb Alpert|Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass]] and [[Dusty Springfield]]\n| cover      = Burt Bacharach - Casino Royale (1967 soundtrack).png\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1967\n| recorded   = 1967\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 34:27\n| label      = [[Colgems]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = Casino Royale Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]\n | single1date = 29 January 1967\n}}\n}}\nFor the music, Feldman decided to bring in [[Burt Bacharach]], who had done the score for his previous production ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]''.

It is loosely based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[Casino Royale (novel)|first James Bond novel]]. The film stars [[David Niven]] as the \"original\" Bond, [[James Bond filmography|Sir James Bond 007]]. Forced out of retirement to investigate the deaths and disappearances of international spies, he soon battles the mysterious Dr. Noah and [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]]. The film's tagline: \"Casino Royale is too much... for one James Bond!\" refers to Bond's ruse to mislead SMERSH in which six other agents are pretending to be \"James Bond\", namely, [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] master Evelyn Tremble ([[Peter Sellers]]); millionaire spy [[Vesper Lynd]] ([[Ursula Andress]]); Bond's secretary [[Miss Moneypenny]] ([[Barbara Bouchet]]); Bond's daughter by [[Mata Hari]], Mata Bond ([[Joanna Pettet]]); and British agents Coop ([[Terence Cooper]]) and The Detainer ([[Daliah Lavi]]).\n\n[[Charles K. Feldman]], the producer, had acquired the film rights in 1960 and had attempted to get ''Casino Royale'' made as an [[Eon Productions]] [[James Bond in film|Bond film]]; however, Feldman and the producers of the Eon series, [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], failed to come to terms. Believing that he could not compete with the Eon series, Feldman resolved to produce the film as a satire. The budget escalated as various directors and writers became involved in the production, and actors expressed dissatisfaction with the project.\n\n''Casino Royale'' was released on 13 April 1967, two months prior to Eon's fifth Bond movie, ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''. The film was a financial success, grossing over $41.7 million worldwide, and  [[Burt Bacharach]]'s musical score was praised, earning him an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for the song \"[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]\". Critical reception to ''Casino Royale'', however, was generally negative, with many reviewers regarding it as a baffling, disorganized affair. Since 1999, the film's rights have been held by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], distributors of the official Bond movies by Eon Productions.\n\n==Plot==\nSir James Bond 007, a legendary British [[spy]] who retired from the secret service 20 years previously, is visited by the head of British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], [[M (James Bond)|M]], [[CIA]] representative Ransome, [[KGB]] representative Smernov, and [[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]] representative Le Grand. All implore Bond to come out of retirement to deal with [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] who have been eliminating agents: Bond spurns all their pleas. When Bond continues to stand firm, his mansion is destroyed by a mortar attack at the orders of M, who is, however, killed in the explosion.\n\nBond travels to Scotland to return M's remains to his grieving widow, Lady Fiona McTarry.  However, the real Lady Fiona has been replaced by SMERSH's Agent Mimi.  The rest of the household have been likewise replaced, with SMERSH's aim to discredit Bond by destroying his \"celibate image\". Attempts by a bevy of beauties to seduce Bond fail, but Mimi/Lady Fiona becomes so impressed with Bond that she changes loyalties and helps Bond to foil the plot against him.  On his way back to London, Bond survives another attempt on his life.\n\nBond is promoted to the head of MI6. He learns that many British agents around the world have been eliminated by enemy spies because of their inability to resist sex. Bond is also told that the \"sex maniac\" who was given the name of \"James Bond\" when the original Bond retired has gone to work in television. He then orders that all remaining MI6 agents will be named \"James Bond 007\", to confuse SMERSH. He also creates a rigorous programme to train male agents to ignore the charms of women. Moneypenny recruits Coop, a karate expert who begins training to resist seductive women: he also meets an exotic agent known as the Detainer.\n\nBond then hires Vesper Lynd, a retired agent turned millionaire, to recruit [[baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] expert Evelyn Tremble, whom he intends to use to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre. Having embezzled SMERSH's money, Le Chiffre is desperate for money to cover up his theft before he is executed.\n\nFollowing up a clue from agent Mimi, Bond persuades his estranged daughter Mata Bond to travel to West Berlin to infiltrate International Mothers' Help, an [[au pair]] service that is a cover for a SMERSH training center. Mata uncovers a plan to sell compromising photographs of military leaders from the US, USSR, China and Great Britain at an \"art auction\", another scheme Le Chiffre hopes to use to raise money. Mata destroys the photos. Le Chiffre's only remaining option is to raise the money by playing baccarat.\n\nTremble arrives at the Casino Royale accompanied by Lynd, who foils an attempt to disable him by seductive SMERSH agent Miss Goodthighs. Later that night, Tremble observes Le Chiffre playing at the casino and realises that he is using infrared sunglasses to cheat. Lynd steals the sunglasses, allowing Evelyn to eventually beat Le Chiffre in a game of baccarat. Lynd is apparently abducted outside the casino, and Tremble is also kidnapped while pursuing her. Le Chiffre, desperate for the winning cheque, [[hallucinogenic]]ally tortures Tremble. Lynd rescues Tremble, only to subsequently kill him. Meanwhile, SMERSH agents raid Le Chiffre's base and kill him.\n\nIn London, Mata is kidnapped by SMERSH in a giant [[flying saucer]], and Sir James and Moneypenny travel to Casino Royale to rescue her. They discover that the casino is located atop a giant underground headquarters run by the evil Dr. Noah, secretly Sir James's nephew Jimmy Bond, a former MI6 agent who defected to SMERSH to spite his famous uncle. Jimmy reveals that he plans to use [[biological warfare]] to make all women beautiful and kill all men over {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|adj=on}} tall, leaving him as the \"big man\" who gets all the girls. Jimmy has already captured The Detainer, and he tries to convince her to be his partner; she agrees, but only to dupe him into swallowing one of his atomic time pills, turning him into a walking atomic bomb.\n\nSir James, Moneypenny, Mata and Coop manage to escape from their cell and fight their way back to the casino director's office where Sir James establishes Lynd is a double agent. The casino is then overrun by secret agents and a battle ensues. American and French support arrive, but just add to the chaos. Jimmy counts down a series of hiccups, each bringing him closer to doom. Eventually the atomic pill explodes, destroying Casino Royale with everyone inside. Sir James and all of his agents then appear in heaven, and Jimmy Bond is shown descending to hell.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Niven]] as [[James Bond (literary character)|Sir James Bond]]: A legendary British secret agent forced out of retirement to fight SMERSH.\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Evelyn Tremble / James Bond: A [[baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] master recruited by Vesper Lynd to challenge [[Le Chiffre]] at ''Casino Royale''.\n* [[Ursula Andress]] as [[Vesper Lynd]] / James Bond: A retired British secret agent forced back into service in exchange for writing off her tax arrears.\n* [[Joanna Pettet]] as Mata Bond / James Bond: Bond's daughter, born of his love affair with [[Mata Hari]].\n* [[Daliah Lavi]] as The Detainer / James Bond: A British secret agent who successfully poisons Dr. Noah with his own atomic pill.\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Dr. Noah / Jimmy Bond: Bond's nephew and head of SMERSH under his Dr. Noah alias.

Feldman]] represented Ratoff's widow and bought the ''Casino Royale'' rights.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" />{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=56}} [[Albert R. Broccoli]], who had held an interest in adapting James Bond for some years, offered to purchase the ''Casino Royale'' rights from Feldman, but he declined.<ref>{{cite book|title=When the Snow Melts: The Autobiography of Cubby Broccoli|author1=Broccoli, Albert R. |author2=Zec, Donald |page=199|publisher=Boxtree|year=1998|ISBN=0752211625}}</ref> Feldman and his friend, the director [[Howard Hawks]], had an interest in adapting ''Casino Royale'', considering [[Leigh Brackett]] as a writer and [[Cary Grant]] as James Bond. They eventually gave up once they saw the film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), the first Bond adaptation made by Broccoli and his partner [[Harry Saltzman]] through their company [[Eon Productions]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood|pp=595, 629|author=McCarthy, Todd|publisher=Grove Press|year=2007|ISBN=0802196403}}</ref>\n\nBy 1964, with Feldman having invested nearly $550,000 of his own money into pre-production of ''Casino Royale'', he decided to try a deal with Eon Productions and its distributor [[United Artists]]. The attempt at a co-production eventually fell through as Feldman frequently argued with Broccoli and Saltzman, especially regarding the profit divisions and when the ''Casino Royale'' adaptation would start production. Feldman approached [[Sean Connery]] to play Bond, but rejected Connery's offer to do the film for one million dollars.<ref>Sellers, Robert ''Sean Connery: A Celebration'' Robert Hale, 1 December 1999, p. 62</ref> Feldman eventually decided to offer his project to [[Columbia Pictures]] through a script written by [[Ben Hecht]], and the studio accepted. Given Eon's series led to spy films being in vogue at the time, Feldman opted to make his film a spoof of the Bond series instead of a straightforward adaptation.<ref name= Missing/>\n\n===Screenplay development===\nBen Hecht's contribution to the project, if not the final result, was in fact substantial and he wrote several complete drafts. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported in May 1966 that Hecht had \"three bashes\" at completing a script, while his papers contain material from four surviving screenplays by Hecht.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" /> His treatments were almost entirely \"straight\" adaptations, far closer to the original source novel than the spoof which the final production became. A draft from 1957 discovered in Hecht's papers \u2013 but which does not identify the screenwriter \u2013 is a direct adaptation of the novel, albeit with the Bond character absent, instead being replaced by a poker-playing American gangster.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" />\n\nLater drafts see [[vice]] made central to the plot, with the Le Chiffre character becoming head of a network of [[brothel]]s (as he is in the novel) whose patrons are then [[blackmail]]ed by Le Chiffre to fund Spectre (an invention of the screenwriter). The racy plot elements opened up by this change of background include a chase scene through [[Hamburg]]'s red light district that results in Bond escaping whilst disguised as a female [[mud wrestler]]. New characters appear such as Lili Wing, a brothel [[Pimp|madam]] and former lover of Bond whose ultimate fate is to be crushed in the back of a garbage truck, and Gita, wife of Le Chiffre. The beautiful Gita, whose face and throat are hideously disfigured as a result of Bond using her as a shield during a gunfight in the same sequence which sees Wing meet her fate, goes on to become the prime protagonist in the torture scene that features in the book, a role originally Le Chiffre's.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" />\n\nVirtually nothing from Hecht's scripts was ever filmed, although a draft dated to February 1964 has a line of dialogue containing the idea of MI6 having giving multiple agents the name of James Bond after Bond has died to confuse the other side.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" /> Hecht died from a heart attack in April 1964, two days after finishing his script and before he was able to present it to Feldman. [[Joseph Heller]] (and his friend [[George Mandel]]) worked on the project for a few weeks in early 1965 submitting  more than 100 pages after Feldman offered Heller $150,000. Heller later wrote about this episode in ''How I found James Bond, lost my self-respect and almost made $150,000 in my spare time''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Duns|first=Jeremy|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/catch-007-how-joseph-heller-almost-wrote-casino-royale-wc5hnv0h9|title=Catch 007: how Joseph Heller almost wrote Casino Royale|work=The Times|location=London|date=20 April 2020|access-date=20 April 2020}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported in 1966 that the script had been completely re-written by [[Billy Wilder]], and by the time the film reached production only the idea that the name James Bond should be given to a number of other agents remained. This key [[plot device]] in the finished film, in the case of Hecht's version, occurs after the demise of the original James Bond (an event which happened prior to the beginning of his story) which, as Hecht's M puts it, \"not only perpetuates his memory, but confuses the opposition.\"<ref name=\"Duns2011\" />\n\nPeter Sellers hired [[Terry Southern]] to write his dialogue (and not the rest of the script) to \"outshine\" Orson Welles and Woody Allen.<ref>Gerber, Gail & Lisanti, Tom.

Extensive sequences also featured London, notably [[Trafalgar Square]] and the exterior of [[10 Downing Street]]. [[Mereworth Castle]] in [[Kent]] was used as the home of Sir James Bond, which is blown up at the start of the film.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1967/03/casino-royale-1967/|title=Kent Film Office Casino Royal Film Focus|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185440/http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1967/03/casino-royale-1967/|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Much of the filming for M's Scottish castle was actually done on location in [[County Meath]], [[Ireland]], with [[Killeen Castle, Dunsany|Killeen Castle]] as the focus.<ref>{{cite web |title=Casino Royale |url=http://www.british-film-locations.com/Casino-Royale-1967 |publisher=British-Film-Locations.com |date=2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413234451/http://www.british-film-locations.com/Casino-Royale-1967 |archivedate=13 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> However, the car chase sequences where Bond leaves the castle were shot in the [[Perthshire]] village of [[Killin]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Casino Royale |url=http://www.scotlandthemovie.com/movies/caskill.html |publisher=Scotland: the Movie Location Guide |date=2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095437/http://www.scotlandthemovie.com/movies/caskill.html |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> with further sequences in [[Berkshire]] (specifically [[Old Windsor]] and [[Bracknell]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britmovie.co.uk/forums/film-locations/115229-sixties-casino-royale-car-chase-locations-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816154900/http://www.britmovie.co.uk/forums/film-locations/115229-sixties-casino-royale-car-chase-locations-2.html |archivedate=16 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe production proved to be rather troubled, with five different directors helming different segments of the film and with stunt co-ordinator [[Richard Talmadge]] co-directing the final sequence. In addition to the credited writers, Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, [[Val Guest]], [[Ben Hecht]], [[Joseph Heller]], Terry Southern, and Billy Wilder are all believed to have contributed to the screenplay to varying degrees. Val Guest was given the responsibility of splicing the various \"chapters\" together, and was offered the unique title of co-ordinating director but declined, claiming the chaotic plot would not reflect well on him if he were so credited. His extra credit was labelled 'additional sequences' instead.<ref name=Pictures>Guest, Val. ''So you want to be in Pictures'', Reynolds & Hearn, 2001, {{ISBN|1-903111-15-3}}</ref>\n\nPart of the behind-the-scenes drama of this film's production concerned the filming of the segments involving [[Peter Sellers]]. Screenwriter [[Wolf Mankowitz]] declared that Sellers felt intimidated by [[Orson Welles]] to the extent that, except for a couple of shots, neither was in the studio simultaneously. Other versions of the legend depict the drama stemming from Sellers being slighted, in favour of Welles, by [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] (whom Sellers knew) during her visit to the set. Welles also insisted on performing magic tricks as Le Chiffre, and the director obliged. Director Val Guest wrote that Welles did not think much of Sellers, and had refused to work with \"that amateur\". Director [[Joseph McGrath (film director)|Joseph McGrath]], a personal friend of Sellers, was punched by the actor when he complained about Sellers's behavior on the set.<ref>Sikov, Ed. ''Mr Strangelove: A Biography of Peter Sellers''. Pan Macmillan, 2011. {{ISBN|1447207149}}. pp. 310\u20133</ref>\n\nSome biographies of Sellers suggest that he took the role of Bond to heart, and was annoyed at the decision to make ''Casino Royale'' a comedy, as he wanted to play Bond straight. This is illustrated in somewhat fictionalised form in the film ''[[The Life and Death of Peter Sellers]]'', based on the biography by [[Roger Lewis]], who has claimed  that Sellers kept re-writing and improvising scenes to make them play seriously. This story is in agreement with the observation that the only parts of the film close to the book are the ones featuring Sellers and Welles.<ref name=Sellers>Lewis, Roger. ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers'', Applause Books, 2000, {{ISBN|1-55783-248-X}}</ref> In the end, Sellers's involvement with the film was cut abruptly short.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n[[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] and [[George Raft]] received [[opening credits|major billing]], even though each actor appears only briefly. Both appear during the climactic brawl at the end, Raft flipping his trademark coin and promptly shooting himself dead with a backward-firing pistol, while Belmondo appears wearing a fake moustache as the [[French Foreign Legion]] officer who requires an English phrase book to translate ''\"[[Shit|merde]]!\"'' into \"ooch!\" during his fistfight.<ref name=Playboy/> Raft's coin flip, which originally appeared in ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), had been spoofed a few years earlier in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959).<ref>{{cite book|title=Gangster Films|author=Smith, Jim|publisher=Virgin Books|year=2004|ISBN=0753508389|page=34}}</ref>\n\nAt the Intercon science fiction convention held in [[Slough]] in 1978, [[David Prowse]] commented on his part in this film, apparently his big-screen debut. He claimed that he was originally asked to play \"Super Pooh\", a giant [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] in a superhero costume who attacks Tremble during the Torture of The Mind sequence. This idea, as with many others in the film's script, was rapidly dropped, and Prowse was re-cast as a [[Frankenstein]]-type monster for the closing scenes.

Evelyn Tremble is not captured on camera; an outtake of Sellers entering a racing car was substituted. In this outtake, he calls for the car, \u00e0 la ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'', to chase down Vesper and her kidnappers; the next thing that is shown is Tremble being tortured. Out-takes of Sellers were also used for Tremble's dream sequence (pretending to play the piano on [[Ursula Andress]]' torso), in the finale \u2013 blowing out the candles whilst in highland dress \u2013 and at the end of the film when all the various \"James Bond doubles\" are together. In the kidnap sequence, Tremble's death is also very abruptly inserted; it consists of pre-existing footage of Tremble being rescued by Vesper, followed by a later-filmed shot of her abruptly deciding to shoot him, followed by a freeze-frame over some of the previous footage of her surrounded by bodies (noticeably a zoom-in on the previous shot).<ref name=Missing />\n\nAs well as this, an entire sequence involving Tremble going to the front for the underground James Bond training school (which turns out to be under [[Harrods]], of which the training area was the lowest level) was never shot, thus creating an abrupt cut from Vesper announcing that Tremble will be James Bond to Tremble exiting the lift into the training school.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nMany sequences from the film were dropped, so that several actors never appeared in the final cut, including [[Ian Hendry]] (as 006, the agent whose body is briefly seen being disposed of by Vesper), [[Mona Washbourne]] and [[Arthur Mullard]].<ref name=Missing />\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Casino Royale\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Burt Bacharach]], [[Herb Alpert|Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass]] and [[Dusty Springfield]]\n| cover      = Burt Bacharach - Casino Royale (1967 soundtrack).png\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1967\n| recorded   = 1967\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 34:27\n| label      = [[Colgems]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = Casino Royale Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]\n | single1date = January 29, 1967\n}}\n}}\nFor the music, Feldman decided to bring in [[Burt Bacharach]], who had done the score for his previous production ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]''.

The Waitemata (Endean) Shield would be awarded to the team scoring the most championship points in the second round, and the \"Nuko\" Cup to the winner of the two lower teams on the ladder.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Draw For Mid-Week Games/The Competition Trophies\n| page =14\n| work =Auckland Star| volume= LXII| issue= 140\n| date = 16 June 1931\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19310616.2.164\n| accessdate = 23 October 2019}}</ref> Marist were awarded the Davis Shield for scoring the most competition points in the junior grades.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =League Football/Junior Management/Abuse of Players' Passes\n| page = 16\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume= LXII| issue= 243\n| date = 14 October 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19311014.2.158\n| accessdate = 28 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nGrades were made of the following teams with the winning team in bold:\n*'''Senior Reserve Grade''': City, Devonport, Ellerslie, Marist, Newton, Ponsonby, Richmond\n*'''Second Grade''': City, Mangere, Mount Albert, Mount Wellington, Northcote, '''Papakura''', Point Chevalier, Ponsonby (Papakura won the knockout competition)\n*'''Third Grade Open''': Devonport, Ellerslie, Glen Lynn, '''Marist''', Papatoetoe, Ponsonby, Richmond (Marist won after beating Ponsonby 4\u20132 in the final, while Ponsonby won the knockout final 8\u20132 over Marist)\n*'''Third Grade Intermediate''': Akarana, City, Glen Lynn, Glenora, Marist, Mount Albert, Ponsonby, '''Richmond''' (Richmond won the championship and knockout competition)\n*'''Fourth Grade''': Akarana, Avondale, City, Devonport, Ellerslie, Glen Lynn, '''Marist''', Mount Albert, Mount Wellington, Newmarket, Northcote, Papakura, Papatoetoe, Point Chevalier, Ponsonby, Richmond (Marist won the championship and the knockout competition)\n*'''Fifth Grade''': City, Devonport, Ellerslie, Glen Lynn, '''Marist''', Mount Albert, Newmarket, Newton, Northcote, Papatoetoe, Ponsonby, Richmond (Marist won the championship and the knockout competition)\n*'''Sixth Grade''': Akarana, City, Devonport, Ellerslie, Marist, '''Newmarket''', Newton, Northcote, Point Chevalier, Richmond (Newmarket beat Richmond 3\u20132 in the final)\n*'''Seventh Grade''': City, Ellerslie, Glen Lynn, Newmarket, Papatoetoe, Point Chevalier, '''Richmond A''', Richmond B (Richmond A won the championship)\n*'''Primary Schoolboys''': Avondale, City, Devonport, Ellerslie, Newton, Newmarket, Northcote, Papatoetoe, Parnell, Richmond A, Richmond B\n*'''Mid-Week Competition''': Auckland Loco, Birkenhead, City Markets, Green Lane, New Zealand Fertilisers, Nicholson Park, Post Office, Stonex and Stormont's, Town Board Rovers, Waterside Workers\n\n=== Other notable matches ===\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | List of Matches\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Attendance\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition Match\n| 11 July<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Frequent Penalties/Teams Evenly Matched\n| page = 12\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume= LXVIII| issue= 20923\n| date = 13 July 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19310713.2.143.2\n| accessdate = 24 October 2019}}</ref>|| Kia Ora (Huntly)|| 5 || City || 25 || Huntly\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition Match\n| 18 July<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Win for Devonport\n| page = 12\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume= LXVIII| issue= 20929\n| date = 20 July 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19310720.2.148.1\n| accessdate = 24 October 2019}}</ref>\n|| Ngaruawahia|| 6 || Devonport || 19 || Huntly\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition Match\n| 25 July<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist in Wellington/Win With 21-Point Margin\n| page = 11\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume= LXII| issue= 175\n| date = 27 July 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19310727.2.125\n| accessdate = 24 October 2019}}</ref>\n|| Wellington Combined Team|| 19 || Marist || 40 || Wellington Show Stadium\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition Match\n| 1 Aug<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Play on Heavy Grounds/Devonport Defeats Ponsonby/L.

There was a match played between North Island and South Island, but the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team's only match was for the Northern Union Cup against [[Northland rugby league team|Northland]]. In a surprise result Northland had defeated [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] to lift the trophy. [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] challenged for it but could only manage a 19 all draw and so Northland retained it. Auckland junior teams played two matches and a colts side played against the touring [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] team from [[Sydney]] who were the premiers of the [[New South Wales Rugby League]].\n\n=== Representative fixtures ===\nOnly a small number of fixtures were played in the 1931 season partly owing to the fact that [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] did not hold the Northern Union Cup. Also the touring [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] team from Sydney had matches with club sides organised for them.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 1931 Auckland Representative Fixtures\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Representative Fixture\n| 15 Aug<ref>{{cite news\n| title =High Scoring Game/North Island League Team/Too Superior for South/Margin of Twenty-Nine Points\n| page = 11\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume= LXVIII| issue= 20953\n| date = 17 August 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19310817.2.130\n| accessdate = 26 October 2019}}</ref>\n|| North Island || 52 || South Island || 23 || Carlaw Park # 1, 3pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Northern Union Cup\n| 26 Sep<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Fixture/Auckland and Northland/Match Ends in a Draw\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume= LXVIII| issue= 20989\n| date = 28 September 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19310928.2.131.5\n| accessdate = 28 October 2019}}</ref>\n|| Auckland || 19 || Northland || 19 || Carlaw Park # 1, 3:15pm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Representative Match\n| 17 Oct<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Wednesday Reps V Junior Reps\n| page =9\n| work =New Zealand Herald| volume= LXVIII| issue= 21007\n| date = 19 October 1931\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19311019.2.136\n| accessdate = 28 September 2019}}</ref>\n|| Wednesday Representatives|| 23 || Auckland Junior Representatives || 6 || Carlaw Park\n|-\n|}\n\n== Annual general meetings and club news ==\n*[[Auckland Rugby League]] held their annual general meeting in the Chamber of Commerce, Swanson Street on Thursday 16 April.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =League Football\n| page = 18\n| work=[[Auckland Star]] |volume= LXII |issue=82\n| date = 8 April 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19310408.2.172.3\n| accessdate = 21 October 2019}}</ref> At a later meeting they voted to adopt the motion whereby its grading of referees and appointments of them for matches would be done by a group of three, consisting of two of its members and a representative of the [[Auckland Rugby League]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Appointment of Referees/Management Representation Approved\n| page = 12\n| work=[[Auckland Star]] |volume= LXII |issue=98\n| date = 28 April 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19310428.2.125\n| accessdate = 21 October 2019}}</ref> Tenders were requested for the lease of the Carlaw Park Refreshment Stall, and for the rights of the Rugby League Gazette.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland Rugby Football League\n| page = 20\n| work=[[Auckland Star]] |volume= LXII |issue=87\n| date = 14 April 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19310414.2.188.3\n| accessdate = 21 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n*[[Auckland Rugby League]] Junior Management Committee held their annual meeting at the Grey Buildings on Tuesday, 31 March.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =League Football\n| page = 8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume= LXVIII |issue= 20834\n| date = 28 March 1931\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19310328.2.10.4\n| accessdate = 18 October 2019}}</ref> After the reports were given by club delegates the prospect was for a record season in terms of team and player numbers.

In a surprise result Northland had defeated [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] to lift the trophy. [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] challenged for it but could only manage a 19 all draw and so Northland retained it. Auckland junior teams played two matches and a colts side played against the touring [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] team from [[Sydney]] who were the premiers of the [[New South Wales Rugby League]].\n\n=== Representative fixtures ===\nOnly a small number of fixtures were played in the 1931 season partly owing to the fact that [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] did not hold the Northern Union Cup.
