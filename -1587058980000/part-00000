Despite the team still being involved in the merger by name, most saw this as the teams continuation of the original team, and not the Lechia-Polonia team. The reforming meant that Polonia had to restart from Poland's lowest divisions. The highest the team has achieved since the turn of the century was 2 seasons in the third division, finishing 14th and 16th from 2012\u201314.

In 2001 there was therefor 3 teams playing football as a result of the merger; Lechia-Polonia Gda\u0144sk, Lechia Gda\u0144sk, and Polonia Gda\u0144sk. While the dissolved Lechia-Polonia team left both Lechia and Polonia in much worse positions than before the merger, Lechia took full advantage of the situation they found themselves in.

Other [[ecology|ecological changes]] - for example, species introduction and predator loss - can also affect virus emergence and prevalence. Some [[agriculture|agricultural]] practices, for example inappropriate management and disposal of farm animal faeces, are also associated with an increased risk of zoonosis.<ref name=\"Penakalapati\">{{cite journal |last1=Penakalapati |first1=G |last2=Swarthout |first2=J |last3=Delahoy |first3=MJ |last4=McAliley |first4=L |last5=Wodnik |first5=B |last6=Levy |first6=K |last7=Freeman |first7=MC | title=Exposure to Animal Feces and Human Health: A Systematic Review and Proposed Research Priorities |journal=Environmental Science & Technology |volume=51(20) |page=11537\u201311552 |doi=10.1021/acs.est.7b02811 |pmid=28926696}}</ref>\n\nViruses may also emerge due to the establishment of a larger population that is vulnerable to infection. For example, a virus may emerge following loss of [[cross-reactivity|cross-protective immunity]], which may occur due to loss of a wild virus or termination of [[vaccination]] programmes. Additionally, changes in human [[demography|demographics]] \u2013 for example, the birth and/or migration of immunologically na\u00efve individuals \u2013 can lead to the development of a susceptible population that enables large-scale virus infection. Poor population health (e.g. due to [[HIV]], malnutrition etc) can also facilitate the emergence of viruses.\n\nOther factors that can directly promote viral emergence include [[international trade]] and travel.

Several bat species (e.g. brown bats) aggregate in crowded roosts, which promotes intra- and interspecies viral transmission. Moreover, as bats are widespread in urban areas, humans occasionally encroach on their habitats which are contaminated with [[guano]] and urine. Their ability to fly and [[migration (ecology)|migration patterns]] also means that bats are able to spread disease over a large geographic area, while also acquiring new viruses. Additionally, bats experience persistent viral infections which, together with their extreme longevity (some bat species have lifespans of 35 years), helps to maintain viruses and transmit them to other species. Other bat characteristics which contribute to their potency as viral hosts include: their food choices, [[torpor]]/[[hibernation]] habits and susceptibility to reinfection.<ref name=\"Calisher\">{{cite journal |last1=Calisher |first1=CH |last2=Childs |first2= JE|last3=Field |first3=HE |last4=Holmes |first4=KV |last5=Schountz |first5=T |title=Bats: Important Reservoir Hosts of Emerging Viruses |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |date=2006 |volume=19(3) |page=531-545 |doi=10.1128/CMR.00017-06}}</ref>\n\n==Drivers of viral emergence==\n{{See also | Infection#Emerging diseases}}\n\nViral emergence is often a consequence of both [[Infection#Emerging diseases|nature and human activity]]. Human [[population growth]] and [[environmental change]]s can greatly facilitate the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic viruses. Factors such as [[deforestation]], [[reforestation]], [[habitat fragmentation]], [[urbanization]] and [[irrigation]] can all impact the ways in which humans come into close contact with wild animal species, and consequently promote virus emergence.<ref name=\"Nava\">{{cite journal |last1=Nava |first1=A |last2=Shimabukuro |first2=JS |last3=Chmura|first3=AA |last4=Luz|first4=SLB |title=The Impact of Global Environmental Changes on Infectious Disease Emergence with a Focus on Risks for Brazil |journal=ILAR Journal |date=2017 |volume=58 |issue=3 |page=393-400 |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ilar/ilx034}}</ref> Additionally, [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]] can affect [[ecosystem|ecosystems]] and [[vector]] distribution, which in turn can affect the emergence of [[Vector#Vector-borne zoonotic disease and human activity|vector-borne viruses]]. Other [[ecology|ecological changes]] - for example, species introduction and predator loss - can also affect virus emergence and prevalence. Some [[agriculture|agricultural]] practices, for example inappropriate management and disposal of farm animal faeces, are also associated with an increased risk of zoonosis.<ref name=\"Penakalapati\">{{cite journal |last1=Penakalapati |first1=G |last2=Swarthout |first2=J |last3=Delahoy |first3=MJ |last4=McAliley |first4=L |last5=Wodnik |first5=B |last6=Levy |first6=K |last7=Freeman |first7=MC | title=Exposure to Animal Feces and Human Health: A Systematic Review and Proposed Research Priorities |journal=Environmental Science & Technology |volume=51(20) |page=11537\u201311552 |doi=10.1021/acs.est.7b02811 |pmid=28926696}}</ref>\n\nViruses may also emerge due to the establishment of a larger population that is vulnerable to infection. For example, a virus may emerge following loss of [[cross-reactivity|cross-protective immunity]], which may occur due to loss of a wild virus or termination of [[vaccination]] programmes. Additionally, changes in human [[demography|demographics]] \u2013 for example, the birth and/or migration of immunologically na\u00efve individuals \u2013 can lead to the development of a susceptible population that enables large-scale virus infection. Poor population health (e.g. due to [[HIV]], malnutrition etc) can also facilitate the emergence of viruses.\n\nOther factors that can directly promote viral emergence include [[international trade]] and travel. Animal migration can also lead to the emergence of viruses, as was the case for the [[West Nile virus]] which was spread by migrating bird populations.<ref name=\"Rappole\">{{cite journal |last1=Rappole |first1=JH |last2=Derrickson |first2=SR |last3=Hubalek |first3=Z |title=Migratory birds and spread of West Nile virus in the Western Hemisphere. |journal=Emerging Infectious Disease |date=2000 |volume=6(4) |page=319-28 |doi=10.3201/eid0604.000401}}</ref>\n\n==Virulence of emergent viruses==\n\nAs hosts are immunologically na\u00efve to pathogens they have not encountered before, emergent viruses are often extremely [[virulence|virulent]] in terms of their capacity to cause disease. \n\nTheir high virulence is also due to a lack of adaptation to the new host. Viruses normally exert strong [[evolutionary pressure|selection pressure]] on the immune systems of their natural hosts, which in turn exerts a strong selection pressure on viruses.<ref name=\"Dominguez\">{{cite journal |last1=Dominguez-Andres |first1=J |last2=Netea |first2=MG |title=Impact of Historic Migrations and Evolutionary Processes on Human Immunity |journal=Trends in Immunology |date=2019 |volume=40(12) |page=1105-1119 |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2019.10.001}}</ref> This [[coevolution]] means that the natural host is able to manage infection. However, when the virus jumps to a new host (e.g. humans), the new host is unable to deal with infection due to mismatch between host [[wikt:immunoeffector|immunoeffector]]s and virus [[Biological response modifier|immunomodulator]]s. \n\nAdditionally, in order to maximise transmission, viruses often naturally undergo attenuation (i.e. [[virulence]] is reduced) so that infected animals can survive long enough to infect other animals more efficiently.<ref name=\"Longdon\">{{cite journal |last1=Longdon |first1=B |last2=Hadfield |first2=JD |last3=Day |first3=JP |last4=Smith |first4=SCL |last5=McGonigle |first5=JE |last6=Cogni |first6=R |last7=Cao |first7=C |last8=Jiggins |first8=FM |title=The Causes and Consequences of Changes in Virulence following Pathogen Host Shifts |journal=PLoS PATHOGENS |date=2015 |volume=11(3) |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004728 |pmid=25774803}}</ref> However, as attenuation takes a long time to achieve, new host populations will not initially benefit from this phenomenon. Moreover, as zoonotic viruses also naturally exist in [[natural_reservoir|animal reservoirs]]<ref name=Eidson/>, their survival is not dependant on transmission between new hosts; this means that emergent viruses are even more unlikely to attenuate for the purpose of maximal transmission.\n\nAlthough emergent viruses are frequently highly virulent, they are limited by several host factors including: [[innate_immune_system|innate immunity]], [[Antibody#Natural antibodies|natural antibodies]] and [[binding_selectivity|receptor specificity]]. If the host has previously been infected by a pathogen that shares similarities with the emergent virus, the host may also benefit from [[cross-reactivity|cross-protective immunity]].\n\n==Examples of emergent viruses==\n\n===Influenza A===\n[[File: EM of influenza virus.jpg| 210px|thumb|upright=0.4|left|alt=Electron micrograph of influenza virus, magnification is approximately 100,000.|Electron micrograph of influenza virus, magnification is approximately 100,000]]\n\n[[Influenza]] is a [[contagious]] infection which primarily affects the [[respiratory_system|upper respiratory organs]] of humans.<ref name=\"UNICEF\">{{cite web |last1=UNICEF |title=Influenza |url=https://www.unicef.org/flu/ |website=UNICEF |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Based on their core proteins, influenza viruses are classified into types A, B, C and D.<ref name=\"WHO\">{{cite web |last1=World Health Organisation |title=Influenza |url=https://www.who.int/biologicals/vaccines/influenza/en/ |publisher=World Health Organisation |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> <ref name=\"WHO2\">{{cite web |last1=World Health Organisation |title=Influenza (Avian and other zoonotic) |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(avian-and-other-zoonotic) |publisher=WHO |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> While both influenza A and B can cause epidemics in humans, influenza A also has pandemic potential and a higher mutation rate, therefore is most significant to public health.<ref name=\"CDC\">{{cite web |last1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Influenza (Flu) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/types.htm |publisher=CDC |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=WHO2/>\n\nInfluenza A viruses are further subtyped based on the surface [[glycoprotein]] [[antigens]] [[hemagglutinin]] (HA) and [[neuraminidase]] (NA).

Texas Country blends these sub-genres with a [[common people|\"common working man\"]] theme and witty undertones, these often combine with a stripped down music sound.\n\nNeither the location of birth nor the location of upbringing seems to calculate in the definition of a Texas Country artist, as long as the origin is not in the corporate Nashville scene as the genre tends to be anti-Nashville. The genre differentiates from Nashville country with its rejection of pop influences that is found in Nashville Country recently, but does not necessarily mean the artist/group is Texas based.  For example, [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] is considered by some to be a Texas Country musician, despite his [[Kentucky]] ties. [[Adam Hood]], an [[Alabama]] native, also has had success in the genre.

Information about the show and voting procedures can be found at https://trrma.net/\n\n==Themes==\nLyrical content is the backbone of Texas country. [[Willie Nelson]], a legendary Country Music Outlaw, inspired his friend [[Waylon Jennings]], an outlaw country music legend himself, who is sometimes cited as an inspiration to present day Texas country musicians, to say, \u201cYour melody goes where the words take you\u201d.<ref>Jennings, Waylon and [[Lenny Kaye]].  ''Waylon: An Autobiography.''  New York: Warner Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nThere are 4 different types of themes in Country Music. These include the following categories: \"It's All Over\" (songs with a core theme of loss or regret), It's Not Working Out (songs with a focus on frustration over a relationship), \"Love and Devotion\" (sappy love songs) and \"The Right Way to Live\" (songs with a dominant theme of pride and homespun wisdom).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/chart-shows-4-themes-country-songs-50-years/|title=Chart Shows the 4 Themes in Country Music Over 50 Years|last=Smith|first=Lindi|date=2016-05-03|website=Wide Open Country|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\nSongs about traditional dance halls, open roads, family farms and hometown bars, along with other illustrations of Texas landscape, are all found in present-day Texas country artists' catalogs.  The ties of landscape and music seem to serve as remembrance and gratitude, as evident in most songs.  Appreciation for surroundings is not the only limitation for this theme.  The \"average man\" and his struggle with nature do appear as well.  \"The songs definitely incorporate a spirit of the times and constitute a spontaneous and fairly comprehensive record of life\".<ref>Clayton, Lawrence. \"Elements of Realism in the Songs of the Cowboy.\" American Renaissance and American West. Ed. Durer, Christopher S. et al. WY: University of Wyoming, 1982.</ref>\n\nA few things Texas Country Music also have in common are topics that are in their songs such as Religion, Patriotism, Red Neck Lifestyles, and Nostalgia. Religion tends to play a big role in Country Music since its roots are in religion \u2013 being born from Traditional Southern Folk and Gospel music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/music/the-ten-biggest-tropes-in-country-music-5694846|title=The ten biggest tropes in country music|last=Rogers|first=Ashley|date=2013-09-05|website=Westword|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> Patriotism is also big since they love to talk about how much they love their country. For example, \"[[American Soldier (song)|American Soldier]]\" by [[Toby Keith]] is a great example of patriotism being expressed. Texas Country also involves singing about \"redneck lifestyles\" which includes their country living with trucks, tractors, fishing, and guns. Nostalgia is also considered a characteristic that most songs Country songs have.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origination===\n\nCountry Music from Texas has been popular since the spread of the cowboy culture in the late 1800s. Texas helped popularize Country Music through the world and the state\u2019s rich and varied traditions continue to redefine Country Music.<ref>Hartman, Gary. The History of Texas Music. N.p.: Texas A&M University Press, 2008. Print.</ref>\n\nTexas Country's roots lie in the [[Outlaw country]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  Texan artists such as [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[David Allan Coe]] retreated from the Nashville Country Music scene to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Luckenbach, Texas|Luckenbach]], [[College station, tx|College Station]] and [[Houston]]. Other artists who were inspired by this movement included performers like [[Guy Clark]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], Gary P. Nunn [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Joe Ely]], [[Terry Allen (country singer)|Terry Allen]], [[Steve Earle]],  and [[Townes Van Zandt]]. All these stars have rated higher than 43 on the Texas Music Scene charts{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.\n\nThese artists were followed in turn by the work of singer-songwriters such as [[Pat Green]], [[Robert Earl Keen]], [[Max Stalling]], [[Wade Bowen]] and [[Cory Morrow]].\n\nWhile the genre has roots in Texas, Oklahoma artists such as [[Jason Boland & The Stragglers|Jason Boland]], [[Stoney LaRue]], [[Mike McClure]], and [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] have had a major influence on Texas Country. For this reason, \"Red Dirt Music\" is becoming a more popular term for the genre to pay homage to its Oklahoma influence. The term was coined in reference to the miles of red dirt that is common throughout the two states.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Robert Earl Keen]]'s ''[[No. 2 Live Dinner]]'', released in 1996, had it all; comedy accompanied with \"a sharp wit, a laid-back cowboy style, and an eye for detail... combined in [his] songs that are as easy on the ears as they are packed with insight\".<ref>Wolff, Kurt.  ''Country Music: The Rough Guide.''  London: Rough Guides Ltd, 2000.</ref>  Keen's home calling came after a short stint in Nashville, where he quickly became uncomfortable.  His 1996 live album release truly showcased the \u201cwide range\u201d of the talented Texas musician and popularized the single \"The Road Goes On Forever\", a song many music fans regard as the paradigm for Texas 'Country anthems'. [[Joe Ely]] and other Texas musicians have recorded cover versions of \u201cThe Road Goes On Forever\u201d.\n<!--\n RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE REMOVAL:\n no reference to verify these claims can be located.\nThe 1998 release of [[Roger Creager]]\u2019s ''Having Fun All Wrong'' had an immediate impact on the Texas scene.  \u201cThe Everclear Song\u201d reached \u201chit single\u201d status when it quickly spread across Texas college towns and has often been called \"The Anthem of Texas Country.\"{{Fact|date=July 2007}}.\n-->\n\n===2000s and the Texas influence in Nashville===\n\n[[Cory Morrow]], a [[Houston]] native, had been on the Texas scene since the mid-90s. With the release of his fourth album ''Outside the Lines'', Morrow found more mainstream success on the Country Music charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kbec.com/texas-music-facts-tales/|title=Texas Music Facts and Some Tales|last=kbec|date=2017-10-24|website=KBEC 1390|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[Pat Green]], also an artist from Texas, began his career as part of the Texas Country scene later went on to widespread commercial success with gold album ''[[Wave on Wave]]'' after switching to a  \"Shania Twain/ Garth Brooks\" Nashville style of Country Music.  The album's title track hit No. 3 on the U.S. ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart and won a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Country Song.\n\n[[Kevin Fowler]], a former hair-metal/glam rocker was [[Dangerous Toys]] guitarist from the late 1980s until 1993, followed by his own founding of Thunderfoot, a Southern rock band based out of Austin. Originally from [[Amarillo]], he self-released his country debut album ''One For The Road'' in 1997. This followed with his smash independent follow-up album, ''Beer, Bait, and Ammo''.  He has since found national success, on a major label.\n\nTexas Country's influence continues to be felt in the mainstream music genre with artists such as [[Jack Ingram]], who had already established a name for himself in Texas Country, who won a [[CMT Music Award]] in 2007 and the 2008 [[Academy of Country Music]] award for New Male Vocalist of the Year.  He has also scored top 25 singles on ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart with songs such as \"[[Love You (Jack Ingram song)|Love You]]\" and his cover of [[Hinder|Hinder's]] \"[[Lips of an Angel]]\".  Another one of his singles, \"[[Wherever You Are (Jack Ingram song)|Wherever You Are]]\", went to number one on the Billboard Chart.\n\nMany independent artists, which is the fastest growing segment of the global recorded music business, <ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissamdaniels/2019/07/10/for-independent-musicians-goingyour-own-way-is-finally-starting-to-pay-off/#45980f4f14f2</ref> have gained commercial success through the Texas music scene, such as albums debuting in the Top 5 of Billboard's Top Country Album sales. <ref>https://www.houstonpress.com/music/indie-texas-country-artists-racking-up-major-league-sales-8721118</ref>\n\n==Radio stations==\nTexas Country is unique in that radio stations throughout Texas have embraced the subgenre and regularly mix Texas country into a Country radio format:\n\n===Internet===\n*[[Texas Country Mix (Internet Radio)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.txcountrymix.com/|title=Texas Country Mix (Internet Radio)}}</ref>\n*[[GotRadio Texas Best (Internet Radio)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gotradio.com/|title=GotRadio Texas Best (Internet Radio)}}</ref>\n\n===Terrestrial (AM/FM)===\n*[[KBSO|KBSO 94.7 Corpus Christi, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://947jalapenocountry.com|title=KBSO 94.7 Corpus Christi, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KFLP-FM|KFLP 106.1 Floydada/Plainview/Lubbock, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://1061flipfm.com|title=KFLP 106.1 Floydada/Plainview/Lubbock, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KFWR|KFWR 95.9 Fort Worth, Texas]]\n*[[KFYN-FM|KFYN 104.3 Paris, Texas]]\n*[[KILT-FM|KILT 100.3 HD3 Houston, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thebull.radio.com|title=KILT 100.3 HD3 Houston, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KKBQ|KKBQ 92.9 HD3 Pasadena, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thenew93q.com|title=KKBQ 92.9 HD3 Pasadena, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KKCN|KKCN 103.1 San Angelo, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://103kkcn.com|title=KKCN 103.1 San Angelo, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KNBT|KNBT 92.1 New Braunfels, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knbt.fm|title=KNBT 92.1 New Braunfels, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KOLI|KOLI 94.9 Wichita Falls, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://949theoutlaw.com|title=KOLI 94.9 Wichita Falls, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KOKE|KOKE 99.3/98.5 Austin, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kokefm.com|title=KOKE 99.3/98.5 Austin, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KORA|KORA 98.3 Bryan/College Station, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://983korafm.com|title=KORA 98.3 Bryan/College Station, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KPLX|KPLX 99.5 Dallas/Ft.

Texas Country is known for fusing [[Neotraditional country|neotraditional country]] with the outspoken, care-free views of [[outlaw country]]. Texas Country blends these sub-genres with a [[common people|\"common working man\"]] theme and witty undertones, these often combine with a stripped down music sound.\n\nNeither the location of birth nor the location of upbringing seems to calculate in the definition of a Texas Country artist, as long as the origin is not in the corporate Nashville scene as the genre tends to be anti-Nashville. The genre differentiates from Nashville country with its rejection of pop influences that is found in Nashville Country recently, but does not necessarily mean the artist/group is Texas based.  For example, [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] is considered by some to be a Texas Country musician, despite his [[Kentucky]] ties. [[Adam Hood]], an [[Alabama]] native, also has had success in the genre. Even international musicians, such as [[Alberta, Canada]] native [[Corb Lund]], have been successful in the Texas Country scene. This just shows how many musicians all over the world have adopted the Texas sound.\n\n==Instrumentation==\n{{unsourced section|date=July 2019}}\nThe [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] is essential in Texas Country Music. However, the use of [[electric guitar]]s, [[steel guitar]]s or [[pedal steel guitar]]s in the genre is not uncommon. [[bass guitar|Bass]] and [[percussion]] are used in live performances. The sounds of [[piano]], [[baritone guitar]], [[banjo]], [[accordion]], [[fiddle]] or [[harmonica]] on studio recordings are the norm for the genre.\n\n==Vocals==\nThe line of delineation for vocals is unclear. Traditionally, the Texas Country scene has been a male dominated genre, however many women have had chart success in recent years. The Texas \"anthem\" is a common song type, referencing and sometimes embellishing on the different positive characteristics of the state. Many of these types of songs have been popular on the Texas Music Charts.<ref>[http://www.countryradioclassics.com/index.php/2007/09/21/texas-national-anthem-voting/ TX National Anthem voting ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703153140/http://www.countryradioclassics.com/index.php/2007/09/21/texas-national-anthem-voting |date=2008-07-03 }} (sponsored by Lone-Star Beer company)</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\nThe live performance is at the very root of the Texas Country scene.

The winners in 25 categories are nominated and voted on by fans, friends and industry professionals and are awarded the night of the show.

The awards show is open to the public and fans alike who cheer on their favorite artist/entertainers and radio stations.  Information about the show and voting procedures can be found at https://trrma.net/\n\n==Themes==\nLyrical content is the backbone of Texas country. [[Willie Nelson]], a legendary Country Music Outlaw, inspired his friend [[Waylon Jennings]], an outlaw country music legend himself, who is sometimes cited as an inspiration to present day Texas country musicians, to say, \u201cYour melody goes where the words take you\u201d.<ref>Jennings, Waylon and [[Lenny Kaye]].  ''Waylon: An Autobiography.''  New York: Warner Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nThere are 4 different types of themes in Country Music. These include the following categories: \"It's All Over\" (songs with a core theme of loss or regret), It's Not Working Out (songs with a focus on frustration over a relationship), \"Love and Devotion\" (sappy love songs) and \"The Right Way to Live\" (songs with a dominant theme of pride and homespun wisdom).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/chart-shows-4-themes-country-songs-50-years/|title=Chart Shows the 4 Themes in Country Music Over 50 Years|last=Smith|first=Lindi|date=2016-05-03|website=Wide Open Country|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\nSongs about traditional dance halls, open roads, family farms and hometown bars, along with other illustrations of Texas landscape, are all found in present-day Texas country artists' catalogs.  The ties of landscape and music seem to serve as remembrance and gratitude, as evident in most songs.  Appreciation for surroundings is not the only limitation for this theme.  The \"average man\" and his struggle with nature do appear as well.  \"The songs definitely incorporate a spirit of the times and constitute a spontaneous and fairly comprehensive record of life\".<ref>Clayton, Lawrence. \"Elements of Realism in the Songs of the Cowboy.\" American Renaissance and American West. Ed. Durer, Christopher S. et al. WY: University of Wyoming, 1982.</ref>\n\nA few things Texas Country Music also have in common are topics that are in their songs such as Religion, Patriotism, Red Neck Lifestyles, and Nostalgia. Religion tends to play a big role in Country Music since its roots are in religion \u2013 being born from Traditional Southern Folk and Gospel music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/music/the-ten-biggest-tropes-in-country-music-5694846|title=The ten biggest tropes in country music|last=Rogers|first=Ashley|date=2013-09-05|website=Westword|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> Patriotism is also big since they love to talk about how much they love their country. For example, \"[[American Soldier (song)|American Soldier]]\" by [[Toby Keith]] is a great example of patriotism being expressed. Texas Country also involves singing about \"redneck lifestyles\" which includes their country living with trucks, tractors, fishing, and guns. Nostalgia is also considered a characteristic that most songs Country songs have.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origination===\n\nCountry Music from Texas has been popular since the spread of the cowboy culture in the late 1800s. Texas helped popularize Country Music through the world and the state\u2019s rich and varied traditions continue to redefine Country Music.<ref>Hartman, Gary. The History of Texas Music. N.p.: Texas A&M University Press, 2008. Print.</ref>\n\nTexas Country's roots lie in the [[Outlaw country]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  Texan artists such as [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[David Allan Coe]] retreated from the Nashville Country Music scene to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Luckenbach, Texas|Luckenbach]], [[College station, tx|College Station]] and [[Houston]]. Other artists who were inspired by this movement included performers like [[Guy Clark]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], Gary P. Nunn [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Joe Ely]], [[Terry Allen (country singer)|Terry Allen]], [[Steve Earle]],  and [[Townes Van Zandt]]. All these stars have rated higher than 43 on the Texas Music Scene charts{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.\n\nThese artists were followed in turn by the work of singer-songwriters such as [[Pat Green]], [[Robert Earl Keen]], [[Max Stalling]], [[Wade Bowen]] and [[Cory Morrow]].\n\nWhile the genre has roots in Texas, Oklahoma artists such as [[Jason Boland & The Stragglers|Jason Boland]], [[Stoney LaRue]], [[Mike McClure]], and [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] have had a major influence on Texas Country. For this reason, \"Red Dirt Music\" is becoming a more popular term for the genre to pay homage to its Oklahoma influence. The term was coined in reference to the miles of red dirt that is common throughout the two states.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Robert Earl Keen]]'s ''[[No. 2 Live Dinner]]'', released in 1996, had it all; comedy accompanied with \"a sharp wit, a laid-back cowboy style, and an eye for detail... combined in [his] songs that are as easy on the ears as they are packed with insight\".<ref>Wolff, Kurt.  ''Country Music: The Rough Guide.''  London: Rough Guides Ltd, 2000.</ref>  Keen's home calling came after a short stint in Nashville, where he quickly became uncomfortable.  His 1996 live album release truly showcased the \u201cwide range\u201d of the talented Texas musician and popularized the single \"The Road Goes On Forever\", a song many music fans regard as the paradigm for Texas 'Country anthems'. [[Joe Ely]] and other Texas musicians have recorded cover versions of \u201cThe Road Goes On Forever\u201d.\n<!--\n RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE REMOVAL:\n no reference to verify these claims can be located.\nThe 1998 release of [[Roger Creager]]\u2019s ''Having Fun All Wrong'' had an immediate impact on the Texas scene.  \u201cThe Everclear Song\u201d reached \u201chit single\u201d status when it quickly spread across Texas college towns and has often been called \"The Anthem of Texas Country.\"{{Fact|date=July 2007}}.\n-->\n\n===2000s and the Texas influence in Nashville===\n\n[[Cory Morrow]], a [[Houston]] native, had been on the Texas scene since the mid-90s. With the release of his fourth album ''Outside the Lines'', Morrow found more mainstream success on the Country Music charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kbec.com/texas-music-facts-tales/|title=Texas Music Facts and Some Tales|last=kbec|date=2017-10-24|website=KBEC 1390|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[Pat Green]], also an artist from Texas, began his career as part of the Texas Country scene later went on to widespread commercial success with gold album ''[[Wave on Wave]]'' after switching to a  \"Shania Twain/ Garth Brooks\" Nashville style of Country Music.  The album's title track hit No. 3 on the U.S. ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart and won a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Country Song.\n\n[[Kevin Fowler]], a former hair-metal/glam rocker was [[Dangerous Toys]] guitarist from the late 1980s until 1993, followed by his own founding of Thunderfoot, a Southern rock band based out of Austin. Originally from [[Amarillo]], he self-released his country debut album ''One For The Road'' in 1997. This followed with his smash independent follow-up album, ''Beer, Bait, and Ammo''.  He has since found national success, on a major label.\n\nTexas Country's influence continues to be felt in the mainstream music genre with artists such as [[Jack Ingram]], who had already established a name for himself in Texas Country, who won a [[CMT Music Award]] in 2007 and the 2008 [[Academy of Country Music]] award for New Male Vocalist of the Year.  He has also scored top 25 singles on ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart with songs such as \"[[Love You (Jack Ingram song)|Love You]]\" and his cover of [[Hinder|Hinder's]] \"[[Lips of an Angel]]\".  Another one of his singles, \"[[Wherever You Are (Jack Ingram song)|Wherever You Are]]\", went to number one on the Billboard Chart.\n\nMany independent artists, which is the fastest growing segment of the global recorded music business, <ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissamdaniels/2019/07/10/for-independent-musicians-goingyour-own-way-is-finally-starting-to-pay-off/#45980f4f14f2</ref> have gained commercial success through the Texas music scene, such as albums debuting in the Top 5 of Billboard's Top Country Album sales. <ref>https://www.houstonpress.com/music/indie-texas-country-artists-racking-up-major-league-sales-8721118</ref>\n\n==Radio stations==\nTexas Country is unique in that radio stations throughout Texas have embraced the subgenre and regularly mix Texas country into a Country radio format:\n\n===Internet===\n*[[Texas Country Mix (Internet Radio)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.txcountrymix.com/|title=Texas Country Mix (Internet Radio)}}</ref>\n*[[GotRadio Texas Best (Internet Radio)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gotradio.com/|title=GotRadio Texas Best (Internet Radio)}}</ref>\n\n===Terrestrial (AM/FM)===\n*[[KBSO|KBSO 94.7 Corpus Christi, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://947jalapenocountry.com|title=KBSO 94.7 Corpus Christi, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KFLP-FM|KFLP 106.1 Floydada/Plainview/Lubbock, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://1061flipfm.com|title=KFLP 106.1 Floydada/Plainview/Lubbock, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KFWR|KFWR 95.9 Fort Worth, Texas]]\n*[[KFYN-FM|KFYN 104.3 Paris, Texas]]\n*[[KILT|KILT 100.3 HD3 Houston, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thebull.radio.com|title=KILT 100.3 HD3 Houston, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KKBQ|KKBQ 92.9 HD3 Pasadena, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thenew93q.com|title=KKBQ 92.9 HD3 Pasadena, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KKCN|KKCN 103.1 San Angelo, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://103kkcn.com|title=KKCN 103.1 San Angelo, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KNBT|KNBT 92.1 New Braunfels, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knbt.fm|title=KNBT 92.1 New Braunfels, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KOLI|KOLI 94.9 Wichita Falls, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://949theoutlaw.com|title=KOLI 94.9 Wichita Falls, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KOKE|KOKE 99.3/98.5 Austin, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kokefm.com|title=KOKE 99.3/98.5 Austin, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KORA|KORA 98.3 Bryan/College Station, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://983korafm.com|title=KORA 98.3 Bryan/College Station, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KPLX|KPLX 99.5 Dallas/Ft.
