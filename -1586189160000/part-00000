A survey team was sent out shortly after by the government to plot the new county's divisions. These surveyors were greeted by established homesteaders who had already begun clearing the land and planting crops. Prior to European settlement, Waverly was predominantly Big Woods which included a mixture of oak, maple, basswood and hickory. Small portions of wet prairie existed on the eastern edge of Waverly Lake and along the western edge of present-day CSAH 8.\n\nImpressed with the two lakes (Waverly and Little Waverly), available water power and the proximity of the Crow River one mile north, an entrepreneurial surveyor and his partners constructed a dam, saw mill and grist mill in 1856 at the outlet of Little Waverly Lake.   The settlement known as Waverly Mills was beginning to take shape, as approximately three hundred acres were surveyed and platted.  Waverly Mills was given its name after a community in Tioga County, New York, the former home of one of the partners.   After a rough start with a bank panic, financial crash and subsequent grasshopper infestations, Waverly Mills managed to survive.   Its saw and grist milling industry help to establish a store, post office and log church with a cemetery at this location.\n\nThe village was formerly called Waverly Station to distinguish it from Old Waverly, a pioneer village which in the early days flourished about a mile away. Waverly Station was laid out by the railroad company on their land in the southwest quarter of section 33, at about the time that regular trains commenced operating in this locality in 1868. A railroad station was erected that year, and a grain house the next. The first store was opened by T. R. Barrett, who operated it for a few years, and then changed it to a hotel under the name of the Keystone House.\n\nAmong the lodges in the early 1900s include the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic Order of Foresters, the Modern Woodmen of America, the Modern Brotherhood of America, the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the Royal Neighbors of America, and others.\n\nThe school which once stood where the current Humphrey Elementary School was built in 1905 and was composed of a brick structure, two stories high, with a basement; and ran by four teachers. In addition to a complete course, the school taught manual training and music.\n\nWaverly Station was incorporated as a village in 1881. And the village was reincorporated as Waverly in 1885. The following notation appears in the county records: \"March 16, 1885. A special election called by the trustees of the village of Waverly for the purpose of ascertaining by ballot whether the village of Waverly should continue as the incorporated under a special act of the legislature or become reincorporated under the General Statute of Minnesota, was held on Monday, March 16, 1885. Due notice of said election having been given and the object of said election having been fully set forth in notices, polls opened at 10 a. m. and closed at 4 p. m. Number of votes polled, 41 ; for reincorporation, 41 ; against, none. The village of Waverly was therefore declared reincorporated under the General Statutes of Minnesota and same recorded in the village records.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of Wright County|last=Curtiss-Wedge|first=Franklin|publisher=H. C. Cooper Jr. & Co|year=1915|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe prosperity of Waverly in those early days was aided by both railroad traffic and by patronage of the surrounding settlers in Woodland and Marysville Townships.  Many of these early farmers hailed from various parts of the United States, French Canada and European countries specifically from Sweden, Ireland, Germany, Prussia, Austria and Switzerland.  These pioneers supported Waverly's many institutions which included a post office, bank, newspapers, city hall, churches, creamery, school, grain elevators, flouring mills, saw mill, insurance agencies, hotels, livery stables, general stores, hardware dealers, furniture shops, lumber companies, bakery, meat markets, millinery shops, saloons and a drugstore to name just a few.\n\nWaverly moved faster and progressed farther in 30 years than some its rival communities. Some claim that Waverly\u2019s businesses and buildings were some of the largest and finest in Wright County at their height of development.   One historical account stated that Waverly, \u201cis a pleasant, prosperous village, located on one of the very pleasant lakes; it is quite a summer resort for pleasure seekers\u2026.\u201d   Records indicate that by 1909, the population of Waverly had expanded to over 1,000 residents.\n\nSince its incorporation in 1869, Waverly has changed both physically and demographically. Like many similar rural communities of greater Minnesota, Waverly has felt the documented socio-economic effects of industrialized agriculture, rural exodus of young residents to regional urban cores and aging population.   Waverly hosted some small development in the 1930s and 40s and a small subdivision in the early 1960s.  But by 1980, Waverly's population had decreased to 470 persons.    Direct results of this rural trend were merging, consolidating or vanishing institutions and businesses.\n\nAcademic researchers have indicated that small communities like Waverly are entering a period of transition and metamorphosis. The grain elevators that once identified Waverly are gone, and new residential housing developments have appeared.   The Twin Cities Metropolitan Area that once seemed distant is now only a 40-minute car drive away.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2007, Waverly attracted the attention of residential developers in a flurry.   The large influx of new residents during this short time beckoned back to Waverly's historical boom period  prior  to 1900.    This  time  however,  the  growth  was  primarily  housing.    Several developments were platted including; Summerfields, Woodland Shores, Spring Meadows, Carrigan Meadows, Carrigan Estates and Windgate at Carrigan Lake.   The population has increased by over 60 percent since 2000 to nearly 1,300 on 2010 after many decades of static to no growth.  Waverly is now poised for future growth while continuing to maintain its small town appeal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.waverlymn.org/index.asp?SEC=7972415F-AACA-4691-9D97-96B44FA2741A&Type=B_BASIC|title=A History of Waverly - Waverly, MN|website=www.waverlymn.org|language=en|accessdate=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Waverly Village Hall (Waverly, Minnesota)|Waverly Village Hall]], built in 1939, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{NRISref|2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.55|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|1.69|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.86|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name =\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref>\n\n[[U.S. Highway 12]] serves as a main route in the community.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 124\n|1890= 370\n|1900= 542\n|1910= 460\n|1920= 418\n|1930= 458\n|1940= 458\n|1950= 493\n|1960= 574\n|1970= 573\n|1980= 470\n|1990= 600\n|2000= 732\n|2010= 1357\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1525\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,357 people, 520 households, and 357 families residing in the city.

The population was 1,357 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name=\"2010 Census\">{{cite web|title=2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&prodType=table|work=American FactFinder|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Census|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe framework for the City of Waverly began in 1855, when the territorial legislature passed an act organizing Wright County. A survey team was sent out shortly after by the government to plot the new county\u2019s divisions. These surveyors were greeted by established homesteaders who had already begun clearing the land and planting crops. Prior to European settlement, Waverly was predominantly Big Woods which included a mixture of oak, maple, basswood and hickory. Small portions of wet prairie existed on the eastern edge of Waverly Lake and along the western edge of present day CSAH 8.\n\nImpressed with the two lakes (Waverly and Little Waverly), available water power and the proximity of the Crow River one mile north, an entrepreneurial surveyor and his partners constructed a dam, saw mill and grist mill in 1856 at the outlet of Little Waverly Lake.   The settlement known as Waverly Mills was beginning to take shape, as approximately three hundred acres were surveyed and platted.  Waverly Mills was given its name after a community in Tioga County, New York, the former home of one of the partners.   After a rough start with a bank panic, financial crash and subsequent grasshopper infestations, Waverly Mills managed to survive.   Its saw and grist milling industry help to establish a store, post office and log church with a cemetery at this location.\n\nThe village was formerly called Waverly Station to distinguish it from Old Waverly, a pioneer village which in the early days flourished about a mile away. Waverly Station was laid out by the railroad company on their land in the southwest quarter of section 33, at about the time that regular trains commenced operating in this locality in 1868. A railroad station was erected that year, and a grain house the next. The first store was opened by T. R. Barrett, who operated it for a few years, and then changed it to a hotel under the name of the Keystone House.\n\nAmong the lodges in the early 1900s include the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic Order of Foresters, the Modern Woodmen of America, the Modern Brotherhood of America, the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the Royal Neighbors of America, and others.\n\nThe school which once stood where the current Humphrey Elementary School was built in 1905 and was composed of a brick structure, two stories high, with a basement; and ran by four teachers. In addition to a complete course, the school taught manual training and music.\n\nWaverly Station was incorporated as a village in 1881. And the village was reincorporated as Waverly in 1885. The following notation appears in the county records: \"March 16, 1885. A special election called by the trustees of the village of Waverly for the purpose of ascertaining by ballot whether the village of Waverly should continue as the incorporated under a special act of the legislature or become reincorporated under the General Statute of Minnesota, was held on Monday, March 16, 1885. Due notice of said election having been given and the object of said election having been fully set forth in notices, polls opened at 10 a. m. and closed at 4 p. m. Number of votes polled, 41 ; for reincorporation, 41 ; against, none. The village of Waverly was therefore declared reincorporated under the General Statutes of Minnesota and same recorded in the village records.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of Wright County|last=Curtiss-Wedge|first=Franklin|publisher=H. C. Cooper Jr. & Co|year=1915|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe prosperity of Waverly in those early days was aided by both railroad traffic and by patronage of the surrounding settlers in Woodland and Marysville Townships.  Many of these early farmers hailed from various parts of the United States, French Canada and European countries specifically from Sweden, Ireland, Germany, Prussia, Austria and Switzerland.  These pioneers supported Waverly's many institutions which included a post office, bank, newspapers, city hall, churches, creamery, school, grain elevators, flouring mills, saw mill, insurance agencies, hotels, livery stables, general stores, hardware dealers, furniture shops, lumber companies, bakery, meat markets, millinery shops, saloons and a drugstore to name just a few.\n\nWaverly moved faster and progressed farther in 30 years than some its rival communities. Some claim that Waverly\u2019s businesses and buildings were some of the largest and finest in Wright County at their height of development.   One historical account stated that Waverly, \u201cis a pleasant, prosperous village, located on one of the very pleasant lakes; it is quite a summer resort for pleasure seekers\u2026.\u201d   Records indicate that by 1909, the population of Waverly had expanded to over 1,000 residents.\n\nSince its incorporation in 1869, Waverly has changed both physically and demographically. Like many similar rural communities of greater Minnesota, Waverly has felt the documented socio-economic effects of industrialized agriculture, rural exodus of young residents to regional urban cores and aging population.   Waverly hosted some small development in the 1930s and 40s and a small subdivision in the early 1960s.  But by 1980, Waverly\u2019s population had decreased to 470 persons.    Direct results of this rural trend were merging, consolidating or vanishing institutions and businesses.\n\nAcademic researchers have indicated that small communities like Waverly are entering a period of transition and metamorphosis. The grain elevators that once identified Waverly are gone, and new residential housing developments have appeared.   The Twin Cities Metropolitan Area that once seemed distant is now only a 40 minute car drive away.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2007, Waverly attracted the attention of residential developers in a flurry.   The large influx of new residents during this short time beckoned back to Waverly\u2019s historical boom period  prior  to 1900.    This  time  however,  the  growth  was  primarily  housing.    Several developments were platted including; Summerfields, Woodland Shores, Spring Meadows, Carrigan Meadows, Carrigan Estates and Windgate at Carrigan Lake.   The population has increased by over 60 percent since 2000 to nearly 1,300 on 2010 after many decades of static to no growth.  Waverly is now poised for future growth while continuing to maintain its small town appeal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.waverlymn.org/index.asp?SEC=7972415F-AACA-4691-9D97-96B44FA2741A&Type=B_BASIC|title=A History of Waverly - Waverly, MN|website=www.waverlymn.org|language=en|accessdate=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Waverly Village Hall (Waverly, Minnesota)|Waverly Village Hall]], built in 1939, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{NRISref|2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.55|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|1.69|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.86|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name =\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref>\n\n[[U.S. Highway 12]] serves as a main route in the community.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 124\n|1890= 370\n|1900= 542\n|1910= 460\n|1920= 418\n|1930= 458\n|1940= 458\n|1950= 493\n|1960= 574\n|1970= 573\n|1980= 470\n|1990= 600\n|2000= 732\n|2010= 1357\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1525\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,357 people, 520 households, and 357 families residing in the city.

During one show in [[Twist, Arkansas]], a brawl broke out between two men and caused a fire. He evacuated along with the rest of the crowd but went back to retrieve his guitar. He said he later found out that the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille.

The rest of the city took heavy flooding. In a news report, state officials said Waveland took a harder hit from the wind and water than any other town along the Gulf Coast, and that the town was obliterated. 36 years earlier, in 1969, Waveland had been severely damaged by Hurricane Camille.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/about_us/meet_us/roger_pielke/camille/report.html |title=Hurricane Camille Report |publisher=Sciencepolicy.colorado.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}</ref>\n\nOfficial reports stated that approximately 50 people died when Waveland was hit directly by the eyewall of Katrina and the {{convert|26|ft|m|adj=on}} storm surge.

The game is a popular use of [[tetromino]]es, the four-element case of [[polyomino]]es, which have been used in popular puzzles since at least 1907. (The name for these figures was given by the mathematician [[Solomon W. Golomb]] in 1953.)\n\nThe game, or [[List of Tetris variants|one of its many variants]], is available for nearly every [[video game console]] and computer [[operating system]], as well as on devices such as [[graphing calculator]]s, [[mobile phones]], [[portable media player]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[Internet radio device|Network music players]], and as an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] on non-media products like [[oscilloscope]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/39244.html|title=HP 54600B Oscilloscope Easter Eggs|publisher=Eeggs.com|accessdate=November 12, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217031557/http://www.eeggs.com/items/39244.html|archive-date=December 17, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> It has inspired ''Tetris'' serving dishes,<ref>{{cite news|author=Perets, Abbi|title=Tetris-inspired dishware brings the game to dinner|url=https://www.cnet.com/8301-13553_1-10457461-32.html|work=CNet|date=February 22, 2010|access-date=February 25, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225183821/http://www.cnet.com/8301-13553_1-10457461-32.html|archive-date=February 25, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> and it has even been played on the sides of various buildings.<ref>{{cite magazine| last = Grossman| first = Samantha| title = Watch a Giant Game of Tetris Played on a Philadelphia Skyscraper| magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date = April 6, 2014| url = http://time.com/50988/giant-tetris-philadelphia-skyscraper/| accessdate = April 7, 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140406160502/http://time.com/50988/giant-tetris-philadelphia-skyscraper/| archive-date = April 6, 2014| url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nWhile versions of ''Tetris'' were sold for a range of 1980s home computer platforms as well as [[Arcade game|arcades]], it was the successful [[Tetris (Game Boy)|handheld version]] for the [[Game Boy]], launched in 1989, that established the game to critics and fans as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. {{As of|2011|12}}, the games in the franchise had sold 202{{nbsp}}million copies\u2014approximately 70{{nbsp}}million physical units and 132{{nbsp}}million paid [[mobile game]] downloads\u2014making it one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchises of all time]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Tetris basic game.gif|thumb|Video of an open-source ''Tetris'' [[Clone (video game)|clone]]]]\n''Tetris'' is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called \"[[Tetromino|tetriminos]]\", descend from the top of the field.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=377}} During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it.<ref name=\"AboutTetris\">{{cite web |url=https://tetris.com/about-us |title=About ''Tetris'' |publisher=The Tetris Company |accessdate=November 14, 2019}}</ref> The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them in most versions.<ref>''Tetris'' (Game Boy) instruction booklet, p. 4</ref><ref>''Tetris DS'' instruction booklet, p. 6</ref> The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many horizontal lines of blocks as possible.

However, in some versions of the game, the player can achieve a \"max-out\" by reaching the highest score that can be displayed (999,999 on a six-digit display).{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=377}} \n\nSince 1996, The Tetris Company has internally defined specifications and guidelines that publishers must adhere to in order to be granted a license to ''Tetris''. The contents of these guidelines establish such elements as the correspondence of buttons and actions, the size of the field of play, the system of rotation, and others.<ref name=\"HistoryOfTetris\">{{cite web |url=https://tetris.com/history-of-tetris |title=History of ''Tetris'' |publisher=The Tetris Company |accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"tftt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/interview/11267/tetris-from-the-top-an-interview-with-henk-rogers |title=''Tetris'' from the Top: An Interview with Henk Rogers |author=Metts, Jonathan |website=Nintendo World Report |date=April 6, 2006 |accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Game pieces===\n[[File:Tetrominoes IJLO STZ Worlds.svg|thumb|left|All seven tetriminos using the standard color scheme]]\nThe pieces on which the game of ''Tetris'' is based around are called \"tetriminos\". Pajitnov's original version for the [[Electronika 60]] computer used green brackets to represent the blocks that make up tetriminos.<ref name=\"vadim\"/> Versions of ''Tetris'' on the original Game Boy/Game Boy Color and on most dedicated handheld games use [[monochrome]] or grayscale graphics, but most popular versions use a separate color for each distinct shape. Prior to The Tetris Company's standardization in the early 2000s, those colors varied widely from implementation to implementation.\n\n===Scoring===\nThe scoring formula for the majority of ''Tetris'' products is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear in ''Tetris Zone'' is worth 100 points, clearing four lines at once (known as a ''Tetris'') is worth 800, while each subsequent back-to-back ''Tetris'' is worth 1,200.<ref name=\"tzmanual\">[http://zone.tetris.com/page/manual ''Tetris Zone'' manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023148/http://zone.tetris.com/page/manual |date=February 6, 2009 }} as of November 12, 2008</ref> In conjunction, players can be awarded combos that exist in certain games which reward multiple line clears in quick succession. The exact conditions for triggering combos, and the amount of importance assigned to them, vary from game to game.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nNearly all ''Tetris'' games allow the player to press a button to increase the speed of the current piece's descent or cause the piece to drop and lock into place immediately, known as a \"soft drop\" and a \"hard drop\", respectively. While performing a soft drop, the player can also stop the piece's increased speed by releasing the button before the piece settles into place. Some games only allow either soft drop or hard drop; others have separate buttons for both. Many games award a number of points based on the height that the piece fell before locking, so using the hard drop generally awards more points.\n\n=== Easy spin dispute ===\nAlthough not the first ''Tetris'' game to feature a new kind of ''Tetris'', \"easy spin\" (see ''[[The Next Tetris]]''), also called \"infinite spin\" by critics,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html |title=Tetris Worlds for Game Boy Advance Review |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=September 5, 2001 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028130427/http://www.gamespot.com/gba/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html |archive-date=October 28, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Tetris Worlds]]'' was the first game to fall under major criticisms for it. Easy spin refers to the property of a Tetromino to stop falling for a moment after left or right movement or rotation, effectively allowing someone to suspend the Tetromino while thinking on where to place it. This feature has been implemented into [[The Tetris Company]]'s official guideline.<ref name=\"tftt\"/> This type of play differs from traditional ''Tetris'' because it takes away the pressure of higher level speed. Some reviewers<ref name=\"gsrev\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html|title=Tetris Worlds for PlayStation 2 Review|accessdate=November 12, 2008|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 19, 2002|author1=Jeff Gerstmann|author2=Ryan Davis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130070533/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html|archive-date=January 30, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> went so far as to say that this mechanism broke the game. The goal in ''Tetris Worlds'', however, is to complete a certain number of lines as fast as possible, so the ability to hold off a piece's placement will not make achieving that goal any faster. Later, GameSpot received \"easy spin\" more openly, saying that \"the infinite spin issue honestly really affects only a few of the single-player gameplay modes in ''Tetris DS'', because any competitive mode requires you to lay down pieces as quickly as humanly possible.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/tetris/review.html |title=Tetris DS for DS Review \u2013 GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=March 20, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805040528/http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/tetris/review.html |archivedate=August 5, 2011 |df= }}</ref> In response to the issue, [[Henk Rogers]] stated in an interview that infinite spin was an intentional part of the game design, allowing novice players to expend some of their available scoring time to decide on the best placement of a piece. Rogers observed that \"gratuitous spinning\" does not occur in competitive play, as expert players do not require much time to think about where a piece should be placed. A limitation has been placed on infinite lock delay in later games of the franchise, where after a certain amount of inputs i.e.: rotations and movements, the piece will instantly lock itself. This is defaulted to 15 inputs.<ref name=\"tftt\"/>\n\n== History ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width    = 250\n | image1   = Tetris-VeryFirstVersion.png\n | caption1 = The first version of ''Tetris'', completed in 1984, run on an emulator of the [[Electronika 60]]\n | image2   = Tetris DOS 1986.png\n | caption2 = Screenshot of the 1986 IBM PC version developed by Dmitry Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]]\n | image3   = Tetris screenshot (Amiga, Infogrames).png\n | caption3 = The version designed by Spectrum Holobyte contained Russia-related images (Amiga version screenshot, 1988)\n}}\n\n=== Creation and early popularity ===\n''Tetris'' was created in June 1984 by [[Alexey Pajitnov]], an [[artificial intelligence]] researcher working for the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] (now the Russian Academy of Sciences) at the Computer Center in Moscow.<ref name=\"guardian2014\">{{cite news |author=Phil Hoad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jun/02/how-we-made-tetris |title=Tetris: how we made the addictive computer game &#124; Culture |newspaper=The Guardian |date=June 2, 2014 |accessdate=July 5, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621140034/https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jun/02/how-we-made-tetris |archive-date=June 21, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tasked with testing the capabilities of new hardware, Pajitnov would do so by writing simple games for them. He initially considered creating a game around [[pentomino]]es, which featured in puzzle games that he had enjoyed as a child, but felt that it might have been too complicated with twelve different shape variations, so the concept switched to [[tetromino]]es, of which there are seven variants.<ref name=\"guardian2014\" /> The [[Electronika 60]] computer used to develop the game had only a text-based display, so the tetrominoes had to consist of pseudo-graphics.<ref name=\"guardian2014\" /> Realizing that completed lines resulted in the screen filling up quickly, Pajitnov decided to delete them, creating a key part of ''Tetris'' gameplay.<ref name=\"guardian2014\" />\n\nPajitnov's game proved popular with his colleagues.<ref name=\"guardian2014\" /> Academy of Sciences co-workers Dmitry Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]] ported the game to the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]. Gerasimov reports that Pajitnov chose the name ''Tetris'' as \"a combination of '[[tetromino]]' and 'tennis'\". From there, the PC game became popular and began spreading around Moscow.<ref name=\"vadim\"/> Unsure of how to publish his game and fearful of the response of the Soviet regime if he did so, Pajitnov took the opportunity offered by [[Perestroika]] and gave the rights to the Soviet government for ten years.<ref name=\"guardian2014\" /><ref name=\"alexyinterview\">Boyes, Emma.

Retrieved October 31, 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Exportation and licensing ===\nPajitnov's boss at the Soviet Academy shared a copy with some colleagues at the SCKI Institute of Computer Science in [[Budapest]], Hungary, where it was ported to the Commodore 64 and Apple II by some of its students. It was at the institute where ''Tetris'' was \"discovered\" by Robert Stein, a man who ran a British software company named Andromeda Software. Stein asked the Institute's director about licensing, and the director told him that the game had come from the Soviet Union. The director had the number to the Soviet Academy's [[Telex]] machine, and Stein used the number to send a message stating that he wanted to acquire the rights to ''Tetris''. The message was forwarded to Pajitnov, and after several weeks of getting translations and proper authorization, Pajitnov sent a reply suggesting that he was interested in a deal. Stein interpreted this as a verbal agreement for him to sub-license ''Tetris'' rights, and he began to make deals with [[Mirrorsoft]] and [[Spectrum HoloByte]] that would allow the latter two to publish ''Tetris'' for computers in their respective regions. There was a problem, however: Stein did not have a signed contract with the Soviet Union. Stein sent a second Telex message to the Academy with his offer for ''Tetris'', and Pajitnov gave a vague, yet positive response. Stein continued to push for a deal with the Soviet Union, but while he was doing so, the Soviet Academy had intervened with the negotiations. The Academy's internal publishing and licensing group, AcademySoft, handled further negotiations with Stein. AcademySoft insisted that the only rights available were the IBM PC rights, and Stein agreed; he would negotiate for future ''Tetris'' rights later.<ref name=\"stts\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fQtxKmgJC8|title=The Story of Tetris}}</ref>\n\nSeveral months had passed since Stein found ''Tetris'' at the Hungarian Institute, and Stein still did not have a signed contract with the Soviet Union for any ''Tetris'' rights. Stein sent a Telex message to the Soviet Union in April 1987 stating that Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte were going to release their versions of ''Tetris'', but his forcefulness would get him nowhere. Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte had prepared their versions of ''Tetris'' for release under the assumption that Stein had secured all the rights with the Soviet Union, and Stein finalized his deals with the two companies in June 1987.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\n=== ''Tetris'' is released ===\nSome time before Mirrorsoft's and Spectrum HoloByte's versions of ''Tetris'' were released, Stein received a Telex message from another Soviet organization known as [[Elektronorgtechnica]] (\"Elorg\"). The message stated that Stein was selling ''Tetris'' illegally, and that further negotiations would have to go through them. Elorg learned that researchers at the Soviet Academy, including Pajitnov, were developing computer programs. Elorg met with Pajitnov to see if any of his programs could be sold internationally, and Pajitnov casually mentioned his ''Tetris'' dealings during the meeting. This shocked the Elorg representatives; they demanded that all of the paperwork be handed over immediately and they took over the ''Tetris'' negotiations. Stein flew to Moscow to explain himself at Elorg's request, and the two continued negotiations.<ref name=\"stts\"/> Although nothing was signed with the Soviet Union yet, the computer versions of ''Tetris'' were released in January 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/29/business/new-software-game-it-comes-from-soviet.html|title=New Software Game: It Comes From Soviet|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1988-01-29}}</ref> The Commodore 64 version had a 26-minute soundtrack composed by game musician Wally Beben.

Stein contacted Mirrorsoft to tell them that the deal was done, and Mirrorsoft inquired about other rights to ''Tetris''. Stein told them that future deals would be coming.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\n=== Henk Rogers enters the picture ===\n[[Henk Rogers]] was first exposed to ''Tetris'' while he was visiting the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in Las Vegas in January 1988. Phil Adam, the president of Spectrum HoloByte, stood on the showroom floor displaying ''Tetris'' to a line of attendees that included Rogers. Although Rogers considered ''Tetris'' to be the quietest game at the show, he was eventually hooked and pursued the rights to the game. Rogers learned that Gilman Louie, the CEO of Spectrum HoloByte, was going to Japan to try to shop the game. Louie pitched ''Tetris'' to [[ASCII]], but they turned it down, thinking it was \"too retro\". Louie eventually found Rogers and the two signed a letter of intent for Rogers' company, [[Blue Planet Software|Bullet-Proof Software]], to publish Tetris in Japan for every platform Rogers could think of, including [[Nintendo]]'s Famicom. Later on, Louie contacted Rogers to tell him that while he could have the Japanese home computer rights to Tetris, he would have to contact [[Atari Games]] if he wanted the Famicom and Japanese arcade rights. Engineers at Atari Games got addicted to the PC version of ''Tetris'', and that encouraged the company to get the console and arcade rights from Mirrorsoft in exchange for the PC rights to ''[[Blasteroids]]''. Atari Games initially declined to sub-license any rights to Rogers when he first contacted them. Despite this, Rogers flew out to California and camped out in the Atari Games parking lot, waiting for an opportunity to talk to its president, Hideyuki Nakajima. One day as Nakajima was leaving, Rogers made his pitch to him. After hearing it, Nakajima agreed to a meeting. The two had a meeting over a sushi dinner, and at the meeting, Nakajima told Rogers that while the Famicom rights were up for grabs, he couldn't have the Japanese arcade rights since they were already sold to [[Sega]]. Steve Hanawa, a representative of Sega of America at the time, learned about ''Tetris'' during the development of ''Monopoly''; the team developing the title was also developing a PC version of ''Tetris'', and Hanawa's addiction to the game led him to get Sega of Japan to license the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sega-16.com/2011/10/interview-steve-hanawa/|title=Interview: Steve Hanawa (SOA Director of R&D}}</ref> Regardless, Rogers paid Atari $300,000 for the Famicom rights.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nBullet-Proof Software had initially only received about 40,000 orders. Henk Rogers contacted [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]], the president of Nintendo at the time, in hopes that he could help him advertise the title. Yamauchi was interested, so he passed down Tetris to [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. Days later, Yamauchi sent a letter to Miyamoto asking if Tetris was a good game. Miyamoto said it was, and when Yamauchi asked why, Miyamoto said, \"Because your accountants and secretaries are playing it\". After this happened, Yamauchi agreed to push sales of Tetris.

Arakawa was intrigued; he was aware of the success of the Famicom version of ''Tetris'' in Japan. Rogers contacted Robert Stein under the assumption that he had the handheld rights and offered him $25,000 in advance for them. While this was happening, Mirrorsoft had contacted Stein to see if he could give them those same rights. Stein was wishy-washy with his response; he told Rogers that he would have to check with Elorg.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nAs time passed, Rogers grew suspicious of Stein and then got word that Gilman Louie was trying to sell the handheld rights to Nintendo. When Arakawa contacted Rogers about it, Rogers told him that Louie didn't actually have the handheld rights and that he needed Arakawa to give him a chance to finalize the deal. Figuring it would be easier to talk to Elorg himself to try to get the handheld rights instead of waiting for Stein to get back to him, Rogers headed to Elorg's headquarters. When Mirrorsoft caught wind of Nintendo's interest in the handheld rights to ''Tetris'', their parent company, the Maxwell Corporation, sent its joint managing director Kevin Maxwell to Elorg's headquarters.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nOn February 22, 1989, Stein, Rogers, and Maxwell headed to Elorg's headquarters to negotiate with Elorg about the handheld rights to Tetris. While Stein and Maxwell booked meetings with Elorg in advance, Rogers did not. Rogers was the first to arrive there; he asked someone at Elorg about who he could talk to about Tetris as soon as he arrived. He was directed to Nikolai Belikov, Elorg's managing director. Belikov had been hired by Elorg to sort out the licensing problems for ''Tetris''; Elorg was not getting paid. Rogers introduced himself by taking out a copy of the Famicom version of ''Tetris'' and said that he was the \"biggest publisher of Tetris in the world\". To Rogers' shock, Belikov told him that Elorg had not given any console rights to ''Tetris'' to anyone. Rogers told Belikov about the chain of licensees that fot him the rights, but Belikov told him that Elorg only gave the rights to Tetris to Andromeda Software, and that those rights were for home computers. After some discussion, Rogers and Belikov set up a meeting for the following day.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nStein's meeting with Belikov was scheduled to start, and Rogers had barely missed Stein as he was leaving. Stein had planned the meeting with the intent of getting the handheld rights to Tetris. However, what happened instead was that Belikov added an amendment to the contract between Elorg and Andromeda and that Stein agreed to look over the amended contract for a few days. The meeting with Maxwell began after Stein had left. Belikov showed Maxwell a copy of the Famicom version of ''Tetris'' and asked him what it was. Maxwell said that it may be a pirated version. The meeting resulted in Mirrorsoft getting a right of first refusal to any new rights to ''Tetris'', and it was confirmation for Elorg that the console rights to ''Tetris'' were never given to anyone.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nOn February 23, 1989, the scheduled meeting between Rogers and Elorg began. The two parties were at opposite ends of a long table; Rogers was on one end while Belikov, Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov, and other Elorg members were on the other end. Rogers started things off by giving the Elorg members a \"crash course\" of the video game market. After that, Elorg showed Rogers the original contract they had with Robert Stein of Andromeda Software. Rogers looked through it and found the line that had caused the licensing issues - the contract stated that Andromeda had the rights to Tetris for \"different types of computers\". Stein assumed that this also meant things like game consoles. After that, Rogers offered the Elorg members a fixed amount of money for each cartridge sold. Belikov asked Rogers to make a formal offer for the handheld rights after hearing the other offer. Stein met up with Belikov that same day with the signed contract, but Belikov stated that Elorg was not ready to hand over the handheld rights to Tetris yet. Rogers met up with Belikov a day later with the formal offer and gave it a one-week deadline.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nSometime later, Belikov contacted Rogers to tell him that Maxwell was bidding for the handheld rights. Rogers told Belikov that although he couldn't give him as much money as Maxwell, he could at least give him honesty and the promise to pay for each cartridge. Several days later, Rogers presented Elorg with a finalized contract and walked through its details. Belikov signed it, and it resulted in Rogers and Nintendo getting the handheld rights to Tetris.<ref name=\"stts\"/> The results of the licensing deal put Bullet-Proof Software as a licensor and Nintendo as a sub-licensor. On top of that, ''Tetris'' had been bundled with every Game Boy.<ref name=guardian020609/> Rogers later said, \"''Tetris'' made Game Boy and Game Boy made ''Tetris''.\"<ref name=\"guardian2014\" />\n\n=== Legal battles ===\n{{main|Tetris (Atari)}}\nAfter Henk Rogers successfully got the handheld rights to ''Tetris'', Elorg told him they would like for him to make an offer for the console rights to ''Tetris''. There would be trouble ahead: Mirrorsoft had the right of first refusal to any new rights to ''Tetris'', and Atari could potentially go after Rogers if they found out a deal was being made. When Rogers left Moscow, he contacted Nintendo to tell them that the console rights were available. Nintendo told Rogers to go back to Moscow with their offer of $5 million in advance and to contact them if he thinks a deal could happen. As soon as Nintendo found out a deal was possible, Minoru Arakawa and [[Howard Lincoln]] headed to Elorg's headquarters to secure the console rights. As soon as Nintendo got them, they sent a cease-and-desist letter to Atari Games.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nDespite the letter, Atari Games went through with releasing their NES version of ''Tetris'' through their subsidiary, [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]]. They distributed it under the name ''TET\u042fIS: The Soviet Mind Game'' (with [[faux Cyrillic]] typography incorporating the [[Ya (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic letter Ya]]). Atari Games sued Nintendo, believing they had the rights. After four weeks on the shelf, the courts ruled that Nintendo was the only company which had the rights to ''Tetris'' on home game systems. The amended contract with Andromeda had invalidated any \"console rights\" given out. Tengen's ''TET\u042fIS'' was recalled with an unknown number of copies sold.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=From Russia with Litigation|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=February 1997|page=42}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|year=2002|title=The Wish List|journal=Edge Presents Retro|id=|url=|quote=}}</ref>\n\nSega had planned to release a [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] version of ''Tetris'' on April 15, 1989, but they cancelled its release<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19890501p.pdf#page=14|title=Game Machine: \"Nintendo Offers Home Video Game 'Tetris'\"|publisher=Amusement Press|date=1989-05-01}}</ref> during Atari's licensing issues, resulting in fewer than ten copies being printed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/you-could-own-this-copy-of-tetris-for-only-1-000-000-5822380 |title=You Could Own This Copy of Tetris for Only $1,000,000 |first=Michael |last=McWhertor |work=Kotaku |date=July 18, 2011 | access-date=June 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604193847/https://kotaku.com/you-could-own-this-copy-of-tetris-for-only-1-000-000-5822380 |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> A new port of the arcade version by M2 was included in the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] microconsole, released in September 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/06/04/final-12-genesis-mini-games-list-includes-one-of-the-worlds-rarest-versions-of-tetris |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604221811/https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/06/04/final-12-genesis-mini-games-list-includes-one-of-the-worlds-rarest-versions-of-tetris |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tetris NES play.png|thumb|right|250px|A-Type game screenshot of the official [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version of ''Tetris'']]\nNintendo released their NES version of ''Tetris'' in November 1989.

Recent ''Tetris'' games have emphasized pace rather than endurance. Older releases such as Game Boy or NES ''Tetris'' offer records according to points. Since the meter for points is restricted to a specific number of digits, these games' records can be \"maxed out\" by an experienced player. The next big Game Boy release after ''Tetris'', ''Tetris DX'', in marathon mode\u2014comparable to mode A in previous releases\u2014allowed an additional digit for the point meter. Even so, players still maxed it to 9,999,999&nbsp;points after hours of play. For ''[[The New Tetris]]'', world record competitors have spent over 12&nbsp;hours playing the same game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=12&id=635 |title=Welcome to Twin Galaxies |publisher=Twingalaxies.com |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604221115/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=12&id=635 |archivedate=June 4, 2008 }}</ref> In ''Tetris DX'' and ''The New Tetris'', the new modes sprint and ultra were added. These modes require the player to act under a timer, either to gain the most lines or points in that time. Releases like ''Tetris Worlds'' removed point records. This particular game kept records by how fast a certain number of lines could be cleared depending on the level. Critics of ''Tetris Worlds'' said it was flawed by virtue of the ability of a piece to hover over the bottom for as long as a player needs.<ref name=\"gsrev\"/>\n\nMany different modes of play have been added in recent years. Modes appearing in more than one major release include classic marathon (game A), sprint (otherwise game B or 40 lines), ultra, square, and cascade.\n\nThe field dimension of ''Tetris'' is perhaps the least deviated among releases: almost always 10 cells wide by 20 high. Some releases on handheld platforms with small screens have smaller fields; for example, the ''Tetris Jr.'' [[Handheld electronic game|keychain game]] has 8 by 12, and ''Tetris'' for Game Boy has 10 by 18.\n\nTraditionally, blocks spawn within the four most central columns and the two highest rows. The ''I'' Tetrimino occupies columns 4, 5, 6 and 7, the ''O'' Tetrimino occupies columns 5 and 6, and the remaining 5 Tetriminos occupy columns 4, 5 and 6 (or in some, especially older, versions, 5, 6 and 7). In some more recent games, pieces spawn above the visible playfield.\n\nIn traditional games, a level-up would occur once every ten lines are cleared. In some newer games such as ''Tetris Worlds'', the number of lines required varies upon each new level. After a level-up, points awarded are increased and the blocks fall slightly faster. For example, NES ''Tetris'' operates at 60 frames per second. At level 0, a piece falls one step every 48 frames, and at level 19, a piece falls one step every 2 frames.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Level increments either terminate at a certain point (Game Boy ''Tetris'' tops off at level 20) or increase forever yet not in speed after a certain point. NES ''Tetris'' will level up in speed until level 29 (due to limitations of the game's engine, pieces are not capable of dropping faster than this), but tool-assisted emulation will show that the level indicator increases indefinitely\u2014eventually leading to a glitch where the meter displays non-numeric characters. Modern games such as ''Tetris the Grand Master'' or ''Tetris Worlds'', at their highest levels, opt to drop a piece more than one row per frame. Pieces will appear to reach the bottom as soon as they spawn. As a result, these games have a delay that lets the player slide the piece on the bottom for a moment to help deal with an otherwise unplayable fall speed. In some games, the hover time is regenerated after a piece is moved or rotated.\n\nSoft drops were first implemented in Nintendo releases of ''Tetris'' so that pieces would be able to drop faster while not locking as to slide into gaps. The other option is hard dropping, which originated in early PC games such as ''Microsoft Tetris'', a game developed by Dave Edson and bundled with [[Microsoft Entertainment Pack]]. With hard dropping, a piece falls and locks in one frame. Newer ''Tetris'' games feature both options. Some games have their locking roles reversed, with soft dropping making the pieces drop faster and locking down, and hard dropping making the pieces drop instantly but not lock.\n\nSingle direction rotation is an older restriction that has since been ruled out in nearly every new official release by the favor of separate buttons for clockwise and one for counter clockwise rotation. In traditional games, the unsymmetrical vertical orientation I-, Z-, and S-pieces will fill the same columns for each clockwise and counter clockwise rotation. Some games vary this by allowing two possible column orientations: one for counter clockwise and one for clockwise rotations. Double rotation\u2014only seen in progressive clones such as ''Quadra'' and ''DTET''\u2014rotates the piece 180\u00b0.\n\nOne of the features most appreciated by skilled players is ''wall kick'' or the ability to rotate the pieces even if these touch the left or right walls. In the NES version, for example, if a Z piece is \"vertically\" aligned and falling touching the left wall, the player cannot rotate the piece, giving the impression that the rotate buttons are locked. In this situation, the player has to move the piece one position to the right before rotating it, losing precious time. Proper implementations of wall kick first appeared in the arcade version of ''Tetris'' by Atari Games.\n\nPiece preview allows a look at the next piece to enter the field. This feature has been implemented since the earliest games, though in those early games, having the preview turned on made the score increase more slowly.\n\n== Variants ==\n{{Main|List of Tetris variants}}\n\nSeveral ''Tetris'' variants exist. Some feature alternate rules and pieces, some feature alternate topologies or dimensions, and others have completely different gameplay.\n\nA popular variant called \"The Grand Master\" eventually becomes so fast players have to use every second of time optimally, and it even has a mode dubbed \"Invisible Tetris\", where the blocks are only shown when falling \u2013 revealed when the game is over.\n\nBecause of its popularity and the relatively simple code required to produce the game, a game with nearly the same rules as ''Tetris'' is often used as a [[Hello world program|hello world]] project for programmers coding for a new system or programming language. This has resulted in the availability of a large number of [[Porting|ports]] for different platforms.\nFor instance, [[\u03bcTorrent]] and [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] contain similar shape-stacking games as easter eggs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/47291.html |title=uTorrent Easter Egg: Tetris in uTorrent |publisher=Eeggs.com |date=March 16, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121044523/http://www.eeggs.com/items/47291.html |archive-date=November 21, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=poenn |url=http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050103201954271 |title=macosxhints.com \u2013 Play Tetris in Terminal via emacs |publisher=Hints.macworld.com |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522153944/http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050103201954271 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== End of play ==\nPlayers lose a typical game of ''Tetris'' when they can no longer keep up with the increasing speed, or when the player can not find a timely solution to the Tetriminos they've been given and the Tetriminos stack up to the top of the playing field. This is commonly referred to as \"topping out\".\n\n=== Infinite gameplay impossibility ===\nThe question ''Would it be possible to play forever?'' was first considered in a thesis by John Brzustowski in 1992.<ref>John Brzustowski. [https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/3263/ubc_1992_spring_brzustowski_john.pdf?sequence=1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016151137/https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/3263/ubc_1992_spring_brzustowski_john.pdf?sequence=1 |date=October 16, 2013 }}. Retrieved October 16, 2013.</ref> The conclusion reached was that the game is statistically doomed to end. The reason has to do with the S and Z Tetriminos. If a player receives a sufficiently large sequence of alternating S and Z Tetriminos, the na\u00efve gravity used by the standard game eventually forces the player to leave holes on the board. The holes will necessarily stack to the top and, ultimately, end the game. If the pieces are distributed randomly, this sequence will eventually occur. Thus, if a game with, for example, an ideal, uniform, uncorrelated [[Random number generation|random number generator]] is played long enough, any player will top out.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061209110731/http://www.math.uic.edu/~burgiel/Tetris/explanation.html Dr. Burgiel's Tetris Research Page, Explanation].

Some [[List of Tetris variants|variants]] allow the player to choose to play with only S and Z Tetriminos, and a good player may survive well over 150 consecutive Tetriminos this way. On an implementation with an ideal uniform randomizer, the probability at any given time of the next 150 Tetriminos being only S and Z is ({{sfrac|2|7}})<sup>150</sup> (approximately {{val|2e-82}}). Most implementations use a [[pseudorandom number generator]] to generate the sequence of Tetriminos, and such an S\u2013Z sequence is almost certainly not contained in the sequence produced by the 32-bit [[linear congruential generator]] in many implementations (which has roughly {{val|4.2e9}} states). The \"evil\" algorithm in ''Bastet'' (an unofficial variant) often starts a game with a series of more than seven Z pieces.\n\nModern versions of ''Tetris'' released after 2001 use a bag-style randomizer that guarantees players will never receive more than four S or Z pieces in a row. This is one of the \"Indispensable Rules\" enforced by the ''Tetris Guideline'' that all officially licensed ''Tetris'' games must follow.<ref name=\"tftt\"/>\n\nRecent versions of ''Tetris'' such as ''Tetris Worlds'' allow the player to repeatedly rotate a block once it hits the bottom of the playfield without it locking into place (see [[#Easy spin dispute|Easy spin dispute]], above). This permits a player to play for an infinite amount of time, though not necessarily to land an infinite number of blocks.\n\n== Computational complexity ==\nIn [[computer science]], it is common to analyze the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of problems, including real life problems and games. It was proven that for the \"offline\" version of ''Tetris'' (the player knows the complete sequence of pieces that will be dropped, i.e. there is no hidden information) the following objectives are [[NP-complete]]:\n* Maximizing the number of rows cleared while playing the given piece sequence.\n* Maximizing the number of pieces placed before a loss occurs.\n* Maximizing the number of simultaneous clearing of four rows.\n* Minimizing the height of the highest filled grid square over the course of the sequence.\n\nAlso, it is [[Hardness of approximation|difficult to even approximately solve]] the first, second, and fourth problem.  It is [[NP-hard]], given an initial gameboard and a sequence of ''p'' pieces, to approximate the first two problems to within a factor of {{nowrap|''p''<sup>1 \u2212 ''\u03b5''</sup>}} for any constant {{nowrap|''\u03b5'' > 0}}.\nIt is NP-hard to approximate the last problem within a factor of {{nowrap|2 \u2212 ''\u03b5''}} for any constant {{nowrap|''\u03b5'' > 0}}.\n\nTo prove NP-completeness, it was shown that there is a polynomial [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] between the [[3-partition problem]], which is also NP-complete, and the ''Tetris'' problem.<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Tetris_COCOON2003/paper.pdf|title=Tetris is Hard, Even to Approximate|last1=Demaine|first1=Erik D.|last2=Hohenberger|first2=Susan|last3=Liben-Nowell|first3=David|date=July 25\u201328, 2003|conference=Proceedings of the 9th International Computing and Combinatorics Conference (COCOON 2003)|conferenceurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105042734/http://www.cs.montana.edu/bhz/cocoon03.html|location=Big Sky, Montana|access-date=December 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613201613/http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Tetris_COCOON2003/paper.pdf|archive-date=June 13, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{See also|Korobeiniki#Tetris arrangements and modern cover versions|Tetris (Game Boy video game)#Music}}\n\n=== Game Boy version ===\n* Music A has become a well-known song in its own right.

The game is a popular use of [[tetromino]]es, the four-element case of [[polyomino]]es, which have been used in popular puzzles since at least 1907. (The name for these figures was given by the mathematician [[Solomon W. Golomb]] in 1953.)\n\nThe game, or [[List of Tetris variants|one of its many variants]], is available for nearly every [[video game console]] and computer [[operating system]], as well as on devices such as [[graphing calculator]]s, [[mobile phones]], [[portable media player]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[Internet radio device|Network music players]], and as an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] on non-media products like [[oscilloscope]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/39244.html|title=HP 54600B Oscilloscope Easter Eggs|publisher=Eeggs.com|accessdate=November 12, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217031557/http://www.eeggs.com/items/39244.html|archive-date=December 17, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> It has inspired ''Tetris'' serving dishes,<ref>{{cite news|author=Perets, Abbi|title=Tetris-inspired dishware brings the game to dinner|url=https://www.cnet.com/8301-13553_1-10457461-32.html|work=CNet|date=February 22, 2010|access-date=February 25, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225183821/http://www.cnet.com/8301-13553_1-10457461-32.html|archive-date=February 25, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> and it has even been played on the sides of various buildings.<ref>{{cite magazine| last = Grossman| first = Samantha| title = Watch a Giant Game of Tetris Played on a Philadelphia Skyscraper| magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date = April 6, 2014| url = http://time.com/50988/giant-tetris-philadelphia-skyscraper/| accessdate = April 7, 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140406160502/http://time.com/50988/giant-tetris-philadelphia-skyscraper/| archive-date = April 6, 2014| url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nWhile versions of ''Tetris'' were sold for a range of 1980s home computer platforms as well as [[Arcade game|arcades]], it was the successful [[Tetris (Game Boy)|handheld version]] for the [[Game Boy]], launched in 1989, that established the game to critics and fans as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. {{As of|2011|12}}, the games in the franchise had sold 202{{nbsp}}million copies\u2014approximately 70{{nbsp}}million physical units and 132{{nbsp}}million paid [[mobile game]] downloads\u2014making it one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchises of all time]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Tetris basic game.gif|thumb|Video of an open-source ''Tetris'' [[Clone (video game)|clone]]]]\n''Tetris'' is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called \"[[Tetromino|tetriminos]]\", descend from the top of the field.{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=377}} During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it.<ref name=\"AboutTetris\">{{cite web |url=https://tetris.com/about-us |title=About ''Tetris'' |publisher=The Tetris Company |accessdate=November 14, 2019}}</ref> The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them in most versions.<ref>''Tetris'' (Game Boy) instruction booklet, p. 4</ref><ref>''Tetris DS'' instruction booklet, p. 6</ref> The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many horizontal lines of blocks as possible.

However, in some versions of the game, the player can achieve a \"max-out\" by reaching the highest score that can be displayed (999,999 on a six-digit display).{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=377}} \n\nSince 1996, The Tetris Company has internally defined specifications and guidelines that publishers must adhere to in order to be granted a license to ''Tetris''. The contents of these guidelines establish such elements as the correspondence of buttons and actions, the size of the field of play, the system of rotation, and others.<ref name=\"HistoryOfTetris\">{{cite web |url=https://tetris.com/history-of-tetris |title=History of ''Tetris'' |publisher=The Tetris Company |accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"tftt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/interview/11267/tetris-from-the-top-an-interview-with-henk-rogers |title=''Tetris'' from the Top: An Interview with Henk Rogers |author=Metts, Jonathan |website=Nintendo World Report |date=April 6, 2006 |accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Game pieces===\n[[File:Tetrominoes IJLO STZ Worlds.svg|thumb|left|All seven tetriminos using the standard color scheme]]\nThe pieces on which the game of ''Tetris'' is based around are called \"tetriminos\".

Prior to The Tetris Company's standardization in the early 2000s, those colors varied widely from implementation to implementation.\n\n===Scoring===\nThe scoring formula for the majority of ''Tetris'' products is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear in ''Tetris Zone'' is worth 100 points, clearing four lines at once (known as a ''Tetris'') is worth 800, while each subsequent back-to-back ''Tetris'' is worth 1,200.<ref name=\"tzmanual\">[http://zone.tetris.com/page/manual ''Tetris Zone'' manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023148/http://zone.tetris.com/page/manual |date=February 6, 2009 }} as of November 12, 2008</ref> In conjunction, players can be awarded combos that exist in certain games which reward multiple line clears in quick succession. The exact conditions for triggering combos, and the amount of importance assigned to them, vary from game to game.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nNearly all ''Tetris'' games allow the player to press a button to increase the speed of the current piece's descent or cause the piece to drop and lock into place immediately, known as a \"soft drop\" and a \"hard drop\", respectively. While performing a soft drop, the player can also stop the piece's increased speed by releasing the button before the piece settles into place. Some games only allow either soft drop or hard drop; others have separate buttons for both. Many games award a number of points based on the height that the piece fell before locking, so using the hard drop generally awards more points.\n\n=== Easy spin dispute ===\nAlthough not the first ''Tetris'' game to feature a new kind of ''Tetris'', \"easy spin\" (see ''[[The Next Tetris]]''), also called \"infinite spin\" by critics,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html |title=Tetris Worlds for Game Boy Advance Review |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=September 5, 2001 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028130427/http://www.gamespot.com/gba/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html |archive-date=October 28, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Tetris Worlds]]'' was the first game to fall under major criticisms for it. Easy spin refers to the property of a Tetromino to stop falling for a moment after left or right movement or rotation, effectively allowing someone to suspend the Tetromino while thinking on where to place it. This feature has been implemented into [[The Tetris Company]]'s official guideline.<ref name=\"tftt\"/> This type of play differs from traditional ''Tetris'' because it takes away the pressure of higher level speed. Some reviewers<ref name=\"gsrev\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html|title=Tetris Worlds for PlayStation 2 Review|accessdate=November 12, 2008|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 19, 2002|author1=Jeff Gerstmann|author2=Ryan Davis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130070533/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/tetrisworlds/review.html|archive-date=January 30, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> went so far as to say that this mechanism broke the game. The goal in ''Tetris Worlds'', however, is to complete a certain number of lines as fast as possible, so the ability to hold off a piece's placement will not make achieving that goal any faster. Later, GameSpot received \"easy spin\" more openly, saying that \"the infinite spin issue honestly really affects only a few of the single-player gameplay modes in ''Tetris DS'', because any competitive mode requires you to lay down pieces as quickly as humanly possible.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/tetris/review.html |title=Tetris DS for DS Review \u2013 GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=March 20, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805040528/http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/tetris/review.html |archivedate=August 5, 2011 |df= }}</ref> In response to the issue, [[Henk Rogers]] stated in an interview that infinite spin was an intentional part of the game design, allowing novice players to expend some of their available scoring time to decide on the best placement of a piece. Rogers observed that \"gratuitous spinning\" does not occur in competitive play, as expert players do not require much time to think about where a piece should be placed. A limitation has been placed on infinite lock delay in later games of the franchise, where after a certain amount of inputs i.e.: rotations and movements, the piece will instantly lock itself. This is defaulted to 15 inputs.<ref name=\"tftt\"/>\n\n== History ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width    = 250\n | image1   = Tetris-VeryFirstVersion.png\n | caption1 = The first version of ''Tetris'', completed in 1984, run on an emulator of the [[Electronika 60]]\n | image2   = Tetris DOS 1986.png\n | caption2 = Screenshot of the 1986 IBM PC version developed by Dmitry Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]]\n | image3   = Tetris screenshot (Amiga, Infogrames).png\n | caption3 = The version designed by Spectrum Holobyte contained Russia-related images (Amiga version screenshot, 1988)\n}}\n\n=== Creation and early popularity ===\n''Tetris'' was created in June 1984 by [[Alexey Pajitnov]], an [[artificial intelligence]] researcher working for the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] (now the Russian Academy of Sciences) at the Computer Center in Moscow.<ref name=\"guardian2014\">{{cite news |author=Phil Hoad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jun/02/how-we-made-tetris |title=Tetris: how we made the addictive computer game &#124; Culture |newspaper=The Guardian |date=June 2, 2014 |accessdate=July 5, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621140034/https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jun/02/how-we-made-tetris |archive-date=June 21, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tasked with testing the capabilities of new hardware, Pajitnov would do so by writing simple games for them. He initially considered creating a game around [[pentomino]]es, which featured in puzzle games that he had enjoyed as a child, but felt that it might have been too complicated with twelve different shape variations, so the concept switched to [[tetromino]]es, of which there are seven variants.<ref name=\"guardian2014\" /> The [[Electronika 60]] computer used to develop the game had only a text-based display, so the tetrominoes had to consist of pseudo-graphics.<ref name=\"guardian2014\" /> Realizing that completed lines resulted in the screen filling up quickly, Pajitnov decided to delete them, creating a key part of ''Tetris'' gameplay.<ref name=\"guardian2014\" />\n\nPajitnov's game proved popular with his colleagues.<ref name=\"guardian2014\" /> Academy of Sciences co-workers Dmitry Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]] ported the game to the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]. Gerasimov reports that Pajitnov chose the name ''Tetris'' as \"a combination of '[[tetromino]]' and 'tennis'\". From there, the PC game became popular and began spreading around Moscow.<ref name=\"vadim\"/> Unsure of how to publish his game and fearful of the response of the Soviet regime if he did so, Pajitnov took the opportunity offered by [[Perestroika]] and gave the rights to the Soviet government for ten years.<ref name=\"guardian2014\" /><ref name=\"alexyinterview\">Boyes, Emma.

It was at the institute where ''Tetris'' was \"discovered\" by Robert Stein, a man who ran a British software company named Andromeda Software. Stein asked the Institute's director about licensing, and the director told him that the game had come from the Soviet Union. The director had the number to the Soviet Academy's [[Telex]] machine, and Stein used the number to send a message stating that he wanted to acquire the rights to ''Tetris''. The message was forwarded to Pajitnov, and after several weeks of getting translations and proper authorization, Pajitnov sent a reply suggesting that he was interested in a deal. Stein interpreted this as a verbal agreement for him to sub-license ''Tetris'' rights, and he began to make deals with [[Mirrorsoft]] and [[Spectrum HoloByte]] that would allow the latter two to publish ''Tetris'' for computers in their respective regions. There was a problem, however: Stein did not have a signed contract with the Soviet Union. Stein sent a second Telex message to the Academy with his offer for ''Tetris'', and Pajitnov gave a vague, yet positive response. Stein continued to push for a deal with the Soviet Union, but while he was doing so, the Soviet Academy had intervened with the negotiations. The Academy's internal publishing and licensing group, AcademySoft, handled further negotiations with Stein. AcademySoft insisted that the only rights available were the IBM PC rights, and Stein agreed; he would negotiate for future ''Tetris'' rights later.<ref name=\"stts\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fQtxKmgJC8|title=The Story of Tetris}}</ref>\n\nSeveral months had passed since Stein found ''Tetris'' at the Hungarian Institute, and Stein still did not have a signed contract with the Soviet Union for any ''Tetris'' rights. Stein sent a Telex message to the Soviet Union in April 1987 stating that Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte were going to release their versions of ''Tetris'', but his forcefulness would get him nowhere. Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte had prepared their versions of ''Tetris'' for release under the assumption that Stein had secured all the rights with the Soviet Union, and Stein finalized his deals with the two companies in June 1987.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\n=== ''Tetris'' is released ===\nSome time before Mirrorsoft's and Spectrum HoloByte's versions of ''Tetris'' were released, Stein received a Telex message from another Soviet organization known as [[Elektronorgtechnica]] (\"Elorg\"). The message stated that Stein was selling ''Tetris'' illegally, and that further negotiations would have to go through them. Elorg learned that researchers at the Soviet Academy, including Pajitnov, were developing computer programs. Elorg met with Pajitnov to see if any of his programs could be sold internationally, and Pajitnov casually mentioned his ''Tetris'' dealings during the meeting. This shocked the Elorg representatives; they demanded that all of the paperwork be handed over immediately and they took over the ''Tetris'' negotiations. Stein flew to Moscow to explain himself at Elorg's request, and the two continued negotiations.<ref name=\"stts\"/> Although nothing was signed with the Soviet Union yet, the computer versions of ''Tetris'' were released in January 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/29/business/new-software-game-it-comes-from-soviet.html|title=New Software Game: It Comes From Soviet|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1988-01-29}}</ref> The Commodore 64 version had a 26-minute soundtrack composed by game musician Wally Beben.

Stein contacted Mirrorsoft to tell them that the deal was done, and Mirrorsoft inquired about other rights to ''Tetris''. Stein told them that future deals would be coming.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\n=== Henk Rogers enters the picture ===\n[[Henk Rogers]] was first exposed to ''Tetris'' while he was visiting the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in Las Vegas in January 1988. Phil Adam, the president of Spectrum HoloByte, stood on the showroom floor displaying ''Tetris'' to a line of attendees that included Rogers. Although Rogers considered ''Tetris'' to be the quietest game at the show, he was eventually hooked and pursued the rights to the game. Rogers learned that Gilman Louie, the CEO of Spectrum HoloByte, was going to Japan to try to shop the game. Louie pitched ''Tetris'' to [[ASCII]], but they turned it down, thinking it was \"too retro\". Louie eventually found Rogers and the two signed a letter of intent for Rogers' company, [[Blue Planet Software|Bullet-Proof Software]], to publish Tetris in Japan for every platform Rogers could think of, including [[Nintendo]]'s Famicom. Later on, Louie contacted Rogers to tell him that while he could have the Japanese home computer rights to Tetris, he would have to contact [[Atari Games]] if he wanted the Famicom and Japanese arcade rights. Engineers at Atari Games got addicted to the PC version of ''Tetris'', and that encouraged the company to get the console and arcade rights from Mirrorsoft in exchange for the PC rights to ''[[Blasteroids]]''. Atari Games initially declined to sub-license any rights to Rogers when he first contacted them. Despite this, Rogers flew out to California and camped out in the Atari Games parking lot, waiting for an opportunity to talk to its president, Hideyuki Nakajima. One day as Nakajima was leaving, Rogers made his pitch to him. After hearing it, Nakajima agreed to a meeting. The two had a meeting over a sushi dinner, and at the meeting, Nakajima told Rogers that while the Famicom rights were up for grabs, he couldn't have the Japanese arcade rights since they were already sold to [[Sega]]. Steve Hanawa, a representative of Sega of America at the time, learned about ''Tetris'' during the development of ''Monopoly''; the team developing the title was also developing a PC version of ''Tetris'', and Hanawa's addiction to the game led him to get Sega of Japan to license the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sega-16.com/2011/10/interview-steve-hanawa/|title=Interview: Steve Hanawa (SOA Director of R&D}}</ref> Regardless, Rogers paid Atari $300,000 for the Famicom rights.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nBullet-Proof Software had initially only received about 40,000 orders. Henk Rogers contacted [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]], the president of Nintendo at the time, in hopes that he could help him advertise the title. Yamauchi was interested, so he passed down Tetris to [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. Days later, Yamauchi sent a letter to Miyamoto asking if Tetris was a good game. Miyamoto said it was, and when Yamauchi asked why, Miyamoto said, \"Because your accountants and secretaries are playing it\". After this happened, Yamauchi agreed to push sales of Tetris. Orders increased from 40,000 to over 200,000.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nBullet-Proof Software's home computer versions of ''Tetris'' were released on November 18, 1988,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000823075838/http://www.bps.co.jp/04_products/index71.html|title=Products: Personal Computers|publisher=Bullet-Proof Software}}</ref> while the Famicom version was released on December 22.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000823075808/http://www.bps.co.jp/04_products/index31.html|title=Products: Family Computer|publisher=Bullet-Proof Software}}</ref> The Famicom version would go on to sell over 2 million copies in Japan,<ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\nSega's arcade version for [[Sega System 16]] and System E arcade boards were released in December 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sega-interactive.co.jp/product/9260|title=\u30c6\u30c8\u30ea\u30b9|publisher=Sega}}</ref><ref>{{KLOV game|10082|Tetris (Sega)}}</ref> It won the Japanese [[Gamest]] Award for [[Game of the Year]] the following year, and it was number-three in ''[[Famitsu|Famicom Ts\u016bshin]]''{{'}}s August and September 1989 arcade earnings charts.<ref>''[[Famitsu|Famicom Ts\u016bshin]]'', issue 19 (September 15, 1989)</ref> It rose to number two in October 1989, overtaking [[Namco]]'s [[racing video game]] ''[[Winning Run]]''.<ref>''[[Famitsu|Famicom Ts\u016bshin]]'', issue 22 (October 27, 1989)</ref>\n\n=== Licensing issues ===\n{{main|Tetris (NES video game)|Tetris (Game Boy video game)}}\nIn December 1988, Rogers met with the president of Nintendo of America at the time, [[Minoru Arakawa]] at NOA's headquarters to discuss the possibility of ''Tetris'' being one of the launch titles for the upcoming [[Game Boy]]. Arakawa was intrigued; he was aware of the success of the Famicom version of ''Tetris'' in Japan. Rogers contacted Robert Stein under the assumption that he had the handheld rights and offered him $25,000 in advance for them. While this was happening, Mirrorsoft had contacted Stein to see if he could give them those same rights. Stein was wishy-washy with his response; he told Rogers that he would have to check with Elorg.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nAs time passed, Rogers grew suspicious of Stein and then got word that Gilman Louie was trying to sell the handheld rights to Nintendo. When Arakawa contacted Rogers about it, Rogers told him that Louie didn't actually have the handheld rights and that he needed Arakawa to give him a chance to finalize the deal. Figuring it would be easier to talk to Elorg himself to try to get the handheld rights instead of waiting for Stein to get back to him, Rogers headed to Elorg's headquarters. When Mirrorsoft caught wind of Nintendo's interest in the handheld rights to ''Tetris'', their parent company, the Maxwell Corporation, sent its joint managing director Kevin Maxwell to Elorg's headquarters.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nOn February 22, 1989, Stein, Rogers, and Maxwell headed to Elorg's headquarters to negotiate with Elorg about the handheld rights to Tetris. While Stein and Maxwell booked meetings with Elorg in advance, Rogers did not. Rogers was the first to arrive there; he asked someone at Elorg about who he could talk to about Tetris as soon as he arrived. He was directed to Nikolai Belikov, Elorg's managing director. Belikov had been hired by Elorg to sort out the licensing problems for ''Tetris''; Elorg was not getting paid. Rogers introduced himself by taking out a copy of the Famicom version of ''Tetris'' and said that he was the \"biggest publisher of Tetris in the world\". To Rogers' shock, Belikov told him that Elorg had not given any console rights to ''Tetris'' to anyone. Rogers told Belikov about the chain of licensees that fot him the rights, but Belikov told him that Elorg only gave the rights to Tetris to Andromeda Software, and that those rights were for home computers. After some discussion, Rogers and Belikov set up a meeting for the following day.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nStein's meeting with Belikov was scheduled to start, and Rogers had barely missed Stein as he was leaving. Stein had planned the meeting with the intent of getting the handheld rights to Tetris. However, what happened instead was that Belikov added an amendment to the contract between Elorg and Andromeda and that Stein agreed to look over the amended contract for a few days. The meeting with Maxwell began after Stein had left. Belikov showed Maxwell a copy of the Famicom version of ''Tetris'' and asked him what it was. Maxwell said that it may be a pirated version. The meeting resulted in Mirrorsoft getting a right of first refusal to any new rights to ''Tetris'', and it was confirmation for Elorg that the console rights to ''Tetris'' were never given to anyone.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nOn February 23, 1989, the scheduled meeting between Rogers and Elorg began. The two parties were at opposite ends of a long table; Rogers was on one end while Belikov, Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov, and other Elorg members were on the other end. Rogers started things off by giving the Elorg members a \"crash course\" of the video game market. After that, Elorg showed Rogers the original contract they had with Robert Stein of Andromeda Software. Rogers looked through it and found the line that had caused the licensing issues - the contract stated that Andromeda had the rights to Tetris for \"different types of computers\". Stein assumed that this also meant things like game consoles. After that, Rogers offered the Elorg members a fixed amount of money for each cartridge sold. Belikov asked Rogers to make a formal offer for the handheld rights after hearing the other offer. Stein met up with Belikov that same day with the signed contract, but Belikov stated that Elorg was not ready to hand over the handheld rights to Tetris yet. Rogers met up with Belikov a day later with the formal offer and gave it a one week deadline.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nSometime later, Belikov contacted Rogers to tell him that Maxwell was bidding for the handheld rights. Rogers told Belikov that although he couldn't give him as much money as Maxwell, he could at least give him honesty and the promise to pay for each cartridge. Several days later, Rogers presented Elorg with a finalized contract and walked through its details. Belikov signed it, and it resulted in Rogers and Nintendo getting the handheld rights to Tetris.<ref name=\"stts\"/> The results of the licensing deal put Bullet-Proof Software as a licensor and Nintendo as a sub-licensor. On top of that, ''Tetris'' had been bundled with every Game Boy.<ref name=guardian020609/> Rogers later said, \"''Tetris'' made Game Boy and Game Boy made ''Tetris''.\"<ref name=\"guardian2014\" />\n\n=== Legal battles ===\n{{main|Tetris (Atari)}}\nAfter Henk Rogers successfully got the handheld rights to ''Tetris'', Elorg told him they would like for him to make an offer for the console rights to ''Tetris''. There would be trouble ahead: Mirrorsoft had the right of first refusal to any new rights to ''Tetris'', and Atari could potentially go after Rogers if they found out a deal was being made. When Rogers left Moscow, he contacted Nintendo to tell them that the console rights were available. Nintendo told Rogers to go back to Moscow with their offer of $5 million in advance and to contact them if he thinks a deal could happen. As soon as Nintendo found out a deal was possible, Minoru Arakawa and [[Howard Lincoln]] headed to Elorg's headquarters to secure the console rights. As soon as Nintendo got them, they sent a cease-and-desist letter to Atari Games.<ref name=\"stts\"/>\n\nDespite the letter, Atari Games went through with releasing their NES version of ''Tetris'' through their subsidiary, [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]]. They distributed it under the name ''TET\u042fIS: The Soviet Mind Game'' (with [[faux Cyrillic]] typography incorporating the [[Ya (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic letter Ya]]). Atari Games sued Nintendo, believing they had the rights. After four weeks on the shelf, the courts ruled that Nintendo was the only company which had the rights to ''Tetris'' on home game systems. The amended contract with Andromeda had invalidated any \"console rights\" given out. Tengen's ''TET\u042fIS'' was recalled with an unknown number of copies sold.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=From Russia with Litigation|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=February 1997|page=42}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|year=2002|title=The Wish List|journal=Edge Presents Retro|id=|url=|quote=}}</ref>\n\nSega had planned to release a [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] version of ''Tetris'' on April 15, 1989, but they cancelled its release<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onitama.tv/gamemachine/pdf/19890501p.pdf#page=14|title=Game Machine: \"Nintendo Offers Home Video Game 'Tetris'\"|publisher=Amusement Press|date=1989-05-01}}</ref> during Atari's licensing issues, resulting in fewer than ten copies being printed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/you-could-own-this-copy-of-tetris-for-only-1-000-000-5822380 |title=You Could Own This Copy of Tetris for Only $1,000,000 |first=Michael |last=McWhertor |work=Kotaku |date=July 18, 2011 | access-date=June 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604193847/https://kotaku.com/you-could-own-this-copy-of-tetris-for-only-1-000-000-5822380 |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> A new port of the arcade version by M2 was included in the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] microconsole, released in September 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/06/04/final-12-genesis-mini-games-list-includes-one-of-the-worlds-rarest-versions-of-tetris |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604221811/https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/06/04/final-12-genesis-mini-games-list-includes-one-of-the-worlds-rarest-versions-of-tetris |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tetris NES play.png|thumb|right|250px|A-Type game screenshot of the official [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version of ''Tetris'']]\nNintendo released their NES version of ''Tetris'' in November 1989.

Recent ''Tetris'' games have emphasized pace rather than endurance. Older releases such as Game Boy or NES ''Tetris'' offer records according to points. Since the meter for points is restricted to a specific number of digits, these games' records can be \"maxed out\" by an experienced player. The next big Game Boy release after ''Tetris'', ''Tetris DX'', in marathon mode\u2014comparable to mode A in previous releases\u2014allowed an additional digit for the point meter. Even so, players still maxed it to 9,999,999&nbsp;points after hours of play. For ''[[The New Tetris]]'', world record competitors have spent over 12&nbsp;hours playing the same game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=12&id=635 |title=Welcome to Twin Galaxies |publisher=Twingalaxies.com |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604221115/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=12&id=635 |archivedate=June 4, 2008 }}</ref> In ''Tetris DX'' and ''The New Tetris'', the new modes sprint and ultra were added. These modes require the player to act under a timer, either to gain the most lines or points in that time. Releases like ''Tetris Worlds'' removed point records. This particular game kept records by how fast a certain number of lines could be cleared depending on the level. Critics of ''Tetris Worlds'' said it was flawed by virtue of the ability of a piece to hover over the bottom for as long as a player needs.<ref name=\"gsrev\"/>\n\nMany different modes of play have been added in recent years. Modes appearing in more than one major release include classic marathon (game A), sprint (otherwise game B or 40 lines), ultra, square, and cascade.\n\nThe field dimension of ''Tetris'' is perhaps the least deviated among releases: almost always 10 cells wide by 20 high. Some releases on handheld platforms with small screens have smaller fields; for example, the ''Tetris Jr.'' [[Handheld electronic game|keychain game]] has 8 by 12, and ''Tetris'' for Game Boy has 10 by 18.\n\nTraditionally, blocks spawn within the four most central columns and the two highest rows. The ''I'' Tetrimino occupies columns 4, 5, 6 and 7, the ''O'' Tetrimino occupies columns 5 and 6, and the remaining 5 Tetriminos occupy columns 4, 5 and 6 (or in some, especially older, versions, 5, 6 and 7). In some more recent games, pieces spawn above the visible playfield.\n\nIn traditional games, a level-up would occur once every ten lines are cleared. In some newer games such as ''Tetris Worlds'', the number of lines required varies upon each new level. After a level-up, points awarded are increased and the blocks fall slightly faster. For example, NES ''Tetris'' operates at 60 frames per second. At level 0, a piece falls one step every 48 frames, and at level 19, a piece falls one step every 2 frames.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Level increments either terminate at a certain point (Game Boy ''Tetris'' tops off at level 20) or increase forever yet not in speed after a certain point. NES ''Tetris'' will level up in speed until level 29 (due to limitations of the game's engine, pieces are not capable of dropping faster than this), but tool-assisted emulation will show that the level indicator increases indefinitely\u2014eventually leading to a glitch where the meter displays non-numeric characters. Modern games such as ''Tetris the Grand Master'' or ''Tetris Worlds'', at their highest levels, opt to drop a piece more than one row per frame. Pieces will appear to reach the bottom as soon as they spawn. As a result, these games have a delay that lets the player slide the piece on the bottom for a moment to help deal with an otherwise unplayable fall speed. In some games, the hover time is regenerated after a piece is moved or rotated.\n\nSoft drops were first implemented in Nintendo releases of ''Tetris'' so that pieces would be able to drop faster while not locking as to slide into gaps. The other option is hard dropping, which originated in early PC games such as ''Microsoft Tetris'', a game developed by Dave Edson and bundled with [[Microsoft Entertainment Pack]]. With hard dropping, a piece falls and locks in one frame. Newer ''Tetris'' games feature both options. Some games have their locking roles reversed, with soft dropping making the pieces drop faster and locking down, and hard dropping making the pieces drop instantly but not lock.\n\nSingle direction rotation is an older restriction that has since been ruled out in nearly every new official release by the favor of separate buttons for clockwise and one for counter clockwise rotation. In traditional games, the unsymmetrical vertical orientation I-, Z-, and S-pieces will fill the same columns for each clockwise and counter clockwise rotation. Some games vary this by allowing two possible column orientations: one for counter clockwise and one for clockwise rotations. Double rotation\u2014only seen in progressive clones such as ''Quadra'' and ''DTET''\u2014rotates the piece 180\u00b0.\n\nOne of the features most appreciated by skilled players is ''wall kick'' or the ability to rotate the pieces even if these touch the left or right walls. In the NES version, for example, if a Z piece is \"vertically\" aligned and falling touching the left wall, the player cannot rotate the piece, giving the impression that the rotate buttons are locked. In this situation, the player has to move the piece one position to the right before rotating it, losing precious time. Proper implementations of wall kick first appeared in the arcade version of ''Tetris'' by Atari Games.\n\nPiece preview allows a look at the next piece to enter the field. This feature has been implemented since the earliest games, though in those early games, having the preview turned on made the score increase more slowly.\n\n== Variants ==\n{{Main|List of Tetris variants}}\n\nSeveral ''Tetris'' variants exist. Some feature alternate rules and pieces, some feature alternate topologies or dimensions, and others have completely different gameplay.\n\nA popular variant called \"The Grand Master\" eventually becomes so fast players have to use every second of time optimally, and it even has a mode dubbed \"Invisible Tetris\", where the blocks are only shown when falling \u2013 revealed when the game is over.\n\nBecause of its popularity and the relatively simple code required to produce the game, a game with nearly the same rules as ''Tetris'' is often used as a [[Hello world program|hello world]] project for programmers coding for a new system or programming language. This has resulted in the availability of a large number of [[Porting|ports]] for different platforms.\nFor instance, [[\u03bcTorrent]] and [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]] contain similar shape-stacking games as easter eggs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/47291.html |title=uTorrent Easter Egg: Tetris in uTorrent |publisher=Eeggs.com |date=March 16, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121044523/http://www.eeggs.com/items/47291.html |archive-date=November 21, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=poenn |url=http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050103201954271 |title=macosxhints.com \u2013 Play Tetris in Terminal via emacs |publisher=Hints.macworld.com |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522153944/http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050103201954271 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== End of play ==\nPlayers lose a typical game of ''Tetris'' when they can no longer keep up with the increasing speed, or when the player can not find a timely solution to the Tetriminos they've been given and the Tetriminos stack up to the top of the playing field. This is commonly referred to as \"topping out\".\n\n=== Infinite gameplay impossibility ===\nThe question ''Would it be possible to play forever?'' was first considered in a thesis by John Brzustowski in 1992.<ref>John Brzustowski. [https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/3263/ubc_1992_spring_brzustowski_john.pdf?sequence=1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016151137/https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/3263/ubc_1992_spring_brzustowski_john.pdf?sequence=1 |date=October 16, 2013 }}. Retrieved October 16, 2013.</ref> The conclusion reached was that the game is statistically doomed to end. The reason has to do with the S and Z Tetriminos. If a player receives a sufficiently large sequence of alternating S and Z Tetriminos, the na\u00efve gravity used by the standard game eventually forces the player to leave holes on the board. The holes will necessarily stack to the top and, ultimately, end the game. If the pieces are distributed randomly, this sequence will eventually occur. Thus, if a game with, for example, an ideal, uniform, uncorrelated [[Random number generation|random number generator]] is played long enough, any player will top out.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061209110731/http://www.math.uic.edu/~burgiel/Tetris/explanation.html Dr. Burgiel's Tetris Research Page, Explanation].

Some [[List of Tetris variants|variants]] allow the player to choose to play with only S and Z Tetriminos, and a good player may survive well over 150 consecutive Tetriminos this way. On an implementation with an ideal uniform randomizer, the probability at any given time of the next 150 Tetriminos being only S and Z is ({{sfrac|2|7}})<sup>150</sup> (approximately {{val|2e-82}}). Most implementations use a [[pseudorandom number generator]] to generate the sequence of Tetriminos, and such an S\u2013Z sequence is almost certainly not contained in the sequence produced by the 32-bit [[linear congruential generator]] in many implementations (which has roughly {{val|4.2e9}} states). The \"evil\" algorithm in ''Bastet'' (an unofficial variant) often starts a game with a series of more than seven Z pieces.\n\nModern versions of ''Tetris'' released after 2001 use a bag-style randomizer that guarantees players will never receive more than four S or Z pieces in a row. This is one of the \"Indispensable Rules\" enforced by the ''Tetris Guideline'' that all officially licensed ''Tetris'' games must follow.<ref name=\"tftt\"/>\n\nRecent versions of ''Tetris'' such as ''Tetris Worlds'' allow the player to repeatedly rotate a block once it hits the bottom of the playfield without it locking into place (see [[#Easy spin dispute|Easy spin dispute]], above). This permits a player to play for an infinite amount of time, though not necessarily to land an infinite number of blocks.\n\n== Computational complexity ==\nIn [[computer science]], it is common to analyze the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of problems, including real life problems and games. It was proven that for the \"offline\" version of ''Tetris'' (the player knows the complete sequence of pieces that will be dropped, i.e. there is no hidden information) the following objectives are [[NP-complete]]:\n* Maximizing the number of rows cleared while playing the given piece sequence.\n* Maximizing the number of pieces placed before a loss occurs.\n* Maximizing the number of simultaneous clearing of four rows.\n* Minimizing the height of the highest filled grid square over the course of the sequence.\n\nAlso, it is [[Hardness of approximation|difficult to even approximately solve]] the first, second, and fourth problem.  It is [[NP-hard]], given an initial gameboard and a sequence of ''p'' pieces, to approximate the first two problems to within a factor of {{nowrap|''p''<sup>1 \u2212 ''\u03b5''</sup>}} for any constant {{nowrap|''\u03b5'' > 0}}.\nIt is NP-hard to approximate the last problem within a factor of {{nowrap|2 \u2212 ''\u03b5''}} for any constant {{nowrap|''\u03b5'' > 0}}.\n\nTo prove NP-completeness, it was shown that there is a polynomial [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] between the [[3-partition problem]], which is also NP-complete, and the ''Tetris'' problem.<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Tetris_COCOON2003/paper.pdf|title=Tetris is Hard, Even to Approximate|last1=Demaine|first1=Erik D.|last2=Hohenberger|first2=Susan|last3=Liben-Nowell|first3=David|date=July 25\u201328, 2003|conference=Proceedings of the 9th International Computing and Combinatorics Conference (COCOON 2003)|conferenceurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105042734/http://www.cs.montana.edu/bhz/cocoon03.html|location=Big Sky, Montana|access-date=December 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613201613/http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Tetris_COCOON2003/paper.pdf|archive-date=June 13, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{See also|Korobeiniki#Tetris arrangements and modern cover versions|Tetris (Game Boy video game)#Music}}\n\n=== Game Boy version ===\n* Music A has become a well-known song in its own right.

If the player fails to complete the puzzle, the voice of Buddy Rubino will make a [[Santa Claus]] type laugh and will encourage the player with a comment such as: \"Squares man! They're just squares!\" or \"Shapes are hard!\" and Buddy will then say \"Life lost\" and one of the four squares on the top screen will disappear. After every stage is completed Buddy will tell the player with a comment such as: \"Level up!\" and there will then be a 45-second bonus round which the player can score two or more bonus points.\n\nIn the Pass It Mode, it is the same as the Marathon mode except Buddy Rubino will say \"Pass It\" to let other people join in.\n\n== Reception and Legacy==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = Arcade: {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Brad|title=Tetris|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2784&tab=review|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114201703/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2784&tab=review|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 14, 2014|publisher=AllGame|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref><br />C64: {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Sutyak|first=Jonathan|title=Tetris|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16887&tab=review|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115004356/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16887&tab=review|archive-date=November 15, 2014|publisher=AllGame |url-status=dead|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref><br />Macintosh: {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Savignano|first=Lisa Karen|title=Tetris|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11800&tab=review|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115004358/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11800&tab=review|archive-date=November 15, 2014|publisher=AllGame|url-status=dead|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref><br />NES&nbsp;(Tengen):&nbsp;{{Rating|4.5|5}}&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Skyler|title=Tetris|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14911&tab=review|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115004353/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14911&tab=review|archive-date=November 15, 2014|publisher=AllGame |url-status=dead|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref><br />NES&nbsp;(Nintendo):&nbsp;{{Rating|4.5|5}}&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Brett Alan|title=Tetris|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1331&tab=review|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216081022/http://allgame.com/game.php?id=1331&tab=review|archive-date=February 16, 2010|publisher=AllGame |url-status=dead|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n| CVG = 94%<ref name=\"CVG-1989-review\">{{cite magazine |url=http://live.worldofspectrum.org/files/thumb/4f2e51c9cdbbfbe/800/800 |title=Tetris Mastertronic |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |issue=92 |page=74 |date=June 1989 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417032455/http://live.worldofspectrum.org/files/thumb/4f2e51c9cdbbfbe/800/800 |archive-date=April 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| CRASH = 77%<ref name=\"Crash-19880review\">{{cite magazine |url=http://live.worldofspectrum.org/files/thumb/78d7602b35d0e2d/800/800 |title=Reviews: Tetris |magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] |issue=50 |page=10 |date=March 1988 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417032452/http://live.worldofspectrum.org/files/thumb/78d7602b35d0e2d/800/800 |archive-date=April 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| SUser = {{Rating|10|10}}<ref name=\"SinclairU-1988-review\">{{cite web |url=http://live.worldofspectrum.org/files/thumb/c53e67fb08dbe15/800/800 |title=TET\u042fIS: Arcade Review |magazine=[[Sinclair User]] |issue=1988 |page=13 |date=February 1988 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417032457/http://live.worldofspectrum.org/files/thumb/c53e67fb08dbe15/800/800 |archive-date=April 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| YSinclair = 9/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Worrall|first=Tony|title=Tetris|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/tetris.htm|publisher=The Your Sinclair Rock'n'Roll Years|accessdate=August 8, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427113515/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/tetris.htm|archivedate=April 27, 2012}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[Zzap!64]]''\n| rev1Score = 98%<ref>{{cite web|title=Gold Standard|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/zzap100/100thspec5.html|publisher=The Def Gui to Zzap!64|accessdate=August 8, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dzo6NOv6?url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/zzap100/100thspec5.html|archive-date=January 28, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]]''\n| rev2Score = 95%<ref name=\"ACE-1988-review\">{{cite web |url=http://live.worldofspectrum.org/files/thumb/4852d3d00d9894b/800/800 |title=Tetris: Can MIRRORSOFT pack them in? |publisher=[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]] |issue=5 |page=49 |date=February 1988 |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417035859/http://live.worldofspectrum.org/files/thumb/4852d3d00d9894b/800/800 |archive-date=April 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| award1Pub = Zzap!64\n| award1 = Gold Medal\n| award2Pub = Sinclair User\n| award2 = SU Classic\n}}\n''[[Compute!]]'' called the IBM version of ''Tetris'' \"one of the most addictive computer games this side of the [[Berlin Wall]] ...
