Christensen's politics were left-wing, deriving from [[anarcho-syndicalism]], but she believed that leftist ideas had a formative influence on both Italian Fascism and German National-Socialism, whose totalitarian perversions were a betrayal of these movements' socialist roots. Elements of a leftist and libertarian racial-socialism could therefore be reclaimed from the fascism in which they had become encrusted.<ref>Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 261.</ref> However, Christensen was also convinced that the diseases of Western culture demanded a spiritual remedy. Mills' almost-forgotten writings inspired her with a programme for re-connecting with the gods and goddesses of the old Norse and Germanic pantheons, which she identified with the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] in [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of the racial [[collective unconscious]]. According to Christensen, therefore, Odinism is organically related to race in that \"its principles are encoded in our genes\".<ref>Christensen 1984.</ref>\n\nThe [[\u00c1satr\u00fa]] movement as practiced by [[Stephen McNallen]] differed from Christensen's Odinist Fellowship in placing a greater emphasis on ritual and a lesser focus on racial ideology. In 1987, McNallen's [[Asatru Free Assembly]] collapsed from prolonged internal tensions arising from his repudiation of Nazi sympathizers within the organization. A group of these, including [[Wyatt Kaldenberg]], then joined the Odinist Fellowship (as its [[Los Angeles]] chapter) and formed an association with [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]], which led to a further rebuff since \"Else Christensen thought Metzger too racist, and members of the Arizona Kindred also wanted the Fellowship to be pro-white but not hostile to colored races and Jews\".<ref name=\"GC262\">Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 262.</ref> A series of defections from both of the main US-based organizations created secessionist groups with more radical agendas, among them Kaldenberg's ''Pagan Revival'' network and [[Jost Turner]]'s ''[[National Socialist Kindred]]''.<ref name=\"GC262\"/>\n\nKaplan and Weinberg note that \"the religious component of the Euro-American radical right subculture includes both pagan and Christian or pseudo-Christian elements,\" locating Satanist or Odinist Nazi Skinhead sects in the United States ([[Ben Klassen]]'s atheistic [[Creativity (religion)|Creativity Movement]]), Britain ([[David Myatt]]), Germany, Scandinavia and South Africa.<ref>Kaplan and Weinberg 1998: 88.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, some [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] groups and terrorists&mdash;including several with neo-fascist or neo-Nazi leanings&mdash;have built their ideologies around pagan religious imagery, including Odinism or Wotanism.

Dorff]]:\n<blockquote>In order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, one would need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be discerned from among variants. Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word necessitates human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will.<ref>Dorff, Elliot N. and Rosett, Arthur, A Living Tree; The Roots and Growth of Jewish Law, SUNY Press, 1988.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Howard Thurman]] was interviewed in the late 1970s for a BBC feature on religion. He told the interviewer:\n{{quote|I say that creeds, dogmas, and theologies are inventions of the mind. It is the nature of the mind to make sense out of experience, to reduce the conglomerates of experience to units of comprehension which we call principles, or ideologies, or concepts. Religious experience is dynamic, fluid, effervescent, yeasty. But the mind can't handle these so it has to imprison religious experience in some way, get it bottled up. Then, when the experience quiets down, the mind draws a bead on it and extracts concepts, notions, dogmas, so that religious experience can make sense to the mind. Meanwhile religious experience goes on experiencing, so that by the time I get my dogma stated so that I can think about it, the religious experience becomes an object of thought.<ref>[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jul1981/v38-2-criticscorner1.htm \"An Interview With Howard Thurman and Ronald Eyre\"], ''Theology Today'', Volume 38, Issue 2 (July 1981).</ref>}}\n\nInfluential criticisms of fundamentalism include [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]]'s books on Christian fundamentalism and [[Bassam Tibi]]'s analysis of Islamic fundamentalism.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nA study at the [[University of Edinburgh]] found that of its six measured dimensions of religiosity, \"lower intelligence is most associated with higher levels of fundamentalism.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The relationship between intelligence and multiple domains of religious belief: Evidence from a large adult US sample |author=Gary J.

The term was prefigured by ''[[The Fundamentals]]'', a collection of twelve books on five subjects published in 1910 and funded by the brothers Milton and [[Lyman Stewart]], but coined by Curtis Lee Lawes, editor of ''The Watchman-Examiner'', who proposed in the wake of the 1920 pre-convention meeting of the Northern Baptist Convention (now the [[American Baptist Churches USA]]) that those fighting for the fundamentals of the faith be called \"fundamentalists.\"<ref>Curtis Lee Laws, \"Convention Side Lights,\" The Watchman-Examiner, 8, no. 27 (1 July 1920), p 834.</ref> ''The Fundamentals'' came to represent a ''[[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]]'' that appeared late in the 19th century within some Protestant denominations in the United States, and continued in earnest through the 1920s.

Christensen's politics were left-wing, deriving from [[anarcho-syndicalism]], but she believed that leftist ideas had a formative influence on both Italian Fascism and German National-Socialism, whose totalitarian perversions were a betrayal of these movements' socialist roots. Elements of a leftist and libertarian racial-socialism could therefore be reclaimed from the fascism in which they had become encrusted.<ref>Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 261.</ref> However, Christensen was also convinced that the diseases of Western culture demanded a spiritual remedy. Mills' almost-forgotten writings inspired her with a programme for re-connecting with the gods and goddesses of the old Norse and Germanic pantheons, which she identified with the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] in [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of the racial [[collective unconscious]]. According to Christensen, therefore, Odinism is organically related to race in that \"its principles are encoded in our genes\".<ref>Christensen 1984.</ref>\n\nThe [[\u00c1satr\u00fa]] movement as practiced by [[Stephen McNallen]] differed from Christensen's Odinist Fellowship in placing a greater emphasis on ritual and a lesser focus on racial ideology. In 1987, McNallen's [[Asatru Free Assembly]] collapsed from prolonged internal tensions arising from his repudiation of Nazi sympathizers within the organization. A group of these, including [[Wyatt Kaldenberg]], then joined the Odinist Fellowship (as its [[Los Angeles]] chapter) and formed an association with [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]], which led to a further rebuff since \"Else Christensen thought Metzger too racist, and members of the Arizona Kindred also wanted the Fellowship to be pro-white but not hostile to colored races and Jews\".<ref name=\"GC262\">Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 262.</ref> A series of defections from both of the main US-based organizations created secessionist groups with more radical agendas, among them Kaldenberg's ''Pagan Revival'' network and [[Jost Turner]]'s ''[[National Socialist Kindred]]''.<ref name=\"GC262\"/>\n\nKaplan and Weinberg note that \"the religious component of the Euro-American radical right subculture includes both pagan and Christian or pseudo-Christian elements,\" locating Satanist or Odinist Nazi Skinhead sects in the United States ([[Ben Klassen]]'s atheistic [[Creativity (religion)|Creativity Movement]]), Britain ([[David Myatt]]), Germany, Scandinavia and South Africa.<ref>Kaplan and Weinberg 1998: 88.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, some [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] groups and terrorists&mdash;including several with neo-fascist or neo-Nazi leanings&mdash;have built their ideologies around pagan religious imagery, including Odinism or Wotanism.

According to economist [[John Quiggin]], the standard features of \"economic fundamentalist rhetoric\" are \"dogmatic\" assertions and the claim that anyone who holds contrary views is not a real economist.

Dorff]]:\n<blockquote>In order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, one would need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be discerned from among variants. Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word necessitates human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will.<ref>Dorff, Elliot N. and Rosett, Arthur, A Living Tree; The Roots and Growth of Jewish Law, SUNY Press, 1988.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Howard Thurman]] was interviewed in the late 1970s for a BBC feature on religion. He told the interviewer:\n{{quote|I say that creeds, dogmas, and theologies are inventions of the mind. It is the nature of the mind to make sense out of experience, to reduce the conglomerates of experience to units of comprehension which we call principles, or ideologies, or concepts. Religious experience is dynamic, fluid, effervescent, yeasty. But the mind can't handle these so it has to imprison religious experience in some way, get it bottled up. Then, when the experience quiets down, the mind draws a bead on it and extracts concepts, notions, dogmas, so that religious experience can make sense to the mind. Meanwhile religious experience goes on experiencing, so that by the time I get my dogma stated so that I can think about it, the religious experience becomes an object of thought.<ref>[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jul1981/v38-2-criticscorner1.htm \"An Interview With Howard Thurman and Ronald Eyre\"], ''Theology Today'', Volume 38, Issue 2 (July 1981).</ref>}}\n\nInfluential criticisms of fundamentalism include [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]]'s books on Christian fundamentalism and [[Bassam Tibi]]'s analysis of Islamic fundamentalism.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nA study at the [[University of Edinburgh]] found that of its six measured dimensions of religiosity, \"lower intelligence is most associated with higher levels of fundamentalism.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The relationship between intelligence and multiple domains of religious belief: Evidence from a large adult US sample |author=Gary J.

They are in the [[American League East|Eastern Division]] of the [[American League]]. They are owned by attorney [[Peter Angelos]].\n\n==Milwaukee Brewers==\n[[Image:MilwaukeeBrewers1889.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The 1889 Milwaukee Brewers]]\n\nThe modern Orioles franchise can trace its roots back to the original Milwaukee Brewers of the [[minor league baseball|minor league level]] of the old  [[Western League (U.S. baseball)|Western League]], beginning in 1894 when the league reorganized. The Brewers of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] were there when the WL under president [[Ban Johnson]] reorganized, upgrading and renamed itself the [[American League]] (\"American League of Base Ball Clubs\")  in 1900, beginning play in its following first season in 1901, competing in several northeastern cities head to head against the elder 25 year old [[National League|National League of Base Ball Clubs]] (\"National League\") playing since 1876.\n\nAt the end of the 1900 season, the new American League removed itself from professional baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the NL and the various nation-wide  minor leagues). At that time, travel by clubs was limited in time constraints on railroads to northeastern American cities which was considered prime \"major league\" territory. Other regions of the nation were deemed \"minors\" and too far away for road trips to far flung ballparks in southern, Midwestern and far west/Pacific areas to be reached in an overnight train trip. No National or American League teams/franchises for the first half of the 20th century were further west than [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] or no further south than [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\nTwo months later, the AL declared itself a competing major league. As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were one of only two Western League teams that didn't either fold or move (the other being the [[Detroit Tigers]]). During the first American League season, they finished dead last with a record of 48\u201389. During its lone Major League season, the team played at [[Lloyd Street Grounds]], between 16th and 18th Streets in Milwaukee.\n\nAs the baseball \"war\" of 1901-1903 heated up, the \"upstart\" American League began to challenge the senior circuit more directly. The American League had already fielded teams in head-to-head direct competition in three northeast cities in [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], and [[Philadelphia]], solid previous National League-only cities. It had planned to move the Brewers to [[St. Louis]], but those plans fizzled.\n\n'''''' Louis Browns==\n{{main article|History of the St. Louis Browns}}\n[[Image:StLouisBrowns.png|left|thumb|100px|St. Louis Browns Logo, circa 1936\u20131951]]\nIn [[1902 in baseball|1902]], however, the original league charter member Milwaukee Brewers team did move southwest to St. Louis, where it became the \"Browns\", in reference to the original name of the legendary 1880s club that by 1902 was renamed and then known as the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] of the National League. In their first St. Louis season by the shores of the [[Mississippi River]], the new Browns finished in second place. Although they usually fielded terrible or mediocre teams throughout their 51 years history from 1902 to 1953 (they had even  only four winning seasons from 1901 (in Milwaukee) to 1922), they were very popular at the gate however and drew fans.\n\nDuring this time, the Browns were best known for their role in [[1910 Chalmers Award|the race]] for the [[1910 Major League Baseball season|1910]] American League batting title. Detroit's [[Ty Cobb]] took the last game of the season off, believing that his slight lead over Cleveland's [[Nap Lajoie]] would hold up unless Lajoie had a near-perfect day at the plate. However, Cobb was one of the most despised players in baseball, and Browns catcher-manager [[Jack O'Connor (catcher)|Jack O'Connor]] ordered rookie third baseman [[Red Corriden]] to station himself in shallow left field. In each of his next five at bats, Lajoie bunted down the third-base line and made it to first easily. In his last at-bat, he reached base on an error &ndash; officially giving him a hitless at-bat. O'Connor and coach Harry Howell tried to bribe the official scorer, a woman, to change the call to a hit, even offering to buy her a new wardrobe. Cobb won the batting title by just a few thousandths of a point over Lajoie (though in 1978 sabermetrician / baseball historian [[Pete Palmer]] discovered that one game may have been counted twice in the statistics). The resulting outcry triggered an investigation by American League president [[Ban Johnson]]. At his insistence, Browns owner [[Robert Hedges (baseball)|Robert Hedges]] fired O'Connor and Howell; both men were informally banned from baseball for life.\n\nIn 1916, after years of prosperity at the gate, Hedges sold the team to cold-storage magnate [[Phil Ball (baseball)|Phil Ball]], who had owned the [[St. Louis Terriers]] of the short-lived now defunct [[Federal League]] (1914-1915), a vain attempt at expanding to a third major league. Ball's 17 years (1916-1933) tenure as owner saw the Browns' first period of prosperity; they were a contender for most of the early 1920s, even finishing second in [[1922 Major League Baseball season|1922]]. He made a considerable effort to make the Browns competitive, reinvesting all profits back into the team development.\n\nBall, however, committed several errors that dogged the franchise for years to come. His first major blunder was to fire [[Branch Rickey]], the then resident genius in the Browns' front office, in 1919 because of a conflict of egos, causing Rickey to jump to the crosstown Cardinals (later famous with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] after 1942). In 1920 [[Sam Breadon]], who had just purchased the Cardinals, convinced Ball to allow his team to share the Browns' home field, [[Sportsman's Park]].  With the money from the sale of the Cardinals' earlier home of [[Robison Field]], Rickey of the \"Cards\" began building an extensive farm system.  This eventually produced a later host of star players that brought the Cardinals far more competitive drawing power in paying fan numbers than the Browns in the American League.\n\nThe 1922 Browns excited their owner by almost beating the developing rising power of the \"Bronx Bombers\" the soon to be fabled [[New York Yankees]] to a pennant. The club was boasting the best players in franchise history, including [[George Sisler]], and an outfield trio &ndash; [[Ken Williams (baseball)|Ken Williams]], [[Baby Doll Jacobson]], and [[Jack Tobin]] &ndash; that batted .300 or better in 1919\u201323 and in 1925. In 1922, Williams became the first player in Major League history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in a season, something that would not be done again in the Majors until 1956.\n\nBall confidently predicted that there would be a [[World Series]] in Sportsman's Park by 1926. In anticipation, he increased the capacity of his ballpark from 18,000 to 30,000. Fulfilling his optimism in a strange way, there was indeed a World Series in Sportsman's Park in [[1926 World Series|1926]] hosting the national championship tournament, but it was the roommates of the Cardinals, not the Browns, who took part, upsetting the Yankees. St. Louis had been considered a \"Browns' town\" until then; after 1926, the Cardinals dominated St. Louis baseball for the next 25 years, while still technically tenants of the Browns-owned stadium. Meanwhile, the Browns rapidly fell into the cellar repeatedly.  They only had two winning records from 1927 to 1943, including a 43\u2013111 mark in [[1939 Major League Baseball season|1939]] that is still the worst in Brewers/Browns/Orioles A.L. franchise history, 1901-2020.\n\nOwner Ball died in 1933.  His estate executors ran the team for three years until Rickey of the Cardinals helped broker a sale to investment banker [[Donald Lee Barnes]], whose son-in-law, [[Bill DeWitt]], became the team's general manager.  To help finance the purchase, Barnes sold 20,000 shares of stock to the public at $5 dollars a share, an unusual practice then for a sports franchise.\n\n===World War II Era===\n\n====1944====\n{{main article|1944 St. Louis Browns season}}\n\nIn [[1944 Major League Baseball season|1944]], during [[World War II]] (1939/1941-1945), the Browns won their only St. Louis-based American League pennant and finally appearing in World Series competition, becoming the last of the 16 teams/franchises that made up the major leagues then from 1901 to 1960 to play in a World Series.  By comparison, each of the other seven American League teams had already appeared in at least three World Series years, and won the crown at least once.  Some critics called it a fluke, as most major league stars voluntarily joined or were drafted into the military; however, many of the Browns' best players were classified 4-F (unfit for the draft / military service). Amazingly, they faced their local rivals, the more successful [[1944 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]], in the [[1944 World Series]], the last World Series to date to be played entirely in only one stadium, and lost 4 games to 2.  After that amazing season, Barnes sold the Browns to businessman [[Richard Muckerman]], who cared more about improving Sportsman's Park facilities than getting better players to play in them.\n\n====Postwar 1945\u201346====\nIn [[1945 Major League Baseball season|1945]], the [[1945 St. Louis Browns season|Browns]] posted an 81\u201375 record and fell to third place, six games out, again with less than top-ranked talent. The 1945 season may be best remembered for the Browns' signing of utility outfielder [[Pete Gray]], the only one-armed major league position player in American sports history.  They tumbled down to seventh place in [[1946 Major League Baseball season|1946]]. They would never again finish with a winning record while still in St. Louis, partly because owner Muckerman was unwilling to improve the on-field product.  Muckerman sold the team to former general manager (1936-xxx),  (and former owner Barnes son-in-law) Bill DeWitt in [[1949 Major League Baseball season|1949]], but now new owner DeWitt was unable to reverse the decades long slide.\n\n===Bill Veeck's Browns===\nIn [[1951 in baseball|1951]], [[Bill Veeck]], the experimental, colorful but controversial former maverick owner of the [[Cleveland Indians]], purchased the Browns. In St. Louis, he extended the promotions and wild antics that had made him famous and loved by many and loathed by many others. His most notorious stunt in St. Louis came on August 19, 1951, when the.mercurial but sly Veeck instructed Browns manager, [[Zack Taylor (baseball)|Zack Taylor]] to send in [[Eddie Gaedel]], a 3-foot 7&nbsp;inch, 65-pound [[midget]], to bat as a pinch hitter.<ref>{{cite news |title=Zack Taylor Dead At 76 |agency=Associated Press |work=The Milwaukee Sentinel |page=5 |date=20 September 1974 |accessdate=4 June 2012 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O29QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=thEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7022,1061064&dq=zack+taylor+catcher&hl=en}}</ref> When Gaedel stepped to the plate he was wearing a Browns uniform with the number \"1/8\" on his back, and little slippers turned up at the end like fairy tale elf's shoes. With hardly no [[strike zone]] to speak of, Gaedel [[walk (baseball)|walked]] on four straight pitches. The stunt infuriated American League President [[Will Harridge]], who immediately voided Gaedel's newly signed baseball contract the next day. In another Veeck stunt, the Browns handed out placards \u2013 reading ''take, swing, bunt'', etc. \u2013 to fans and allowed them to make managerial decisions for a day. Taylor dutifully surveyed the fans' advice and relayed the sign accordingly.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Mike Shatzkin |author2=Stephen Holtje |author3=James Charlton |title=The Ballplayers |publisher=Arbor House/William Morrow |location=New York |year=1990 |page= |isbn=0-87795-984-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ballplayersbaseb00shat }}</ref>\n\nVeeck also brought the legendary, and seemingly ageless, [[Satchel Paige]] back to major league baseball to pitch for the Browns. Veeck had previously signed the former [[Negro League]] great to a contract in Cleveland in [[1948 Major League Baseball season|1948]] (a year after Branch Rickey introduced [[Jackie Robinson]] to the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] of the N.L. integrating previously white-only major leagues), at an \"elderly\" age 42, amid much criticism. At 45, Paige's re-appearance in a Browns' uniform did nothing to win Veeck friends among baseball's owners but did greatly increase the African-American numbers of St. Louis baseball fans to Browns games, swelling the meager crowds in Sportsman's Park. Nonetheless, Paige ended his final season with a respectable 3\u20134 record and a 4.79 ERA.\n\nVeeck believed that St. Louis eventually was too small a sports market for two MLB franchises (by the later 20th century, only 3 cities of [[New York City]], [[Chicago]] and later [[Los Angeles]] would have double league teams, [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], and finally St. Louis all had one of their franchises move), and planned to hopefully be the one to drive the Cardinals out of town since he and the Browns owned the stadium. He signed many of the Cardinals' most locally loved ex-players and, as a result, brought many of their fans in to see the Browns. Veeck signed former Cardinals great [[Dizzy Dean]] to a broadcasting contract and tapped former \"Redbirds\" great [[Rogers Hornsby]] as Brownies  manager. He also re-acquired former Browns fan favorite [[Vern Stephens]] and signed former Cardinals pitcher [[Harry Brecheen]], both of whom had starred in the famed all-St. Louis World Series of 1944. He stripped Sportsman's Park of any Cardinals material and decorations and dressed it up in exclusively Browns memorabilia and colors. He even moved his family to an apartment living under the stands.\n\nVeeck's showmanship and colorful promotions made the fan experience at a Browns game much more fun and unpredictable than that at a Cardinals game. At the same time, the Cardinals were finally feeling the effects of Rickey's departure for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] in [[1942 Major League Baseball season|1942]]. In early 1953, then Cardinals owner [[Fred Saigh]] was indicted for tax evasion, and ultimately pleaded no contest to lesser charges.  Facing almost certain banishment from baseball, Saigh was forced to put the Cardinals up for sale.  For a time, no credible offers surfaced from St. Louis business / civic interests, and it looked as if Veeck's all-out assault on the Cardinals might indeed force them out of town leaving his team with a monopoly.\n\nHowever, Saigh turned down higher offers from out-of-town buyers in favor of a bid from the St. Louis-based [[Anheuser-Busch]] brewery, which stepped in with the specific intent of keeping the Cardinals in St. Louis. Veeck quickly realized that the Cardinals now had more resources than he could possibly hope to match. Reluctantly, he decided to cede St. Louis to the Cardinals and move the Browns elsewhere. The Browns had been candidates for relocation earlier; in 1941, they had come close to moving to Los Angeles, nearly two decades before Major League Baseball eventually arrived in [[California]]. The American League even drew up a schedule including Los Angeles and had a meeting scheduled to vote on the relocation of the Browns.  However, on December 7, the day the vote was scheduled, the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor]].\n\nSoon after Anheuser-Busch closed on its purchase of the Cardinals, Veeck sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals\u2013thus ending a situation where the more popular team in a two-team city was the tenant of the less-popular team. It is very likely Veeck would have had to sell it in any event, as the 44-year-old park had fallen into disrepair. The city was threatening to have it condemned, and Veeck could not afford to make the necessary improvements to bring it up to code even with the rent from the Cardinals.\n\nVeeck attempted to move the Browns back to [[Milwaukee]] (where he had owned the [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Brewers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] in the 1940s) for the [[1953 Major League Baseball season|1953 season]]. However, the other American League owners blocked the move, seemingly for reasons that were more personal than business related. \n\nVeeck then tried to move the Browns to [[Baltimore]].  He got in touch with [[List of mayors of Baltimore, Maryland|Mayor]] [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.|Tommy D'Alesandro]] and attorney [[Clarence Miles]], who were leading an effort to bring the major leagues back to Baltimore after a half-century hiatus.  However, he was rebuffed by the owners, still seething at the publicity stunts he pulled at the Browns home games.\n\nAfter the season, Veeck cut a deal with Miles which would see the Browns move to Baltimore. Under the plan, Veeck would sell half of his 80 percent stake in the Browns to Miles and several other Baltimore investors, with Veeck remaining as principal owner. Despite being assured by American League president [[Will Harridge]] that there would be no problem getting approval, only four owners voted aye &ndash; two short of passage. Reportedly, this was due to Yankees co-owner [[Del Webb]] drumming up support to move the Browns to Los Angeles.\n\nMiles and D'Alesandro realized that the owners were simply looking for a way to push Veeck out. Over the next 48 hours, Miles lined up enough support from his group of investors to buy out Veeck's stake entirely for $2.5 million. The plan called for Baltimore brewer [[Jerold Hoffberger]] to emerge as the largest single shareholder, though Miles became team president.  With his only leverage, ownership of Sportsman's Park, gone and facing threats of having his franchise liquidated, Veeck had little choice but to agree.  Miles' first act was to submit a renewed request to move to Baltimore for the 1954 season. With Veeck \"out of the way,\" this request was swiftly approved.\n\n===Legacy===\nUnlike other clubs that relocated in the 1950s, retaining their nickname and a sense of continuity with their past (such as the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn-Los Angeles Dodgers]]), the Browns were renamed upon their transfer, implicitly severing themselves from their history. In December 1954, the team further distanced itself from its Browns past by making a 17-player trade with the [[New York Yankees]] that included most former Browns of note still on the roster. Though the deal did little to improve the short-term competitiveness of the club, it did help establish a fresh identity for the franchise. To this day, it mentions almost nothing about its past in St. Louis.\n\nThere are still societies to keep the memory of the team alive in St. Louis. The club was in St. Louis for 52 years. In 2006, the O's played their 53rd season in Baltimore, meaning they have now played in Baltimore longer than they did in St. Louis.\n\n==Baltimore Orioles==\nSoon after taking over, the Miles-Hoffberger group renamed their new team the '''Baltimore Orioles'''. The name has a rich history in Baltimore, having been used by Baltimore baseball teams since the late 19th century.\n\n===History of the Orioles name===\n\nIn the 1890s, in the [[National League|National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (\"National League\")]], established in [[1876 in baseball|1876]], a powerful, innovative and scrappy  Baltimore Orioles squad included [[Willie Keeler|\"Wee\" Willie Keeler]], [[Wilbert Robinson]], [[Hughie Jennings]] and [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]]. They won three straight unprecedented NL pennants - - [[1894 in baseball|1894]]/[[1895 in baseball|1895]]/[[1896 in baseball|1896]], and participated in all four of the then \"[[Temple Cup]]\" championship series, winning the last two of them. \n\nThat Orioles team had started a decade and a half earlier as a charter member of the old [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in [[1882 in baseball|1882]], a competing rival to the then  7 year older Nationals. Despite its on-field success in either first or second place standings, it was unfortunately sabotaged as one of the four teams that was contracted out of existence by the National League after the [[1899 in baseball|1899]] season which reduced itself from 12 franchises to only 8 teams, a low number which endured for over half a century. Its best players (and its manager, [[Ned Hanlon (baseball)|Ned Hanlon]]) regrouped with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers]], turning that later famous team into a contender.\n\nIn [[1900 in baseball|1900]] and  [[1901 in baseball|1901]], Baltimore and infamous player/manager McGraw were awarded a charter franchise of the original 8 in the  newly reorganized [[American League|American League of Professional Baseball Clubs (\"American League\")]], (out of the old minor level Western League) now claiming major league status under feisty president [[Ban Johnson]], but again the team and city of Baltimore was sacrificed in favor of a New York City franchise - the \"New York Higlanders\", or occasionally known as the \"New York Americans\", as the team was transferred in [[1903 in baseball|1903]] to the nation's biggest city after only playing two seasons of ball of [[1901 in baseball|1901]] & [[1902 in baseball|1902]], as one of the terms negotiated of the \"peace pact\" to end the \"baseball wars\" between the elder [[National League|Nationals]] of 1876 and the fledging upstart [[American League]] of 1901, giving the newcomers a representative franchise in the one American city that was the biggest and most important. Another term of the truce was also with inauguration of a new championship game tournament series to be known as the [[World Series]], also begun in [[1903 World Series|1903]]. \n\nAfter some early struggles, that fledging [[History of the New York Yankees|New York Highlanders]] team eventually became renamed a decade later in [[1913 in baseball|1913]]  and by the 1920s with the help of a young  Baltimorean - [[Babe Ruth|George Herman \"Babe\" Ruth]] and eventually became baseball's most successful franchise &ndash; the [[New York Yankees]], the former legendary 19th century \"Baltimore Orioles\".\n\nAs a member of the high-minor league level in the  [[International League]] (with Canadian and Cuban teams competing against Americans), [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|these IL Orioles]] competed at what is now known as the \"Triple A\"  (\"AAA\")  [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] level from 1903 to 1953. Baltimore's own [[Babe Ruth]] pitched briefly for owner/manager [[Jack Dunn (baseball)|Jack Dunn's]] Orioles for part of one season after signing the 19 year old wild rough youth out of [[St. Mary's Industrial School]] on Wilkens and Caton Avenues, just on the southwest edge of the city before being forced to further sell him to the AL [[Boston Red Sox]] in [[1914 in baseball|1914]] because of the new third major league competition by the [[Baltimore Terrapins]] of the upstart [[Federal League]] for two seasons. \n\nThese Orioles of the old IL were among the best baseball teams in America offerng frequent competition to passing AL and NL teams in exhibitions. These \"Birds\"  won nine league championships, first in [[1908 in baseball|1908]] followed by a lengthy dominating run during the \"Roaring 20's\" from 1919 to 1925, and then finally  dramatically during [[World War II]] in [[1944 in baseball|1944]], after they had lost their home field [[Oriole Park]] (built 1915)  on Greenmount Avenue in a disastrous mid-season fire.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Baseball in Baltimore|last=Flynn|first=Tom|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2008|isbn=9780738553252|location=Maryland|pages=67|quote=|via=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5iTozrMruwC&lpg=PP1&dq=baseball%20in%20baltimore&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=baseball%20in%20baltimore&f=false}}</ref> Later relocating to 33rd Street Boulevard to [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Municipal Stadium]] (aka Baltimore or Venable or later as Babe Ruth Stadium), -  the 1922 football-only huge bowl for the rest of that '44 season (plus the following decade to 1954 as well), so thanks to that immense stadium, that the [[Junior World Series]]\" easily outdrew that year's major league [[1944 World Series|World Series]] which, coincidentally, included the same team of the [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] of the AL (versus cross-town rivals [[St. Louis Cardinals]] from the NL) that would move to Baltimore 10 years later and take up occupancy in the rebuilt  1949-1954 version of that big stadium bowl in former Venable Park on 33rd Street.\n\nFor the [[2014 Baltimore Orioles season|2014]] season, the Orioles wore a patch on their right sleeve to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the franchise's move to Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web|title=Another Right Sleeve Patch for Baltimore Orioles:60 Years|url=http://www.sportsmedia101.com/baltimoreorioles/2013/10/09/another-right-sleeve-patch-in-2014-for-baltimore-orioles-60-years/}}</ref>\n\n===First years in Baltimore - Memorial Stadium (1954\u20131965)===\nThe new AL Orioles took about six years to become competitive even after jettisoning most of the holdovers from St. Louis.  Under the guidance of [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]], who served as both field manager and [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] from [[1955 Baltimore Orioles season|1955]] to [[1958 Baltimore Orioles season|1958]] (the first man since [[John McGraw]] to hold both positions simultaneously),<ref name=\"A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances\">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065155/index.htm |title=A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> the Orioles began a slow climb to respectability.  While they posted a .500 record only once in their first five years (76-76 in {{Baseball year|1957}}), they were a success at the gate. In their first season, for instance, they drew more than 1.06 million fans &ndash; more than five times what they had ever drawn in their tenures in Milwaukee and St. Louis. This came amid slight turnover in the ownership group. Miles served as team president for two years, then stepped down in favor of developer [[James Keelty]]. In turn, Keelty gave way in {{Baseball year|1960}} to financier [[Joe Iglehart]] who was in the position until 1965 when replaced by major stockholder [[Jerold Hoffberger]], (also president of the [[National Brewing Company]], makers of the city's iconic brand of [[National Bohemian]] Beer).\n\nBy the early 1960s, stars such as [[Brooks Robinson]], [[Boog Powell|John \"Boog\" Powell]], and [[Dave McNally]] were being developed by a strong farm system. The Orioles first made themselves heard in {{Baseball year|1960}}, when they finished 89\u201365, good enough for second in the American League. While they were still eight games behind the Yankees, it was the first time they had been a factor in a pennant race that late in the season since 1944. It was also the first season of a 26-year stretch where the team would have only two losing seasons. Shortstop [[Ron Hansen (baseball)|Ron Hansen]] was named AL [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]], and first-year pitcher [[Chuck Estrada]] tied for the league lead in wins with 18, finishing second to Hansen in the Rookie of the Year balloting.\n\nAfter the [[1965 in baseball|1965 season]], Hoffberger acquired controlling interest in the Orioles from Iglehart and installed himself as president. He had been serving as a silent partner over the past decade despite being the largest shareholder and part of the original syndicate amassed by lawyer [[Clarence Miles]] with Mayor [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.|Thomas J. D'Alesandro, Jr.]] to purchase and bring the Birds to the Chesapeake in 1953-1954. [[Frank Cashen]], advertising chief of Hoffberger's brewery who supervised National's 1960s and 70s iconic widespread famous advertising campaign of singing cartoon characters with a memorable jingle extolling \"The Land of Pleasant Living\" about the joys of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], [[Maryland]] and its queen city of [[Baltimore]] and its [[Culture of Baltimore|distinctive culture]], became Orioles executive vice-president for several decades.\n\nOn December 9, 1965, not long after Hoffberger took over, he engineered a deal which sent pitcher [[Milt Pappas]] (and several others) to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in exchange for slugging outfielder [[Frank Robinson]], who supposedly some baseball experts thought he had seen better days of his career in the N.L. Continuing his winning ways in the 1966 first championship season, Robinson won the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] (leading the American League in [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], [[home runs]], and [[runs batted in]]) and received the American League [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] Award, becoming the first (and so far only) player to win the MVP Award in each league (he had been named NL MVP in 1961, leading the Reds to the pennant). The Orioles would win their first-ever American League championship in that unforgetable fabulous magical memorable [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|1966 season]] and, in a major upset, swept the [[1966 World Series|World Series]] by out-dueling the N.L. [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitching aces [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Don Drysdale]].  Pappas, meanwhile, went 30\u201329 in a little over two years with the Reds before being traded. Although he would go on to have back-to-back 17-win seasons for the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 1971 and 1972, including a [[no-hitter]] in the latter season, this did not help the Reds, who ended up losing the [[1970 World Series]] to Robinson and the Orioles. This Cincinnati to Baltimore trade has become renowned as one of the most lopsided in baseball history, including a mention by [[Susan Sarandon]] in her opening soliloquy in the famous 1988 sports film ''[[Bull Durham]]'': \"Bad trades are a part of baseball. I mean, who can forget Frank Robinson for Milt Pappas?\"\n\n===Glory years (1966\u20131983)===\nThe Orioles farm system had begun to produce a number of high-quality players and coaches who formed the core of winning teams; from 1966 to [[1983 in baseball|1983]], the Orioles won three World Series titles ([[1966 World Series|1966]], [[1970 World Series|1970]], and [[1983 World Series|1983]]), six American League pennants ([[1966 in baseball|1966]], [[1969 in baseball|1969]], [[1970 in baseball|1970]], [[1971 in baseball|1971]], [[1979 in baseball|1979]], and [[1983 in baseball|1983]]), and five of the first six [[American League East]] titles. They played baseball the '''''Oriole Way''''', an organizational ethic best described by longtime farm hand and coach [[Cal Ripken, Sr.]]'s phrase ''\"'''perfect''' practice makes perfect!\"'' The Oriole Way was a belief that hard work, professionalism, and a strong understanding of fundamentals were the keys to success at the major league level. It was based on the belief that if every coach, at every level, taught the game the same way, the organization could produce \"replacement parts\" that could be substituted seamlessly into the big league club with little or no adjustment. This led to a run of success from 1966 to 1983 which saw the Orioles become the envy of the league, and the winningest team in baseball.\n\nDuring this stretch, three different Orioles were named [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] ([[Frank Robinson]] in 1966, [[Boog Powell]] in 1970, and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] in 1983), four Oriole pitchers combined for six [[Cy Young Award]]s ([[Mike Cuellar]] in 1969, [[Jim Palmer]] in 1973, 1975, and 1976, [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] in 1979, and [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] in 1980), and three players were named [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] ([[Al Bumbry]] in 1973, [[Eddie Murray]] in 1977, and Cal Ripken, Jr. in 1982).\n\nIt was also during this time that the Orioles severed their last remaining financial link to their era in St. Louis.  In 1979, Hoffberger sold the Orioles to his longtime friend, Washington attorney [[Edward Bennett Williams]].  As part of the deal, Williams bought the publicly traded shares Donald Barnes had issued in 1936 while the team was still in St. Louis, making the franchise privately held once again and severing one of the few remaining links with the Orioles' past in St. Louis.\n\nDuring this rise to prominence, '''''Weaver Ball''''' came into vogue. Named for fiery manager [[Earl Weaver]], it was defined by the Oriole trifecta of ''\"Pitching, Defense, and the Three-Run Home Run.\"'' When an Oriole GM was told by a reporter that Earl Weaver, as the skipper of a very talented team, was a \"push-button manager\", he replied, ''\"Earl built the machine and installed all the buttons!\"''\n\nAs Frank and Brooks Robinson grew older, newer stars emerged, including multiple [[Cy Young Award]] winner [[Jim Palmer]] and switch-hitting first baseman [[Eddie Murray]]. With the decline and eventual departure of two other professional sports teams in the area, the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Baltimore Colts]] and baseball's [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]], the Orioles' excellence paid off at the gate, as the team cultivated a large and rabid fan base at old [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]].\n\n===Collapse and redemption (1984\u20131991)===\nAfter winning the World Series in [[1983 in baseball|1983]], the Orioles organization began to decline. In [[1986 in baseball|1986]] the team suffered its first losing season since 1967. The [[1988 in baseball|1988]] season started unceremoniously when the Orioles lost their first 21 contests, and ended the year at 54-107, the worst record for the franchise since 1939. The horrendous season resulted in the dismissal of manager [[Cal Ripken, Sr.]] and his replacement by former Oriole great [[Frank Robinson]].\n\nThe next year, the O's sported a new look, replacing the cartoonish bird with a more realistic one. The [[1989 in baseball|1989]] squad, led by surprise ace [[Jeff Ballard (pitcher)|Jeff Ballard]], rebounded to finish in second place behind the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] with an 87\u201375 record, staying in contention until the last week of the season and earning the nickname of the \"Why Not?\" Orioles. Frank Robinson earned the 1989 American League [[Manager of the Year Award]] for his efforts in leading the team out of the abyss. [[1991 in baseball|Two years later]], [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] won American League MVP honors in the team's final season at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]]. He was also named MVP of the [[1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1991 All-Star Game]], played in [[Toronto]]'s [[SkyDome]].\n\n===Oriole Park at Camden Yards and Ripken's record (1992\u20131995)===\nIn [[1992 in baseball|1992]], with grand ceremony, the Orioles began their season in a brand new ballpark, [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]]. The name of the new park though did have much controversy in it. Many felt that since the Orioles' new home was so close to [[Babe Ruth]]'s birthplace that the new park should have been named after Ruth instead of being indirectly named after the [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Earl of Camden, Charles Pratt]], who was a Britisher who never set foot on American soil. There was also the superficial connection to the fact that Ruth played for the Orioles early in his career, but the Orioles team that Ruth played for was in no way related to the Orioles team that moved to Baltimore from St. Louis.\n\nIn [[1993 in baseball|1993]], [[Peter Angelos]] bought the Baltimore Orioles, which returned the team to local ownership. However, Angelos' ownership resulted in a number of controversies. The Orioles also hosted the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star Game]].\n\nOn September 6, 1995, in a game between the Orioles and the [[California Angels]] at Camden Yards, [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] finally broke [[Lou Gehrig]]'s consecutive games streak of 2,130 games. This was later voted the all-time baseball moment of the 20th century by fans from around the country in [[1999 in baseball|1999]]. Ripken's streak would finally end at 2,632 straight games, finally sitting on September 20, 1998.\n\n===Return to the playoffs (1996\u201397)===\nIn [[1996 in baseball|1996]], team owner Peter Angelos hired [[Pat Gillick]] away from the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] to be the Orioles' general manager. Gillick brought in several players like catcher [[B. J. Surhoff]], relief pitcher [[Randy Myers]], and second baseman [[Roberto Alomar]]. Under Gillick and manager [[Davey Johnson]], the Orioles finally returned to postseason play by winning the American League's wild card spot in the [[1996 in baseball|1996]] season. The team set a major league record for home runs in a single season, with 257, and upset the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the Division Series before falling to the [[New York Yankees]] in a controversial [[1996 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] (a fan, [[Jeffrey Maier]], interfered with a fly ball hit by [[Derek Jeter]] in Game 1; the play was ruled a home run and the Yankees eventually won the game). The Orioles followed up by winning the [[American League East|AL East Division]] title in [[1997 in baseball|1997]], going \"wire-to-wire\" (being in first place from the first day of the season to the last). After eliminating the [[Seattle Mariners]] in four games in the opening round, the team lost again in the [[1997 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], this time to the underdog Indians, in which each Oriole loss was by 1 run. After the Orioles failed to advance to the World Series in either playoff, Johnson resigned as manager following a dispute with Angelos, with pitching coach [[Ray Miller (baseball manager)|Ray Miller]] taking his place.\n\n===Downturn (1998\u20132004)===\nWith Miller at the helm, the Orioles found themselves not only out of the playoffs, but also with a losing season. When Gillick's contract expired in [[1998 in baseball|1998]], it was not renewed, and Angelos brought in [[Frank Wren]] to take over as GM. The Orioles added volatile slugger [[Albert Belle]], but the team's woes continued in the [[1999 in baseball|1999]] season, with stars like [[Rafael Palmeiro]], [[Roberto Alomar]] (who joined his brother [[Sandy Alomar, Jr.|Sandy Jr.]] in Cleveland), and [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] leaving via free agency. After a second straight losing season, Angelos fired both Miller and Wren. He named [[Syd Thrift]] the new GM and brought in former Cleveland manager [[Mike Hargrove]] to lead the team. In [[1998 in baseball|1998]], the Orioles updated the Bird in their logo, and then once again in 1999 to bring it to its present form.\n\nThe first decade of the 21st century saw the Orioles struggle due to the combination of lackluster play on the team's part, a string of ineffective management, and the ascent of the Yankees and Red Sox to the top of the game &ndash; each rival having a clear advantage in financial flexibility due to their larger media market size. Further complicating the situation for the Orioles was the relocation of the [[National League]]'s [[Montreal Expos]] franchise to nearby Washington, D.C. in 2004. Orioles owner Peter Angelos demanded compensation from [[Major League Baseball]], as the new [[Washington Nationals]] threatened to carve into the Orioles fan base and television dollars. However, there was some hope that having competition in the larger Baltimore-Washington metro market would spur the Orioles to field a better product to compete for fans with the Nationals.\n\nBeginning with the [[2003 in baseball|2003]] season, big changes began to sweep through the organization to try to snap the losing ways. General manager Syd Thrift was fired and to replace him, the Orioles hired [[Jim Beattie (baseball)|Jim Beattie]] as the '''Executive Vice President''' and [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] as the '''Vice President of Baseball Operations''''. After another losing season, manager [[Mike Hargrove]] was not retained and Yankees coach [[Lee Mazzilli]] was brought in as the new manager. The team signed powerful hitters in shortstop [[Miguel Tejada]], catcher [[Javy L\u00f3pez]], and former Oriole firstbaseman [[Rafael Palmeiro]]. The following season, the Orioles traded for outfielder [[Sammy Sosa]].\n\n===2005 season===\n\nThe [[2005 in baseball|2005]] season may go down as one of the most controversial in the Orioles' history. The Orioles began the season with a tremendous start, holding onto first place in the AL East division for 62 straight days. However, turmoil on and off the field began to take its toll as the team started struggling around the All-Star break, dropping them close to the surging Yankees and Red Sox. Injuries to [[Luis Matos]], [[Javy L\u00f3pez]], [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]], [[Sammy Sosa]], and [[Larry Bigbie]] came within weeks of each other. The team was increasingly dissatisfied with the front office's and manager Lee Mazzilli's \"band-aid\" moves to help the team through this period of struggle. Various minor league players such as Single-A Frederick outfielder [[Jeff Fiorentino]] were brought up in place of more experienced players such as [[David Newhan]], who batted .311 the previous season.\n\nOn July 15, 2005, [[Rafael Palmeiro]] collected his 3,000th hit in Seattle; but 15 days later he was suspended for a violation of [[Major League Baseball drug policy|MLB's drug policy]], after testing positive for the anabolic steroid [[stanozolol]]. The Orioles continued tumbling, falling out of first place and further down the AL East standings. This downfall cost [[Lee Mazzilli]] his managerial job in early August, allowing bench coach and 2003 managerial candidate [[Sam Perlozzo]] to take over as interim manager and lead the team to a 23-32 finish. The Orioles called up [[Dave Cash (baseball)|Dave Cash]] from the [[Ottawa Lynx]] to serve as the team's first base coach.\n\nThe Orioles' 32-60 second half record is, from a percentage standpoint, the worst in baseball history after playing .600 ball for the first 70 days {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. The club's major offseason acquisition, [[Sammy Sosa]], posted his worst performance in a decade, with 14 home runs and a .221 batting average. The Orioles did not attempt to re-sign him, considering his exorbitant salary, his miserable performance, and his stormy relationship with batting coach [[Terry Crowley]] and teammates including [[Miguel Tejada]]. The Orioles also allowed Rafael Palmeiro to file for free agency and publicly stated they would not re-sign him. On August 25, pitcher [[Sidney Ponson]] was arrested for [[DUI]] and on September 1 the Orioles moved to void his contract (on a morals clause) and release him. The [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] filed a grievance on Ponson's behalf and the case was sent to arbitration. The case was finally resolved in late 2008 with Ponson winning at the arbitration hearings.\n\n===2005\u201306 offseason===\n\n==== Front office changes ====\nFollowing the disappointing 2005 season, it was clear major changes needed to be made within the Orioles. In the front office, Executive VP [[Jim Beattie (baseball)|Jim Beattie]] was not re-signed, allowing [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] to become the sole GM of the Orioles. Shortly after, [[Jim Duquette]] was hired as Vice President of Baseball Operations, which was Flanagan's previous position. Duquette made it clear at his signing that he reported to Flanagan, so the \"two-headed GM\" will not exist anymore. The Orioles also fired assistant General Manager [[Ed Kenney]] and asked for the resignation of [[Dave Ritterpusch]], Director of Baseball [[Information Systems]].\n\n==== Coaching staff changes ====\nThere were also drastic changes in the Orioles coaching staff. Perlozzo was named the new manager, and unlike Mazzilli, was given full freedom to name his coaching staff. Perlozzo led off strong by convincing Atlanta pitching coach [[Leo Mazzone]], who had revolutionized the careers of many pitchers in Atlanta, to become the pitching coach for the Orioles. He retained hitting coach [[Terry Crowley]] and first base coach [[Dave Cash (baseball)|Dave Cash]]. Former base coach and [[1983 World Series]] [[World Series MVP Award|MVP]] [[Rick Dempsey]] replaced the late [[Elrod Hendricks]] as the bullpen coach, with [[Tom Trebelhorn]] resuming third base coach. Perlozzo rounded out his staff with former Cubs and Phillies manager [[Lee Elia]] as the bench coach.\n\n==== Roster changes ====\nThe roster changes of 2005 were prefaced with [[Peter Angelos|Peter Angelos']] comments: ''\"We are coming back strong next year. I know you have heard that tune before, but this time it will literally come true.\"'' The Orioles allowed [[Rafael Palmeiro]], [[Sammy Sosa]], and [[B. J. Surhoff]] to become free agents. They also set their wishlist: An everyday first baseman, an experienced starter, a closer, a defensive catcher, outfield help, more defense, and more speed. However, their offseason moves showed no differences from past years. The Orioles were not able to re-sign closer [[B. J. Ryan]], who signed a landmark deal with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. They were also locked out in bids to sign first baseman [[Paul Konerko]], outfielder [[Johnny Damon]], and starter [[Paul Byrd]]. The Orioles were rumoured to have a deal with outfielder [[Jeromy Burnitz]], but his agent balked, supposedly at language regarding the physical, which was deemed by legal experts to be rather standard, and Burnitz signed with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. The Orioles chose not to enter the bidding for players like [[A. J. Burnett]] and [[Kevin Millwood]], whose asking prices were far beyond what the Orioles were willing to pay. The only target the Orioles managed to sign was catcher [[Ram\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez]].\n\nLocked out of pursuits to sign top-tier players, the Orioles decided to make several moves to allow minor league prospects more time to develop. This led to bringing in players like [[Jeff Conine]] and [[Kevin Millar]], both of whom are known for their positive presence in the clubhouse. The Orioles also made several trades to bring in needed players. They first traded disgruntled reliever [[Steve Kline (left-handed pitcher)|Steve Kline]] for [[LaTroy Hawkins]], then traded for outfielder [[Corey Patterson]], who brought speed and defense to the outfield, and traded former closer [[Jorge Julio]] and [[John Maine]] for experienced starter [[Kris Benson]]. The Orioles also addressed future free agents by extending the contract of outfielder [[Jay Gibbons]] and third baseman [[Melvin Mora]], and recently signed a contract extension with second baseman [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]]. The team's Opening Day roster featured top prospect [[Nick Markakis]], a potential A.L. \"Rookie of the Year\", the best young position player the Orioles' farm system has produced since Brian Roberts. Markakis represented the revival of the Orioles' once proud farm system, which features four players listed in Baseball America's 2006 list of the top 100 prospects in minor league baseball.\n\n==== Miguel Tejada ====\nThe Orioles' lack of movement over the course of the offseason frustrated many, including [[Miguel Tejada]]. This led to him stating, controversially, that he ''\"wanted to play for a winner\"'', and ''\"perhaps a change of scenery is needed.\"'' The Oriole front office began to talk to many teams interested in Tejada as a trade. It was rumored that the [[Boston Red Sox]] offered All-Star outfielder [[Manny Ram\u00edrez]] for Tejada, though no Orioles officials confirmed this. There were also talks of [[Mark Prior]] being offered for Tejada. After several weeks, teammate [[Melvin Mora]] facilitated a conference call between the Orioles and Tejada where Tejada backed down and said his comments were intended to provoke the Orioles to make more moves in free agency.\n\nThe Orioles finished the up and down 2006 season with a record of 70\u201392, 27 games behind the AL East leading Yankees.\n\n=== 2007\u20132011: Rebuilding years ===\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2015}}\nA new President of Baseball of Operations named [[Andy MacPhail]] was brought in about halfway through the 2007 season.  MacPhail had had success as general manager of the [[Minnesota Twins]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and had been the CEO of the [[Chicago Cubs]] from 1994\u20132006.  MacPhail spent the remainder of the 2007 season assessing the talent level of the Orioles, and determined that significant steps needed to be made if the Orioles were ever to be a contender again in the American League East.  He completed two blockbuster trades during the next off-season, each sending a premium player away in return for five prospects or (or younger less expensive players).  Tejada, who had hit .296 with 18 HR and 81 RBI in 2007, went to the Houston Astros in exchange for outfielder [[Luke Scott]], pitchers [[Matt Albers]], [[Troy Patton]], and [[Dennis Sarfate]], and third baseman [[Mike Costanzo]].  Also, the newly designated ace of the Orioles rotation [[\u00c9rik B\u00e9dard]], who went 13\u20135 with a 3.16 ERA in 2007 with 221 strikeouts, was sent to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for top outfield prospect [[Adam Jones (baseball)|Adam Jones]], left-handed pitcher [[George Sherrill]], and three minor league pitchers [[Chris Tillman]], [[Kam Mickolio]], and [[Tony Butler (baseball)|Tony Butler]].  The Bedard trade in particular would go down as one of the most lop-sided and successful trades in the history of the franchise.\n\nWhile MacPhail would find success in most of his trades made for the Orioles over the long-term, the veteran stop acquisitions that he would make would not often pan out, and as a result, the team would never finish higher than 4th place in the AL East, or with more than 69 wins, while MacPhail was in charge.  Although some of his free agent signings would have positive contributions (such as reliever [[Koji Uehara]]), most gave mediocre returns, at best.  In particular, the Orioles never managed to cobble together a successful pitching staff during this time.  Their most consistent starting pitcher from 2008\u20132011 was the late bloomer [[Jeremy Guthrie]] who was named the Opening Day starter in 3 of the 4 seasons and had a cumulative 4.12 ERA during this stretch.\n\n==== Buck Showalter ====\n\nFollowing Davey Johnson's dismissal after the 1997 playoff season, Orioles ownership struggled to find a manager that they liked, and this time period was no exception. [[Dave Trembley]] was brought on as an interim manager in June 2007, and had the interim tag removed later that year.  Trembley was at the helm again in 2008 and 2009 but was never able to lead the team out of the cellar in the AL East.  After starting the 2010 season a dismal 15\u201339, Dave Trembley was fired and third base coach [[Juan Samuel]] was named the interim manager.  The Orioles were seeking a more permanent solution at manager as the 2010 season continued to unfold, and two-time AL Manager of the Year [[Buck Showalter]] was eventually hired in July 2010.  The Orioles went 34\u201323 after Buck took over, foreshadowing that a brighter future might be on the horizon, and giving Orioles fans renewed hope and optimism for the team's future.\n\nThe Orioles made some aggressive moves to improve the team in 2011 in the hopes of securing their first playoff berth since 1997.  [[Andy MacPhail]] completed trades to bring in established veterans like [[Mark Reynolds (baseball)|Mark Reynolds]] and [[J. J. Hardy]] from the Diamondbacks and Twins, respectively.  Veteran free agents [[Derrek Lee]] and [[Vladimir Guerrero]] were also brought in to help improve the offense.   At the 2011 trade deadline, fan favorite [[Koji Uehara]] was sent to the Texas Rangers in exchange for [[Chris Davis (baseball)|Chris Davis]] and [[Tommy Hunter (baseball)|Tommy Hunter]], a move that would not pay immediate dividends, but would be crucial to the team's later success.  While these moves had varying impacts, the Orioles did score 95 more runs in 2011 than they had the previous year. The team still finished last in the AL East due to the utter failures of the team's pitching staff.  [[Brian Matusz]] compiled one of the highest single-season ERAs in MLB history (10.69 over 12 starts) and every single pitcher who started a game for the Orioles in 2011 ended the season with an ERA of 4.50 or higher except for [[Jeremy Guthrie]].  The Orioles finished 30th out of 30 MLB teams that year with a 4.89 team ERA. Andy MacPhail's contract was not renewed in October 2011 and a search for a new GM began.  After a public interview process where several candidates declined to take the position, ex-GM [[Dan Duquette]] was brought in to serve as the Executive Vice-President of Baseball Operations.\n\n=== 2012\u20132014 \"Buckle Up, We won't stop.\" ===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2015}}\nDuquette wasted no time in overhauling the Orioles roster, especially the MLB-worst pitching staff.  He traded fan favorite [[Jeremy Guthrie]] to the Colorado Rockies in exchange for [[Jason Hammel]].  He brought in new free agent starting pitcher [[Wei-Yin Chen]] from the Nippon Professional Baseball league, and [[Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez (pitcher)|Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez]] was signed as a minor league free agent.  [[Nate McLouth]] was signed to a minor league deal in June 2012 and would prove to make a significant impact down the stretch.  This year also marked the debut of the much hyped prospect [[Manny Machado]].\n\nThe Orioles won 93 games in 2012 (after winning 69 in the previous year) thanks in large part to a 29\u20139 record in one-run games, and a 16\u20132 record in extra inning games.  The difference between this Orioles bullpen and bullpens past was like night and day, led by [[Jim Johnson (baseball, born 1983)|Jim Johnson]] and his 51 saves.  He finished with a 2.49 ERA that season with [[Darren O'Day]], [[Luis Ayala]], [[Pedro Strop]], and [[Troy Patton]] all finishing as well with ERAs under 3.00.  Experts{{Who|date=April 2015}} were amazed as the team continued to outperform expectations, but regression never came that year.  They battled with the New York Yankees for first place in the AL East up until September, and would earn their first playoff berth in 15 years by winning the second wildcard spot in the American League.\n\nIn the 'sudden death' wildcard game against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Joe Saunders]] (acquired in August of that year in exchange for [[Matt Lindstrom]]) defeated [[Yu Darvish]] to help the Orioles advance to the divisional round, where they faced a familiar opponent, the Yankees. The Orioles forced the series to go five games (losing games 1 and 3 of the series, while winning 2 and 4), but [[CC Sabathia]] outpitched the Orioles [[Jason Hammel]] in Game 5 and the Orioles were eliminated from the playoffs.\n\n=== Last years of playoff contention (2015\u20132016) ===\n{{Main|2015 Baltimore Orioles season}}\nOn April 26, the Orioles scored 18 runs against the [[Boston Red Sox]], the most runs they had scored in a single game, since they defeated the [[Cleveland Indians]] 18\u20139<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/scoreboard/20060419.html|title=Major League Baseball : Scoreboard|work=mlb.com|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}</ref> on April 19, 2006.

They are in the [[American League East|Eastern Division]] of the [[American League]]. They are owned by attorney [[Peter Angelos]].\n\n==Milwaukee Brewers==\n[[Image:MilwaukeeBrewers1889.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The 1889 Milwaukee Brewers]]\n\nThe modern Orioles franchise can trace its roots back to the original Milwaukee Brewers of the [[minor league baseball|minor league level]] of the old  [[Western League (U.S. baseball)|Western League]], beginning in 1894 when the league reorganized. The Brewers of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] were there when the WL under president [[Ban Johnson]] reorganized, upgrading and renamed itself the [[American League]] (\"American League of Base Ball Clubs\")  in 1900, begining play in its following first  season in 1901, competing in several northeastern cities head to head against the elder 25 year old [[National League|National League of Base Ball Clubs]] (\"National League\") playing since 1876.\n\nAt the end of the 1900 season, the new American League removed itself from professional baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the NL and the various nation-wide  minor leagues). At that time, travel by clubs was limited in time constraints on railroads to northeastern American cities which was considered prime \"major league\" territory. Other regions of the nation were deemed \"minors\" and too far away for road trips to far flung ballparks in southern, Midwestern and far west/Pacific areas to be reached in an overnight train trip. No National or American League teams/franchises for the first half of the 20th century were further west than [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] or no further south than [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\nTwo months later, the AL declared itself a competing major league. As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were one of only two Western League teams that didn't either fold or move (the other being the [[Detroit Tigers]]). During the first American League season, they finished dead last with a record of 48\u201389. During its lone Major League season, the team played at [[Lloyd Street Grounds]], between 16th and 18th Streets in Milwaukee.\n\nAs the baseball \"war\" of 1901-1903 heated up, the \"upstart\" American League began to challenge the senior circuit more directly. The American League had already fielded teams in head-to-head direct competition in three northeast cities in [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], and [[Philadelphia]], solid previous National League-only cities. It had planned to move the Brewers to [[St. Louis]], but those plans fizzled.\n\n'''''' Louis Browns==\n{{main article|History of the St. Louis Browns}}\n[[Image:StLouisBrowns.png|left|thumb|100px|St. Louis Browns Logo, circa 1936\u20131951]]\nIn [[1902 in baseball|1902]], however, the original league charter member Milwaukee Brewers team did move southwest to St. Louis, where it became the \"Browns\", in reference to the original name of the legendary 1880s club that by 1902 was renamed and then known as the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] of the National League. In their first St. Louis season by the shores of the [[Mississippi River]], the new Browns finished in second place. Although they usually fielded terrible or mediocre teams throughout their 51 years history from 1902 to 1953 (they had even  only four winning seasons from 1901 (in Milwaukee) to 1922), they were very popular at the gate however and drew fans.\n\nDuring this time, the Browns were best known for their role in [[1910 Chalmers Award|the race]] for the [[1910 Major League Baseball season|1910]] American League batting title. Detroit's [[Ty Cobb]] took the last game of the season off, believing that his slight lead over Cleveland's [[Nap Lajoie]] would hold up unless Lajoie had a near-perfect day at the plate. However, Cobb was one of the most despised players in baseball, and Browns catcher-manager [[Jack O'Connor (catcher)|Jack O'Connor]] ordered rookie third baseman [[Red Corriden]] to station himself in shallow left field. In each of his next five at bats, Lajoie bunted down the third-base line and made it to first easily. In his last at-bat, he reached base on an error &ndash; officially giving him a hitless at-bat. O'Connor and coach Harry Howell tried to bribe the official scorer, a woman, to change the call to a hit, even offering to buy her a new wardrobe. Cobb won the batting title by just a few thousandths of a point over Lajoie (though in 1978 sabermetrician / baseball historian [[Pete Palmer]] discovered that one game may have been counted twice in the statistics). The resulting outcry triggered an investigation by American League president [[Ban Johnson]]. At his insistence, Browns owner [[Robert Hedges (baseball)|Robert Hedges]] fired O'Connor and Howell; both men were informally banned from baseball for life.\n\nIn 1916, after years of prosperity at the gate, Hedges sold the team to cold-storage magnate [[Phil Ball (baseball)|Phil Ball]], who had owned the [[St. Louis Terriers]] of the short-lived now defunct [[Federal League]] (1914-1915), a vain attempt at expanding to a third major league. Ball's 17 years (1916-1933) tenure as owner saw the Browns' first period of prosperity; they were a contender for most of the early 1920s, even finishing second in [[1922 Major League Baseball season|1922]]. He made a considerable effort to make the Browns competitive, reinvesting all profits back into the team development.\n\nBall, however, committed several errors that dogged the franchise for years to come. His first major blunder was to fire [[Branch Rickey]], the then resident genius in the Browns' front office, in 1919 because of a conflict of egos, causing Rickey to jump to the crosstown Cardinals (later famous with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] after 1942). In 1920 [[Sam Breadon]], who had just purchased the Cardinals, convinced Ball to allow his team to share the Browns' home field, [[Sportsman's Park]].  With the money from the sale of the Cardinals' earlier home of [[Robison Field]], Rickey of the \"Cards\" began building an extensive farm system.  This eventually produced a later host of star players that brought the Cardinals far more competitive drawing power in paying fan numbers than the Browns in the American League.\n\nThe 1922 Browns excited their owner by almost beating the developing rising power of the \"Bronx Bombers\" the soon to be fabled [[New York Yankees]] to a pennant. The club was boasting the best players in franchise history, including [[George Sisler]], and an outfield trio &ndash; [[Ken Williams (baseball)|Ken Williams]], [[Baby Doll Jacobson]], and [[Jack Tobin]] &ndash; that batted .300 or better in 1919\u201323 and in 1925. In 1922, Williams became the first player in Major League history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in a season, something that would not be done again in the Majors until 1956.\n\nBall confidently predicted that there would be a [[World Series]] in Sportsman's Park by 1926. In anticipation, he increased the capacity of his ballpark from 18,000 to 30,000. Fulfilling his optimism in a strange way, there was indeed a World Series in Sportsman's Park in [[1926 World Series|1926]] hosting the national championship tournament, but it was the roommates of the Cardinals, not the Browns, who took part, upsetting the Yankees. St. Louis had been considered a \"Browns' town\" until then; after 1926, the Cardinals dominated St. Louis baseball for the next 25 years, while still technically tenants of the Browns-owned stadium. Meanwhile, the Browns rapidly fell into the cellar repeatedly.  They only had two winning records from 1927 to 1943, including a 43\u2013111 mark in [[1939 Major League Baseball season|1939]] that is still the worst in Brewers/Browns/Orioles A.L. franchise history, 1901-2020.\n\nOwner Ball died in 1933.  His estate executors ran the team for three years until Rickey of the Cardinals helped broker a sale to investment banker [[Donald Lee Barnes]], whose son-in-law, [[Bill DeWitt]], became the team's general manager.  To help finance the purchase, Barnes sold 20,000 shares of stock to the public at $5 dollars a share, an unusual practice then for a sports franchise.\n\n===World War II Era===\n\n====1944====\n{{main article|1944 St. Louis Browns season}}\n\nIn [[1944 Major League Baseball season|1944]], during [[World War II]] (1939/1941-1945), the Browns won their only St. Louis-based American League pennant and finally appearing in World Series competition, becoming the last of the 16 teams/franchises that made up the major leagues then from 1901 to 1960 to play in a World Series.  By comparison, each of the other seven American League teams had already appeared in at least three World Series years, and won the crown at least once.  Some critics called it a fluke, as most major league stars voluntarily joined or were drafted into the military; however, many of the Browns' best players were classified 4-F (unfit for the draft / military service). Amazingly, they faced their local rivals, the more successful [[1944 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]], in the [[1944 World Series]], the last World Series to date to be played entirely in only one stadium, and lost 4 games to 2.  After that amazing season, Barnes sold the Browns to businessman [[Richard Muckerman]], who cared more about improving Sportsman's Park facilities than getting better players to play in them.\n\n====Postwar 1945\u201346====\nIn [[1945 Major League Baseball season|1945]], the [[1945 St. Louis Browns season|Browns]] posted an 81\u201375 record and fell to third place, six games out, again with less than top-ranked talent. The 1945 season may be best remembered for the Browns' signing of utility outfielder [[Pete Gray]], the only one-armed major league position player in American sports history.  They tumbled down to seventh place in [[1946 Major League Baseball season|1946]]. They would never again finish with a winning record while still in St. Louis, partly because owner Muckerman was unwilling to improve the on-field product.  Muckerman sold the team to former general manager (1936-xxx),  (and former owner Barnes son-in-law) Bill DeWitt in [[1949 Major League Baseball season|1949]], but now new owner DeWitt was unable to reverse the decades long slide.\n\n===Bill Veeck's Browns===\nIn [[1951 in baseball|1951]], [[Bill Veeck]], the experimental, colorful but controversial former maverick owner of the [[Cleveland Indians]], purchased the Browns. In St. Louis, he extended the promotions and wild antics that had made him famous and loved by many and loathed by many others. His most notorious stunt in St. Louis came on August 19, 1951, when the.mercurial but sly Veeck instructed Browns manager, [[Zack Taylor (baseball)|Zack Taylor]] to send in [[Eddie Gaedel]], a 3-foot 7&nbsp;inch, 65-pound [[midget]], to bat as a pinch hitter.<ref>{{cite news |title=Zack Taylor Dead At 76 |agency=Associated Press |work=The Milwaukee Sentinel |page=5 |date=20 September 1974 |accessdate=4 June 2012 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O29QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=thEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7022,1061064&dq=zack+taylor+catcher&hl=en}}</ref> When Gaedel stepped to the plate he was wearing a Browns uniform with the number \"1/8\" on his back, and little slippers turned up at the end like fairy tale elf's shoes. With hardly no [[strike zone]] to speak of, Gaedel [[walk (baseball)|walked]] on four straight pitches. The stunt infuriated American League President [[Will Harridge]], who immediately voided Gaedel's newly signed baseball contract the next day. In another Veeck stunt, the Browns handed out placards \u2013 reading ''take, swing, bunt'', etc. \u2013 to fans and allowed them to make managerial decisions for a day. Taylor dutifully surveyed the fans' advice and relayed the sign accordingly.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Mike Shatzkin |author2=Stephen Holtje |author3=James Charlton |title=The Ballplayers |publisher=Arbor House/William Morrow |location=New York |year=1990 |page= |isbn=0-87795-984-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ballplayersbaseb00shat }}</ref>\n\nVeeck also brought the legendary, and seemingly ageless, [[Satchel Paige]] back to major league baseball to pitch for the Browns. Veeck had previously signed the former [[Negro League]] great to a contract in Cleveland in [[1948 Major League Baseball season|1948]] (a year after Branch Rickey introduced [[Jackie Robinson]] to the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] of the N.L. integrating previously white-only major leagues), at an \"elderly\" age 42, amid much criticism. At 45, Paige's re-appearance in a Browns' uniform did nothing to win Veeck friends among baseball's owners but did greatly increase the African-American numbers of St. Louis baseball fans to Browns games, swelling the meager crowds in Sportsman's Park. Nonetheless, Paige ended his final season with a respectable 3\u20134 record and a 4.79 ERA.\n\nVeeck believed that St. Louis eventually was too small a sports market for two MLB franchises (by the later 20th century, only 3 cities of [[New York City]], [[Chicago]] and later [[Los Angeles]] would have double league teams, [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], and finally St. Louis all had one of their franchises move), and planned to hopefully be the one to drive the Cardinals out of town since he and the Browns owned the stadium. He signed many of the Cardinals' most locally loved ex-players and, as a result, brought many of their fans in to see the Browns. Veeck signed former Cardinals great [[Dizzy Dean]] to a broadcasting contract and tapped former \"Redbirds\" great [[Rogers Hornsby]] as Brownies  manager. He also re-acquired former Browns fan favorite [[Vern Stephens]] and signed former Cardinals pitcher [[Harry Brecheen]], both of whom had starred in the famed all-St. Louis World Series of 1944. He stripped Sportsman's Park of any Cardinals material and decorations and dressed it up in exclusively Browns memorabilia and colors. He even moved his family to an apartment living under the stands.\n\nVeeck's showmanship and colorful promotions made the fan experience at a Browns game much more fun and unpredictable than that at a Cardinals game. At the same time, the Cardinals were finally feeling the effects of Rickey's departure for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] in [[1942 Major League Baseball season|1942]]. In early 1953, then Cardinals owner [[Fred Saigh]] was indicted for tax evasion, and ultimately pleaded no contest to lesser charges.  Facing almost certain banishment from baseball, Saigh was forced to put the Cardinals up for sale.  For a time, no credible offers surfaced from St. Louis business / civic interests, and it looked as if Veeck's all-out assault on the Cardinals might indeed force them out of town leaving his team with a monopoly.\n\nHowever, Saigh turned down higher offers from out-of-town buyers in favor of a bid from the St. Louis-based [[Anheuser-Busch]] brewery, which stepped in with the specific intent of keeping the Cardinals in St. Louis. Veeck quickly realized that the Cardinals now had more resources than he could possibly hope to match. Reluctantly, he decided to cede St. Louis to the Cardinals and move the Browns elsewhere. The Browns had been candidates for relocation earlier; in 1941, they had come close to moving to Los Angeles, nearly two decades before Major League Baseball eventually arrived in [[California]]. The American League even drew up a schedule including Los Angeles and had a meeting scheduled to vote on the relocation of the Browns.  However, on December 7, the day the vote was scheduled, the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor]].\n\nSoon after Anheuser-Busch closed on its purchase of the Cardinals, Veeck sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals\u2013thus ending a situation where the more popular team in a two-team city was the tenant of the less-popular team. It is very likely Veeck would have had to sell it in any event, as the 44-year-old park had fallen into disrepair. The city was threatening to have it condemned, and Veeck could not afford to make the necessary improvements to bring it up to code even with the rent from the Cardinals.\n\nVeeck attempted to move the Browns back to [[Milwaukee]] (where he had owned the [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Brewers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] in the 1940s) for the [[1953 Major League Baseball season|1953 season]]. However, the other American League owners blocked the move, seemingly for reasons that were more personal than business related. \n\nVeeck then tried to move the Browns to [[Baltimore]].  He got in touch with [[List of mayors of Baltimore, Maryland|Mayor]] [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.|Tommy D'Alesandro]] and attorney [[Clarence Miles]], who were leading an effort to bring the major leagues back to Baltimore after a half-century hiatus.  However, he was rebuffed by the owners, still seething at the publicity stunts he pulled at the Browns home games.\n\nAfter the season, Veeck cut a deal with Miles which would see the Browns move to Baltimore. Under the plan, Veeck would sell half of his 80 percent stake in the Browns to Miles and several other Baltimore investors, with Veeck remaining as principal owner. Despite being assured by American League president [[Will Harridge]] that there would be no problem getting approval, only four owners voted aye &ndash; two short of passage. Reportedly, this was due to Yankees co-owner [[Del Webb]] drumming up support to move the Browns to Los Angeles.\n\nMiles and D'Alesandro realized that the owners were simply looking for a way to push Veeck out. Over the next 48 hours, Miles lined up enough support from his group of investors to buy out Veeck's stake entirely for $2.5 million. The plan called for Baltimore brewer [[Jerold Hoffberger]] to emerge as the largest single shareholder, though Miles became team president.  With his only leverage, ownership of Sportsman's Park, gone and facing threats of having his franchise liquidated, Veeck had little choice but to agree.  Miles' first act was to submit a renewed request to move to Baltimore for the 1954 season. With Veeck \"out of the way,\" this request was swiftly approved.\n\n===Legacy===\nUnlike other clubs that relocated in the 1950s, retaining their nickname and a sense of continuity with their past (such as the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn-Los Angeles Dodgers]]), the Browns were renamed upon their transfer, implicitly severing themselves from their history. In December 1954, the team further distanced itself from its Browns past by making a 17-player trade with the [[New York Yankees]] that included most former Browns of note still on the roster. Though the deal did little to improve the short-term competitiveness of the club, it did help establish a fresh identity for the franchise. To this day, it mentions almost nothing about its past in St. Louis.\n\nThere are still societies to keep the memory of the team alive in St. Louis. The club was in St. Louis for 52 years. In 2006, the O's played their 53rd season in Baltimore, meaning they have now played in Baltimore longer than they did in St. Louis.\n\n==Baltimore Orioles==\nSoon after taking over, the Miles-Hoffberger group renamed their new team the '''Baltimore Orioles'''. The name has a rich history in Baltimore, having been used by Baltimore baseball teams since the late 19th century.\n\n===History of the Orioles name===\n\nIn the 1890s, in the [[National League|National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (\"National League\")]], established in [[1876 in baseball|1876]], a powerful, innovative and scrappy  Baltimore Orioles squad included [[Willie Keeler|\"Wee\" Willie Keeler]], [[Wilbert Robinson]], [[Hughie Jennings]] and [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]]. They won three straight unprecedented NL pennants - - [[1894 in baseball|1894]]/[[1895 in baseball|1895]]/[[1896 in baseball|1896]], and participated in all four of the then \"[[Temple Cup]]\" championship series, winning the last two of them. \n\nThat Orioles team had started a decade and a half earlier as a charter member of the old [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in [[1882 in baseball|1882]], a competing rival to the then  7 year older Nationals. Despite its on-field success in either first or second place standings, it was unfortunately sabotaged as one of the four teams that was contracted out of existence by the National League after the [[1899 in baseball|1899]] season which reduced itself from 12 franchises to only 8 teams, a low number which endured for over half a century. Its best players (and its manager, [[Ned Hanlon (baseball)|Ned Hanlon]]) regrouped with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers]], turning that later famous team into a contender.\n\nIn [[1900 in baseball|1900]] and  [[1901 in baseball|1901]], Baltimore and infamous player/manager McGraw were awarded a charter franchise of the original 8 in the  newly reorganized [[American League|American League of Professional Baseball Clubs (\"American League\")]], (out of the old minor level Western League) now claiming major league status under feisty president [[Ban Johnson]], but again the team and city of Baltimore was sacrificed in favor of a New York City franchise - the \"New York Higlanders\", or occasionally known as the \"New York Americans\", as the team was transferred in [[1903 in baseball|1903]] to the nation's biggest city after only playing two seasons of ball of [[1901 in baseball|1901]] & [[1902 in baseball|1902]], as one of the terms negotiated of the \"peace pact\" to end the \"baseball wars\" between the elder [[National League|Nationals]] of 1876 and the fledging upstart [[American League]] of 1901, giving the newcomers a representative franchise in the one American city that was the biggest and most important. Another term of the truce was also with inauguration of a new championship game tournament series to be known as the [[World Series]], also begun in [[1903 World Series|1903]]. \n\nAfter some early struggles, that fledging [[History of the New York Yankees|New York Highlanders]] team eventually became renamed a decade later in [[1913 in baseball|1913]]  and by the 1920s with the help of a young  Baltimorean - [[Babe Ruth|George Herman \"Babe\" Ruth]] and eventually became baseball's most successful franchise &ndash; the [[New York Yankees]], the former legendary 19th century \"Baltimore Orioles\".\n\nAs a member of the high-minor league level in the  [[International League]] (with Canadian and Cuban teams competing against Americans), [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|these IL Orioles]] competed at what is now known as the \"Triple A\"  (\"AAA\")  [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] level from 1903 to 1953. Baltimore's own [[Babe Ruth]] pitched briefly for owner/manager [[Jack Dunn (baseball)|Jack Dunn's]] Orioles for part of one season after signing the 19 year old wild rough youth out of [[St. Mary's Industrial School]] on Wilkens and Caton Avenues, just on the southwest edge of the city before being forced to further sell him to the AL [[Boston Red Sox]] in [[1914 in baseball|1914]] because of the new third major league competition by the [[Baltimore Terrapins]] of the upstart [[Federal League]] for two seasons. \n\nThese Orioles of the old IL were among the best baseball teams in America offerng frequent competition to passing AL and NL teams in exhibitions. These \"Birds\"  won nine league championships, first in [[1908 in baseball|1908]] followed by a lengthy dominating run during the \"Roaring 20's\" from 1919 to 1925, and then finally  dramatically during [[World War II]] in [[1944 in baseball|1944]], after they had lost their home field [[Oriole Park]] (built 1915)  on Greenmount Avenue in a disastrous mid-season fire.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Baseball in Baltimore|last=Flynn|first=Tom|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2008|isbn=9780738553252|location=Maryland|pages=67|quote=|via=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5iTozrMruwC&lpg=PP1&dq=baseball%20in%20baltimore&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=baseball%20in%20baltimore&f=false}}</ref> Later relocating to 33rd Street Boulevard to [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Municipal Stadium]] (aka Baltimore or Venable or later as Babe Ruth Stadium), -  the 1922 football-only huge bowl for the rest of that '44 season (plus the following decade to 1954 as well), so thanks to that immense stadium, that the [[Junior World Series]]\" easily outdrew that year's major league [[1944 World Series|World Series]] which, coincidentally, included the same team of the [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] of the AL (versus cross-town rivals [[St. Louis Cardinals]] from the NL) that would move to Baltimore 10 years later and take up occupancy in the rebuilt  1949-1954 version of that big stadium bowl in former Venable Park on 33rd Street.\n\nFor the [[2014 Baltimore Orioles season|2014]] season, the Orioles wore a patch on their right sleeve to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the franchise's move to Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web|title=Another Right Sleeve Patch for Baltimore Orioles:60 Years|url=http://www.sportsmedia101.com/baltimoreorioles/2013/10/09/another-right-sleeve-patch-in-2014-for-baltimore-orioles-60-years/}}</ref>\n\n===First years in Baltimore - Memorial Stadium (1954\u20131965)===\nThe new AL Orioles took about six years to become competitive even after jettisoning most of the holdovers from St. Louis.  Under the guidance of [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]], who served as both field manager and [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] from [[1955 Baltimore Orioles season|1955]] to [[1958 Baltimore Orioles season|1958]] (the first man since [[John McGraw]] to hold both positions simultaneously),<ref name=\"A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances\">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065155/index.htm |title=A Fond Farewell To A Baseball Man Who Wasn't Afraid To Take Chances |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> the Orioles began a slow climb to respectability.  While they posted a .500 record only once in their first five years (76-76 in {{Baseball year|1957}}), they were a success at the gate. In their first season, for instance, they drew more than 1.06 million fans &ndash; more than five times what they had ever drawn in their tenures in Milwaukee and St. Louis. This came amid slight turnover in the ownership group. Miles served as team president for two years, then stepped down in favor of developer [[James Keelty]]. In turn, Keelty gave way in {{Baseball year|1960}} to financier [[Joe Iglehart]] who was in the position until 1965 when replaced by major stockholder [[Jerold Hoffberger]], (also president of the [[National Brewing Company]], makers of the city's iconic brand of [[National Bohemian]] Beer).\n\nBy the early 1960s, stars such as [[Brooks Robinson]], [[Boog Powell|John \"Boog\" Powell]], and [[Dave McNally]] were being developed by a strong farm system. The Orioles first made themselves heard in {{Baseball year|1960}}, when they finished 89\u201365, good enough for second in the American League. While they were still eight games behind the Yankees, it was the first time they had been a factor in a pennant race that late in the season since 1944. It was also the first season of a 26-year stretch where the team would have only two losing seasons. Shortstop [[Ron Hansen (baseball)|Ron Hansen]] was named AL [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]], and first-year pitcher [[Chuck Estrada]] tied for the league lead in wins with 18, finishing second to Hansen in the Rookie of the Year balloting.\n\nAfter the [[1965 in baseball|1965 season]], Hoffberger acquired controlling interest in the Orioles from Iglehart and installed himself as president. He had been serving as a silent partner over the past decade despite being the largest shareholder and part of the original syndicate amassed by lawyer [[Clarence Miles]] with Mayor [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.|Thomas J. D'Alesandro, Jr.]] to purchase and bring the Birds to the Chesapeake in 1953-1954. [[Frank Cashen]], advertising chief of Hoffberger's brewery who supervised National's 1960s and 70s iconic widespread famous advertising campaign of singing cartoon characters with a memorable jingle extolling \"The Land of Pleasant Living\" about the joys of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], [[Maryland]] and its queen city of [[Baltimore]] and its [[Culture of Baltimore|distinctive culture]], became Orioles executive vice-president for several decades.\n\nOn December 9, 1965, not long after Hoffberger took over, he engineered a deal which sent pitcher [[Milt Pappas]] (and several others) to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in exchange for slugging outfielder [[Frank Robinson]], who supposedly some baseball experts thought he had seen better days of his career in the N.L. Continuing his winning ways in the 1966 first championship season, Robinson won the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] (leading the American League in [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], [[home runs]], and [[runs batted in]]) and received the American League [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] Award, becoming the first (and so far only) player to win the MVP Award in each league (he had been named NL MVP in 1961, leading the Reds to the pennant). The Orioles would win their first-ever American League championship in that unforgetable fabulous magical memorable [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|1966 season]] and, in a major upset, swept the [[1966 World Series|World Series]] by out-dueling the N.L. [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitching aces [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Don Drysdale]].  Pappas, meanwhile, went 30\u201329 in a little over two years with the Reds before being traded. Although he would go on to have back-to-back 17-win seasons for the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 1971 and 1972, including a [[no-hitter]] in the latter season, this did not help the Reds, who ended up losing the [[1970 World Series]] to Robinson and the Orioles. This Cincinnati to Baltimore trade has become renowned as one of the most lopsided in baseball history, including a mention by [[Susan Sarandon]] in her opening soliloquy in the famous 1988 sports film ''[[Bull Durham]]'': \"Bad trades are a part of baseball. I mean, who can forget Frank Robinson for Milt Pappas?\"\n\n===Glory years (1966\u20131983)===\nThe Orioles farm system had begun to produce a number of high-quality players and coaches who formed the core of winning teams; from 1966 to [[1983 in baseball|1983]], the Orioles won three World Series titles ([[1966 World Series|1966]], [[1970 World Series|1970]], and [[1983 World Series|1983]]), six American League pennants ([[1966 in baseball|1966]], [[1969 in baseball|1969]], [[1970 in baseball|1970]], [[1971 in baseball|1971]], [[1979 in baseball|1979]], and [[1983 in baseball|1983]]), and five of the first six [[American League East]] titles. They played baseball the '''''Oriole Way''''', an organizational ethic best described by longtime farm hand and coach [[Cal Ripken, Sr.]]'s phrase ''\"'''perfect''' practice makes perfect!\"'' The Oriole Way was a belief that hard work, professionalism, and a strong understanding of fundamentals were the keys to success at the major league level. It was based on the belief that if every coach, at every level, taught the game the same way, the organization could produce \"replacement parts\" that could be substituted seamlessly into the big league club with little or no adjustment. This led to a run of success from 1966 to 1983 which saw the Orioles become the envy of the league, and the winningest team in baseball.\n\nDuring this stretch, three different Orioles were named [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] ([[Frank Robinson]] in 1966, [[Boog Powell]] in 1970, and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] in 1983), four Oriole pitchers combined for six [[Cy Young Award]]s ([[Mike Cuellar]] in 1969, [[Jim Palmer]] in 1973, 1975, and 1976, [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] in 1979, and [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] in 1980), and three players were named [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] ([[Al Bumbry]] in 1973, [[Eddie Murray]] in 1977, and Cal Ripken, Jr. in 1982).\n\nIt was also during this time that the Orioles severed their last remaining financial link to their era in St. Louis.  In 1979, Hoffberger sold the Orioles to his longtime friend, Washington attorney [[Edward Bennett Williams]].  As part of the deal, Williams bought the publicly traded shares Donald Barnes had issued in 1936 while the team was still in St. Louis, making the franchise privately held once again and severing one of the few remaining links with the Orioles' past in St. Louis.\n\nDuring this rise to prominence, '''''Weaver Ball''''' came into vogue. Named for fiery manager [[Earl Weaver]], it was defined by the Oriole trifecta of ''\"Pitching, Defense, and the Three-Run Home Run.\"'' When an Oriole GM was told by a reporter that Earl Weaver, as the skipper of a very talented team, was a \"push-button manager\", he replied, ''\"Earl built the machine and installed all the buttons!\"''\n\nAs Frank and Brooks Robinson grew older, newer stars emerged, including multiple [[Cy Young Award]] winner [[Jim Palmer]] and switch-hitting first baseman [[Eddie Murray]]. With the decline and eventual departure of two other professional sports teams in the area, the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Baltimore Colts]] and baseball's [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]], the Orioles' excellence paid off at the gate, as the team cultivated a large and rabid fan base at old [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]].\n\n===Collapse and redemption (1984\u20131991)===\nAfter winning the World Series in [[1983 in baseball|1983]], the Orioles organization began to decline. In [[1986 in baseball|1986]] the team suffered its first losing season since 1967. The [[1988 in baseball|1988]] season started unceremoniously when the Orioles lost their first 21 contests, and ended the year at 54-107, the worst record for the franchise since 1939. The horrendous season resulted in the dismissal of manager [[Cal Ripken, Sr.]] and his replacement by former Oriole great [[Frank Robinson]].\n\nThe next year, the O's sported a new look, replacing the cartoonish bird with a more realistic one. The [[1989 in baseball|1989]] squad, led by surprise ace [[Jeff Ballard (pitcher)|Jeff Ballard]], rebounded to finish in second place behind the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] with an 87\u201375 record, staying in contention until the last week of the season and earning the nickname of the \"Why Not?\" Orioles. Frank Robinson earned the 1989 American League [[Manager of the Year Award]] for his efforts in leading the team out of the abyss. [[1991 in baseball|Two years later]], [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] won American League MVP honors in the team's final season at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]]. He was also named MVP of the [[1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1991 All-Star Game]], played in [[Toronto]]'s [[SkyDome]].\n\n===Oriole Park at Camden Yards and Ripken's record (1992\u20131995)===\nIn [[1992 in baseball|1992]], with grand ceremony, the Orioles began their season in a brand new ballpark, [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]]. The name of the new park though did have much controversy in it. Many felt that since the Orioles' new home was so close to [[Babe Ruth]]'s birthplace that the new park should have been named after Ruth instead of being indirectly named after the [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Earl of Camden, Charles Pratt]], who was a Britisher who never set foot on American soil. There was also the superficial connection to the fact that Ruth played for the Orioles early in his career, but the Orioles team that Ruth played for was in no way related to the Orioles team that moved to Baltimore from St. Louis.\n\nIn [[1993 in baseball|1993]], [[Peter Angelos]] bought the Baltimore Orioles, which returned the team to local ownership. However, Angelos' ownership resulted in a number of controversies. The Orioles also hosted the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star Game]].\n\nOn September 6, 1995, in a game between the Orioles and the [[California Angels]] at Camden Yards, [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] finally broke [[Lou Gehrig]]'s consecutive games streak of 2,130 games. This was later voted the all-time baseball moment of the 20th century by fans from around the country in [[1999 in baseball|1999]]. Ripken's streak would finally end at 2,632 straight games, finally sitting on September 20, 1998.\n\n===Return to the playoffs (1996\u201397)===\nIn [[1996 in baseball|1996]], team owner Peter Angelos hired [[Pat Gillick]] away from the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] to be the Orioles' general manager. Gillick brought in several players like catcher [[B. J. Surhoff]], relief pitcher [[Randy Myers]], and second baseman [[Roberto Alomar]]. Under Gillick and manager [[Davey Johnson]], the Orioles finally returned to postseason play by winning the American League's wild card spot in the [[1996 in baseball|1996]] season. The team set a major league record for home runs in a single season, with 257, and upset the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the Division Series before falling to the [[New York Yankees]] in a controversial [[1996 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] (a fan, [[Jeffrey Maier]], interfered with a fly ball hit by [[Derek Jeter]] in Game 1; the play was ruled a home run and the Yankees eventually won the game). The Orioles followed up by winning the [[American League East|AL East Division]] title in [[1997 in baseball|1997]], going \"wire-to-wire\" (being in first place from the first day of the season to the last). After eliminating the [[Seattle Mariners]] in four games in the opening round, the team lost again in the [[1997 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], this time to the underdog Indians, in which each Oriole loss was by 1 run. After the Orioles failed to advance to the World Series in either playoff, Johnson resigned as manager following a dispute with Angelos, with pitching coach [[Ray Miller (baseball manager)|Ray Miller]] taking his place.\n\n===Downturn (1998\u20132004)===\nWith Miller at the helm, the Orioles found themselves not only out of the playoffs, but also with a losing season. When Gillick's contract expired in [[1998 in baseball|1998]], it was not renewed, and Angelos brought in [[Frank Wren]] to take over as GM. The Orioles added volatile slugger [[Albert Belle]], but the team's woes continued in the [[1999 in baseball|1999]] season, with stars like [[Rafael Palmeiro]], [[Roberto Alomar]] (who joined his brother [[Sandy Alomar, Jr.|Sandy Jr.]] in Cleveland), and [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] leaving via free agency. After a second straight losing season, Angelos fired both Miller and Wren. He named [[Syd Thrift]] the new GM and brought in former Cleveland manager [[Mike Hargrove]] to lead the team. In [[1998 in baseball|1998]], the Orioles updated the Bird in their logo, and then once again in 1999 to bring it to its present form.\n\nThe first decade of the 21st century saw the Orioles struggle due to the combination of lackluster play on the team's part, a string of ineffective management, and the ascent of the Yankees and Red Sox to the top of the game &ndash; each rival having a clear advantage in financial flexibility due to their larger media market size. Further complicating the situation for the Orioles was the relocation of the [[National League]]'s [[Montreal Expos]] franchise to nearby Washington, D.C. in 2004. Orioles owner Peter Angelos demanded compensation from [[Major League Baseball]], as the new [[Washington Nationals]] threatened to carve into the Orioles fan base and television dollars. However, there was some hope that having competition in the larger Baltimore-Washington metro market would spur the Orioles to field a better product to compete for fans with the Nationals.\n\nBeginning with the [[2003 in baseball|2003]] season, big changes began to sweep through the organization to try to snap the losing ways. General manager Syd Thrift was fired and to replace him, the Orioles hired [[Jim Beattie (baseball)|Jim Beattie]] as the '''Executive Vice President''' and [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] as the '''Vice President of Baseball Operations''''. After another losing season, manager [[Mike Hargrove]] was not retained and Yankees coach [[Lee Mazzilli]] was brought in as the new manager. The team signed powerful hitters in shortstop [[Miguel Tejada]], catcher [[Javy L\u00f3pez]], and former Oriole firstbaseman [[Rafael Palmeiro]]. The following season, the Orioles traded for outfielder [[Sammy Sosa]].\n\n===2005 season===\n\nThe [[2005 in baseball|2005]] season may go down as one of the most controversial in the Orioles' history. The Orioles began the season with a tremendous start, holding onto first place in the AL East division for 62 straight days. However, turmoil on and off the field began to take its toll as the team started struggling around the All-Star break, dropping them close to the surging Yankees and Red Sox. Injuries to [[Luis Matos]], [[Javy L\u00f3pez]], [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]], [[Sammy Sosa]], and [[Larry Bigbie]] came within weeks of each other. The team was increasingly dissatisfied with the front office's and manager Lee Mazzilli's \"band-aid\" moves to help the team through this period of struggle. Various minor league players such as Single-A Frederick outfielder [[Jeff Fiorentino]] were brought up in place of more experienced players such as [[David Newhan]], who batted .311 the previous season.\n\nOn July 15, 2005, [[Rafael Palmeiro]] collected his 3,000th hit in Seattle; but 15 days later he was suspended for a violation of [[Major League Baseball drug policy|MLB's drug policy]], after testing positive for the anabolic steroid [[stanozolol]]. The Orioles continued tumbling, falling out of first place and further down the AL East standings. This downfall cost [[Lee Mazzilli]] his managerial job in early August, allowing bench coach and 2003 managerial candidate [[Sam Perlozzo]] to take over as interim manager and lead the team to a 23-32 finish. The Orioles called up [[Dave Cash (baseball)|Dave Cash]] from the [[Ottawa Lynx]] to serve as the team's first base coach.\n\nThe Orioles' 32-60 second half record is, from a percentage standpoint, the worst in baseball history after playing .600 ball for the first 70 days {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. The club's major offseason acquisition, [[Sammy Sosa]], posted his worst performance in a decade, with 14 home runs and a .221 batting average. The Orioles did not attempt to re-sign him, considering his exorbitant salary, his miserable performance, and his stormy relationship with batting coach [[Terry Crowley]] and teammates including [[Miguel Tejada]]. The Orioles also allowed Rafael Palmeiro to file for free agency and publicly stated they would not re-sign him. On August 25, pitcher [[Sidney Ponson]] was arrested for [[DUI]] and on September 1 the Orioles moved to void his contract (on a morals clause) and release him. The [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] filed a grievance on Ponson's behalf and the case was sent to arbitration. The case was finally resolved in late 2008 with Ponson winning at the arbitration hearings.\n\n===2005\u201306 offseason===\n\n==== Front office changes ====\nFollowing the disappointing 2005 season, it was clear major changes needed to be made within the Orioles. In the front office, Executive VP [[Jim Beattie (baseball)|Jim Beattie]] was not re-signed, allowing [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] to become the sole GM of the Orioles. Shortly after, [[Jim Duquette]] was hired as Vice President of Baseball Operations, which was Flanagan's previous position. Duquette made it clear at his signing that he reported to Flanagan, so the \"two-headed GM\" will not exist anymore. The Orioles also fired assistant General Manager [[Ed Kenney]] and asked for the resignation of [[Dave Ritterpusch]], Director of Baseball [[Information Systems]].\n\n==== Coaching staff changes ====\nThere were also drastic changes in the Orioles coaching staff. Perlozzo was named the new manager, and unlike Mazzilli, was given full freedom to name his coaching staff. Perlozzo led off strong by convincing Atlanta pitching coach [[Leo Mazzone]], who had revolutionized the careers of many pitchers in Atlanta, to become the pitching coach for the Orioles. He retained hitting coach [[Terry Crowley]] and first base coach [[Dave Cash (baseball)|Dave Cash]]. Former base coach and [[1983 World Series]] [[World Series MVP Award|MVP]] [[Rick Dempsey]] replaced the late [[Elrod Hendricks]] as the bullpen coach, with [[Tom Trebelhorn]] resuming third base coach. Perlozzo rounded out his staff with former Cubs and Phillies manager [[Lee Elia]] as the bench coach.\n\n==== Roster changes ====\nThe roster changes of 2005 were prefaced with [[Peter Angelos|Peter Angelos']] comments: ''\"We are coming back strong next year. I know you have heard that tune before, but this time it will literally come true.\"'' The Orioles allowed [[Rafael Palmeiro]], [[Sammy Sosa]], and [[B. J. Surhoff]] to become free agents. They also set their wishlist: An everyday first baseman, an experienced starter, a closer, a defensive catcher, outfield help, more defense, and more speed. However, their offseason moves showed no differences from past years. The Orioles were not able to re-sign closer [[B. J. Ryan]], who signed a landmark deal with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. They were also locked out in bids to sign first baseman [[Paul Konerko]], outfielder [[Johnny Damon]], and starter [[Paul Byrd]]. The Orioles were rumoured to have a deal with outfielder [[Jeromy Burnitz]], but his agent balked, supposedly at language regarding the physical, which was deemed by legal experts to be rather standard, and Burnitz signed with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. The Orioles chose not to enter the bidding for players like [[A. J. Burnett]] and [[Kevin Millwood]], whose asking prices were far beyond what the Orioles were willing to pay. The only target the Orioles managed to sign was catcher [[Ram\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez]].\n\nLocked out of pursuits to sign top-tier players, the Orioles decided to make several moves to allow minor league prospects more time to develop. This led to bringing in players like [[Jeff Conine]] and [[Kevin Millar]], both of whom are known for their positive presence in the clubhouse. The Orioles also made several trades to bring in needed players. They first traded disgruntled reliever [[Steve Kline (left-handed pitcher)|Steve Kline]] for [[LaTroy Hawkins]], then traded for outfielder [[Corey Patterson]], who brought speed and defense to the outfield, and traded former closer [[Jorge Julio]] and [[John Maine]] for experienced starter [[Kris Benson]]. The Orioles also addressed future free agents by extending the contract of outfielder [[Jay Gibbons]] and third baseman [[Melvin Mora]], and recently signed a contract extension with second baseman [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]]. The team's Opening Day roster featured top prospect [[Nick Markakis]], a potential A.L. \"Rookie of the Year\", the best young position player the Orioles' farm system has produced since Brian Roberts. Markakis represented the revival of the Orioles' once proud farm system, which features four players listed in Baseball America's 2006 list of the top 100 prospects in minor league baseball.\n\n==== Miguel Tejada ====\nThe Orioles' lack of movement over the course of the offseason frustrated many, including [[Miguel Tejada]]. This led to him stating, controversially, that he ''\"wanted to play for a winner\"'', and ''\"perhaps a change of scenery is needed.\"'' The Oriole front office began to talk to many teams interested in Tejada as a trade. It was rumored that the [[Boston Red Sox]] offered All-Star outfielder [[Manny Ram\u00edrez]] for Tejada, though no Orioles officials confirmed this. There were also talks of [[Mark Prior]] being offered for Tejada. After several weeks, teammate [[Melvin Mora]] facilitated a conference call between the Orioles and Tejada where Tejada backed down and said his comments were intended to provoke the Orioles to make more moves in free agency.\n\nThe Orioles finished the up and down 2006 season with a record of 70\u201392, 27 games behind the AL East leading Yankees.\n\n=== 2007\u20132011: Rebuilding years ===\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2015}}\nA new President of Baseball of Operations named [[Andy MacPhail]] was brought in about halfway through the 2007 season.  MacPhail had had success as general manager of the [[Minnesota Twins]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and had been the CEO of the [[Chicago Cubs]] from 1994\u20132006.  MacPhail spent the remainder of the 2007 season assessing the talent level of the Orioles, and determined that significant steps needed to be made if the Orioles were ever to be a contender again in the American League East.  He completed two blockbuster trades during the next off-season, each sending a premium player away in return for five prospects or (or younger less expensive players).  Tejada, who had hit .296 with 18 HR and 81 RBI in 2007, went to the Houston Astros in exchange for outfielder [[Luke Scott]], pitchers [[Matt Albers]], [[Troy Patton]], and [[Dennis Sarfate]], and third baseman [[Mike Costanzo]].  Also, the newly designated ace of the Orioles rotation [[\u00c9rik B\u00e9dard]], who went 13\u20135 with a 3.16 ERA in 2007 with 221 strikeouts, was sent to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for top outfield prospect [[Adam Jones (baseball)|Adam Jones]], left-handed pitcher [[George Sherrill]], and three minor league pitchers [[Chris Tillman]], [[Kam Mickolio]], and [[Tony Butler (baseball)|Tony Butler]].  The Bedard trade in particular would go down as one of the most lop-sided and successful trades in the history of the franchise.\n\nWhile MacPhail would find success in most of his trades made for the Orioles over the long-term, the veteran stop acquisitions that he would make would not often pan out, and as a result, the team would never finish higher than 4th place in the AL East, or with more than 69 wins, while MacPhail was in charge.  Although some of his free agent signings would have positive contributions (such as reliever [[Koji Uehara]]), most gave mediocre returns, at best.  In particular, the Orioles never managed to cobble together a successful pitching staff during this time.  Their most consistent starting pitcher from 2008\u20132011 was the late bloomer [[Jeremy Guthrie]] who was named the Opening Day starter in 3 of the 4 seasons and had a cumulative 4.12 ERA during this stretch.\n\n==== Buck Showalter ====\n\nFollowing Davey Johnson's dismissal after the 1997 playoff season, Orioles ownership struggled to find a manager that they liked, and this time period was no exception. [[Dave Trembley]] was brought on as an interim manager in June 2007, and had the interim tag removed later that year.  Trembley was at the helm again in 2008 and 2009 but was never able to lead the team out of the cellar in the AL East.  After starting the 2010 season a dismal 15\u201339, Dave Trembley was fired and third base coach [[Juan Samuel]] was named the interim manager.  The Orioles were seeking a more permanent solution at manager as the 2010 season continued to unfold, and two-time AL Manager of the Year [[Buck Showalter]] was eventually hired in July 2010.  The Orioles went 34\u201323 after Buck took over, foreshadowing that a brighter future might be on the horizon, and giving Orioles fans renewed hope and optimism for the team's future.\n\nThe Orioles made some aggressive moves to improve the team in 2011 in the hopes of securing their first playoff berth since 1997.  [[Andy MacPhail]] completed trades to bring in established veterans like [[Mark Reynolds (baseball)|Mark Reynolds]] and [[J. J. Hardy]] from the Diamondbacks and Twins, respectively.  Veteran free agents [[Derrek Lee]] and [[Vladimir Guerrero]] were also brought in to help improve the offense.   At the 2011 trade deadline, fan favorite [[Koji Uehara]] was sent to the Texas Rangers in exchange for [[Chris Davis (baseball)|Chris Davis]] and [[Tommy Hunter (baseball)|Tommy Hunter]], a move that would not pay immediate dividends, but would be crucial to the team's later success.  While these moves had varying impacts, the Orioles did score 95 more runs in 2011 than they had the previous year. The team still finished last in the AL East due to the utter failures of the team's pitching staff.  [[Brian Matusz]] compiled one of the highest single-season ERAs in MLB history (10.69 over 12 starts) and every single pitcher who started a game for the Orioles in 2011 ended the season with an ERA of 4.50 or higher except for [[Jeremy Guthrie]].  The Orioles finished 30th out of 30 MLB teams that year with a 4.89 team ERA. Andy MacPhail's contract was not renewed in October 2011 and a search for a new GM began.  After a public interview process where several candidates declined to take the position, ex-GM [[Dan Duquette]] was brought in to serve as the Executive Vice-President of Baseball Operations.\n\n=== 2012\u20132014 \"Buckle Up, We won't stop.\" ===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2015}}\nDuquette wasted no time in overhauling the Orioles roster, especially the MLB-worst pitching staff.  He traded fan favorite [[Jeremy Guthrie]] to the Colorado Rockies in exchange for [[Jason Hammel]].  He brought in new free agent starting pitcher [[Wei-Yin Chen]] from the Nippon Professional Baseball league, and [[Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez (pitcher)|Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez]] was signed as a minor league free agent.  [[Nate McLouth]] was signed to a minor league deal in June 2012 and would prove to make a significant impact down the stretch.  This year also marked the debut of the much hyped prospect [[Manny Machado]].\n\nThe Orioles won 93 games in 2012 (after winning 69 in the previous year) thanks in large part to a 29\u20139 record in one-run games, and a 16\u20132 record in extra inning games.  The difference between this Orioles bullpen and bullpens past was like night and day, led by [[Jim Johnson (baseball, born 1983)|Jim Johnson]] and his 51 saves.  He finished with a 2.49 ERA that season with [[Darren O'Day]], [[Luis Ayala]], [[Pedro Strop]], and [[Troy Patton]] all finishing as well with ERAs under 3.00.  Experts{{Who|date=April 2015}} were amazed as the team continued to outperform expectations, but regression never came that year.  They battled with the New York Yankees for first place in the AL East up until September, and would earn their first playoff berth in 15 years by winning the second wildcard spot in the American League.\n\nIn the 'sudden death' wildcard game against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Joe Saunders]] (acquired in August of that year in exchange for [[Matt Lindstrom]]) defeated [[Yu Darvish]] to help the Orioles advance to the divisional round, where they faced a familiar opponent, the Yankees. The Orioles forced the series to go five games (losing games 1 and 3 of the series, while winning 2 and 4), but [[CC Sabathia]] outpitched the Orioles [[Jason Hammel]] in Game 5 and the Orioles were eliminated from the playoffs.\n\n=== Last years of playoff contention (2015\u20132016) ===\n{{Main|2015 Baltimore Orioles season}}\nOn April 26, the Orioles scored 18 runs against the [[Boston Red Sox]], the most runs they had scored in a single game, since they defeated the [[Cleveland Indians]] 18\u20139<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/scoreboard/20060419.html|title=Major League Baseball : Scoreboard|work=mlb.com|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}</ref> on April 19, 2006.

The film was remade in Bangladeshi film as Black Money in (2015) starting Symon Sadik.  \n\n==Plot==\nA minister of Andhra Pradesh Cabinet named Kalamoorthy is removed from his post after the Central Bureau of Investigation proves his involvement in Liquor Mafia and the Election Commission of India declares the first by election after the main elections of that term in that constituency. While a senior ruling party leader Saradhi ([[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Bharath Reddy]]) is willing to spend {{INR}}25 crore for the election, other senior members ask Sanyasi Naidu ([[Charan Raj]]) to shell out {{INR}}50 crores and if he wins in the by election, he would become the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. Since it is his ambition to rule the state, Sanyasi Naidu accepts to spend {{INR}}50 crores. With the help of his trusted aid, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Sanyasi Naidu brings {{INR}}50 crores to India through Hawala transaction into Old City in Hyderabad. The ACP is tasked with transporting the money to the constituency. On completion of the task and if Sanyasi Naidu becomes the Chief Minister, then the ACP would be promoted as Inspector General (IG) of Police. The ACP goes to the Old city to collect the amount and the money is wrapped in big black plastic bags and is placed in the Deck lid of a Black Innova.\n\nAnother story runs parallel to the above plot. Prakash ([[Nani (actor)|Nani]]) is a model of an Old city sherwani firm who dreams to become rich. He has such an obsession for money that he pronounces his name as Pra'cash' often. He has two friends, Tabar ([[Akbar Bin Tabar]]), a cab driver and Gokul. Noor ([[Catherine Tresa]]), who also works in the same firm, is in love with him. However, as Prakash is in love with Sweety (Siddhika Sharma), the daughter of Sanyasi Naidu, Noor decides to leave him and marry an old sheikh in order to solve her family's financial problems on the pressure of their creditor and the local don Yadav (R.K.). But Prakash does not know that Sweety is Sanyasi Naidu's daughter and Sweety is not aware of Prakash's intentions and takes his advances lightly. When Prakash comes to know about Noor's marriage, he beats the sheikh, Yadav and his men in disguise and takes away Noor along with his friends. The two plots converge here as Prakash escapes in that Black Innova along with Noor and his friends while the ACP is left injured severely. Neither Prakash nor his companions are aware of the money in the car.\n\nTo save Noor, Prakash arranges her stay in Sweety's house to which Sweety accepts. In the meantime, Sanyasi Naidu calls his henchmen to Hyderabad to kill the ACP and find the money. Another gang of Sanyasi Naidu is approached by Saradhi who tells them to find the {{INR}}50 crores and distribute it among themselves and this stint makes the other gang turning into Saradhi's henchmen. The ACP makes a deal with Encounter specialist Daniel (Raja Ravindra) to find the money and share it between them equally. Prakash comes to know that his phone is missing and is in the Innova and goes to the parking lot along with Tabar in the latter's cab. There Prakash finds the money in the deck lid and shifts the bags into the deck lid of the cab. Tabar and Prakash go to the place where abandoned vehicles are kept and there Prakash and Tabar see the money. The keys are with Prakash and both go away from there. Meanwhile, Daniel and his sub-ordinate go to the parking lot and find only a part of the money in the Innova's deck lid. While they are informing about it to the ACP, Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen kill him and see the photo of Daniel in the caller image when he dials again.\n\nDaniel arrests all the Old city youngsters along with Prakash and Tabar and Daniel's sub-ordinate (Duvvasi Mohan) asks all of them about the money. Meanwhile, the Local MLA intervenes and all of them are released. Just as Prakash and Tabar leave the station, Saradhi's henchmen attack Prakash about the money and Prakash manages to beat them and escapes with Tabar. After an inquiry with the local Qazi, Daniel comes to know about Yadav's presence in the only marriage that happened on the day of missing of Innova. Yadav's men steal the cab from the new area and while Prakash and Tabar blame each other of stealing the money, Yadav makes a call to Prakash and threatens to sell the cab if he does not bring Noor today. But Yadav is unaware of the money in the cab. When Prakash, Tabar and Gokul see Yadav's men with the cab, they try to attack them but Daniel arrests Yadav's men and Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen rob the car. While Prakash, Tabar and Gokul chase them on a bike, they hit the car of Daniel and since Daniel knows that Prakash is also involved in the robbery of Innova after beating Yadav's men at the spot, Prakash and Tabar are arrested. They are tortured and when Daniel tries to shoot Prakash, Tabar tells that the money is in his cab. Tabar is shot by Daniel and Sanyasi Naidu's men kill Daniel and his sub-ordinate and kidnap Prakash. Gokul reaches the spot and takes Tabar along with him whom Prakash believes to be dead.\n\nSanyasi Naidu sees Prakash and threatens to kill Noor who is present in his house if he doesn't tell the place where the money is. Then Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen inform him that the cab is at the place where they robbed it as there was no petrol in it to drive. Prakash goes there along with Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen and is informed by Sweety that he is going to be murdered after they reach the spot. Prakash beats them up and refuels the cab. He goes to Yadav's place where Tabar and Gokul are being held. He calls Sanyasi Naidu to come there along with Noor if he wants him. Meanwhile, Prakash leaves petrol cans open inside the cab and plans to explode the cab once the petrol leaks. The two parties meet each other and while everything is going smooth, Saradhi's henchmen arrive along with Sweety and threaten Sanyasi Naidu to kill her if Prakash and the {{INR}}50 crores are not handed to them. Prakash and Sanyasi Naidu are not at all happy as Yadav is now aware of the money's presence and Prakash displays the money in the deck lid. He locks it and throws away the key. In the chaos that ensues, Sweety's life is endangered which worries Sanyasi Naidu.\n\nOnce Sweety and Noor are saved, the petrol starts leaking profusely and Prakash throws a burning stick on it which blasts the car and the entire money is burnt into ashes. Sanyasi Naidu is a reformed man. Prakash marries Noor and goes to Dubai along with his friends. There when his friends blame Prakash for burning the money, Prakash replies that before reaching Yadav's place, he took {{INR}}50 lakhs from the lot and replaced it with white papers. Out of the {{INR}}49.5 crores, he donates {{INR}}45 crores to Saheli, an organisation established for the welfare of poor women in old city to ensure that there is no financial problem to the old city families among which Noor's family is also one. The rest {{INR}}4.5 cores are retained by Prakash with which he starts a very successful Sherwani business in Dubai with his wife and friends as employees.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nani (actor)|Nani]] as Prakash\n* [[Catherine Tresa]] as Noor\n* Sidhika Sharma as Sweety\n* [[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Bharath Reddy]] as Saradhi\n* [[Charan Raj]] as Sanyasi Naidu\n* Raja Ravindra as Daniel\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as Daniel's subordinate\n* Akbar Bin Tabar as Prakash's friend\n* R.K. as Yadav\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nAfter Krishna Vamsi's failure [[Mogudu (film)|Mogudu]], he began working on his next film.

While a senior ruling party leader Saradhi ([[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Bharath Reddy]]) is willing to spend {{INR}}25 crore for the election, other senior members ask Sanyasi Naidu ([[Charan Raj]]) to shell out {{INR}}50 crores and if he wins in the by election, he would become the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. Since it is his ambition to rule the state, Sanyasi Naidu accepts to spend {{INR}}50 crores. With the help of his trusted aid, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Sanyasi Naidu brings {{INR}}50 crores to India through Hawala transaction into Old City in Hyderabad. The ACP is tasked with transporting the money to the constituency. On completion of the task and if Sanyasi Naidu becomes the Chief Minister, then the ACP would be promoted as Inspector General (IG) of Police. The ACP goes to the Old city to collect the amount and the money is wrapped in big black plastic bags and is placed in the Deck lid of a Black Innova.\n\nAnother story runs parallel to the above plot. Prakash ([[Nani (actor)|Nani]]) is a model of an Old city sherwani firm who dreams to become rich. He has such an obsession for money that he pronounces his name as Pra'cash' often. He has two friends, Tabar ([[Akbar Bin Tabar]]), a cab driver and Gokul. Noor ([[Catherine Tresa]]), who also works in the same firm, is in love with him. However, as Prakash is in love with Sweety (Siddhika Sharma), the daughter of Sanyasi Naidu, Noor decides to leave him and marry an old sheikh in order to solve her family's financial problems on the pressure of their creditor and the local don Yadav (R.K.). But Prakash does not know that Sweety is Sanyasi Naidu's daughter and Sweety is not aware of Prakash's intentions and takes his advances lightly. When Prakash comes to know about Noor's marriage, he beats the sheikh, Yadav and his men in disguise and takes away Noor along with his friends. The two plots converge here as Prakash escapes in that Black Innova along with Noor and his friends while the ACP is left injured severely. Neither Prakash nor his companions are aware of the money in the car.\n\nTo save Noor, Prakash arranges her stay in Sweety's house to which Sweety accepts. In the meantime, Sanyasi Naidu calls his henchmen to Hyderabad to kill the ACP and find the money. Another gang of Sanyasi Naidu is approached by Saradhi who tells them to find the {{INR}}50 crores and distribute it among themselves and this stint makes the other gang turning into Saradhi's henchmen. The ACP makes a deal with Encounter specialist Daniel (Raja Ravindra) to find the money and share it between them equally. Prakash comes to know that his phone is missing and is in the Innova and goes to the parking lot along with Tabar in the latter's cab. There Prakash finds the money in the deck lid and shifts the bags into the deck lid of the cab. Tabar and Prakash go to the place where abandoned vehicles are kept and there Prakash and Tabar see the money. The keys are with Prakash and both go away from there. Meanwhile, Daniel and his sub-ordinate go to the parking lot and find only a part of the money in the Innova's deck lid. While they are informing about it to the ACP, Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen kill him and see the photo of Daniel in the caller image when he dials again.\n\nDaniel arrests all the Old city youngsters along with Prakash and Tabar and Daniel's sub-ordinate (Duvvasi Mohan) asks all of them about the money. Meanwhile, the Local MLA intervenes and all of them are released. Just as Prakash and Tabar leave the station, Saradhi's henchmen attack Prakash about the money and Prakash manages to beat them and escapes with Tabar. After an inquiry with the local Qazi, Daniel comes to know about Yadav's presence in the only marriage that happened on the day of missing of Innova. Yadav's men steal the cab from the new area and while Prakash and Tabar blame each other of stealing the money, Yadav makes a call to Prakash and threatens to sell the cab if he does not bring Noor today. But Yadav is unaware of the money in the cab. When Prakash, Tabar and Gokul see Yadav's men with the cab, they try to attack them but Daniel arrests Yadav's men and Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen rob the car. While Prakash, Tabar and Gokul chase them on a bike, they hit the car of Daniel and since Daniel knows that Prakash is also involved in the robbery of Innova after beating Yadav's men at the spot, Prakash and Tabar are arrested. They are tortured and when Daniel tries to shoot Prakash, Tabar tells that the money is in his cab. Tabar is shot by Daniel and Sanyasi Naidu's men kill Daniel and his sub-ordinate and kidnap Prakash. Gokul reaches the spot and takes Tabar along with him whom Prakash believes to be dead.\n\nSanyasi Naidu sees Prakash and threatens to kill Noor who is present in his house if he doesn't tell the place where the money is. Then Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen inform him that the cab is at the place where they robbed it as there was no petrol in it to drive. Prakash goes there along with Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen and is informed by Sweety that he is going to be murdered after they reach the spot. Prakash beats them up and refuels the cab. He goes to Yadav's place where Tabar and Gokul are being held. He calls Sanyasi Naidu to come there along with Noor if he wants him. Meanwhile, Prakash leaves petrol cans open inside the cab and plans to explode the cab once the petrol leaks. The two parties meet each other and while everything is going smooth, Saradhi's henchmen arrive along with Sweety and threaten Sanyasi Naidu to kill her if Prakash and the {{INR}}50 crores are not handed to them. Prakash and Sanyasi Naidu are not at all happy as Yadav is now aware of the money's presence and Prakash displays the money in the deck lid. He locks it and throws away the key. In the chaos that ensues, Sweety's life is endangered which worries Sanyasi Naidu.\n\nOnce Sweety and Noor are saved, the petrol starts leaking profusely and Prakash throws a burning stick on it which blasts the car and the entire money is burnt into ashes. Sanyasi Naidu is a reformed man. Prakash marries Noor and goes to Dubai along with his friends. There when his friends blame Prakash for burning the money, Prakash replies that before reaching Yadav's place, he took {{INR}}50 lakhs from the lot and replaced it with white papers. Out of the {{INR}}49.5 crores, he donates {{INR}}45 crores to Saheli, an organisation established for the welfare of poor women in old city to ensure that there is no financial problem to the old city families among which Noor's family is also one. The rest {{INR}}4.5 cores are retained by Prakash with which he starts a very successful Sherwani business in Dubai with his wife and friends as employees.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nani (actor)|Nani]] as Prakash\n* [[Catherine Tresa]] as Noor\n* Sidhika Sharma as Sweety\n* [[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Bharath Reddy]] as Saradhi\n* [[Charan Raj]] as Sanyasi Naidu\n* Raja Ravindra as Daniel\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as Daniel's subordinate\n* Akbar Bin Tabar as Prakash's friend\n* R.K. as Yadav\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nAfter Krishna Vamsi's failure [[Mogudu (film)|Mogudu]], he began working on his next film.

Nani's character is inappropriately happy-go-lucky. Moreover, his expression should have been intense in the second part of the film but that is not so. The screenplay was terribly written and executed, as the result, the audience feel that, barring Raja Ravindar, the others were less than perturbed by the mess.

It is not until the interval caption that one realizes that first half is over. But trouble begins in second half. It could not sustain the same speed and had a dip which eventually played the spoilsport.
