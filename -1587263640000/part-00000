The Model 21 was redesignated '''L5/21''', and the Model 30 was redesignated '''L5/30'''.\n\nThe Fiat 3000 (Model 21) was first used in action in February 1926 in [[Libya]], and subsequently also saw action against the Ethiopians in the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] in 1935. It was not one of the tanks used by the Italians in Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]], however. With Italy's entry into World War II in June 1940, a limited number of Fiat 3000s still in service with the Italian Army were employed operationally on the Greek-Albanian front. They were also among the last Italian tanks to oppose the Allies, as in July 1943, when the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allies landed in Sicily]], two Italian tank companies on the island were still equipped with the 3000. One company was dug in and their vehicles were used as fixed [[fortification]]s, while the other company was used in a mobile role to respond to the amphibious landing during the  [[Battle of Gela (1943)|Battle of Gela]], with few of the tanks surviving the Allied drive.<ref name=\"g&s7\">Garland & Smith ''U.S. Army in World War II - Mediterranean Theater of Operations - Sicily and the Surrender of Italy'' pp.147-162</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fiat 2000]]\n* [[Pacification of Libya]]\n* [[Ethiopian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1928]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324234436/http://www.wwiivehicles.com/italy/tanks-light/fiat-3000.asp Fiat 3000] at wwiivehicles.com\n\n{{WWIIItalianAFVs|style=wide}}\n{{Interwar tanks|style=wide}}\n{{Fiat}}\n{{Portal bar|Tanks}}\n[[Category:Fiat armored vehicles|3000]]\n[[Category:World War I tanks of Italy]]\n[[Category:World War II tanks of Italy]]\n[[Category:Light tanks of Italy]]\n", "name_user": "Aldis90", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_3000"}

The High School curriculum includes Algebra (1&2), Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Environmental Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, World History, American History, English, and Jewish History (1&2). [[Advanced Placement]] courses that TA has offered in the past include Physics, American History, European History, and English Literature. Seniors may optionally take college courses for English 101 and Psychology 101 provided by [[Baltimore City Community College|Baltimore City Community Community College (BCCC)]]\n\n====Religious====\nTalmud study begins in 5th grade at an introductory level. Talmudic study in earnest begins in 8th grade with its division into Bekius and Iyyun. Tractates that are studied with the Bekius method include [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)]], [[Sotah]], [[Ta'anit (Talmud)]], [[Megillah (Talmud)]] and others. Shorter Tractates are usually chosen. Unlike many other [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]]-Style Yeshivas, TA does not have a set cycle of Tractates that it studies, rather every year the new Tractate is selected in a Faculty meeting. [[Mishna]] is studied until 5th grade. The learning of [[Tanach]] is encouraged by most Rabbis on the Faculty, though it is not a primary subject. Most set aside time in the morning for the study of [[Halacha]]. This is generally, however, a mere formality.\n\n==Beis Medrash==\nUntil 1998, a Bais Medrash-level [[shiur]] was given by Rabbi [[Yosef Rottenberg]]. When he became too ill to continue giving the shiur, the Bais Medrash was discontinued. At the end of 2004, HaRav [[Yisrael Asia]] was brought in to lead the Beis Medrash, which he did for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 school years. During the 2005/06 year, Rav [[Avrohom Notis]] also gave shiur to the Beis Medrash. In 2006\u201307, the Bais Medrash was resurrected yet again by Rabbi [[Bentzion Mellman]] and Rabbi [[Dovid Hoffman]]. Rabbi Mellman acted as [[Rosh Beis Medrash]] and Instructor of Iyyun (a slower, more in-depth Talmudic analysis) and Rabbi Hoffman as the \"Sho'el u-Maishiv\" (study-hall mentor) and Instructor of B'kius (a faster, less in-depth method of Talmudic study). The inaugural Class consisted of seven members; however three more students joined the Program in the middle of the year. The program continued through the 2008\u201309 year, but has been discontinued for the time being.\n\n==Extra-curricular activities==\nT.A. used to have a varsity basketball team. They were called the Fighting Davids in the '70s and '80s. In the '90s they became the Tigers.\nThe team reached its zenith in the [[Tamir Goodman]] era, which was in the late '90s and early 2000s. The team name was changed to the \"Thunder\".\n\nTorah Youth Association was loosely connected with T.A. The Association, headed by Gavi Cohn, and continues to serve as an outlet for teenage boys to play sports and hang out in an environment that fully agrees with Jewish Orthodox social customs. The T.Y.A. sponsored a flag football league near T.A. which was very popular. The association also hosted tennis and pizza nights on Saturday Night, as well as a yearly Super Bowl Party. T.Y.A. also hosted shabbatons at the [[Pearlstone Center]], in Western Maryland, as well as [[Camp Shoresh]].\n\nT.A. has always been the site of many informal sports and other leisurely activities, such as the (now defunct) chess club, debate club, and the 'tag club' of the mid-1990s. There was a short-lived varsity baseball team, led by [[Paul Blitz]], a U.S. Army Reserve soldier.\n\nIn the late 1970s, National Football League player Mike Collier briefly served as gym teacher.\n \nA Mishmar program is currently available for middle school students. 6th and 7th grade Mishmar starts after school ends at 5:15.\n\n==Notable visitors==\nT.A. has hosted a number of famous Roshei Yeshiva, and other scholars of repute.
