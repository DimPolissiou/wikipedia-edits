It is located between the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Western Ghats]] mountain range about {{convert|352|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Bangalore]], the state capital. Mangalore is the state's only city to have all four modes of transport\u2014air, road, rail and sea. The population of the [[urban agglomeration]] was 619,664&nbsp;{{as of|alt=according to the 2011|2011}}&nbsp;national census of India.\n\nThe city developed as a port in the Arabian Sea during ancient times; it has since developed into a major [[Ports in India|port of India]] that handles 75&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of India's coffee and cashew exports, and is the country's seventh largest container port. Mangalore has been ruled by several major powers, including the [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadambas]], [[Alupas]], [[Vijayanagar Empire]], [[Nayakas of Keladi|Keladi Nayaks]] and the Portuguese. The city was a source of contention between the [[British Raj|British]] and the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] rulers [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], and was eventually annexed by the British in 1799. Mangalore remained part of the [[Madras Presidency]] until [[Partition of India|India's independence]] in 1947 and was unified with [[Mysore State]] (now called Karnataka) in 1956.\n\nMangalore is also the administrative headquarters of the [[Dakshina Kannada]] district, and is a commercial, industrial, educational, healthcare and startup hub. This city's International Airport is the second-largest airport in Karnataka. Mangalore City Corporation is responsible for the civic administration, which manages the 60&nbsp;wards of the city. The city's landscape is characterised by rolling hills, coconut palms, rivers and hard, red-clay-roofed buildings. India's first 3D&nbsp;planetarium with 8K&nbsp;resolution display is situated in this city. Mangalore is also included in the [[Smart Cities Mission]] list and is among the 100&nbsp;smart cities to be developed in India. The city has an average elevation of {{convert|22|m|foot|0|abbr=on}} above [[mean sea level]]. Mangalore has a tropical monsoon climate and is under the influence of the southwest monsoon.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:1652 Sanson Map of India - Geographicus - India-sanson-1652.jpg|thumb|left|1652 Sanson Map of India]]\nMangalore was named after the deity Mangaladevi, the presiding deity of the [[Mangaladevi Temple]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Kameshwar|first=G.|publisher=Rupa & Co.|title=Tulu tales: a soota chronicle|isbn=978-81-291-0427-4|year=2004|p=8}}</ref> or a synonym of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] Bhagvati of the [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhist]] sect.<ref name=Sadasivan>{{cite book|last=Sadasivan|first=S.N.|title=A social history of India|year=2000|publisher=APH Pub.

It is located between the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Western Ghats]] mountain range about {{convert|352|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Bangalore]], the state capital. Mangalore is the state's only city to have all four modes of transport\u2014air, road, rail and sea. The population of the [[urban agglomeration]] was 619,664&nbsp;{{as of|alt=according to the 2011|2011}}&nbsp;national census of India.\n\nThe city developed as a port in the Arabian Sea during ancient times; it has since developed into a major [[Ports in India|port of India]] that handles 75&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of India's coffee and cashew exports, and is the country's seventh largest container port. Mangalore has been ruled by several major powers, including the [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadambas]], [[Alupas]], [[Vijayanagar Empire]], [[Nayakas of Keladi|Keladi Nayaks]] and the Portuguese. The city was a source of contention between the [[British Raj|British]] and the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] rulers [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], and was eventually annexed by the British in 1799. Mangalore remained part of the [[Madras Presidency]] until [[Partition of India|India's independence]] in 1947 and was unified with [[Mysore State]] (now called Karnataka) in 1956.\n\nMangalore is also the administrative headquarters of the [[Dakshina Kannada]] district, and is a commercial, industrial, educational, healthcare and startup hub. This city's International Airport is the second-largest airport in Karnataka. Mangalore City Corporation is responsible for the civic administration, which manages the 60&nbsp;wards of the city. The city's landscape is characterised by rolling hills, coconut palms, rivers and hard, red-clay-roofed buildings. India's first 3D&nbsp;planetarium with 8K&nbsp;resolution display is situated in this city. Mangalore is also included in the [[Smart Cities Mission]] list and is among the 100&nbsp;smart cities to be developed in India. The city has an average elevation of {{convert|22|m|foot|0|abbr=on}} above [[mean sea level]]. Mangalore has a tropical monsoon climate and is under the influence of the southwest monsoon.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:1652 Sanson Map of India - Geographicus - India-sanson-1652.jpg|thumb|left|1652 Sanson Map of India]]\nMangalore was named after the deity Mangaladevi, the presiding deity of the [[Mangaladevi Temple]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Kameshwar|first=G.|publisher=Rupa & Co.|title=Tulu tales: a soota chronicle|isbn=978-81-291-0427-4|year=2004|p=8}}</ref> or a synonym of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] Bhagvati of the [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhist]] sect.<ref name=Sadasivan>{{cite book|last=Sadasivan|first=S.N.|title=A social history of India|year=2000|publisher=APH Pub.

Bhikni ends up staying with the widow Shanichari, who lives within the Thakur's compound. As they both begin to bond, Shanichari tells Bhikni her life's story, which is revealed to us in flashbacks.\n\nShanichari was born on a ''Shanichar'' (Saturday), which is concerned to be an [[ill omen]]ed day, ruled by the planet ''Shani'' ([[Saturn]]) in astrology. Shanichari is blamed by the villagers for everything bad that happens around her - starting from her father's death, to her mother Peewli's running off to join a folk theatre troupe. While still young, Shanichari is married off to Ganju, a drunkard, who ends up dying due to a plague at a village fair. Her only support is her son, Budhua, whom she loves very much. However, he likes to roam around aimlessly, just like Peewli did.\n\nMeanwhile, the Thakur's son Lakshman Singh reveals that he likes her and offers her a job at the Thakur's ''[[haveli]]''. She then serves under his wife, who has been spoiled but is secluded from others. Lakshman tries to teach Shanichari to empower herself and understand her rights, and encourages her to \"look up\" into his eyes when speaking to him. One night, after Shanichari's singing performance at the ''haveli'', he gifts her a house of her own, along with two acres of land.\n\nSoon, the adult Budhua brings home a wife, Mungri, who is a young prostitute pregnant with his child. However, the couple keeps fighting, and one day in a fit of rage, Mungri [[Abortion|aborts]] the child. Budhua, upset, runs away from home, leaving his mother all alone. It is revealed that throughout her hardships, Shanichari had never shed a tear.\n\nOne night, Bhikni is called to the neighbouring village to meet Bhimdata. The Thakur passes away a few hours later. Lakshman Singh and Shanichari are then seen bidding farewell to each other as Singh plans to leave the village after his father's demise. They are interrupted by a messenger from Bhimdata, who reveals that Bhikni succumbed to the plague, and in her last few minutes requested that Shanichari be told that she was her mother, Peewli.

It was placed in the ''[[Russula]]'' [[Genus]] by the Swedish mycologist, and botanist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838, with the epithet ''heterophylla''. Despite many changes, by several mycologists over the years since then, it is this binomial that is currently recognised,<ref>http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=193557</ref> and is in use at present.\n\nThe variants ''Russula heterophylla'' var. ''chlora'' Gillet 1876, and ''Russula heterophylla'' var. ''virginea'' (Cooke and Massee) A.Pearson & Dennis, have been given species status as ''[[Russula violeipes]]'', and ''[[Russula virginea]]'' respectively.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in}} in diameter.

It was placed in the ''[[Russula]]'' [[Genus]] by the Swedish mycologist, and botanist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838, with the epithet ''heterophylla''. Despite many changes, by several mycologists over the years since then, it is this binomial that is currently recognised,<ref>http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=193557</ref> and is in use at present.\n\nThe variants ''Russula heterophylla'' var. ''chlora'' Gillet 1876, and ''Russula heterophylla'' var. ''virginea'' (Cooke and Massee) A.Pearson & Dennis, have been given species status as ''[[Russula violeipes]]'', and ''[[Russula virginea]]'' respectively.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in}} in diameter. It is known to vary in colour, and can be various shades of green, brown, or ochre. It is initially round, flattening with age, and laters develops a depression.
