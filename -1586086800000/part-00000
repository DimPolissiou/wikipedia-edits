First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

It was founded on November 1, 1901, at Richmond College (now the [[University of Richmond]]), and its national headquarters remains in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]]. It was founded on three principles: [[Virtue]], [[Diligence]], and [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|Brotherly Love]] (often abbreviated as \"VDBL\"). Sigma Phi Epsilon is one of the largest social fraternities in the United States in terms of current undergraduate membership.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sigep.org/about/facts_national.asp | title=Fraternity Facts - The National Fraternity | work=Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity | accessdate=2010-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:OU Sigma Phi Epsilon.JPG|thumb|Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity House at [[Ohio University]].]]\n\n===Founding===\nIn the fall of 1900 18-year-old divinity student Carter Ashton Jenkens, the son of a Baptist minister, transferred from [[Rutgers University|Rutgers College]] of New Jersey to [[University of Richmond|Richmond College]], a Baptist institution in the Virginia capital.<ref name=\"spefound\">{{cite web|url=http://sigep.org/about/history_02.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The first 50 Years > Sigma Phi Epsilon Founded|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070610103649/http://sigep.org/about/history_02.asp|archive-date=2007-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> At Rutgers Jenkens had been initiated into the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity. At Richmond, which did not have a chapter of Chi Phi, Jenkens was part of group of friends who were meeting regularly under the unofficial name the \"Saturday Night Club\".<ref name=\"spemeet\">{{cite web|url=http://sigep.org/about/history_03.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The first 50 years >The First Meeting|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070610103649/http://sigep.org/about/history_03.asp|archive-date=2007-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> By early October, 1901, Jenkens had persuaded the group, which had grown to twelve men, to try to establish a chapter of Chi Phi at Richmond. These men were reportedly spurned by the existing fraternities on campus for their sense of morality (seven of the twelve were studying for the ordained ministry) and for their rural, middle-class backgrounds.<ref name=\"spefound\"/> Jenkens had convinced the others that their chapter could be different from the other fraternities on campus and assured them that Chi Phi's principles were in line with their own. The group's request for a charter, however, was met with refusal as the national fraternity felt that Richmond College was too small to host a Chi Phi chapter.<ref name=\"spefound\"/> Jenkens and his friends therefore founded their own fraternity.\n\nAfter several secret meetings throughout October 1901, the new fraternity took shape and on November 1, 1901, the fraternity's first membership roster was publicly posted at the school. It listed the twelve founding members in this order: Carter Ashton Jenkens, Benjamin Donald Gaw, William Hugh Carter, William Andrew Wallace, Thomas Temple Wright, William Lazelle Phillips, Lucian Baum Cox, Richard Spurgeon Owens, Edgar Lee Allen, Robert Alfred McFarland, Franklin Webb Kerfoot and Thomas Vaden McCaul. After much discussion, the group settled on a secret motto and called their fraternity Sigma Phi.<ref name=\"spemeet\"/>\n\nJenkens, Gaw and Phillips then met with a faculty committee to seek official recognition for their new fraternity. The faculty members were reluctant to recognize a sixth fraternity in a school with only 300 students, especially as more than half the members would be soon-to graduate seniors. Additionally, another national fraternity already existed using the name [[Sigma Phi]].<ref name=\"sperecognized\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/about/history_04.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The First 50 Years > Fraternity Recognized|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013044231/http://www.sigep.org/about/history_04.asp|archive-date=2006-10-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> The founders responded that their new fraternity would be different from the others at Richmond, as was being founded upon biblical, egalitarian principles,<ref name=\"sperecognized\"/> and new members would quickly be taken in from the undergraduate classes to increase the new fraternity's size, and the fraternity's name was still open to debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/about/who-we-are/history-and-facts/thefirst50years/ |title=The First 50 Years |publisher=Sigep.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-24}}</ref> With these assurances from the founders, the faculty committee approved the new fraternity's request for official recognition. Shortly afterwards, the founders met and decided to rename the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon.<ref name=\"sperecognized\"/>\n\n===Badge and colors===\nThe colors dark red and royal purple were chosen to represent [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|fraternity]], while the golden heart was chosen as the fraternity's symbol. The principles of Virtue, Diligence and Brotherly Love, were chosen as \"The Three Cardinal Principles\". Jenkens also designed the fraternity's badge as a golden heart surmounted by a black enameled heart-shaped shield. Upon the shield are inscribed, in gold, the Greek-letters of the fraternity, \u03a3\u03a6\u0395, and below these letters, a [[skull and crossbones (symbol)|skull and crossbones]]. The meaning of these symbols is divulged during the initiation ritual and known to members only. The founders' badges were designed and ordered before the addition of \"Epsilon\" to the fraternity's name. Thus they had only a \"Sigma\" and a \"Phi\" inscribed on the lobes of the heart, with the skull and crossbones below. A last-minute telegraph sent to the jeweler requested that an \"Epsilon\" be added \"somewhere\" on the already-complete badges, so the jeweler replaced the bottom-most gemstones with a black enameled \"Epsilon.\" The badges of founders Carter and McCaul are on display at the Sigma Phi Epsilon headquarters at the fraternity's headquarters.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nChapter house doors are traditionally painted red. The tradition of the red door on Sigma Phi Epsilon Chapter houses began at Syracuse University (New York Alpha) in the 1920s. Brothers there painted the front door of their house red as a token of fraternalism, because it is a fraternity color. Today, all 260 SigEp chapters have red doors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://semosigep.com/page.php?pageid=27|title=MO Zeta of Sigma Phi Epsilon at Southeast Missouri State University - MO Zeta, Sigma Phi Epsilon , Southeast Missouri State University, chapterspot fraternity websites, chapterspot sorority websites, chapterspot.com|website=semosigep.com|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref>\n\n===Acceptance of transgender members===\nIn December 2014, Sigma Phi Epsilon became the first fraternity in the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]] to accept [[transgender]] men as members.

It was founded on November 1, 1901, at Richmond College (now the [[University of Richmond]]), and its national headquarters remains in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]]. It was founded on three principles: [[Virtue]], [[Diligence]], and [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|Brotherly Love]] (often abbreviated as \"VDBL\"). Sigma Phi Epsilon is one of the largest social fraternities in the United States in terms of current undergraduate membership.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sigep.org/about/facts_national.asp | title=Fraternity Facts - The National Fraternity | work=Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity | accessdate=2010-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:OU Sigma Phi Epsilon.JPG|thumb|Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity House at [[Ohio University]].]]\n\n===Founding===\nIn the fall of 1900 18-year-old divinity student Carter Ashton Jenkens, the son of a Baptist minister, transferred from [[Rutgers University|Rutgers College]] of New Jersey to [[University of Richmond|Richmond College]], a Baptist institution in the Virginia capital.<ref name=\"spefound\">{{cite web|url=http://sigep.org/about/history_02.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The first 50 Years > Sigma Phi Epsilon Founded|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070610103649/http://sigep.org/about/history_02.asp|archive-date=2007-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> At Rutgers Jenkens had been initiated into the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity. At Richmond, which did not have a chapter of Chi Phi, Jenkens was part of group of friends who were meeting regularly under the unofficial name the \"Saturday Night Club\".<ref name=\"spemeet\">{{cite web|url=http://sigep.org/about/history_03.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The first 50 years >The First Meeting|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070610103649/http://sigep.org/about/history_03.asp|archive-date=2007-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> By early October, 1901, Jenkens had persuaded the group, which had grown to twelve men, to try to establish a chapter of Chi Phi at Richmond. These men were reportedly spurned by the existing fraternities on campus for their sense of morality (seven of the twelve were studying for the ordained ministry) and for their rural, middle-class backgrounds.<ref name=\"spefound\"/> Jenkens had convinced the others that their chapter could be different from the other fraternities on campus and assured them that Chi Phi's principles were in line with their own. The group's request for a charter, however, was met with refusal as the national fraternity felt that Richmond College was too small to host a Chi Phi chapter.<ref name=\"spefound\"/> Jenkens and his friends therefore founded their own fraternity.\n\nAfter several secret meetings throughout October 1901, the new fraternity took shape and on November 1, 1901, the fraternity's first membership roster was publicly posted at the school. It listed the twelve founding members in this order: Carter Ashton Jenkens, Benjamin Donald Gaw, William Hugh Carter, William Andrew Wallace, Thomas Temple Wright, William Lazelle Phillips, Lucian Baum Cox, Richard Spurgeon Owens, Edgar Lee Allen, Robert Alfred McFarland, Franklin Webb Kerfoot and Thomas Vaden McCaul. After much discussion, the group settled on a secret motto and called their fraternity Sigma Phi.<ref name=\"spemeet\"/>\n\nJenkens, Gaw and Phillips then met with a faculty committee to seek official recognition for their new fraternity. The faculty members were reluctant to recognize a sixth fraternity in a school with only 300 students, especially as more than half the members would be soon-to graduate seniors. Additionally, another national fraternity already existed using the name [[Sigma Phi]].<ref name=\"sperecognized\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/about/history_04.asp|title=The History of Sigma Phi Epsilon - The First 50 Years > Fraternity Recognized|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013044231/http://www.sigep.org/about/history_04.asp|archive-date=2006-10-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> The founders responded that their new fraternity would be different from the others at Richmond, as was being founded upon biblical, egalitarian principles,<ref name=\"sperecognized\"/> and new members would quickly be taken in from the undergraduate classes to increase the new fraternity's size, and the fraternity's name was still open to debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/about/who-we-are/history-and-facts/thefirst50years/ |title=The First 50 Years |publisher=Sigep.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-24}}</ref> With these assurances from the founders, the faculty committee approved the new fraternity's request for official recognition. Shortly afterwards, the founders met and decided to rename the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon.<ref name=\"sperecognized\"/>\n\n===Badge and colors===\nThe colors dark red and royal purple were chosen to represent [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|fraternity]], while the golden heart was chosen as the fraternity's symbol. The principles of Virtue, Diligence and Brotherly Love, were chosen as \"The Three Cardinal Principles\". Jenkens also designed the fraternity's badge as a golden heart surmounted by a black enameled heart-shaped shield. Upon the shield are inscribed, in gold, the Greek-letters of the fraternity, \u03a3\u03a6\u0395, and below these letters, a [[skull and crossbones (symbol)|skull and crossbones]]. The meaning of these symbols is divulged during the initiation ritual and known to members only. The founders' badges were designed and ordered before the addition of \"Epsilon\" to the fraternity's name. Thus they had only a \"Sigma\" and a \"Phi\" inscribed on the lobes of the heart, with the skull and crossbones below. A last-minute telegraph sent to the jeweler requested that an \"Epsilon\" be added \"somewhere\" on the already-complete badges, so the jeweler replaced the bottom-most gemstones with a black enameled \"Epsilon.\" The badges of founders Carter and McCaul are on display at the Sigma Phi Epsilon headquarters at the fraternity's headquarters.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nChapter house doors are traditionally painted red. The tradition of the red door on Sigma Phi Epsilon Chapter houses began at Syracuse University (New York Alpha) in the 1920s. Brothers there painted the front door of their house red as a token of fraternalism, because it is a fraternity color. Today, all 260 SigEp chapters have red doors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://semosigep.com/page.php?pageid=27|title=MO Zeta of Sigma Phi Epsilon at Southeast Missouri State University - MO Zeta, Sigma Phi Epsilon , Southeast Missouri State University, chapterspot fraternity websites, chapterspot sorority websites, chapterspot.com|website=semosigep.com|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref>\n\n===Acceptance of transgender members===\nIn December 2014, Sigma Phi Epsilon became the first fraternity in the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]] to accept [[transgender]] men as members.

All three of the men were from Charleston.\n\nIn 1904, the [[College of Charleston]] was a small, [[municipal college]]. The all-male college was the first municipal college in the country, and the thirteenth oldest educational institution in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cofc.edu/about/historyandtraditions/briefhistory.php|title=A Brief History of the College - College of Charleston|website=www.cofc.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref>  The school had a campus literary society called the Chrestomathics, which held activities such as debates. The college's monthly magazine was staffed by the officers of the Chrestomathics, forming the equivalent of a modern-day student government.\n\nThe three men set a goal to obtain officer positions within the Chrestomathic Literary Society. At that time, the organization was dominated by the three chapters of national fraternities on campus. All fraternity men were sworn to vote for their candidates, making it virtually impossible for any non-fraternity men to win election.\n\nKroeg, Mixson, Fogarty, and a group of their friends, all non-fraternity men, began forming an opposition party. Several meetings were held at Mixson's home on Wentworth Street leading to the formation of Nu Phi, which stood for \"non-fraternity.\" The group of 15 men developed an opposing slate and began campaigning. Nu Phi adopted the outline of a hand as its secret symbol. A sketched hand on a classroom chalkboard signified an upcoming meeting. Inside the hand was written the meeting time and the host's last name.\n\nThe Nu Phi group assigned a member to kidnap those who might vote for the fraternity ticket on election day. However, the Nu Phi ticket lost the elections. Later, it was revealed that several disloyal members cast their votes for the opposing fraternity slate. Kroeg, determined to see his friends have a chance at winning elections, decided that the only way to gain the influence of the fraternity men on campus was to begin his own fraternity.<ref name=nonfraternity>{{cite web\n|title = Non fraternity\n|url= http://www.pikapp.org/flash/history/non_fraternity.swf|publisher= Pi Kappa Phi\n|accessdate=2007-12-17\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030010346/http://www.pikapp.org/flash/history/non_fraternity.swf\n|archivedate=2008-10-30\n|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Founding===\n\n[[Image:Kroeg.png|thumb|left|98px|Andrew Alexander Kroeg, Jr.]]\nOn December 10, 1904, a meeting of the loyal Nu Phis was held at Fogarty's home at 90 Broad Street to establish a new fraternity. There were seven men in attendance at the meeting: Kroeg, Fogarty, Mixson, Anthony Pelzer Wagener, Thomas F. Mosimann, Theodore (\"Teddy\") Barnwell Kelley, and James Fogarty (Simon's younger brother). All of the original members were students at the college and had grown up together in Charleston.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\nWagener, who was a student of Greek and Latin, recommended the letters Pi Kappa Phi and their secret meaning as the official new name of the group. Simon proposed the design of the fraternity's pin, a black enamel diamond with the Greek letters \u03a0\u039a\u03a6 engraved in gold with a star and lamp as additional elements. Kroeg was selected as the new chapter's first president, which was termed \"[[Archon]]\", from the Greek term. He then began work on a constitution for chapter. The group quickly set out to recruit new members to its ranks.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\nOn December 10, 1905, the first anniversary of the fraternity's founding, Mixson's mother cooked the men a special dinner in her home to celebrate a successful first year as a fraternity. The fraternity celebrate that date as \"Founders Day\" with a dinner or a similar ceremony. In 1906 Mixson and Wagener wrote the fraternity's initiation ritual as the \"highest ideals of Christian manhood\".<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\n===Expansion===\nThat same year, the group was offered a charter from another U.S. fraternity. Instead, they chose to expand and create more Pi Kappa Phi chapters. A second chapter (\"Beta Chapter\") was formed at [[Presbyterian College]] on March 9, 1907. Due to a state law banning fraternities at state supported schools, Presbyterian College and the College of Charleston were the only two South Carolina schools where fraternities were allowed. A third chapter was formed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], which was the first chapter to obtain a house.\n\nKroeg developed \"Articles of Incorporation\" and the name Pi Kappa Phi became legally registered in the state of [[South Carolina]] on December 23, 1907.\n\nThe interest in Pi Kappa Phi within South Carolina was growing despite laws and policies banning fraternities. In 1909, Delta Chapter at [[Furman University]] formed and operated in secret until state laws changed, allowing fraternal organizations. In 1910, a charter was granted to Sigma Chapter at the [[University of South Carolina]] and the chapter was operated as the Sigma Club due to the laws banning fraternities.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\n===The ''Star and Lamp''===\n''The Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity Journal'' was begun in 1909, with Henry Wagener as editor. In 1911, the name was changed to the ''Star & Lamp''.<ref name=\"nonfraternity\"/>\n\n==Controversies==\nIn 2019, several members of the fraternity at [[Texas State University]] brutally attacked a fellow student they mistakenly assumed was a member of their rival fraternity on campus [[Phi Kappa Psi]], leaving him with a fractured skull and a traumatic brain injury.  As a result, the fraternity was placed on suspension, some members are facing criminal charges, and the attacked student filed a lawsuit against the fraternity.<ref>https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/us/texas-state-fraternity-arrest/index.html</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the fraternity at [[Central Michigan University]] was suspended indefinitely by the university for failure to adhere to previous sanctions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sheffield|first1=Paige|title=Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity suspended indefinitely|url=http://www.cm-life.com/article/2017/11/pi-kappa-phi|accessdate=December 15, 2017|work=Central Michigan Life|date=November 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2017, the Alpha chapter at the [[College of Charleston]] was suspended by the college following a probe investigating allegations of drug and alcohol use, hazing, and the alleged beating of a student.

Kroeg, determined to see his friends have a chance at winning elections, decided that the only way to gain the influence of the fraternity men on campus was to begin his own fraternity.<ref name=nonfraternity>{{cite web\n|title = Non fraternity\n|url= http://www.pikapp.org/flash/history/non_fraternity.swf|publisher= Pi Kappa Phi\n|accessdate=2007-12-17\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030010346/http://www.pikapp.org/flash/history/non_fraternity.swf\n|archivedate=2008-10-30\n|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Founding===\n\n[[Image:Kroeg.png|thumb|left|98px|Andrew Alexander Kroeg, Jr.]]\nOn December 10, 1904, a meeting of the loyal Nu Phis was held at Fogarty's home at 90 Broad Street to establish a new fraternity. There were seven men in attendance at the meeting: Kroeg, Fogarty, Mixson, Anthony Pelzer Wagener, Thomas F. Mosimann, Theodore (\"Teddy\") Barnwell Kelley, and James Fogarty (Simon's younger brother). All of the original members were students at the college and had grown up together in Charleston.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\nWagener, who was a student of Greek and Latin, recommended the letters Pi Kappa Phi and their secret meaning as the official new name of the group. Simon proposed the design of the fraternity's pin, a black enamel diamond with the Greek letters \u03a0\u039a\u03a6 engraved in gold with a star and lamp as additional elements. Kroeg was selected as the new chapter's first president, which was termed \"[[Archon]]\", from the Greek term. He then began work on a constitution for chapter. The group quickly set out to recruit new members to its ranks.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\nOn December 10, 1905, the first anniversary of the fraternity's founding, Mixson's mother cooked the men a special dinner in her home to celebrate a successful first year as a fraternity. The fraternity celebrate that date as \"Founders Day\" with a dinner or a similar ceremony. In 1906 Mixson and Wagener wrote the fraternity's initiation ritual as the \"highest ideals of Christian manhood\".<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\n===Expansion===\nThat same year, the group was offered a charter from another U.S. fraternity. Instead, they chose to expand and create more Pi Kappa Phi chapters. A second chapter (\"Beta Chapter\") was formed at [[Presbyterian College]] on March 9, 1907. Due to a state law banning fraternities at state supported schools, Presbyterian College and the College of Charleston were the only two South Carolina schools where fraternities were allowed. A third chapter was formed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], which was the first chapter to obtain a house.\n\nKroeg developed \"Articles of Incorporation\" and the name Pi Kappa Phi became legally registered in the state of [[South Carolina]] on December 23, 1907.\n\nThe interest in Pi Kappa Phi within South Carolina was growing despite laws and policies banning fraternities. In 1909, Delta Chapter at [[Furman University]] formed and operated in secret until state laws changed, allowing fraternal organizations. In 1910, a charter was granted to Sigma Chapter at the [[University of South Carolina]] and the chapter was operated as the Sigma Club due to the laws banning fraternities.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\n===The ''Star and Lamp''===\n''The Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity Journal'' was begun in 1909, with Henry Wagener as editor. In 1911, the name was changed to the ''Star & Lamp''.<ref name=\"nonfraternity\"/>\n\n==Controversies==\nIn 2019, several members of the fraternity at [[Texas State University]] brutally attacked a fellow student they mistakenly assumed was a member of their rival fraternity on campus [[Phi Kappa Psi]], leaving him with a fractured skull and a traumatic brain injury.  As a result, the fraternity was placed on suspension, some members are facing criminal charges, and the attacked student filed a lawsuit against the fraternity.<ref>https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/us/texas-state-fraternity-arrest/index.html</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the fraternity at [[Central Michigan University]] was suspended indefinitely by the university for failure to adhere to previous sanctions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sheffield|first1=Paige|title=Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity suspended indefinitely|url=http://www.cm-life.com/article/2017/11/pi-kappa-phi|accessdate=December 15, 2017|work=Central Michigan Life|date=November 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2017, the Alpha chapter at the [[College of Charleston]] was suspended by the college following a probe investigating allegations of drug and alcohol use, hazing, and the alleged beating of a student.

It was found out that the fraternity hosted a large party with up to 70 people the night before. They discovered Daniels was a pledge and fraternity brothers forced him to drink large amounts of alcohol for initiation. Once he became sick, FIJI members carried him to a secluded room at the fraternity and left him. Daniels died in the early morning of January 8, 2006 from acute alcohol intoxication and later tests showed that Daniels had a blood-alcohol level of 0.34, more than four times the legal limit. The university suspended the chapter for 5 years and as of 2019, they are still inactive.<ref>[https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article193021704.html]</ref><ref>[https://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2006/01/danny_daniels_1.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.fresnostatenews.com/2006/01/24/fresno-state-bans-phi-gamma-delta-fraternitys-phi-chi-chapter-for-five-years/]</ref>\n\nOn September 17, 2010 a prospective member (pledge), Matt Fritzie, was partially paralyzed after diving into a shallow pool during a Fiji Islander party in Lawrence, Kansas.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rehab needed for hazing victim|url=http://cjonline.com/news/state/2010-09-29/rehab_needed_for_hazing_victim|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=Associated Press (Topeka Capital Journal)|date=29 September 2010}}</ref> In response to the incident, the [[University of Kansas]] placed the chapter on a two-year probation for hazing.<ref>{{cite news|title=KU alters policies on hazing after problems|url=http://www.kansas.com/2011/02/14/1719673/ku-alters-policies-on-hazing-after.html|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=Associated Press (Wichita Eagle)|date=14 February 2011}}</ref>  Fritzie has since sued both the chapter and the national organization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Diepenbrock |first=George |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2012/jan/27/lawsuit-filed-after-injury-fiji-party-moving-dougl/ |title=Lawsuit filed after injury at KU Fiji party moving to Douglas County |website=Ljworld.com |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140306035328/http://www.pitch.com/plog/archives/2011/01/03/matt-fritzie-sues-kus-fiji-fraternity-after-becoming-paralyzed-at-frat-party ]</ref>\n\nIn 2012, [[West Virginia University]] banned the fraternity in response to alcohol related hazing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Crum|first=Travis|title=WVU bans frat over alleged hazing|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201211270105|accessdate=9 April 2013|newspaper=West Virginia Gazette|date=27 November 2012}}</ref> The fraternity reinstated the chapter in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Haight|first1=Laura|title=FIJI reinstated after suspension|url=http://www.thedaonline.com/news/article_c93056f2-9ea2-11e3-b651-0017a43b2370.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|work=The Daily Athenaeum (West Virginia University)|date=25 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn April 4, 2014, Michael Evan Anderson, member of the [[University of Arizona]] chapter of FIJI died after an unsanctioned FIJI event, after falling {{convert|20|ft|sigfig=1}} from the top of an air conditioning unit onto the roof of his dormitory.

She contended that she would do so only if she knew the secrets behind the letters. The fraternity, after debate, declined to initiate her. So, upon suggestion of her father, Dr. John Wesley Locke, a [[Beta Theta Pi]], she formed Kappa Alpha Theta with Alice Allen, Bettie Tipton and Hannah Fitch; four of the small number of women enrolled at DePauw at the time. Kappa Alpha Theta was founded on January 27, 1870.
