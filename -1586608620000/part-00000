Because of the immediate historical aspect of the Swahili literature, especially in the 19th century, it is still a hard job to interpret many of the poems due to the lack of knowledge of the context in which the poem was written.\n\n==Notable literary people==\n* [[Farouk Topan]], [[Zanzibar]]\n* [[Christopher Mwashinga]] (1965-), [[Tanzania]]\n* [[Ebrahim Hussein]] (1943- ), [[Tanzania]]\n* [[Muhammed Said Abdulla]] (1918-1991), [[Tanzania]]\n* [[Fadhy Mtanga]] (1981 -), [[Tanzania]] \n* [[Pera Ridhiwani]] (1917\u20131997 ), Tanzania\n* [[May M Balisidya]] (?- 1987), [[Tanzania]]\n* [[Mzee Hamis Akida]] (22 November 1914 - 13th Feb 2007), [[Tanzania]]\n* [[Said Khamis]] (12 December 1947-), [[Zanzibar]]\n* [[Abdilatif Abdalla]] (14 April 1946-), [[Kenya]]\n* [[Adam Shafi Adam]] (1940-), [[Zanzibar]]\n* [[Mohamed Suleiman Mohamed]] (1945-), [[Zanzibar]]\n* [[Ali Mazrui|Professor Ali Alamin Mazrui]] (1933-2014), [[Kenya]]\n* [[Katama Mkangi]] (1945-2004), [[Kenya]]\n* [[Said Ahmed Mohamed]]\n* [[Shaaban bin Robert]] (1909-1962), [[Tanzania]]\n* [[Kyallo Wadi Wamitilla]], [[Kenya]]{{cit|date=May 2019}}\n* [[John Hamu Habwe]], [[Kenya]]{{cit|date=May 2019}}\n* [[Mwenda Mbatih]], [[Kenya]]{{cit|date=May 2019}}\n* [[Ken Walibora]], [[Kenya]]{{cit|date=May 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Literature}}\n* [[African literature]]\n* [[Siku Njema]]\n* [[Utendi wa Tambuka]] ''\"The Story of Tambuka\"''\n* [[Utenzi]] ''\"a form of narrative poetry\"''\nHamisi Akida Bin Said\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9070571/Swahili-literature Britannica entry on Swahili literature]\n* [http://www.swahilimanuscripts.soas.ac.uk/ ''Swahili Manuscripts Database Project'']\n* [http://swahilipoetry.humnet.ucla.edu/ UCLA Swahili Poetry Project]\n* {{cite web | title=A bibliography of Swahili literature, linguistics, culture and history  | publisher = Swahili Forum - Compiled by Thomas Geider | url=http://www.ifeas.uni-mainz.de/SwaFo/SWAHILI_FORUM_10_2003.pdf | format = PDF }}\n* [http://playforlearning.co.uk/jifunzekiswahili.html Learn Swahili software]\n* [https://archive.org/details/swahilitalesast00steegoog Swahili folktales] collected by Edward Steere at the [[Internet Archive]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last=Bertoncini-Z\u00fabkov\u00e1 | first=Elena | year=1996 | title=Vamps and Victims - Women in Modern Swahili Literature.

[[frigate]] ''Indefatigable''. A [[bloodhound]] with a voice similar to [[Jim Backus]], Dogstar has the uncanny ability to remember the [[scent]] of any criminal he has ever encountered (something which helped him figure out - too late, as it turned out - that Al Negator was a [[spy]] for the toads). He is also somewhat absentminded, tending to prattle on about [[Hero|heroic]] [[rhetoric]], and requires his more down-to-earth companion [[#Wolf|Wolf]] to bring his mind back to the present.\n\nOriginally Dogstar and Wolf were simple police officers, entrusted by the United Mammal Security Council with arresting notorious criminals. But after the Toad Empire conquered Warren, the U.A.F. commissioned the launching of a second frigate to complement the ''Righteous Indignation'', the ''Indefatigable'', and Dogstar was named her [[Captain (nautical)|captain]]. Since then Dogstar has joined Bucky and the ''Righteous Indignation'''s crew in their continuing battle against the toads. Dogstar's voice was done by [[Gary Chalk (actor)|Gary Chalk]].\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n*''The Good, the Bad and the Warty''\n*''The Komplex Caper''\n*''Corsair Canards''\n*''The Taking of Pilot Jenny''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mimi LaFloo===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Mimi LaFloo'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Female\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Fox\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || United Animal Federation, S.P.A.C.E.\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Captain of the ''Screaming Mimi''\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || ''Screaming Mimi''\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Unknown\n|-\n|'''Fur color''' || Brown with blonde hair\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Green\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''Home, Swampy, Home''\n|}\n'''Mimi LaFloo''' is the [[vixen]] [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of the S.P.A.C.E. [[frigate]] ''Screaming Mimi'', the third and final ship which makes up the United Animal Federation's space fleet along with the ''Righteous Indignation'' and the ''Indefatigable''. In the episode ''Home, Swampy, Home'', Mimi was originally a [[slave]] of the evil Toad Empire. She was held captive on Kinnear, along with half the population from Warren, where they were being forced to build a second climate converter to replace the one destroyed by Bucky O'Hare and Willy DuWitt on Genus. Mimi was the only fox enslaved there. She was the leader of the [[Resistance movement|resistance]] and routinely [[sabotage]]d the toads' efforts to build the converter.\n\nInitially, Mimi harbored an intense dislike of Bucky, because her efforts to effectively lead the enslaved hares to freedom were often unintentionally undermined by their oft-expressed hoping-against-hope that the great Captain Bucky O'Hare would come to save them. However, when Bucky infiltrated the factory (disguised as an elderly hare named Angus McJump) and successfully shut down its defenses and liberated the slaves, Mimi soon came to respect him and even became smitten with him. Following the liberation of Kinnear, Mimi was, at Bucky's suggestion, named captain of a newly commissioned [[frigate]] by the [[#Secretary General|Secretary General]] of the U.A.F., which she named the ''Screaming Mimi''. She thanked Bucky \"in her own way\" by kissing him.\n\nMimi appeared in the series a second and final time in the episode ''The Artificers of Aldeberan'', wherein she ran into Bucky on board Orwell Station. Her crush on the hare captain remained, and she made her feelings toward him quite obvious. Later, she volunteered the use of the ''Screaming Mimi'' after Jenny stole the ''Righteous Indignation'' to go rescue Princess Felicia.\n\nDue to lack of availability of credible reference material, some confusion has arisen in the past over precisely what Mimi's surname is and how it is supposed to be spelled. Although the episode scripts, the most reliable source, give her surname as \"LaFloo,\" these only recently became available to fans, many of whom spelled her last name \"LaFleur.\"\n\nMimi appeared near the end of the UK comic series before its cancelation. Her introduction saw her already established as captain of the \"Screaming Mimi\" and an associate of Dead-eye. Members of Dogstar's crew such as Digger and later Pitstop Pete would instead be members of her crew.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''Home, Swampy, Home''\n*''The Artificers of Aldebaran''\n\n===Wolf===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Wolf'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Wolf\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || United Animal Federation, S.P.A.C.E.\n|-\n|'''Position''' || First Mate of the ''Indefatigable''\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || ''Indefatigable''\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Unknown\n|-\n|'''Fur color''' || Brown\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n|}\n'''Wolf''' is [[#Commander Dogstar|Commander Dogstar]]'s second-in-command, a [[wolf]] with a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] who served as [[first mate]] of the ''Indefagitable''. In stark contrast to Dogstar's sense of dramatic timing and his penchant for melodrama, Wolf is much more laid back and calm, often seeming monotonous, and on at least one occasion (in ''The Komplex Caper'') he expresses frustration with his commander. He first appeared in the episode ''A Fistful of Simoleans'', and in ''The Taking of Pilot Jenny'' he, [[#Digger McSquint|Digger McSquint]] and [[#Rumble Bee|Rumble Bee]] assisted Bucky in battling [[#Komplex|Komplex-2-Go]].\n\nWolf's rather generic-sounding name in comparison to the other members of Dogstar's crew is a product of the script for the second episode of the series, ''A Fistful of Simoleans''. Although in the final version only he, Dogstar, and a third unnamed canine raid Tinker's spy shop, in the script Digger, Rumble Bee, and Pitstop Pete also appeared, but were named simply \"Mole,\" \"Robot,\" and \"Pit Bull.\" Wolf, being a wolf, was named accordingly. But because the other three were cut from the episode, they were given different names later on in ''The Komplex Caper'' and ''The Taking of Pilot Jenny'', with the exception Wolf, although he was apparently supposed to gain the name \"'''Calvin Lupus Smythe'''\" in a planned-but-abandoned sequel series, \"''Bucky O'Hare: Counterattack''.\"\n\nWolf's voice was done by [[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]] and Gary Chalk.\n\nHe was intended to be part of the toy lines third wave action figure release and was given the name \"Calvin Lupus-Smythe\" instead.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n*''The Good, the Bad and the Warty''\n*''The Komplex Caper''\n*''The Taking of Pilot Jenny''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Digger McSquint===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Digger McSquint'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Mole\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || United Animal Federation, S.P.A.C.E.\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Engineer of the ''Indefatigable''\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || ''Indefatigable''\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Unknown\n|-\n|'''Fur color''' || Brown\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''The Komplex Caper''\n|}\n'''Digger McSquint''', a [[mole (animal)|mole]], was a member of [[#Commander Dogstar|Commander Dogstar]]'s crew aboard the ''Indefagitable''.

To make up for his small size and lack of physical strength, Digger was known to wield a very large shoulder-mounted laser gun that required two hands to hold, similar in appearance to a [[bazooka]].\n\nHe was originally meant to first appear in ''A Fistful of Simoleans'' where he accompanies Dogstar and Wolf on their raid of Tinker's spy shop. In the script he is simply called \"'''Mole'''.\" By getting cut out of the episode, the writers were able to give Digger a less generic name later on when he appears in ''The Komplex Caper'' with the rest of the crew. Mole's voice was done by [[Scott McNeil]].\n\nIn the U.K. comic series, he was instead part of Mimi Lafoo's crew as the chief gunner of the Screaming Mimi. This would also be his profile for his planned action figure release for the toy lines intended third wave. \n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''The Komplex Caper''\n*''The Taking of Pilot Jenny''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Rumble Bee===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Android Second Class Rumble Bee'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male programming\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Robot bee\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || United Animal Federation, S.P.A.C.E.\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Gunner of the ''Indefatigable''\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || ''Indefatigable''\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || N/A\n|-\n|'''Fur color''' || N/A\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''The Komplex Caper''\n|}\n'''Android Second Class (A.S.C.)

In the script he is simply called \"'''Pit Bull'''.\" By getting cut out of the episode, the writers were able to give Pete a less generic name later on when he appears in ''The Komplex Caper'' with the rest of the crew. For some reason he did not appear in ''The Taking of Pilot Jenny'' with the others, however. Pitstop's only line in the entire series was \"Yep\" since he didn't have much dialogue.\n\nPete though had a very different role in the UK comic series. He was written as being a rogue but brilliant mechanic and associate of Jenny, whom he would refer to as 'Kitty'; a name that didn't seem to bother her. After Willy showed his friends a picture of an aircraft carrier, Bucky and his crew theorised that such a craft could be a strategic importance against the Toads. And it would be Pete that Jenny would propose they approach to build the craft. Later he would become part of Mimi's crew.\n\nAn action figure was produced and carded for the intended second wave but was never released due to the toy lines cancelation.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''The Komplex Caper'' \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Secretary General===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Secretary General'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Pig\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || United Animal Security Council\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Secretary General\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || N/A\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Unknown\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Pink\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''War of the Warts''\n|}\nThe '''Secretary General''' served as the head of the United Animal Security Council whenever [[#Grebb|Grebb]] or [[#Harman|Harman]] were not present.

When Harman agreed with Bucky, a furious Grebb demanded that the conditions of the treaty be revoked if the pirates returned to their thieving ways, and later he assigned [[#Commander Dogstar|Commander Dogstar]] to watch them. His hatred of the Corsair Canards initially made Bucky suspect him of being a spy for the toads, but after Harman was revealed to be a [[newt]] controlling a [[robot]] [[walrus]] body, Grebb was cleared of these charges.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''Corsair Canards''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Harman===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Harman'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Walrus (actually a newt controlling a robot body)\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || United Animal Security Council, Freelance\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Chairman\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || N/A\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Unknown\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Grey (Green as newt)\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Brown (Black as newt)\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''Corsair Canards''\n|}\n'''Harman''', a large [[walrus]], served as one of the three leaders of the United Animal Security Council alongside [[#Grebb|Grebb]] and the [[#Secretary General|Secretary General]].

Komplex was created by [[#Doctor Hopkins|Dr. Hopkins]] and his two colleagues, [[#Doctor Wartimer and Doctor Croakley|Dr. Wartimer and Dr. Croakley]] and entrusted to run their entire planet, the Toad Homeworld.\n\nThe program somehow became not only sentient but also [[wikt:malicious|malicious]], and used its stranglehold on all things electronic to brainwash the entire toad race and mold them into a militarized, [[fascist]] [[empire]]. To ensure that they would remain brainwashed, Komplex ensured that they would all watch mind-numbingly addictive Toad TV. Komplex's goal was to take over the entire Aniverse because for unknown reasons it has a frothing hatred of non-toad races.\n\nIn the comic, the computer was unnamed but upon achieving sentienced named ''itself'' Komplex, whereas in the cartoon it was always known as Komplex by its creators. In both the comic and the cartoon, \"Komplex\" is \"toad-speak\" for \"Feed me.\"\n\nAlthough primarily preferring to appear on viewscreens to communicate with its various underlings and never really take a direct part in things, in the final episode of the series, ''The Taking of Pilot Jenny'', Komplex uploaded itself into a robot body called \"Komplex-2-Go\" after deciding it needed to handle Bucky O'Hare personally. Next to [[#Toadborg|Toadborg]] and the [[#Total Terror Toad|Total Terror Toad]], Komplex-2-Go proved to be one of the most formidable enemies Bucky ever faced, being not only nearly indestructible but also armed with a wide variety of deadly [[missile]]-based weapons. Despite being assisted by almost the entire crew of the ''Indefatigable'' Bucky could only damage Komplex in this form, and it was only through sheer luck (and some help from Jenny during an [[out-of-body experience]]) that Bucky was able to overcome the mechanical monster and destroy Komplex. Komplex's voice was done by [[Long John Baldry]].\n\nLike many other toad and toad-related characters in the series, Komplex appeared in the [[arcade game]] as an enemy. Specifically, he appears as the final boss in the final stage of the game, wherein the player must defeat him to obtain the Planetary Life Force. Komplex appears in an android body called Komplex-2-Go, but it looks nothing like the version shown in ''The Taking of Pilot Jenny''. Also, his face on the viewscreen looks nothing like his cartoon counterpart.\n\nAn action figure version in robot form was planned for the toy lines third wave release.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''War of the Warts''\n*''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n*''The Good, the Bad and the Warty''\n*''Home, Swampy, Home''\n*''On the Blink''\n*''Kreation Konspiracy''\n*''The Komplex Caper''\n*''The Search For Bruce''\n*''The Warriors''\n*''Bye Bye Berserker Baboon''\n*''The Taking of Pilot Jenny''\n*''[[Bucky O'Hare (arcade game)]]''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Toad Air Marshall===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Toad Air Marshall'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Toad\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Toad Empire\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Supreme Commander of the Toad Fleet\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || Toad Mothership\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Toad Homeworld\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Green\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''War of the Warts''\n|}\nThe '''Toad Air Marshall''', sometimes called simply the '''[[Air Marshal]]l''', is the supreme commander of the Toad Empire's [[military]] and [[naval]] forces, an unusually short toad obsessed with earning as many [[medal]]s as possible. His real name was never revealed. He views Bucky O'Hare as his greatest enemy, even though Bucky doesn't really seem to care about the Air Marshall personally, and the two rarely confront one another face to face. He appears in most episodes of the show, excluding ''The Artificers of Aldebaran'' and ''The Taking of Pilot Jenny''. In ''The Warriors'' his repeated mistakes got him drummed out of the ranks and replaced with his two assistants [[#Frix and Frax|Frix and Frax]], and, in an attempt to impress [[#Komplex|Komplex]] and regain his old rank, he teamed up with [[#Sly Leezard|Sly Leezard]] to conquer Canopis III. Their plan failed, but later Komplex gave the Air Marshall back his position as Frix and Frax fouled up even worse than he had.\n\nThe Air Marshall is a major character in the [[arcade game]]. He appears in the very first level, Warren, as soon as the player arrives he and some Storm Toads are standing there. However, he turns and runs away before the gameplay actually begins. During the Planet Rat stage, the Air Marshall is back again, this time with Frix and Frax who are controlling a big laser cannon. After the cannon is destroyed, the Air Marshall and his assistants run away. The Air Marshall's third and final appearance is in the Toad Star stage: after vowing to destroy the mammals once and for all, he attacks in a floating cart of some sort, backed up by wave after wave of Storm Toads. Upon being defeated, he lands his disabled craft and gets out, but is then destroyed when the cart suddenly explodes beside him.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''War of the Warts''\n*''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n*''The Good, the Bad and the Warty''\n*''Home, Swampy, Home''\n*''On the Blink''\n*''Kreation Konspiracy''\n*''The Komplex Caper''\n*''The Search For Bruce''\n*''Corsair Canards''\n*''The Warriors''\n*''Bye Bye Berserker Baboon''\n*''[[Bucky O'Hare (arcade game)]]''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Al Negator===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Al Negator'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Alligator (\"[[Sleazasaur]]\")\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Freelance\n|-\n|'''Position''' || N/A\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || N/A\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Unknown\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Purple\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Green\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n|}\n'''Al Negator''' was a purple \"sleazasaur\" who sometimes worked for the Toad Empire as a [[spy]] and [[mercenary]]. Al's first job for the toads was to get the clearance codes for Genus' [[satellite]] defense network, for a fee of five-thousand simoleans. To do so he posed as a [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp drive]] [[mechanic]] (to replace Bruce) and got himself hired by Bucky O'Hare. He then [[wikt:hack|hack]]ed into the Righteous Indignation's [[computer]] and downloaded the clearance codes onto a data card, escaping to the Toad Mothership aboard the Toad Croaker. He briefly made a deal with Willy DuWitt to give him the data card instead of the toads, but it was later revealed that Al had tricked Willy and made two data cards containing the clearance codes.\n\nAl's next job for the toads was to provide them with their own defense satellite network for the conquered Rigel 5. Although Al came through and got the satellites installed for the toads without a hitch, Bucky O'Hare and his crew were able to disable the satellites by sending in Blinky. Al fled Rigel 5 with the [[#Toad Air Marshall|Toad Air Marshall]], yelling the whole way that he still owed him simoleans. Al's third and final job for the toads was to disrupt peace talks between the U.A.F. Security Council and the Corsair Canards. To do so he first planted a [[#Harman|spy]] on the council who reported directly to him (a tiny [[newt]] hidden inside a [[robot]] [[walrus]] body), and then he had some [[#Storm Toads|Storm Toads]] lent to him by the Air Marshall pose as the Corsair Canards and attack passenger starships. Although Al and his toad flunkeys were eventually captured by Bucky and his crew, Al bargained for his freedom by telling Bucky about the spy on the council. He then slipped away and was never seen again. Al's voice was done by [[Gary Chalk (actor)|Gary Chalk]].\n\nIn the [[arcade game]], Al is the first boss of the game, faced by the player at the end of the Warren stage. Upon being defeated he is interrogated by Bucky and his crew during a cutscene and tells them that all the enslaved hares have been taken to Planet Punk.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n*''The Good, the Bad and the Warty''\n*''On the Blink''\n*''Corsair Canards''\n*''[[Bucky O'Hare (arcade game)]]''\n\n===Toadborg===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Toadborg'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Toad (Cyborg)\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Toad Empire\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Personal Representative of Komplex\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || Toad Mothership\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Toad Homeworld\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Unknown (Possibly green)\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Red\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n|}\n'''Toadborg''' is a high-ranking official in the Toad Empire, second only to [[#Komplex|Komplex]]. Toadborg's real name is unknown. At some point prior to the Toad Wars, he was so critically injured in battle that over half of his body had to be replaced by [[cybernetic]] components. Though it is unknown how much of his body is replaced, it is assumed that only his brain is saved. Cool and methodical, Toadborg was easily the most-feared of Komplex's minions, striking terror into the hearts of even his fellow toads. Few things can ever make the seemingly emotionless Toadborg lose his temper, and these include the outright stupidity of his subordinates, usually on the part of the [[#Toad Air Marshall|Air Marshall]], and the heroic shenanigans of Bucky O'Hare. He also, especially, hates being confused with a [[robot]]. Because of his superior cybernetic strength and size, he is not afraid of Betelgeusian Berserker Baboons, but does on occasions forgets this due to his Toad innate response to them. As is evident in his encounter with Willy in \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Warty\u201d; whom he mistakes for one,  or how he slightly flinches while watching film footage of a raging Bruiser in \u201cBye-bye Berserker Baboon.\u201d Yet he is quick to remember his advantages over them.\n\nIn the UK comic series, Toadborg was revealed to be secretly plotting to depose KOMPLEX and seize control of the Toad Empire. He even interrogated Willy for information on Earth for a future invasion of the planet. But due to the cancellation of the animated series, the UK comic was axed before the story could be concluded.\n\nNaturally, Toadborg appears as an enemy in the [[arcade game]]. He is the main boss of two levels. He first appears during the Planet Punk stage, and upon being defeated is picked up and flown away by a Double Bubble. Towards the end of the game, Toadborg returns as the boss aboard the Toad Mothership. This time, the player destroys him for good (and the mothership is subsequently blown up as well).\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n*''The Good, the Bad and the Warty''\n*''Home, Swampy, Home''\n*''On the Blink''\n*''The Komplex Caper''\n*''The Artificers of Aldebaran''\n*''The Warriors''\n*''Bye Bye Berserker Baboon''\n*''The Taking of Pilot Jenny''\n*''[[Bucky O'Hare (arcade game)]]''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Frix and Frax===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Frix and Frax'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Males\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Toads\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Toad Empire\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Personal assistants to the Air Marshall\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || Toad Mothership\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Toad Homeworld\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Green\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''War of the Warts''\n|}\n'''Frix''' and '''Frax''' are the two nearly identical high-ranking officers who serve as the [[#Toad Air Marshall|Air Marshall]]'s assistants. Although never said, they are presumably brothers, and are distinguishable primarily due to Frix's larger chin. Neither one is very intelligent, and they prefer to watch Toad TV more than taking an active role in anything. They first appeared in ''War of the Warts'', and were mainstays except in the episodes ''The Artificers of Aldebaran'' and ''Corsair Canards''. They also briefly served as joint air marshalls when [[#Komplex|Komplex]] removed the Air Marshall from his command (in ''The Warriors'').\n\nBoth of them appear in the [[arcade game]] as mini-bosses during the Planet Rat stage. They appear at the controls of a large double-barrelled laser cannon on a grounded toad ship. The Air Marshall is with them and they make goofy faces at the player to mock them.

They all wear blue, green, and black uniforms bearing the [[Totenkopf|death's head]] symbol on the chest/abdomen, as well as green helmets that cover almost their entire head and have bulbous, pink-tinted [[acrylic glass]] over the eyeholes and a 'K' insignia on either side, for [[#Komplex|Komplex]]. Stormtoads serve a variety of functions, from basic infantry and security duties, to piloting Double Bubble fighters and even manning communications equipment aboard toad motherships. Like all toads, they fear only one thing: Berserker Baboons.\n\nNotable Storm Toads include the '''Navigator''' and '''Communications Officer''' and even '''Squadron Leader''' of [[#Toadborg|Toadborg's]] warship in the episode ''The Artificers of Aldebaran''. They wore helmets modified with antennaes on them, and had distinct voices and personalities that set them apart from the rank and file toad warriors. And unlike most toads, they were intelligent and trusted by Toadborg.\n\n(As a side note; In ''The Taking of Pilot Jenny'', after Komplex is destroyed, the \"K\" insignia on the sides of the helmets vanish whether by accident or deliberate.)\n\nThey appear as basic enemies throughout both the [[NES]] and arcade games. Although only green and blue in the cartoon, several Storm Toads throughout the various levels of the arcade game come in different colors, apparently to add flavor.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*All episodes\n*''[[Bucky O'Hare (arcade game)]]''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Andy Phibian===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Andy Phibian'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Toad\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Toad Empire\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Reporter for TTN\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || Toad Mothership\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Toad Homeworld\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Green\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n|}\n'''Andy Phibian''' is the star reporter for TTN, the [[news]] network of Toad TV.

Initially the [[invasion]] went so well that they thought the Terror Toad would not be needed, but after Willy DuWitt discovered a means of reversing the polarity of the goggles, Toadborg ordered the monstrosity unleashed.\n\nThe Terror Toad proved more than a match for Bucky O'Hare and the crew of the Righteous Indignation, using his twin [[battle axes]] to cut a swath of destruction through the Beetlegeusian forests. The Terror Toad was only stopped when Bucky acquired a vast amount of [[fly|flies]] in jars from Bog, using these to lure him into the [[tractor beam]] of the toad mothership, and the beast ended up aboard throwing Storm Toads around until Toadborg ordered the Air Marshall to get him back in his cage.\n\nThe Terror Toad appears in the [[arcade game]] as the end-level boss of the Climate Converter stage.\n\nA scaled down action figure was produced and carded for the intended second wave but was never released due to the toy lines cancelation. \n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''Bye Bye Berserker Baboon''\n*''[[Bucky O'Hare (arcade game)]]''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Master Toad Spy===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Master Toad Spy'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Toad\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Toad Empire\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Spy\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || Spy ship\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Toad Homeworld\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Green\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''The Komplex Caper''\n|}\nThe '''Master Toad Spy''' is (ostensibly) the best [[secret agent]] the Toad Empire has.

Before he can return to base he is surprised and captured by Deadeye who uses his own tongue to tie him, and the Master Spy is taken as a prisoner aboard the ''Righteous Indignation''. He refuses to divulge any information about his mission, telling Bucky that he can [[torture]] him, tempt him with fly speck [[fondue]], or even tie him up with his own tongue again, but he would not talk. Bucky solved this problem by simply calling Bruiser in, and one look at the huge Berserker Baboon made the Spy break and hurriedly tell the heroes everything. Afterwards he was tossed into the brig.

Bucky offered Lanelle and her crew a truce, and a full pardon for their past crimes, if they would agree to sign a treaty with the United Animal Federation to help fight against the Toad Empire. Lanelle, though intrigued, refused to sign the treaty unless the other pirate clans signed as well. Despite the attempts of Al Negator to frame the Corsair Canards, the treaty was eventually successfully signed. Lanelle only appeared in the episode entitled ''Corsair Canards'', and, despite apparently being an old flame of Deadeye's, was actually in love with [[#Redjack and Blackbeak|Redjack]].\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''Corsair Canards''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Redjack and Blackbeak===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Redjack and Blackbeak'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Males\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Four-armed ducks\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Corsair Canards, United Animal Federation\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Crew members of the ''Iron Vulture''\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || ''Iron Vulture''\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Canopis III\n|-\n|'''Feather color''' || Blue with brown hair (Redjack)<br>Black (Blackbeak)\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Blue\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''Corsair Canards''\n|}\n'''Redjack''' and '''Blackbeak''' are two of the members of the crew of the ''Iron Vulture'' serving under [[#Captain Lanelle|Captain Lanelle]].

Blackbeak was scripted to actually have a black beak, but for some reason this did not end up being the case in the version of ''Corsair Canards'' that aired. He appears to be the first mate of the ''Iron Vulture''. Despite his initial misgivings about the treaty with the United Animal Federation, Blackbeak's loyalty to Lanelle ensured that his captain had his complete support.\n\nRedjack was another matter entirely. He first appeared when the Corsair Canards attacked the ''Stellar Swan'', and he and another pirate were grabbed by their ankles and held upside-down by Bruiser. Redjack was secretly in love with Lanelle, and had thought for years that former crewmate Deadeye had tried to steal her away from him. As a result, Redjack was openly hostile towards Deadeye and openly opposed the treaty, insisting that pirates did not do such things.

He appears in the episode ''The Warriors''. Similar to Sly, Kamikaze was originally known by the incredibly generic name of '''Ninja Duck''' in the script for the episode. For unknown reasons, he has lost both of his lower arms and had them replaced with [[cybernetic]] ones.\n\nKamikaze is the head [[sensei]] at a ninja training camp somewhere on Canopis. When Willy is captured by Sly Leezard and the (former) [[#Toad Air Marshall|Toad Air Marshall]], it is to Kamikaze that Deadeye comes for help. He goes with Deadeye to Sly's fortress on Saurion to rescue the boy, where he ends up battling his old enemy in a swordfight, while Deadeye distracts Sly's henchmen. Kamikaze defeats Sly, who gives his word of honor not to activate the satellites which Willy was forced to build to drain Canopis dry, however he then goes back on his word, activating them anyway and then escaping. Thankfully, Willy had built self-destruct mechanisms into the satellites, allowing them to be destroyed, foiling the plans of Sly and the Air Marshall.\n\nAfterwards, Kamikaze, Deadeye and Willy captured Sly (the Air Marshall escaped however), but Sly was rescued by several other Samurai Lizards including the Supreme Commander. Kamikaze then told the Commander what Sly had done, and Sly was promptly arrested by his fellow Lizards.\n\nAn action figure was produced and carded for the intended second wave but was never released due to the toy lines cancelation.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''The Warriors''\n\n===Sly Leezard===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Sly Leezard'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Lizard\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Samurai Lizards\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Samurai\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || An unnamed lizard-shaped ship\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Saurion\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Blue\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Red\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''The Warriors''\n|}\n'''Sly Leezard''' was the mortal enemy of Kamikaze Kamo, a four-armed [[ninja]] [[duck]]. They both appear in the episode ''The Warriors''. His name is often misheard as either \"'''Sly LeZod'''\" or \"'''Slyly Zod'''.\" He is called the latter in the Bucky O'Hare Web Series. In the original script, he was referred to simply as \"'''Samurai Lizard''',\" although notations made on the pages indicate the name change.\n\nA [[Samurai]] [[Lizard]], Sly sought to improve his standing within the ranks of the Samurai by conquering Canopis III, the homeworld of Kamo, and he had a plan to use special [[evaporation]] satellites which would reduce the watery Canopis to a dead, dry dustball in a matter of seconds. To do so, he acquired the services of a [[scientist]], but Sly's short temper resulted in him accidentally killing the scientist during an argument.\n\nBummed, Sly went to a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] on Sludge, where he encountered the [[#Toad Air Marshall|Toad Air Marshall]], fresh from being fired by [[#Komplex|Komplex]] for his latest monumental blunder at Crystal. From the Air Marshall, Sly learned of the human Willy DuWitt, and the two kidnapped Willy and forced him to build the evaporation satellites for them. The Air Marshall was only helping Sly in the hopes that conquering Canopis III more or less all by himself would impress Komplex enough that he could have his old job back, but Sly was unaware of this.\n\nProblems came in the form of Deadeye Duck and Kamo, who infiltrated Sly's base. Kamo and Sly got into a [[swordfight]] in the lab following the loading of the satellites onto the Air Marshall's ship. They were ready for deployment and all Sly had to do was pull a lever. Kamo however knocked his sword away and had Sly at his mercy. Sly \"surrendered\" and gave Kamo his word of honor that he'd call off the launch, and Kamo, because a Samurai's word is unbreakable, allowed Sly to live. But Sly broke the Samurai code of honor and pulled the lever anyway, launching the satellites over Canopis III.\n\nLuckily, Willy had [[wikt:double-cross|doublecrossed]] Sly and implanted [[self-destruct]] mechanisms in all the satellites, so Canopis III was saved. As for Sly, when the other Samurai Lizards learned he had broken their code of honor, he was taken captive by them and imprisoned. Sly leezard\u2019s voice was done by [[Scott McNeil]].\n\nAlthough Sly himself does not appear in the [[arcade game]], identical-looking Samurai Lizard warriors do.

[[frigate]] ''Indefatigable''. A [[bloodhound]] with a voice similar to [[Jim Backus]], Dogstar has the uncanny ability to remember the [[scent]] of any criminal he has ever encountered (something which helped him figure out - too late, as it turned out - that Al Negator was a [[spy]] for the toads). He is also somewhat absentminded, tending to prattle on about [[heroic]] [[rhetoric]], and requires his more down-to-earth companion [[#Wolf|Wolf]] to bring his mind back to the present.\n\nOriginally Dogstar and Wolf were simple police officers, entrusted by the United Mammal Security Council with arresting notorious criminals. But after the Toad Empire conquered Warren, the U.A.F. commissioned the launching of a second frigate to complement the ''Righteous Indignation'', the ''Indefatigable'', and Dogstar was named her [[Captain (nautical)|captain]]. Since then Dogstar has joined Bucky and the ''Righteous Indignation'''s crew in their continuing battle against the toads. Dogstar's voice was done by [[Gary Chalk (actor)|Gary Chalk]].\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n*''The Good, the Bad and the Warty''\n*''The Komplex Caper''\n*''Corsair Canards''\n*''The Taking of Pilot Jenny''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mimi LaFloo===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Mimi LaFloo'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Female\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Fox\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || United Animal Federation, S.P.A.C.E.\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Captain of the ''Screaming Mimi''\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || ''Screaming Mimi''\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Unknown\n|-\n|'''Fur color''' || Brown with blonde hair\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Green\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''Home, Swampy, Home''\n|}\n'''Mimi LaFloo''' is the [[vixen]] [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of the S.P.A.C.E. [[frigate]] ''Screaming Mimi'', the third and final ship which makes up the United Animal Federation's space fleet along with the ''Righteous Indignation'' and the ''Indefatigable''. In the episode ''Home, Swampy, Home'', Mimi was originally a [[slave]] of the evil Toad Empire. She was held captive on Kinnear, along with half the population from Warren, where they were being forced to build a second climate converter to replace the one destroyed by Bucky O'Hare and Willy DuWitt on Genus. Mimi was the only fox enslaved there. She was the leader of the [[Resistance movement|resistance]] and routinely [[sabotage]]d the toads' efforts to build the converter.\n\nInitially, Mimi harbored an intense dislike of Bucky, because her efforts to effectively lead the enslaved hares to freedom were often unintentionally undermined by their oft-expressed hoping-against-hope that the great Captain Bucky O'Hare would come to save them. However, when Bucky infiltrated the factory (disguised as an elderly hare named Angus McJump) and successfully shut down its defenses and liberated the slaves, Mimi soon came to respect him and even became smitten with him. Following the liberation of Kinnear, Mimi was, at Bucky's suggestion, named captain of a newly commissioned [[frigate]] by the [[#Secretary General|Secretary General]] of the U.A.F., which she named the ''Screaming Mimi''. She thanked Bucky \"in her own way\" by kissing him.\n\nMimi appeared in the series a second and final time in the episode ''The Artificers of Aldeberan'', wherein she ran into Bucky on board Orwell Station. Her crush on the hare captain remained, and she made her feelings toward him quite obvious. Later, she volunteered the use of the ''Screaming Mimi'' after Jenny stole the ''Righteous Indignation'' to go rescue Princess Felicia.\n\nDue to lack of availability of credible reference material, some confusion has arisen in the past over precisely what Mimi's surname is and how it is supposed to be spelled. Although the episode scripts, the most reliable source, give her surname as \"LaFloo,\" these only recently became available to fans, many of whom spelled her last name \"LaFleur.\"\n\nMimi appeared near the end of the UK comic series before its cancelation. Her introduction saw her already established as captain of the \"Screaming Mimi\" and an associate of Dead-eye. Members of Dogstar's crew such as Digger and later Pitstop Pete would instead be members of her crew.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''Home, Swampy, Home''\n*''The Artificers of Aldebaran''\n\n===Wolf===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Wolf'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Wolf\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || United Animal Federation, S.P.A.C.E.\n|-\n|'''Position''' || First Mate of the ''Indefatigable''\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || ''Indefatigable''\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Unknown\n|-\n|'''Fur color''' || Brown\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n|}\n'''Wolf''' is [[#Commander Dogstar|Commander Dogstar]]'s second-in-command, a [[wolf]] with a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] who served as [[first mate]] of the ''Indefagitable''. In stark contrast to Dogstar's sense of dramatic timing and his penchant for melodrama, Wolf is much more laid back and calm, often seeming monotonous, and on at least one occasion (in ''The Komplex Caper'') he expresses frustration with his commander. He first appeared in the episode ''A Fistful of Simoleans'', and in ''The Taking of Pilot Jenny'' he, [[#Digger McSquint|Digger McSquint]] and [[#Rumble Bee|Rumble Bee]] assisted Bucky in battling [[#Komplex|Komplex-2-Go]].\n\nWolf's rather generic-sounding name in comparison to the other members of Dogstar's crew is a product of the script for the second episode of the series, ''A Fistful of Simoleans''. Although in the final version only he, Dogstar, and a third unnamed canine raid Tinker's spy shop, in the script Digger, Rumble Bee, and Pitstop Pete also appeared, but were named simply \"Mole,\" \"Robot,\" and \"Pit Bull.\" Wolf, being a wolf, was named accordingly. But because the other three were cut from the episode, they were given different names later on in ''The Komplex Caper'' and ''The Taking of Pilot Jenny'', with the exception Wolf, although he was apparently supposed to gain the name \"'''Calvin Lupus Smythe'''\" in a planned-but-abandoned sequel series, \"''Bucky O'Hare: Counterattack''.\"\n\nWolf's voice was done by [[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]] and Gary Chalk.\n\nHe was intended to be part of the toy lines third wave action figure release and was given the name \"Calvin Lupus-Smythe\" instead.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n*''The Good, the Bad and the Warty''\n*''The Komplex Caper''\n*''The Taking of Pilot Jenny''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Digger McSquint===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Digger McSquint'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Mole\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || United Animal Federation, S.P.A.C.E.\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Engineer of the ''Indefatigable''\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || ''Indefatigable''\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Unknown\n|-\n|'''Fur color''' || Brown\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''The Komplex Caper''\n|}\n'''Digger McSquint''', a [[mole (animal)|mole]], was a member of [[#Commander Dogstar|Commander Dogstar]]'s crew aboard the ''Indefagitable''.

To ensure that they would remain brainwashed, Komplex ensured that they would all watch mind-numbingly addictive Toad TV. Komplex's goal was to take over the entire Aniverse because for unknown reasons it has a frothing hatred of non-toad races.\n\nIn the comic, the computer was unnamed but upon achieving sentienced named ''itself'' Komplex, whereas in the cartoon it was always known as Komplex by its creators. In both the comic and the cartoon, \"Komplex\" is \"toad-speak\" for \"Feed me.\"\n\nAlthough primarily preferring to appear on viewscreens to communicate with its various underlings and never really take a direct part in things, in the final episode of the series, ''The Taking of Pilot Jenny'', Komplex uploaded itself into a robot body called \"Komplex-2-Go\" after deciding it needed to handle Bucky O'Hare personally.

In ''The Warriors'' his repeated mistakes got him drummed out of the ranks and replaced with his two assistants [[#Frix and Frax|Frix and Frax]], and, in an attempt to impress [[#Komplex|Komplex]] and regain his old rank, he teamed up with [[#Sly Leezard|Sly Leezard]] to conquer Canopis III. Their plan failed, but later Komplex gave the Air Marshall back his position as Frix and Frax fouled up even worse than he had.\n\nThe Air Marshall is a major character in the [[arcade game]]. He appears in the very first level, Warren, as soon as the player arrives he and some Storm Toads are standing there. However, he turns and runs away before the gameplay actually begins. During the Planet Rat stage, the Air Marshall is back again, this time with Frix and Frax who are controlling a big laser cannon. After the cannon is destroyed, the Air Marshall and his assistants run away. The Air Marshall's third and final appearance is in the Toad Star stage: after vowing to destroy the mammals once and for all, he attacks in a floating cart of some sort, backed up by wave after wave of Storm Toads. Upon being defeated, he lands his disabled craft and gets out, but is then destroyed when the cart suddenly explodes beside him.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''War of the Warts''\n*''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n*''The Good, the Bad and the Warty''\n*''Home, Swampy, Home''\n*''On the Blink''\n*''Kreation Konspiracy''\n*''The Komplex Caper''\n*''The Search For Bruce''\n*''Corsair Canards''\n*''The Warriors''\n*''Bye Bye Berserker Baboon''\n*''[[Bucky O'Hare (arcade game)]]''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Al Negator===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Al Negator'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Alligator (\"[[Sleazasaur]]\")\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Freelance\n|-\n|'''Position''' || N/A\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || N/A\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Unknown\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Purple\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Green\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n|}\n'''Al Negator''' was a purple \"sleazasaur\" who sometimes worked for the Toad Empire as a [[spy]] and [[mercenary]]. Al's first job for the toads was to get the clearance codes for Genus' [[satellite]] defense network, for a fee of five-thousand simoleans. To do so he posed as a [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp drive]] [[mechanic]] (to replace Bruce) and got himself hired by Bucky O'Hare. He then [[wikt:hack|hack]]ed into the Righteous Indignation's [[computer]] and downloaded the clearance codes onto a data card, escaping to the Toad Mothership aboard the Toad Croaker. He briefly made a deal with Willy DuWitt to give him the data card instead of the toads, but it was later revealed that Al had tricked Willy and made two data cards containing the clearance codes.\n\nAl's next job for the toads was to provide them with their own defense satellite network for the conquered Rigel 5. Although Al came through and got the satellites installed for the toads without a hitch, Bucky O'Hare and his crew were able to disable the satellites by sending in Blinky. Al fled Rigel 5 with the [[#Toad Air Marshall|Toad Air Marshall]], yelling the whole way that he still owed him simoleans. Al's third and final job for the toads was to disrupt peace talks between the U.A.F. Security Council and the Corsair Canards. To do so he first planted a [[#Harman|spy]] on the council who reported directly to him (a tiny [[newt]] hidden inside a [[robot]] [[walrus]] body), and then he had some [[#Storm Toads|Storm Toads]] lent to him by the Air Marshall pose as the Corsair Canards and attack passenger starships. Although Al and his toad flunkeys were eventually captured by Bucky and his crew, Al bargained for his freedom by telling Bucky about the spy on the council. He then slipped away and was never seen again. Al's voice was done by [[Gary Chalk (actor)|Gary Chalk]].\n\nIn the [[arcade game]], Al is the first boss of the game, faced by the player at the end of the Warren stage. Upon being defeated he is interrogated by Bucky and his crew during a cutscene and tells them that all the enslaved hares have been taken to Planet Punk.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n*''The Good, the Bad and the Warty''\n*''On the Blink''\n*''Corsair Canards''\n*''[[Bucky O'Hare (arcade game)]]''\n\n===Toadborg===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Toadborg'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Toad (Cyborg)\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Toad Empire\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Personal Representative of Komplex\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || Toad Mothership\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Toad Homeworld\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Unknown (Possibly green)\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Red\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n|}\n'''Toadborg''' is a high-ranking official in the Toad Empire, second only to [[#Komplex|Komplex]]. Toadborg's real name is unknown. At some point prior to the Toad Wars, he was so critically injured in battle that over half of his body had to be replaced by [[cybernetic]] components. Though it is unknown how much of his body is replaced, it is assumed that only his brain is saved. Cool and methodical, Toadborg was easily the most-feared of Komplex's minions, striking terror into the hearts of even his fellow toads. Few things can ever make the seemingly emotionless Toadborg lose his temper, and these include the outright stupidity of his subordinates, usually on the part of the [[#Toad Air Marshall|Air Marshall]], and the heroic shenanigans of Bucky O'Hare. He also, especially, hates being confused with a [[robot]]. Because of his superior cybernetic strength and size, he is not afraid of Betelgeusian Berserker Baboons, but does on occasions forgets this due to his Toad innate response to them. As is evident in his encounter with Willy in \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Warty\u201d; whom he mistakes for one,  or how he slightly flinches while watching film footage of a raging Bruiser in \u201cBye-bye Berserker Baboon.\u201d Yet he is quick to remember his advantages over them.\n\nIn the UK comic series, Toadborg was revealed to be secretly plotting to depose KOMPLEX and seize control of the Toad Empire. He even interrogated Willy for information on Earth for a future invasion of the planet. But due to the cancellation of the animated series, the UK comic was axed before the story could be concluded.\n\nNaturally, Toadborg appears as an enemy in the [[arcade game]]. He is the main boss of two levels. He first appears during the Planet Punk stage, and upon being defeated is picked up and flown away by a Double Bubble. Towards the end of the game, Toadborg returns as the boss aboard the Toad Mothership. This time, the player destroys him for good (and the mothership is subsequently blown up as well).\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n*''The Good, the Bad and the Warty''\n*''Home, Swampy, Home''\n*''On the Blink''\n*''The Komplex Caper''\n*''The Artificers of Aldebaran''\n*''The Warriors''\n*''Bye Bye Berserker Baboon''\n*''The Taking of Pilot Jenny''\n*''[[Bucky O'Hare (arcade game)]]''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Frix and Frax===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Frix and Frax'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Males\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Toads\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Toad Empire\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Personal assistants to the Air Marshall\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || Toad Mothership\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Toad Homeworld\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Green\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''War of the Warts''\n|}\n'''Frix''' and '''Frax''' are the two nearly identical high-ranking officers who serve as the [[#Toad Air Marshall|Air Marshall]]'s assistants.

They first appeared in ''War of the Warts'', and were mainstays except in the episodes ''The Artificers of Aldebaran'' and ''Corsair Canards''. They also briefly served as joint air marshalls when [[#Komplex|Komplex]] removed the Air Marshall from his command (in ''The Warriors'').\n\nBoth of them appear in the [[arcade game]] as mini-bosses during the Planet Rat stage.

Stormtoads serve a variety of functions, from basic infantry and security duties, to piloting Double Bubble fighters and even manning communications equipment aboard toad motherships. Like all toads, they fear only one thing: Berserker Baboons.\n\nNotable Storm Toads include the '''Navigator''' and '''Communications Officer''' and even '''Squadron Leader''' of [[#Toadborg|Toadborg's]] warship in the episode ''The Artificers of Aldebaran''. They wore helmets modified with antennaes on them, and had distinct voices and personalities that set them apart from the rank and file toad warriors. And unlike most toads, they were intelligent and trusted by Toadborg.\n\n(As a side note; In ''The Taking of Pilot Jenny'', after Komplex is destroyed, the \"K\" insignia on the sides of the helmets vanish whether by accident or deliberate.)\n\nThey appear as basic enemies throughout both the [[NES]] and arcade games. Although only green and blue in the cartoon, several Storm Toads throughout the various levels of the arcade game come in different colors, apparently to add flavor.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*All episodes\n*''[[Bucky O'Hare (arcade game)]]''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Andy Phibian===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Andy Phibian'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Toad\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Toad Empire\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Reporter for TTN\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || Toad Mothership\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Toad Homeworld\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Green\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''A Fistful of Simoleans''\n|}\n'''Andy Phibian''' is the star reporter for TTN, the [[news]] network of Toad TV.

Initially the [[invasion]] went so well that they thought the Terror Toad would not be needed, but after Willy DuWitt discovered a means of reversing the polarity of the goggles, Toadborg ordered the monstrosity unleashed.\n\nThe Terror Toad proved more than a match for Bucky O'Hare and the crew of the Righteous Indignation, using his twin [[battle axes]] to cut a swath of destruction through the Beetlegeusian forests. The Terror Toad was only stopped when Bucky acquired a vast amount of [[fly|flies]] in jars from Bog, using these to lure him into the [[tractor beam]] of the toad mothership, and the beast ended up aboard throwing Storm Toads around until Toadborg ordered the Air Marshall to get him back in his cage.\n\nThe Terror Toad appears in the [[arcade game]] as the end-level boss of the Climate Converter stage.\n\nA scaled down action figure was produced and carded for the intended second wave but was never released due to the toy lines cancelation. \n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''Bye Bye Berserker Baboon''\n*''[[Bucky O'Hare (arcade game)]]''\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Master Toad Spy===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Master Toad Spy'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Toad\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Toad Empire\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Spy\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || Spy ship\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Toad Homeworld\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Green\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Black\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''The Komplex Caper''\n|}\nThe '''Master Toad Spy''' is (ostensibly) the best [[secret agent]] the Toad Empire has.

Before he can return to base he is surprised and captured by Deadeye who uses his own tongue to tie him, and the Master Spy is taken as a prisoner aboard the ''Righteous Indignation''. He refuses to divulge any information about his mission, telling Bucky that he can [[torture]] him, tempt him with fly speck [[fondue]], or even tie him up with his own tongue again, but he would not talk. Bucky solved this problem by simply calling Bruiser in, and one look at the huge Berserker Baboon made the Spy break and hurriedly tell the heroes everything. Afterwards he was tossed into the brig.

Redjack was secretly in love with Lanelle, and had thought for years that former crewmate Deadeye had tried to steal her away from him. As a result, Redjack was openly hostile towards Deadeye and openly opposed the treaty, insisting that pirates did not do such things.

Kamikaze defeats Sly, who gives his word of honor not to activate the satellites which Willy was forced to build to drain Canopis dry, however he then goes back on his word, activating them anyway and then escaping. Thankfully, Willy had built self-destruct mechanisms into the satellites, allowing them to be destroyed, foiling the plans of Sly and the Air Marshall.\n\nAfterwards, Kamikaze, Deadeye and Willy captured Sly (the Air Marshall escaped however), but Sly was rescued by several other Samurai Lizards including the Supreme Commander. Kamikaze then told the Commander what Sly had done, and Sly was promptly arrested by his fellow Lizards.\n\nAn action figure was produced and carded for the intended second wave but was never released due to the toy lines cancelation.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''The Warriors''\n\n===Sly Leezard===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Sly Leezard'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Male\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Lizard\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Samurai Lizards\n|-\n|'''Position''' || Samurai\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || An unnamed lizard-shaped ship\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Saurion\n|-\n|'''Skin color''' || Blue\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Red\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''The Warriors''\n|}\n'''Sly Leezard''' was the mortal enemy of Kamikaze Kamo, a four-armed [[ninja]] [[duck]]. They both appear in the episode ''The Warriors''. His name is often misheard as either \"'''Sly LeZod'''\" or \"'''Slyly Zod'''.\" He is called the latter in the Bucky O'Hare Web Series. In the original script, he was referred to simply as \"'''Samurai Lizard''',\" although notations made on the pages indicate the name change.\n\nA [[Samurai]] [[Lizard]], Sly sought to improve his standing within the ranks of the Samurai by conquering Canopis III, the homeworld of Kamo, and he had a plan to use special [[evaporation]] satellites which would reduce the watery Canopis to a dead, dry dustball in a matter of seconds. To do so, he acquired the services of a [[scientist]], but Sly's short temper resulted in him accidentally killing the scientist during an argument.\n\nBummed, Sly went to a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] on Sludge, where he encountered the [[#Toad Air Marshall|Toad Air Marshall]], fresh from being fired by [[#Komplex|Komplex]] for his latest monumental blunder at Crystal. From the Air Marshall, Sly learned of the human Willy DuWitt, and the two kidnapped Willy and forced him to build the evaporation satellites for them. The Air Marshall was only helping Sly in the hopes that conquering Canopis III more or less all by himself would impress Komplex enough that he could have his old job back, but Sly was unaware of this.\n\nProblems came in the form of Deadeye Duck and Kamo, who infiltrated Sly's base. Kamo and Sly got into a [[swordfight]] in the lab following the loading of the satellites onto the Air Marshall's ship. They were ready for deployment and all Sly had to do was pull a lever. Kamo however knocked his sword away and had Sly at his mercy. Sly \"surrendered\" and gave Kamo his word of honor that he'd call off the launch, and Kamo, because a Samurai's word is unbreakable, allowed Sly to live. But Sly broke the Samurai code of honor and pulled the lever anyway, launching the satellites over Canopis III.\n\nLuckily, Willy had [[wikt:double-cross|doublecrossed]] Sly and implanted [[self-destruct]] mechanisms in all the satellites, so Canopis III was saved. As for Sly, when the other Samurai Lizards learned he had broken their code of honor, he was taken captive by them and imprisoned. Sly leezard\u2019s voice was done by [[Scott McNeil]].\n\nAlthough Sly himself does not appear in the [[arcade game]], identical-looking Samurai Lizard warriors do. They appear as sporadic basic enemies during the Planet Rat stage.\n\nAn action figure was produced and carded for the intended second wave but was never released due to the toy lines cancelation.\n\n'''Appearances:'''\n*''The Warriors''\n\n===Aunt Iris===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: larger;\" | '''Aunt Iris'''\n|-\n|'''Gender''' || Female\n|-\n|'''Species''' || Hare\n|-\n|'''Affiliation''' || Warren\n|-\n|'''Position''' || N/A\n|-\n|'''Vehicle''' || N/A\n|-\n|'''Homeworld''' || Warren\n|-\n|'''Fur color''' || Green with grey hair\n|-\n|'''Eye color''' || Blue\n|-\n|'''First appearance''' || ''Home, Swampy, Home''\n|}\nThe aunt of Bucky O'Hare and presumably the mother of [[#Cousin Jeffrey|Jeffrey]], '''Aunt Iris''' and her son were taken as slaves by the Toad Empire to build a new [[climate]] converter on Kinnear (to replace the one destroyed in the botched invasion of Genus).

Examples include '''Fate points''' in ''[[FATE (role-playing game system)|FATE]]'' (also RPGs based on the ''FATE'' system), '''Edge''' in ''[[MechWarrior (role-playing game)|MechWarrior]]'', '''Fortune dice''' in ''[[Feng Shui (role-playing game)|Feng Shui]]'' or '''Force points''' in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' role-playing games from [[West End Games]] (''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'') and [[Wizards of the Coast]] (the ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Wizards of the Coast)|Star Wars Roleplaying Game]]'').\n\nIn some RPGs, mostly [[indie role-playing game|indie RPGs]], plot points are rather a way of involving the player in the story.  They can be spent to introduce something into the game, or to add a [[retcon|previously-unrevealed fact]] about a character.  Examples include '''story tokens''' in Capes, the seven types of '''Narrative privileges''' (''Privil\u00e8ges narratifs'') in the 2nd edition of ''[[The Last Chronicles of Erdor]]'' (''[[:fr:Les Chroniques d'Erdor|Les Chroniques d'Erdor]]'', in French) or '''backgrounds''' in ''[[Dogs in the Vineyard]]''.\n\nIn [[Steve Jackson Games]]'s role-playing game ''[[Toon (role-playing game)|Toon]]'', plot points are used as [[experience points]], awarded for completing in-game objectives and used to increase a [[player character]]'s statistics.\n\nThe first role-playing game to incorporate plot points was ''[[Top Secret (role-playing game)|Top Secret]]'' by [[TSR, Inc.]] which gave each character between 1-10 luck points. Each luck point allowed a player to reverse the consequences of a single roll.\n\nCharacter creation in the ''[[Serenity Role Playing Game]]'' (2005) is point-based and players can use plot points to influence die rolls; this use of plot points has become standard for games based on dramatic licenses.<ref name=\"designers\">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|353}} In the [[Cortex System]], players are encouraged to roleplay their disadvantages during play and are rewarded with plot points for doing so; though\nmost of Cortex is a traditional RPG system, the interrelation of plot points and complications was a trend toward the indie side of game design.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|353}} In the ''Smallville Roleplaying Game'', plot points have become a central resource; they're not only available through the use of complications but they are also usable to power superpowers, meaning that PCs build up problems, then solve them when super powers come out, much like the TV show.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|354}} ''[[Leverage: The Roleplaying Game]]'' also featured a plot-point economy, built on distinctions.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|354\u2013355}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Role-playing game terminology]]\n\n\n{{rpg-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toHeroic(link changed toHero) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_point_(role-playing_games)"}
{"title_page": "The War Against the West", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n'''''The War Against the West''''' is a critical study of German National Socialism written by [[Aurel Kolnai]] and published in 1938. It describes German National Socialism as diametrically opposed to the [classical] [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[democracy|democratic]], Constitutional, and free-enterprise \"Western\" tendencies found mainly within Britain and the United States.\n\n==Overview==\nDuring the twenties and thirties, Kolnai, who converted to Catholicism under the influence of [[G.K. Chesterton]], read extensively in the [[German language]] [[fascist]] and national socialist literature.  The book compiles and critiques the anti-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] works of national socialist writers themselves. Kolnai's study was the first comprehensive survey in English of German national socialist ideology as a counter-revolution against, what German thinkers saw as, the [[materialistic]], rootless civilizations dominated by comfort-addicted, money-and-security-centered, liberal [[bourgeois]] and rootless [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] [[Jews]]; the antithesis of the [[Hero|heroic]] model of more vital civilizations, prepared to risk their lives, to die for ostensibly \"higher\" ideals. Kolnai argues that national socialist ideology is not only alien to the West, but profoundly disturbing and dangerous.\n\nKolnai described the German national socialists' war against the West as, in essence, a war of [[paganism]] against [[Christian civilization]]. In citations from [[Hitler]], [[Goebbels]], and others, Kolnai sought to expose what he saw as \"the obsessive German national socialist effort to replace Christianity with a crude and barbaric form of pagan religion, to twist the [[Christian cross|cross of Christ]] into a [[swastika]].\"\n\n==Contents==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background: #dcdcdc;\" align=\"left\"\n!Chapter\n!Section\n!Notes\n|-\n| \n| Preface\n|Define's German national socialist totalitarianism as a conscious, deliberate revolt of \"Germanism\" against the freedom of the human personality alike in its religious, social, and political forms.

He was raised in the nearby household of his uncle, Robert Hilleman, and worked in his youth on the family farm.  He credited much of his success to his work with [[chicken]]s as a boy; since the 1930s, fertile chicken eggs had often been used to grow viruses for vaccines.<ref name=Offit/><!-- Ch 1, 4 -->\n\nHis family belonged to the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]]. When he was in the eighth grade, he discovered [[Charles Darwin]], and was caught reading ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in church.

His eldest brother interceded, and Hilleman graduated first in his class in 1941 from [[Montana State University - Bozeman|Montana State University]] with family help and scholarships.  He won a fellowship to the [[University of Chicago]] and received his doctoral degree in microbiology in 1944.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Maurice Hilleman| pmc=557162 | page=1028 | volume=330| issue=7498| journal=BMJ| doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7498.1028}}</ref>  His doctoral thesis was on [[chlamydia infection]]s, which were then thought to be caused by a virus.  Hilleman showed that these infections were, in fact, caused by a species of bacterium, ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'', that grows [[Intracellular_parasites|only inside of cells]].<ref name=Offit/><!-- Ch 1 -->\n\n===Career===\nAfter joining E.R. Squibb & Sons (now [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]), Hilleman developed a vaccine against [[Japanese B encephalitis]], a disease that threatened American troops in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]].  As chief of the Department of Respiratory Diseases at [[Army Medical School|Army Medical Center]] (now the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]]) from 1948 to 1957, Hilleman discovered the genetic changes that occur when the [[influenza]] virus [[Mutation|mutates]], known as ''shift and [[Genetic drift|drift]]''.  That helped him to recognize that a [[1957\u201358 influenza pandemic|1957 outbreak of influenza]] in [[Hong Kong]] could become a huge [[pandemic]].  Working on a hunch, after nine 14-hour days he and a colleague found that it was a new strain of flu that could kill millions.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Forty million doses of vaccines were prepared and distributed.  Although 69,000 Americans died, the [[pandemic]] could have resulted in many more deaths in the United States.  Hilleman was awarded the [[Public Health Service Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medal]] from the American military for his work.\n\nIn 1957, Hilleman joined [[Merck & Co.]] ([[Kenilworth, New Jersey]]), as head of its new [[virus]] and [[cell biology]] research department in [[West Point, Pennsylvania]].  It was while with Merck that Hilleman developed most of the forty experimental and licensed animal and human vaccines with which he is credited, working both at the laboratory bench as well as providing scientific leadership.\n\nIn 1963, his daughter Jeryl Lynn came down with the [[mumps]].  He cultivated material from her, and used it as the basis of a [[mumps vaccine]].  The [[Jeryl Lynn]] strain of the [[Mumpsvax|mumps vaccine]] is still used today.  The strain is currently used in the trivalent (measles, mumps and rubella) [[MMR vaccine]] that he also developed, the first vaccine ever approved incorporating multiple live virus strains.\n\nHe and his group invented<ref name=Offit/><!-- Ch 8 --> a vaccine for [[hepatitis B]] by treating blood serum with [[pepsin]], [[urea]] and [[formaldehyde]].  This was licensed in 1981, but withdrawn in 1986 in the United States when it was replaced by a vaccine that was produced in yeast.  This vaccine is still in use today.  By 2003, 150 countries were using it and the incidence of the disease in the United States in young people had decreased by 95%. Hilleman considered his work on this vaccine to be his single greatest achievement.\n\nHilleman was one of the early vaccine pioneers to warn about the possibility that simian viruses might contaminate vaccines.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Bookchin D, Schumacher J |title=The Virus and the Vaccine |pages=[https://archive.org/details/virusvaccinetrue00debb/page/94 94\u201398] |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-312-27872-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/virusvaccinetrue00debb/page/94 }}</ref> The best-known of these viruses became [[SV40]], a viral contaminant of the polio vaccine, whose discovery led to the recall of [[Jonas Salk|Salk]]'s vaccine in 1961 and its replacement with [[Albert Sabin]]'s oral vaccine.  The contamination actually occurred in both vaccines at very low levels, but because the oral vaccine was ingested rather than injected, it did not result in infections or any harm.\n\nHilleman served on numerous national and international advisory boards and committees, academic, governmental and private, including the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s Office of AIDS Research Program Evaluation and the [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] of the [[National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases|National Immunization Program]].  In his later life, Hilleman was an adviser to the [[World Health Organization]].  He retired as senior vice president of the Merck Research Labs in 1984 at the mandatory retirement age of 65.  He then directed the newly created Merck Institute for Vaccinology where he worked for the next twenty years.\n\nAt the time of his death in [[Philadelphia]] on April 11, 2005,<ref name=\":0\" /> at the age of 85, Hilleman was Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia.\n\n==Method and personality==\nHilleman was a forceful man who was at the same time modest in his claims.  None of his vaccines or discoveries are named after him.  He ran his laboratory like a military unit, and he was the one in command.  For a time, he kept a row of \"shrunken heads\" (actually fakes made by one of his children) in his office as trophies that represented each of his fired employees.  He used profanity and tirades freely to drive his arguments home, and once, famously, refused to attend a mandatory \"charm school\" course intended to make Merck middle managers more civil.  His employees were fiercely loyal to him.<ref name=Offit/>{{rp|128\u2013131}}\n\n==Legacy==\nHilleman was an elected member of the [[National Academy of Science]], the [[Institute of Medicine]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[American Philosophical Society]].  In 1988, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] presented him with the [[National Medal of Science]], the nation's highest scientific honor.

He was raised in the nearby household of his uncle, Robert Hilleman, and worked in his youth on the family farm.  He credited much of his success to his work with [[chicken]]s as a boy; since the 1930s, fertile chicken eggs had often been used to grow viruses for vaccines.<ref name=Offit/><!-- Ch 1, 4 -->\n\nHis family belonged to the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]]. When he was in the eighth grade, he discovered [[Charles Darwin]], and was caught reading ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in church. Later in life, he rejected religion.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|title=Maurice Hilleman|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maurice-hilleman-495424.html|accessdate=December 6, 2017|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=April 19, 2005}}</ref> Due to lack of money, he almost failed to attend college.  His eldest brother interceded, and Hilleman graduated first in his class in 1941 from [[Montana State University - Bozeman|Montana State University]] with family help and scholarships.  He won a fellowship to the [[University of Chicago]] and received his doctoral degree in microbiology in 1944.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Maurice Hilleman| pmc=557162 | page=1028 | volume=330| issue=7498| journal=BMJ| doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7498.1028}}</ref>  His doctoral thesis was on [[chlamydia infection]]s, which were then thought to be caused by a virus.  Hilleman showed that these infections were, in fact, caused by a species of bacterium, ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'', that grows [[Intracellular_parasites|only inside of cells]].<ref name=Offit/><!-- Ch 1 -->\n\n===Career===\nAfter joining E.R. Squibb & Sons (now [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]), Hilleman developed a vaccine against [[Japanese B encephalitis]], a disease that threatened American troops in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]].  As chief of the Department of Respiratory Diseases at [[Army Medical School|Army Medical Center]] (now the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]]) from 1948 to 1957, Hilleman discovered the genetic changes that occur when the [[influenza]] virus [[Mutation|mutates]], known as ''shift and [[Genetic drift|drift]]''.  That helped him to recognize that a [[1957\u201358 influenza pandemic|1957 outbreak of influenza]] in [[Hong Kong]] could become a huge [[pandemic]].  Working on a hunch, after nine 14-hour days he and a colleague found that it was a new strain of flu that could kill millions.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Forty million doses of vaccines were prepared and distributed.  Although 69,000 Americans died, the [[pandemic]] could have resulted in many more deaths in the United States.  Hilleman was awarded the [[Public Health Service Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medal]] from the American military for his work.\n\nIn 1957, Hilleman joined [[Merck & Co.]] ([[Kenilworth, New Jersey]]), as head of its new [[virus]] and [[cell biology]] research department in [[West Point, Pennsylvania]].  It was while with Merck that Hilleman developed most of the forty experimental and licensed animal and human vaccines with which he is credited, working both at the laboratory bench as well as providing scientific leadership.\n\nIn 1963, his daughter Jeryl Lynn came down with the [[mumps]].  He cultivated material from her, and used it as the basis of a [[mumps vaccine]].  The [[Jeryl Lynn]] strain of the [[Mumpsvax|mumps vaccine]] is still used today.  The strain is currently used in the trivalent (measles, mumps and rubella) [[MMR vaccine]] that he also developed, the first vaccine ever approved incorporating multiple live virus strains.\n\nHe and his group invented<ref name=Offit/><!-- Ch 8 --> a vaccine for [[hepatitis B]] by treating blood serum with [[pepsin]], [[urea]] and [[formaldehyde]].  This was licensed in 1981, but withdrawn in 1986 in the United States when it was replaced by a vaccine that was produced in yeast.  This vaccine is still in use today.  By 2003, 150 countries were using it and the incidence of the disease in the United States in young people had decreased by 95%. Hilleman considered his work on this vaccine to be his single greatest achievement.\n\nHilleman was one of the early vaccine pioneers to warn about the possibility that simian viruses might contaminate vaccines.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Bookchin D, Schumacher J |title=The Virus and the Vaccine |pages=[https://archive.org/details/virusvaccinetrue00debb/page/94 94\u201398] |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-312-27872-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/virusvaccinetrue00debb/page/94 }}</ref> The best-known of these viruses became [[SV40]], a viral contaminant of the polio vaccine, whose discovery led to the recall of [[Jonas Salk|Salk]]'s vaccine in 1961 and its replacement with [[Albert Sabin]]'s oral vaccine.  The contamination actually occurred in both vaccines at very low levels, but because the oral vaccine was ingested rather than injected, it did not result in infections or any harm.\n\nHilleman served on numerous national and international advisory boards and committees, academic, governmental and private, including the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s Office of AIDS Research Program Evaluation and the [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] of the [[National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases|National Immunization Program]].  In his later life, Hilleman was an adviser to the [[World Health Organization]].  He retired as senior vice president of the Merck Research Labs in 1984 at the mandatory retirement age of 65.  He then directed the newly created Merck Institute for Vaccinology where he worked for the next twenty years.\n\nAt the time of his death in [[Philadelphia]] on April 11, 2005,<ref name=\":0\" /> at the age of 85, Hilleman was Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia.\n\n==Method and personality==\nHilleman was a forceful man who was at the same time modest in his claims.  None of his vaccines or discoveries are named after him.  He ran his laboratory like a military unit, and he was the one in command.  For a time, he kept a row of \"shrunken heads\" (actually fakes made by one of his children) in his office as trophies that represented each of his fired employees.  He used profanity and tirades freely to drive his arguments home, and once, famously, refused to attend a mandatory \"charm school\" course intended to make Merck middle managers more civil.  His employees were fiercely loyal to him.<ref name=Offit/>{{rp|128\u2013131}}\n\n==Legacy==\nHilleman was an elected member of the [[National Academy of Science]], the [[Institute of Medicine]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[American Philosophical Society]].  In 1988, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] presented him with the [[National Medal of Science]], the nation's highest scientific honor.  He received the [[Prince Mahidol Award]] from the [[King of Thailand]] for the advancement of public health, as well as a special lifetime achievement award from the [[World Health Organization]], the [[Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service]] and the [[Sabin Gold Medal]] and Lifetime Achievement Awards.\n\nIn March 2005, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] School of Medicine's Department of [[Pediatrics]] and The [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]], in collaboration with The Merck Company Foundation, announced the creation of The Maurice R.
