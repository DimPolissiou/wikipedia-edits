It is bordered by [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Cambridgeshire]] to the north, [[Essex]] to the east, [[Greater London]] to the south, and [[Buckinghamshire]] to the west.

[[Hertford]], once the main [[market town]] for the medieval agricultural county, derives its name from a [[wikt:hart|hart]] (stag) and a [[ford (crossing)|ford]], used as the components of the county's coat of arms and flag.  Elevations are high for the region in the north and west.  These reach over {{convert|800|ft}} in the western projection around [[Tring]] which is in the [[Chilterns]].  The county's borders are approximately the [[drainage divide|watershed]]s of the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Colne]] and [[River Lea|Lea]]; both flowing to the south; each accompanied by a canal. Hertfordshire's undeveloped land is mainly agricultural and much is protected by [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]].\n\nThe county's landmarks span many centuries, ranging from the [[Six Hills]] in the [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new town]] of [[Stevenage]] built by local inhabitants during the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] period, to [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]]. The volume of intact medieval and [[Tudor architecture|Tudor buildings]] surpasses London, in places in well-preserved [[conservation area]]s, especially in [[St Albans]] which includes some remains of [[Verulamium]], the town where in the 3rd century an early recorded British martyrdom took place. [[Saint Alban]], a Romano-British soldier, took the place of a Christian priest and was beheaded on Holywell Hill. His martyr's cross of a yellow saltire on a blue field is reflected in the [[Flag of Hertfordshire|flag and coat of arms of Hertfordshire]].\n\nHertfordshire is well-served with motorways and railways, providing good access to [[London]]. The largest sector of the economy of the county is in services.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Hertfordshire}}\nHertfordshire was the area assigned to a fortress constructed at [[Hertford]] under the rule of [[Edward the Elder]] in 913. Hertford is derived from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''heort ford,'' meaning [[deer]] crossing (of a watercourse). The name Hertfordshire is first recorded in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' in 1011. Deer feature in many county emblems. Many of the names of the current settlements date back to the Anglo-Saxon period, with many featuring standard placename suffixes attributed to the Anglo-Saxons: \"ford\", \"ton\", \"den\", \"bourn\", \"ley\", \"stead\", \"ing\", \"lett\", \"wood\", and \"worth\", are represented in this county by Hertford, Royston, Harpenden, Redbourn, Cuffley, Wheathampstead, Tring, Radlett, Borehamwood, and Rickmansworth.\n\nThere is evidence of human life in Hertfordshire from the [[Mesolithic period]]. It was first farmed during the [[Neolithic period]] and permanent habitation appeared at the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]]. This was followed by tribes settling in the area during the [[Iron Age]].\n\nFollowing the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43]], the aboriginal [[Catuvellauni]] quickly submitted and adapted to the Roman life; resulting in the development of several new towns, including [[Verulamium]] (St Albans) where in c. 293 the first recorded British martyrdom is traditionally believed to have taken place. [[Saint Alban]], a Romano-British soldier, took the place of a Christian priest and was beheaded on Holywell Hill. His martyr's cross of a yellow saltire on a blue field is reflected in the [[Flag of Hertfordshire|flag and coat of arms of Hertfordshire]] as the yellow field to the stag or Hart representing the county. He is the Patron Saint of Hertfordshire.\n\nWith the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|departure of the Roman Legions in the early 5th century]], the now unprotected territory was invaded and colonised by the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. By the 6th century the majority of the modern county was part of the [[East Saxon]] kingdom. This relatively short-lived kingdom collapsed in the 9th century, ceding the territory of Hertfordshire to the control of the West Anglians of [[Mercia]]. The region finally became an English shire in the 10th century, on the merger of the West Saxon and Mercian kingdoms.\nIn the midst of the Norse invasions, Hertfordshire was on the front lines of much of the fighting. King [[Edward the Elder]], in his reconquest of Norse-held lands in what was to become [[England]], established a \"[[burh]]\" or fort in Hertford, which was to curb Norse activities in the area. His father, [[King Alfred the Great]], established the River Lea as a boundary between his kingdom and that of the Norse lord [[Guthrum]], with the north and eastern parts of the county being within the [[Danelaw]]. There is little evidence however of [[Old Norse|Norse]] placenames within this region, and many of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] features remained intact to this day. The county however suffered from renewed Norse raids in the late 10th to early 11th centuries, as armies led by [[Danish king]]s [[Swein Forkbeard]] and [[Cnut the Great]] harried the country as part of their attempts to undermine and overthrow English king [[Athelred the Unready]].\n\nA century later, [[William the Conqueror|William of Normandy]] received the surrender of the surviving senior English Lords and Clergy at [[Berkhamsted]], resulting in a new Anglicised title of [[William the Conqueror]] before embarking on an uncontested entry into London and his coronation at [[Westminster]]. Hertfordshire was used for some of the new Norman castles at [[Bishop's Stortford]], and at [[Kings Langley|King's Langley]], a staging post between London and the royal residence of [[Berkhamsted]].\n\nThe [[Domesday Book]] recorded the county as having nine [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]]. [[Tring (hundred)|Tring]] and [[Danais (hundred)|Danais]] became one{{mdash}}[[Dacorum]]{{mdash}}from Danis Corum or Danish rule harking back to a [[Viking]] not [[Saxons|Saxon]] past. The other seven were [[Braughing]], [[Stevenage|Broadwater]], [[Liberty of St Albans|Cashio]], [[Buntingford|Edwinstree]], [[Hertford]], [[Hitchin]] and [[Odsey]].\n\nIn the later Plantagenet period, St. Albans Abbey was an initial drafting place of what was to become the Magna Carta. And in the later Wars of the Roses, St. Albans staged two major battles featuring the Lancastrians and the Yorkists.\n\nIn Tudor times, Hatfield House was often frequented by Queen Elizabeth I. Stuart kings such as James VI/I of Scotland and England used the locale as a hunting lodge, and Charles II facilitated the construction of the New River running from the county as a supply of drinking water into London.\n\nThe first shooting-down of a [[zeppelin]] over Great Britain during WW1 happened in Cuffley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hertsatwar.co.uk/zeppelin-raids-hertfordshire|title=Zeppelin Raids - Herts at War|website=www.hertsatwar.co.uk|access-date=23 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228221343/http://www.hertsatwar.co.uk/zeppelin-raids-hertfordshire|archive-date=28 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs London grew, Hertfordshire became conveniently close to the English capital; much of the area was owned by the [[nobility]] and [[aristocracy]], this [[patronage]] helped to boost the local economy. However, the greatest boost to Hertfordshire came during the [[Industrial Revolution]], after which the population rose dramatically. In 1903, [[Letchworth]] became the world's first [[Garden city movement|garden city]] and [[Stevenage]] became the first town to redevelop under the [[New Towns Act 1946]].\n\nFrom the [[1920s in film|1920s]] until the late [[1980s in film|1980s]], the town of [[Borehamwood]] was home to one of the major British [[film studio]] complexes, including the [[MGM-British Studios]]. Many well-known films were made here including the first three ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies ([[Star Wars (film)|IV]], [[The Empire Strikes Back|V]], & [[Return of the Jedi|VI]]). The studios generally used the name of [[Elstree]]. American director [[Stanley Kubrick]] not only used to shoot in those studios but also lived in the area until his death. ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' and ''[[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?]]'' have been filmed there. ''[[EastEnders]]'' is filmed at Elstree. Hertfordshire has seen development at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]]; the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' series]] was filmed here and the 1995 James Bond film ''[[GoldenEye]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmlondon.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=836|title=Leavesden Studios|website=[[Film London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807090806/http://www.filmlondon.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=836|archive-date=7 August 2007|url-status=|access-date=4 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 2000, the [[Hatfield rail crash]] killed four people with over 70 injured.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-11560482|title=Hatfield train crash remembered|date=17 October 2010|work=BBC News|access-date=2 August 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802191243/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-11560482|archive-date=2 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The crash exposed the shortcomings of [[Railtrack]], which consequently saw speed restrictions and major track replacement.

To the east is [[Essex]], to the west is [[Buckinghamshire]] and to the north are [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Cambridgeshire]].\n\nThe county's boundaries were roughly fixed by the [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844#Hertfordshire|Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844]] which eliminated [[exclave]]s; amended when, in 1965 under the [[London Government Act 1963]], [[East Barnet Urban District]] and [[Barnet Urban District]] were abolished, their area was transferred to form part of the present-day [[London Borough of Barnet]] and the [[Potters Bar Urban District]] of [[Middlesex]] was transferred to Hertfordshire.\n\nThe highest point in the county is at {{convert|245|m}}  ([[above sea level|AOD]]) on [[the Ridgeway]] long distance national path, on the border of [[Hastoe]] near [[Tring]] with [[Drayton Beauchamp]], Buckinghamshire.\n\nAs at the 2011 census of the ten Districts, [[East Hertfordshire]] had the minimal, 290 people per km<sup>2</sup>, whereas Watford had the maximal 4210 people per km<sup>2</sup>. Compared to nearby Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire has far less large towns or cities, such as Luton and Milton Keynes respectively, which have roughly 200,000 or more residents apiece. The overall population of Hertfordshire is higher than the two aforementioned counties (approximately 1,000,000), but featuring many small to medium-sized towns. The larger communities in the county, such as Stevenage, Watford, Letchworth and Hemel Hempstead, all have populations ranging from 70,000 to 150,000, and thus not overly large in the grand scheme of British locales.\n\nThe [[River Lea]] near [[Harpenden]] runs through [[Wheathampstead]], Welwyn Garden City, Hertford, Ware, and Broxbourne before reaching [[Cheshunt]] and ultimately the River Thames. The far west of the county is the most hilly, with the [[Chiltern Hills]] surrounding [[Tring]], [[Berkhamsted]] and the Ashridge estate. This [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] runs from near Hitchin in the north to Berkshire and Oxfordshire.\n\nMany of the county's major settlements are in the central, northern and southern areas, such as [[Watford]], Hemel Hempstead, [[Kings Langley]], [[Rickmansworth]], [[St. Albans]], Harpenden, [[Radlett]], [[Borehamwood]], [[Potters Bar]], Stevenage, [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], [[Welwyn]] and Welwyn Garden City, Hitchin, Letchworth and Baldock. These are all small to medium-sized locations, featuring a mix of post-WWII new towns and older/more historical locales. The [[St Albans|City of St. Albans]] is an example of a historical settlement, as its Cathedral and Abbey date to the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] period, and there are ruins from the Roman settlement of [[Verulamium]] nearby the current city centre. Stevenage is a mix of post-WWII [[new town]] planning amidst its prior incarnation as a smaller town. The Old Town in Stevenage represents this historic core and has many shops and buildings reflecting its pre-WWII heritage. Hitchin also has a historic centre, with many [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] era buildings interspersed amongst more contemporary structures.\n\nHertfordshire's eastern regions are predominantly rural and arable, intermixed with villages and small to medium-sized towns. Royston, Buntingford and [[Bishops Stortford]], along with [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] and the county town of Hertford are major settlements in this regard. The physical geography of eastern Hertfordshire is less elevated than the far west, but with lower rising hills and prominent rivers such as the [[Stort]]. This river rises in [[Essex]] and terminates via a confluence with the Lea near to Ware. \nApart from the Lea and Stort, the River Colne is the major watercourse in the county's west. This runs near Watford and Radlett, and has a complex system/drainage area running south into both Greater London and Buckinghamshire.\n\nAn unofficial status, the purple star-shaped flower with yellow stamens, the [[Pulsatilla vulgaris|Pasqueflower]] is among endemic [[county flower]]s.<ref>[http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/plant_species/pasqueflower \"Wild Plants: Pasqueflower\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226191254/http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/plant_species/pasqueflower |date=26 February 2015 }} [[Plantlife]]. Retrieved 26 February 2015</ref>\n\n=== Geology ===\n{{main|Geology of Hertfordshire}}\n\nThe rocks of Hertfordshire belong to the great shallow [[syncline]] known as the [[London Basin]]. The beds dip in a south-easterly direction towards the syncline's lowest point roughly under the [[River Thames]]. The most important formations are the [[Cretaceous]] [[Chalk]], exposed as the high ground in the north and west of the county, forming the [[Chiltern Hills]] and the younger [[Palaeocene]], [[Reading Beds]] and [[Eocene]], [[London Clay]] which occupy the remaining southern part. The eastern half of the county was covered by glaciers during the [[Ice Age]] and has a superficial layer of glacial [[boulder clay]]s.\n\n=== Natural resources and environment ===\n[[File:De Wint, Peter, Cornfields near Tring Station, Hertfordshire, 1847.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peter de Wint]], ''Cornfields near Tring Station, Hertfordshire'', 1847, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\nMuch of the county is given over to agriculture.

In the past, clay has supplied local brick-making and still does in [[Bovingdon]], just south-west of Hemel Hempstead. The chalk that is the bedrock of much of the county provides an [[aquifer]] that feeds streams and is also exploited to provide water supplies for much of the county and beyond. Chalk has also been used as a building material and, once fired, the resultant lime was spread on agricultural land to improve fertility. The mining of chalk since the early 18th century has left unrecorded underground galleries that occasionally collapse unexpectedly and endanger buildings.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = About the chalk mines\n |publisher    = Dacorum Borough Council\n |year         = 2008\n |url          = http://www.dacorum.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=5692\n |accessdate   = 7 February 2009\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081212000718/http://www.dacorum.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=5692\n |archive-date = 12 December 2008\n |url-status     = live\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nFresh water is supplied to London from [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], using the [[New River (England)|New River]] built by [[Hugh Myddleton]] and opened in 1613.

[[Hertford]], once the main [[market town]] for the medieval agricultural county, derives its name from a [[wikt:hart|hart]] (stag) and a [[ford (crossing)|ford]], used as the components of the county's coat of arms and flag.  Elevations are high for the region in the north and west.  These reach over {{convert|800|ft}} in the western projection around [[Tring]] which is in the [[Chilterns]].  The county's borders are approximately the [[drainage divide|watershed]]s of the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Colne]] and [[River Lea|Lea]]; both flowing to the south; each accompanied by a canal. Hertfordshire's undeveloped land is mainly agricultural and much is protected by [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]].\n\nThe county's landmarks span many centuries, ranging from the [[Six Hills]] in the [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new town]] of [[Stevenage]] built by local inhabitants during the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] period, to [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]]. The volume of intact medieval and [[Tudor architecture|Tudor buildings]] surpasses London, in places in well-preserved [[conservation area]]s, especially in [[St Albans]] which includes some remains of [[Verulamium]], the town where in the 3rd century an early recorded British martyrdom took place. [[Saint Alban]], a Romano-British soldier, took the place of a Christian priest and was beheaded on Holywell Hill. His martyr's cross of a yellow saltire on a blue field is reflected in the [[Flag of Hertfordshire|flag and coat of arms of Hertfordshire]].\n\nHertfordshire is well-served with motorways and railways, providing good access to [[London]]. The largest sector of the economy of the county is in services.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Hertfordshire}}\nHertfordshire was the area assigned to a fortress constructed at [[Hertford]] under the rule of [[Edward the Elder]] in 913. Hertford is derived from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''heort ford,'' meaning [[deer]] crossing (of a watercourse). The name Hertfordshire is first recorded in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' in 1011. Deer feature in many county emblems. Many of the names of the current settlements date back to the Anglo-Saxon period, with many featuring standard placename suffixes attributed to the Anglo-Saxons: \"ford\", \"ton\", \"den\", \"bourn\", \"ley\", \"stead\", \"ing\", \"lett\", \"wood\", and \"worth\", are represented in this county by Hertford, Royston, Harpenden, Redbourn, Cuffley, Wheathampstead, Tring, Radlett, Borehamwood, and Rickmansworth.\n\nThere is evidence of human life in Hertfordshire from the [[Mesolithic period]]. It was first farmed during the [[Neolithic period]] and permanent habitation appeared at the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]]. This was followed by tribes settling in the area during the [[Iron Age]].\n\nFollowing the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43]], the aboriginal [[Catuvellauni]] quickly submitted and adapted to the Roman life; resulting in the development of several new towns, including [[Verulamium]] (St Albans) where in c. 293 the first recorded British martyrdom is traditionally believed to have taken place. [[Saint Alban]], a Romano-British soldier, took the place of a Christian priest and was beheaded on Holywell Hill. His martyr's cross of a yellow saltire on a blue field is reflected in the [[Flag of Hertfordshire|flag and coat of arms of Hertfordshire]] as the yellow field to the stag or Hart representing the county. He is the Patron Saint of Hertfordshire.\n\nWith the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|departure of the Roman Legions in the early 5th century]], the now unprotected territory was invaded and colonised by the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. By the 6th century the majority of the modern county was part of the [[East Saxon]] kingdom. This relatively short-lived kingdom collapsed in the 9th century, ceding the territory of Hertfordshire to the control of the West Anglians of [[Mercia]]. The region finally became an English shire in the 10th century, on the merger of the West Saxon and Mercian kingdoms.\nIn the midst of the Norse invasions, Hertfordshire was on the front lines of much of the fighting. King [[Edward the Elder]], in his reconquest of Norse-held lands in what was to become [[England]], established a \"[[burh]]\" or fort in Hertford, which was to curb Norse activities in the area. His father, [[King Alfred the Great]], established the River Lea as a boundary between his kingdom and that of the Norse lord [[Guthrum]], with the north and eastern parts of the county being within the [[Danelaw]]. There is little evidence however of [[Old Norse|Norse]] placenames within this region, and many of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] features remained intact to this day. The county however suffered from renewed Norse raids in the late 10th to early 11th centuries, as armies led by [[Danish king]]s [[Swein Forkbeard]] and [[Cnut the Great]] harried the country as part of their attempts to undermine and overthrow English king [[Athelred the Unready]].\n\nA century later, [[William the Conqueror|William of Normandy]] received the surrender of the surviving senior English Lords and Clergy at [[Berkhamsted]], resulting in a new Anglicised title of [[William the Conqueror]] before embarking on an uncontested entry into London and his coronation at [[Westminster]]. Hertfordshire was used for some of the new Norman castles at [[Bishop's Stortford]], and at [[Kings Langley|King's Langley]], a staging post between London and the royal residence of [[Berkhamsted]].\n\nThe [[Domesday Book]] recorded the county as having nine [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]]. [[Tring (hundred)|Tring]] and [[Danais (hundred)|Danais]] became one{{mdash}}[[Dacorum]]{{mdash}}from Danis Corum or Danish rule harking back to a [[Viking]] not [[Saxons|Saxon]] past. The other seven were [[Braughing]], [[Stevenage|Broadwater]], [[Liberty of St Albans|Cashio]], [[Buntingford|Edwinstree]], [[Hertford]], [[Hitchin]] and [[Odsey]].\n\nIn the later Plantagenet period, St. Albans Abbey was an initial drafting place of what was to become the Magna Carta. And in the later Wars of the Roses, St. Albans staged two major battles featuring the Lancastrians and the Yorkists.\n\nIn Tudor times, Hatfield House was often frequented by Queen Elizabeth I. Stuart kings such as James VI/I of Scotland and England used the locale as a hunting lodge, and Charles II facilitated the construction of the New River running from the county as a supply of drinking water into London.\n\nThe first shooting-down of a [[zeppelin]] over Great Britain during WW1 happened in Cuffley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hertsatwar.co.uk/zeppelin-raids-hertfordshire|title=Zeppelin Raids - Herts at War|website=www.hertsatwar.co.uk|access-date=23 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228221343/http://www.hertsatwar.co.uk/zeppelin-raids-hertfordshire|archive-date=28 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs London grew, Hertfordshire became conveniently close to the English capital; much of the area was owned by the [[nobility]] and [[aristocracy]], this [[patronage]] helped to boost the local economy. However, the greatest boost to Hertfordshire came during the [[Industrial Revolution]], after which the population rose dramatically. In 1903, [[Letchworth]] became the world's first [[Garden city movement|garden city]] and [[Stevenage]] became the first town to redevelop under the [[New Towns Act 1946]].\n\nFrom the [[1920s in film|1920s]] until the late [[1980s in film|1980s]], the town of [[Borehamwood]] was home to one of the major British [[film studio]] complexes, including the [[MGM-British Studios]]. Many well-known films were made here including the first three ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies ([[Star Wars (film)|IV]], [[The Empire Strikes Back|V]], & [[Return of the Jedi|VI]]). The studios generally used the name of [[Elstree]]. American director [[Stanley Kubrick]] not only used to shoot in those studios but also lived in the area until his death. ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' and ''[[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?]]'' have been filmed there. ''[[EastEnders]]'' is filmed at Elstree. Hertfordshire has seen development at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]]; the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' series]] was filmed here and the 1995 James Bond film ''[[GoldenEye]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmlondon.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=836|title=Leavesden Studios|website=[[Film London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807090806/http://www.filmlondon.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=836|archive-date=7 August 2007|url-status=|access-date=4 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 2000, the [[Hatfield rail crash]] killed four people with over 70 injured.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-11560482|title=Hatfield train crash remembered|date=17 October 2010|work=BBC News|access-date=2 August 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802191243/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-11560482|archive-date=2 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The crash exposed the shortcomings of [[Railtrack]], which consequently saw speed restrictions and major track replacement.

To the east is [[Essex]], to the west is [[Buckinghamshire]] and to the north are [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Cambridgeshire]].\n\nThe county's boundaries were roughly fixed by the [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844#Hertfordshire|Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844]] which eliminated [[exclave]]s; amended when, in 1965 under the [[London Government Act 1963]], [[East Barnet Urban District]] and [[Barnet Urban District]] were abolished, their area was transferred to form part of the present-day [[London Borough of Barnet]] and the [[Potters Bar Urban District]] of [[Middlesex]] was transferred to Hertfordshire.\n\nThe highest point in the county is at {{convert|245|m}}  ([[above sea level|AOD]]) on [[the Ridgeway]] long distance national path, on the border of [[Hastoe]] near [[Tring]] with [[Drayton Beauchamp]], Buckinghamshire.\n\nAs at the 2011 census of the ten Districts, [[East Hertfordshire]] had the minimal, 290 people per km<sup>2</sup>, whereas Watford had the maximal 4210 people per km<sup>2</sup>. Compared to nearby Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire has far less large towns or cities, such as Luton and Milton Keynes respectively, which have roughly 200,000 or more residents apiece. The overall population of Hertfordshire is higher than the two aforementioned counties (approximately 1,000,000), but featuring many small to medium-sized towns. The larger communities in the county, such as Stevenage, Watford, Letchworth and Hemel Hempstead, all have populations ranging from 70,000 to 150,000, and thus not overly large in the grand scheme of British locales.\n\nThe [[River Lea]] near [[Harpenden]] runs through [[Wheathampstead]], Welwyn Garden City, Hertford, Ware, and Broxbourne before reaching [[Cheshunt]] and ultimately the River Thames. The far west of the county is the most hilly, with the [[Chiltern Hills]] surrounding [[Tring]], [[Berkhamsted]] and the Ashridge estate. This [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] runs from near Hitchin in the north to Berkshire and Oxfordshire.\n\nMany of the county's major settlements are in the central, northern and southern areas, such as [[Watford]], Hemel Hempstead, [[Kings Langley]], [[Rickmansworth]], [[St. Albans]], Harpenden, [[Radlett]], [[Borehamwood]], [[Potters Bar]], Stevenage, [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], [[Welwyn]] and Welwyn Garden City, Hitchin, Letchworth and Baldock. These are all small to medium-sized locations, featuring a mix of post-WWII new towns and older/more historical locales. The [[St Albans|City of St. Albans]] is an example of a historical settlement, as its Cathedral and Abbey date to the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] period, and there are ruins from the Roman settlement of [[Verulamium]] nearby the current city centre. Stevenage is a mix of post-WWII [[new town]] planning amidst its prior incarnation as a smaller town. The Old Town in Stevenage represents this historic core and has many shops and buildings reflecting its pre-WWII heritage. Hitchin also has a historic centre, with many [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] era buildings interspersed amongst more contemporary structures.\n\nHertfordshire's eastern regions are predominantly rural and arable, intermixed with villages and small to medium-sized towns. Royston, Buntingford and [[Bishops Stortford]], along with [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] and the county town of Hertford are major settlements in this regard. The physical geography of eastern Hertfordshire is less elevated than the far west, but with lower rising hills and prominent rivers such as the [[Stort]]. This river rises in [[Essex]] and terminates via a confluence with the Lea near to Ware. \nApart from the Lea and Stort, the River Colne is the major watercourse in the county's west.

The beds dip in a south-easterly direction towards the syncline's lowest point roughly under the [[River Thames]]. The most important formations are the [[Cretaceous]] [[Chalk]], exposed as the high ground in the north and west of the county, forming the [[Chiltern Hills]] and the younger [[Palaeocene]], [[Reading Beds]] and [[Eocene]], [[London Clay]] which occupy the remaining southern part. The eastern half of the county was covered by glaciers during the [[Ice Age]] and has a superficial layer of glacial [[boulder clay]]s.\n\n=== Natural resources and environment ===\n[[File:De Wint, Peter, Cornfields near Tring Station, Hertfordshire, 1847.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peter de Wint]], ''Cornfields near Tring Station, Hertfordshire'', 1847, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\nMuch of the county is given over to agriculture.

In the past, clay has supplied local brick-making and still does in [[Bovingdon]], just south-west of Hemel Hempstead. The chalk that is the bedrock of much of the county provides an [[aquifer]] that feeds streams and is also exploited to provide water supplies for much of the county and beyond. Chalk has also been used as a building material and, once fired, the resultant lime was spread on agricultural land to improve fertility. The mining of chalk since the early 18th century has left unrecorded underground galleries that occasionally collapse unexpectedly and endanger buildings.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = About the chalk mines\n |publisher    = Dacorum Borough Council\n |year         = 2008\n |url          = http://www.dacorum.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=5692\n |accessdate   = 7 February 2009\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081212000718/http://www.dacorum.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=5692\n |archive-date = 12 December 2008\n |url-status     = live\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nFresh water is supplied to London from [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], using the [[New River (England)|New River]] built by [[Hugh Myddleton]] and opened in 1613.
