{"title_page": "List of Pacific hurricanes", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=January 2013}}\nThis is a '''list of notable Pacific hurricanes''', subdivided by reason for [[notability]]. Notability means that it has met some criterion or achieved some statistic, or is part of a top ten for some superlative. It includes lists and rankings of [[Pacific hurricane]]s by different characteristics and impacts.\n\nCharacteristics include extremes of location, such as the northernmost or most equator-ward formation or position of a tropical cyclone. Other characteristics include its central pressure, windspeed, category on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]], [[tropical cyclogenesis|cyclogenesis]] outside of a normal [[Pacific hurricane|hurricane season's]] timeframe, or storms that remain unnamed despite forming after tropical cyclone naming began in 1960. Another characteristic is how long a system lasted from formation to dissipation. These include the cost of damage, the number of casualties, as well as meteorological statistics such as [[rain]]fall point maximum, wind speed, and minimum pressure.\n[[File:Patricia_2015-10-23_1730Z.jpg|thumb|[[Hurricane Patricia]] approaching [[Mexico]] on October 23, 2015]]\n\n==Impact==\n\n===Retired names===\n{{Main|List of retired Pacific hurricane names}}\n[[Hurricane Adolph (2001)|Adolph]] and [[Hurricane Ismael#Aftermath|Israel]] were removed from the list of names during and after the 2001 season due to political sensitivities.

Notability means that it has met some criterion or achieved some statistic, or is part of a top ten for some superlative. It includes lists and rankings of [[Pacific hurricane]]s by different characteristics and impacts.\n\nCharacteristics include extremes of location, such as the northernmost or most equator-ward formation or position of a tropical cyclone. Other characteristics include its central pressure, windspeed, category on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]], [[tropical cyclogenesis|cyclogenesis]] outside of a normal [[Pacific hurricane|hurricane season's]] timeframe, or storms that remain unnamed despite forming after tropical cyclone naming began in 1960. Another characteristic is how long a system lasted from formation to dissipation. These include the cost of damage, the number of casualties, as well as meteorological statistics such as [[rain]]fall point maximum, wind speed, and minimum pressure.\n[[File:Patricia_2015-10-23_1730Z.jpg|thumb|[[Hurricane Patricia]] approaching [[Mexico]] on October 23, 2015]]\n\n==Impact==\n\n===Retired names===\n{{Main|List of retired Pacific hurricane names}}\n[[Hurricane Adolph (2001)|Adolph]] and [[Hurricane Ismael#Aftermath|Israel]] were removed from the list of names during and after the 2001 season due to political sensitivities.

The cemetery no longer contains graves, the corpses having been interred in the Pakistani cemetery close to the mosque, however the walls, entrance and corner towers of the cemetery still remain intact, and they bear a clearly oriental Indian style. The cemetery is set well back from the road and remained hidden until surrounding woods and shrubbery were pruned and thinned.\n\nMonument Way is probably a reference to a much earlier structure in the area that was destroyed by natural causes in the mid-1800s:\n\n<blockquote>\"Early in the 17th century Sir [[Edward Zouch]] obtained the Manor of Woking and gained permission to demolish the old palace site.

It is ''commonly thought'' to be so named because of the [[Muslim Burial Ground, Horsell Common|Muslim Burial Ground]] established for Muslim Indian soldiers who died in the service of the British Empire in the Great War of 1914\u20131918. The cemetery no longer contains graves, the corpses having been interred in the Pakistani cemetery close to the mosque, however the walls, entrance and corner towers of the cemetery still remain intact, and they bear a clearly oriental Indian style. The cemetery is set well back from the road and remained hidden until surrounding woods and shrubbery were pruned and thinned.\n\nMonument Way is probably a reference to a much earlier structure in the area that was destroyed by natural causes in the mid-1800s:\n\n<blockquote>\"Early in the 17th century Sir [[Edward Zouch]] obtained the Manor of Woking and gained permission to demolish the old palace site. He used some of the material to build a new house \u2013 Hoe Place (now a private school) \u2013 with some of the Tudor bricks apparently being used in buildings such as The Old House in OLD WOKING and 'The Monument' \u2013 a tower that once stood on the hill where the Hoe Bridge Golf Course is today. It was Sir Edward's grandson, Sir James Zouch, who obtained the Market Charter for Woking in 1661, with the Market House (opposite the entrance to Church Street) being built in 1665.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterfalls.co.uk/AreaInfo/History/Woking/Woking17c.php |title=Area Info \u2013 An introduction to Woking's heritage \u2013 Woking through the ages \u2013 17th/18th Century Woking |publisher=Waterfalls |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:WokingStation.jpg|right|thumb|[[Woking railway station]], (south, platform 5, side]]\n{{stn|Woking}} is on the [[Alton Line]], [[Portsmouth Direct Line]], [[South Western Main Line]] and [[West of England Main Line]].

Thus people with original C/D group aerials, who live in poor reception areas, may struggle to pick up some channels (see [https://www.aerialsandtv.com/knowledge/transmitters/pontop-pike-transmitter#pontop-pike-graph graph]).\n\n==Services listed by frequency==\n\n===Analogue radio===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Frequency\n!kW\n!Service\n|-\n|88.5&nbsp;MHz\n|250\n|[[BBC Radio 2]]\n|-\n|90.7&nbsp;MHz\n|250\n|[[BBC Radio 3]]\n|-\n|92.9&nbsp;MHz\n|250\n|[[BBC Radio 4]]\n|-\n|95.4&nbsp;MHz\n|10\n|[[BBC Newcastle]]\n|-\n|98.1&nbsp;MHz\n|250\n|[[BBC Radio 1]]\n|-\n|100.3&nbsp;MHz\n|65\n|[[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]]\n|}\n\n===Digital radio===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Frequency\n!Block\n!kW<ref>Radio Listeners Guide 2010</ref>\n!Operator\n|-\n|222.064&nbsp;MHz\n|11D\n|6.3\n|[[Digital One]]\n|-\n|225.648&nbsp;MHz\n|12B\n|10\n|[[BBC National DAB]]\n|}\n\n===Digital television===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Frequency\n!UHF\n!kW<ref>Television Viewers Guide 2009</ref>\n!Operator\n!System\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=32}}\n|32\n|100\n|COM4 ([[S4C Digital Networks|SDN]])\n|[[DVB-T]]\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=33}}\n|33\n|5\n|LTVmux\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=34}}\n|34\n|100\n|COM5 ([[Arqiva]] A)\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=35}}\n|35\n|100\n|COM6 (Arqiva B)\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=39}}\n|39\n|100\n|PSB1 ([[BBC]] A)\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=42}}\n|42\n|100\n|PSB2 ([[Digital 3&4|D3&4]])\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=45}}\n|45\n|100\n|PSB3 (BBC B)\n|[[DVB-T2]]\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=55}}\n|55\n|19.498\n|COM7 (Arqiva C)\n|DVB-T2\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=56}}\n|56\n|19.498\n|COM8 (Arqiva D)\n|DVB-T2\n|}\n\n====Before 700MHz Clearence====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!{{no2}}Frequency\n!{{no2}}UHF\n!{{no2}}kW<ref>Television Viewers Guide 2009</ref>\n!{{no2}}Operator\n!{{no2}}System\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=33}}\n|33\n|33.8\n|COM7 ([[Arqiva|ARQ]] C)\n|[[DVB-T2]]\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=34}}\n|34\n|9.5\n|COM8 (ARQ D)\n|DVB-T2\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=49}}\n|49\n|100\n|PSB3 ([[BBC]] B)\n|DVB-T2\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=50}}\n|50\n|50\n|COM4 ([[S4C Digital Networks|SDN]])\n|[[DVB-T]]\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=54}}\n|54\n|100\n|PSB2 ([[Digital 3&4|D3&4]])\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=55}}\n|55\n|50\n|COM6 (ARQ B)\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=56}}\n|56\n|5\n|LTVmux\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=58}}\n|58\n|100\n|PSB1 (BBC A)\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=59}}\n|59\n|50\n|COM5 (ARQ A)\n|DVB-T\n|}\n\n====Before switchover====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!{{no2}}Frequency\n!{{no2}}UHF\n!{{no2}}kW<ref>Television Viewers Guide 2009</ref>\n!{{no2}}Operator\n!{{no2}}System\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=48}}\n|48\n|10\n|[[BBC]] (Mux 1)\n|[[DVB-T]]\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=53|off=neg}}\n|53-\n|10\n|[[Arqiva]] (Mux D)\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=55|off=pos}}\n|55+\n|10\n|[[Digital 3&4]] (Mux 2)\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=59|off=pos}}\n|59+\n|10\n|[[S4C Digital Networks|SDN]] (Mux A)\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=62|off=pos}}\n|62+\n|10\n|BBC (Mux B)\n|DVB-T\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=63}}\n|63\n|10\n|BBC B (Mux HD)\n|[[DVB-T2]]\n|-\n|{{UK DVB-T|ch=65|off=pos}}\n|65+\n|10\n|Arqiva (Mux C)\n|DVB-T\n|}\n\n===Analogue television===\nAnalogue television from Pontop Pike has now ceased permanently.

This building was built in 1890 and has always housed a hardware store, first by the Lewis Brothers, then Cruikshank and Kolln. The hardware store has been known as Kolln Hardware since 1933.

[[Charlie Houston]] was the leader of what was a small and happily united climbing party. After deciding the Abruzzi Ridge was most favorable, they made good progress up to the head of the ridge at {{convert|24700|ft}} on July 19, 1938. However, by then their supply lines were very extended, they were short of food and the monsoon seemed imminent. It was decided that Houston and [[Paul Petzoldt]] would make a last push to get as close to the summit as they could and then rejoin the rest of the party in descent. On July 21 the pair reached about {{convert|26000|ft}}. In favorable weather they were able to identify a suitable site for a higher camp and a clear route to the summit.{{sfnp|Kauffman|Putnam|1992|pp=25\u201327}}\n\nThe expedition was regarded as a success and no one had suffered serious injury. A suitable route up the Abruzzi Ridge had been explored in detail, good sites for tents had been found (sites that would go on to be used in many future expeditions) and they had identified the technically most difficult part of the climb, up [[House's Chimney]] at {{convert|22000|ft}} (named after [[Bill House]] who had led the two-hour climb up the rock face). The book the team jointly wrote, ''Five Miles High'' {{harv|Bates|Burdsall|1939}}, was also successful.

The American Alpine Club (AAC) president applied for an expedition permit via the [[Department of State]] \u2013 the British colonial authorities approved the plan for a reconnaissance, possibly leading to an attempt, in 1938 to be followed by an expedition in 1939 if the first attempt failed. Although Wiessner had been expected to lead the first expedition \u2013 he was probably the best American mountaineer and climber at the time \u2013 he backed down and suggested Houston replace him. Houston had considerable mountaineering experience \u2013 he had organized and achieved the first ascent of Alaska's [[Mount Foraker]] in 1934 and had been a climbing member on the [[British\u2013American Himalayan Expedition]] of 1936 which reached the top of [[Nanda Devi]], which was then and in 1938 was still the highest summit to have been climbed.{{sfnp|Kauffman|Putnam|1992|pp=23\u201324}} Their primary aim was to reconnoiter the three main ridges of K2, and make a summit attempt if possible.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=81\u201382}}\n\n=== Team members ===\n[[Robert Bates (mountaineer)|Bob Bates]] was a friend of Houston's and a fellow student at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] \u2013 he had twice been mountaineering in [[Alaska]]. Richard Burdsall had successfully climbed [[Mount Gongga]] in [[Sichuan]], China. [[Bill House]] had been with Wiessner on the first ascent of [[Mount Waddington]] in [[British Columbia]]. [[Paul Petzoldt]] was a very experienced mountain guide and rock climber in [[Wyoming]]'s [[Teton Range|Tetons]]. Unlike the others who were [[ivy League]] graduates, Petzoldt had not been to college.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=81\u201382}} Norman Streatfeild was a British army officer based in India who had been transport officer on a French Karakoram expedition. He was not a highly experienced mountaineer but was good at organising the porters and at deploying the equipment.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=81\u201382}}{{sfnp|Curran|2005|loc=873/3989}}\n\n=== Equipment ===\nThey had to experiment with what food to take, eventually deciding on {{convert|50|lb}} of [[pemmican]], beloved of polar explorers. It was not yet known that pemmican is far too fatty for high altitudes. They chose hard biscuits that did not soften when moist. Dried fruit and vegetables were beginning to be available and they took cereal along with powdered milk. {{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=83\u201384}}\n\nBoots were leather with [[hobnail]]s, specially made for them in England. Climbing ropes were [[manila]] and [[hemp]] \u2013 no [[nylon]]. The design of ice ax was for a long wooden shaft with a steel head forming a pick and adze.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=84\u201385}} Following the British example, and unlike Wiessner's expedition next year, they took very little technical climbing equipment \u2013 only ten pitons were thought sufficient. Petzoldt favoured modern devices but his professional climbing experience was not considered to be in his favor. Because he could not afford the trip, Petzoldt had been funded by another AAC member but he felt forced to spend some of his limited funds by secretly purchasing fifty pitons while he passed through Paris.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=84\u201386}}\n\n==Voyage and trek to K2 Base Camp==\n[[File:Approach to K2, 1938.svg|thumb|Approach and return routes between Srinagar and K2]]\nThe expedition set sail on April 14 from New York to [[Bombay]] via Europe.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=84\u201385}} They reached [[Rawalpindi]] on May 9 and drove just north of [[Srinagar]] to [[Wayil|Wayul]], at that time at the end of the road.

At Yuno the porters refused to work for the pay offered so Bates and Streatfeild rafted back down to Skardu, {{convert|28|mi}} down the torrential [[Shigar River|Shigar]] and [[River Indus|Indus]] rivers, to get more helpful porters. At Hoto they all had to cross the [[Braldu River]] over a {{convert|200|ft|adj=on}}-deep gorge across a \"rope\" bridge made from plaited willow twigs. Askole was reached on June 3 but there Petzoldt went down with what was later diagnosed as [[dengue fever]] so Houston, who was a doctor, stayed with him while the others went on. They climbed  the [[Glacier terminus|snout]] of the [[Baltoro Glacier]] and then reached Urdukas, a solitary grassy oasis just off the glacier which is the farthest local herdsmen go for grazing. At this point Houston and Petzoldt caught up with the main party.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=89\u201394}}\n\nOn June 12 they reached their site for Base Camp where the porters were paid off with instructions to return in 45 days.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n==Reconnaissance of possible ascent routes==\nBenefiting from the work done twenty-nine years earlier by the Duke of the Abruzzi expedition, Houston's party set out to review the various possible approaches to the summit.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n===1909 Duke of the Abruzzi exploration===\nThe Abruzzi party had included the photographer [[Vittorio Sella]] whose magnificent photographs were used and admired by later generations of explorers, giving a fine impression of the mountain faces and ridges of K2 and its surrounding mountains. At [[Concordia (Karakoram)|Concordia]], where the Baltoro and  Godwin-Austen glaciers merge, they had travelled up the latter. From what became the traditional base camp site they explored K2's northeast ridge, which they considered hopeless, so attempted to climb up the southeast ridge \u2013 now called the Abruzzi Ridge or Spur. Two [[Courmayeur]] guides reached about {{convert|21,000|ft}} but this only proved the party as a whole would not manage the climb. They then went on the western side of K2, up the Savoia Glacier to a place they called the Savoia Pass at {{convert|21870|ft}}, at the foot of the northwest ridge. Again they were thwarted so as a consolation they climbed high on [[Chogolisa]], to about {{convert|24275|ft}} \u2013 the highest altitude ever reached and one that would not be exceeded until the [[1922 British Mount Everest expedition]].{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=77\u201380}}\n\n===1938 reconnaissance===\n[[File:The Abruzzi ridge of K2 in profile.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Abruzzi Ridge from the west (expedition photo)]]\nThroughout the two weeks in June 1938 allocated to reconnaissance there was stormy weather.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=94\u201395}} Bates and Streatfeild ventured up the [[Godwin-Austen Glacier]] from where the south face and northeast ridge of K2 seemed impossible. They explored the Savoia Glacier but on three occasions failed to reach the Savoia Pass,  the way being blocked with crevasses and walls of ice. They had been hoping to find a route from this side because the 1909 survey had observed that the rock strata on the northwest ridge provided a step-like climbing route whereas on the other side, the Abruzzi Ridge, the rocks sloped downward giving insecure footing and poor places to pitch tents.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=93\u201394}}\n \nNear base camp the Abruzzi Ridge appeared to be a very difficult climb on mixed rock, ice and snow, continuously steep for over {{convert|8000|ft}} up to a shoulder at about {{convert|26000|ft}}. Above this the summit pyramid could be glimpsed where there was a hanging glacier threatening both the northeast and Abruzzi ridges. On June 28 Petzoldt and House favored attempting the Abruzzi Ridge whereas Houston and Burdsall preferred investigating the northeast ridge further. On the Abruzzi Ridge it was difficult to find anywhere at all suitable for pitching a tent until on July 2 Petzoldt found a small saddle point hidden away but suitable for several tents. This decided the line of attack and the location was to become Camp II.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=93\u201396}}\n\n== Abruzzi Ridge line of ascent ==\n[[File:K2 Abruzzi Spur 1939 American route and camps.svg|thumb|Abruzzi Ridge route]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | Locations of camps on mountain\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Camp \n! colspan=\"2\" | Altitude{{sfnp|Kauffman|Putnam|1992|pp=25\u201327}}\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Camp<br />established<br />{{refn|group=note|Dates in parentheses are when a camp was first used rather than when it was established (fully set up and stocked).

Streatfeild led a small party to the foot of [[Gasherbrum]] hoping to find the supply left by a French group in 1936. It turned out porters had looted the fuel but Streatfeild in turn acquired some cans of food. Pemba Kitar, and the cook, Ahdoo, went off down to Askole, a march expected to take seven days, to get porters to bring up a supply of firewood. Only eight days later they arrived back at Base Camp with ten porters bringing a massive amount of cedar wood. By using this for heat at Base Camp there was sufficient fuel on the mountain.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=96\u201398}}\n\nWhile this was going on supplies were being carried up the Ridge and, in awkward places, fixed ropes were being placed. Petzoldt's pitons were of tremendous help. [[Jumar]]s had not yet been invented so the climbing technique was to knot the hemp ropes in places and simply heave upwards, hand over hand. Pasang Kikuli, Phinsoo and Tse Tendrup did most of the load carrying as well as shifting rocks to level the platforms for tents.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|p=98}}{{refn|group=note|These three Sherpas were all on the [[1939 American Karakoram expedition to K2|1939 American K2 expedition]] where Pasang Kikuli and Phinsoo both died trying to rescue [[Dudley Wolfe]].}} As it turned out Camp III was sited in a dangerous position threatened by rock falls.

In those days pitons were of rather soft metal and were ineffective on hard rock so at {{convert|21500|ft}} House effectively had to [[Free climbing|free climb]] his way up the chimney without [[Climbing protection|protection]] because there were no alternatives for getting further up the ridge.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=99\u2013102}} It had been the hardest rock climb at that time at any comparable altitude.{{sfnp|Sale|2011|p=76}} There was then rapid progress through the Black Pyramid to reach above {{convert|25000|ft}} on July 19.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=100\u2013103}}\n\nWith everyone together at Camp VI they reviewed their situation \u2013 there was only ten days of fuel and food remaining. Concerned in case bad weather would delay a descent, they decided by a vote that Houston and Petzoldt would be the climbers to up to as high as possible.{{sfnp|Curran|2005|loc=938/3989}} It was thought that the mountaineering was now technically too difficult for Sherpas so that only the four sahibs would carry supplies up to  establish Camp VII \u2013 however they agreed to include Pasang Kikuli after he had pleaded with them. With Houston and Petzoldt at Camp VII on July 20 Houston was sure a summit attempt would be out of the question.{{refn|group=note|Petzoldt much later claimed that he had wanted to go on and that Houston had too much seen the purpose as reconnaissance and had never been sufficiently determined to reach the summit.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=107\u2013110}}}} They then discovered no matches had been included in their supplies but fortunately Houston had nine matches in his pocket. After preparing them carefully with grease they got the stove to light with the third match. In the morning three more matches were used for lighting the breakfast stove. On July 21, heading without camping gear towards the Shoulder in knee-deep snow Petzoldt was the stronger climber. By 13:00 there reached the more level Shoulder and traversed over to just {{convert|900|ft}} below the couloir (known later as [[Bottleneck (K2)|the Bottleneck]]).{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nAt that point Houston could go no higher and they turned back at 16:00 after Petzoldt had reached about {{convert|26000|ft}} where he found a site suitable for a tent for a future expedition.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=104\u2013105}}{{sfnp|Sale|2011|pp=77\u201378}} As darkness fell they got back to their tent where they managed to light the stove with their third and last remaining match.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|p=105}} Below Camp III on the way down Pasang Kikuli shouted out when he spotted a large rock shooting down towards them and they were only just able to take cover in time.

[[Charlie Houston]] was the leader of what was a small and happily united climbing party. After deciding the Abruzzi Ridge was most favorable, they made good progress up to the head of the ridge at {{convert|24700|ft}} on July 19, 1938. However, by then their supply lines were very extended, they were short of food and the monsoon seemed imminent. It was decided that Houston and [[Paul Petzoldt]] would make a last push to get as close to the summit as they could and then rejoin the rest of the party in descent. On July 21 the pair reached about {{convert|26000|ft}}. In favorable weather they were able to identify a suitable site for a higher camp and a clear route to the summit.{{sfnp|Kauffman|Putnam|1992|pp=25\u201327}}\n\nThe expedition was regarded as a success and no one had suffered serious injury. A suitable route up the Abruzzi Ridge had been explored in detail, good sites for tents had been found (sites that would go on to be used in many future expeditions) and they had identified the technically most difficult part of the climb, up [[House's Chimney]] at {{convert|22000|ft}} (named after [[Bill House]] who had led the two-hour climb up the rock face). The book the team jointly wrote, ''Five Miles High'' {{harv|Bates|Burdsall|1939}}, was also successful. The following year the [[1939 American Karakoram expedition]] took advantage of the reconnaissance to get very near the summit but their descent led to tragedy.\n\n== Background ==\n=== K2 ===\n[[File:The south face of K2 from near the Base Camp.jpg|thumb|upright|South face of [[K2]] showing 1938 Base Camp in foreground (expedition photo)]]\n[[K2]] is on the border between what in 1938 was the [[British Raj]] of India (now [[Pakistan]]) and the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. At {{convert|8611|m|ft|order=flip}} it is the highest point of the [[Karakoram]] range and the [[List of highest mountains#List|second highest mountain]] in the world. The mountain had been spotted in 1856 by the [[Great Trigonometrical Survey]] to [[Kashmir]]{{refn|group=note|The tallest mountains measured were called \"K1\" and \"K2\" and the higher one turned out to be K2.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|p=18}}}} and by 1861 [[Henry Godwin-Austen]] had reached the [[Baltoro Glacier]] and was able to get a clear view of K2 from the slopes of [[Masherbrum]].{{refn|group=note|Hence the earlier name of K2 was \"Mount Godwin-Austen\".{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|p=21}}}} He could see the descending glacier eventually drained to the [[Indus River]] and so the mountain was in the [[British Empire]].{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=18\u201321}} K2 is further north than the [[Himalaya]]n mountains so the climate is colder; the Karakoram range is wider than the Himalayan so more ice and snow is trapped there.{{sfnp|Curran|2005|loc=156/3989}}\n\n===History of climbing on the mountain===\n{{external media|title=''History of climbing K2''|headerimage=[[File:K-2 and Virgin peak.jpg|200px]]|caption=''Television programs''\n|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxL_bzt7Pyo Quest For K2 Savage Mountain]{{sfnp|Vogel|Aaronson|2000}}<br />1938 expedition starts at 07:20 minutes\n|video2=[http://mickconefrey.co.uk/films/entry/the-ghosts-of-k2 Mountain Men: The Ghosts of K2]{{sfnp|Conefrey|2001}}<br />1938 expedition starts at 05:35 minutes\n|video3=[https://www.cctv.org/watch-tv/programs/brotherhood-rope-k2-expedition-1953-dr-charles-houston Brotherhood of The Rope]{{sfnp|Houston|2005}} <br />Houston talking about [[1953 American Karakoram expedition|1953 expedition]] (start 05:50) and narrating film (starting 15:35) but also referring to 1938 expedition}}\nIn 1890 Roberto Lerco had entered the [[Baltoro Muztagh]] region of the [[Karakoram]].

The expedition examined ascent routes both north and south of the mountain and made best progress up the north-east ridge before they were forced to abandon their efforts.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=58\u201360}} Since that time K2 has developed the reputation of being a more difficult mountain to climb than [[Mount Everest]] \u2013 every route to the summit is tough.{{sfnp|Conefrey|2015|p=xii}}{{refn|group=note|K2 may be the most challenging of all the [[eight-thousander|eight-thousand-metre mountains]] although [[Annapurna]] has a higher death rate for climbers than either Everest or K2.{{sfnp|Day|2010|pp=181\u2013189}} Kauffman and Putnam liken the comparison between Everest and K2 to that between [[Mont Blanc]] and the [[Matterhorn]] in the [[Alps]].{{sfnp|Kauffman|Putnam|1992|p=18}}}}\n\nThe 1909 [[Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi|Duke of the Abruzzi]] expedition reached about {{convert|6250|m|ft|order=flip}} on the southeast ridge before deciding the mountain was unclimbable. This route later became known as the [[Abruzzi Spur|Abruzzi Ridge]] (or Abruzzi Spur) and eventually became regarded as the normal route to the summit.{{sfnp|Kauffman|Putnam|1992|pp=18\u201322}} In 1929 [[Prince Aimone, Duke of Aosta|Aimone de Savola-Aosta]], the nephew of the Duke of the Abruzzi, led an expedition to explore the upper Baltoro Glacier, near to K2.{{sfnp|Isserman|Weaver|2008|pp=198\u2013199}}\n\n== Preparation for 1938 expedition ==\n=== American  Alpine Club plans for 1938 and 1939 expeditions ===\nAt the [[American Alpine Club]]'s 1937 meeting, [[Charlie Houston]] and [[Fritz Wiessner]] were the main speakers and Wiessner proposed an expedition to climb K2 for the first time, an idea that was strongly supported. The American Alpine Club (AAC) president applied for an expedition permit via the [[Department of State]] \u2013 the British colonial authorities approved the plan for a reconnaissance, possibly leading to an attempt, in 1938 to be followed by an expedition in 1939 if the first attempt failed. Although Wiessner had been expected to lead the first expedition \u2013 he was probably the best American mountaineer and climber at the time \u2013 he backed down and suggested Houston replace him. Houston had considerable mountaineering experience \u2013 he had organized and achieved the first ascent of Alaska's [[Mount Foraker]] in 1934 and had been a climbing member on the [[British\u2013American Himalayan Expedition]] of 1936 which reached the top of [[Nanda Devi]], which was then and in 1938 was still the highest summit to have been climbed.{{sfnp|Kauffman|Putnam|1992|pp=23\u201324}} Their primary aim was to reconnoiter the three main ridges of K2, and make a summit attempt if possible.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=81\u201382}}\n\n=== Team members ===\n[[Robert Bates (mountaineer)|Bob Bates]] was a friend of Houston's and a fellow student at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] \u2013 he had twice been mountaineering in [[Alaska]]. Richard Burdsall had successfully climbed [[Mount Gongga]] in [[Sichuan]], China. [[Bill House]] had been with Wiessner on the first ascent of [[Mount Waddington]] in [[British Columbia]]. [[Paul Petzoldt]] was a very experienced mountain guide and rock climber in [[Wyoming]]'s [[Teton Range|Tetons]]. Unlike the others who were [[ivy League]] graduates, Petzoldt had not been to college.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=81\u201382}} Norman Streatfeild was a British army officer based in India who had been transport officer on a French Karakoram expedition. He was not a highly experienced mountaineer but was good at organising the porters and at deploying the equipment.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=81\u201382}}{{sfnp|Curran|2005|loc=873/3989}}\n\n=== Equipment ===\nThey had to experiment with what food to take, eventually deciding on {{convert|50|lb}} of [[pemmican]], beloved of polar explorers. It was not yet known that pemmican is far too fatty for high altitudes. They chose hard biscuits that did not soften when moist. Dried fruit and vegetables were beginning to be available and they took cereal along with powdered milk. {{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=83\u201384}}\n\nBoots were leather with [[hobnail]]s, specially made for them in England. Climbing ropes were [[manila]] and [[hemp]] \u2013 no [[nylon]]. The design of ice ax was for a long wooden shaft with a steel head forming a pick and adze.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=84\u201385}} Following the British example, and unlike Wiessner's expedition next year, they took very little technical climbing equipment \u2013 only ten pitons were thought sufficient. Petzoldt favoured modern devices but his professional climbing experience was not considered to be in his favor. Because he could not afford the trip, Petzoldt had been funded by another AAC member but he felt forced to spend some of his limited funds by secretly purchasing fifty pitons while he passed through Paris.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=84\u201386}}\n\n==Voyage and trek to K2 Base Camp==\n[[File:Approach to K2, 1938.svg|thumb|Approach and return routes between Srinagar and K2]]\nThe expedition set sail on April 14 from New York to [[Bombay]] via Europe.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=84\u201385}} They reached [[Rawalpindi]] on May 9 and drove just north of [[Srinagar]] to [[Wayil|Wayul]], at that time at the end of the road. Then it was a case of trekking over the [[Zoji La]] to [[Skardu]] and on via [[Askole]] to K2 Base Camp, a distance of {{convert|360|mi}}.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=85\u201387}} At Srinagar they had met with the six [[Sherpa people#Mountaineering|Sherpa]]s they had hired in advance and who had travelled from [[Darjeeling]]. Sherpas are of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Nepalis|Nepali]] origin but those seeking a career in mountain guiding based themselves at [[Darjeeling]] in India where pre-war British Everest expeditions had always done their recruiting.{{refn|group=note|After [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan independence]] in 1947 Sherpas were not permitted into the country so local [[Burusho people|Hunza]] high-altitude porters were employed by the [[1953 American Karakoram expedition|next American expedition]].{{sfnp|Curran|2005|loc=1206/3989}}}} A Sherpa was attached to each [[sahib]] \u2013 [[Pasang Kikuli]], who had been with Houston on the [[British-American Himalayan Expedition|British\u2013American Nanda Devi Expedition]] in 1936,{{refn|group=note|[[Bill Tilman]] had arranged for Pasang Kikuli to go on the [[1938 British Mount Everest expedition]] but Tilman agreed for him to accompany Houston instead.{{sfnp|Houston|1939b}}}} was again with Houston and was the [[Sardar#Modern usage|sirdar]] (chief Sherpa).{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=87\u201388}} The other Sherpas were Pemba Kitar, Tse Tendrup, Ang Pemba, Sonam, and Phinsoo. Three Kashmiri shikaris (huntsmen) were appointed to maintain Base Camp: Ahdoo the cook, a major-domo and a valet.{{sfnp|Houston|1939a|p=56, 69}}\n\n[[File:Crossing an ice-chasm of the Upper Baltoro glacier. Image from 1938 K2 expedition.jpg|thumb|Crossing a crevasse in the upper Baltoro Glacier (expedition photo)]]\nThey set off with less than one hundred porters and twenty-five ponies which could only be taken as far as Yuno where they were replaced by seventy-five additional porters.{{sfnp|Houston|1939a|pp=56, 58}}\nLocal porters were hired just for a few days before new ones were taken on. At Yuno the porters refused to work for the pay offered so Bates and Streatfeild rafted back down to Skardu, {{convert|28|mi}} down the torrential [[Shigar River|Shigar]] and [[River Indus|Indus]] rivers, to get more helpful porters. At Hoto they all had to cross the [[Braldu River]] over a {{convert|200|ft|adj=on}}-deep gorge across a \"rope\" bridge made from plaited willow twigs. Askole was reached on June 3 but there Petzoldt went down with what was later diagnosed as [[dengue fever]] so Houston, who was a doctor, stayed with him while the others went on. They climbed  the [[Glacier terminus|snout]] of the [[Baltoro Glacier]] and then reached Urdukas, a solitary grassy oasis just off the glacier which is the farthest local herdsmen go for grazing. At this point Houston and Petzoldt caught up with the main party.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=89\u201394}}\n\nOn June 12 they reached their site for Base Camp where the porters were paid off with instructions to return in 45 days.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n==Reconnaissance of possible ascent routes==\nBenefiting from the work done twenty-nine years earlier by the Duke of the Abruzzi expedition, Houston's party set out to review the various possible approaches to the summit.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n===1909 Duke of the Abruzzi exploration===\nThe Abruzzi party had included the photographer [[Vittorio Sella]] whose magnificent photographs were used and admired by later generations of explorers, giving a fine impression of the mountain faces and ridges of K2 and its surrounding mountains. At [[Concordia (Karakoram)|Concordia]], where the Baltoro and  Godwin-Austen glaciers merge, they had travelled up the latter. From what became the traditional base camp site they explored K2's northeast ridge, which they considered hopeless, so attempted to climb up the southeast ridge \u2013 now called the Abruzzi Ridge or Spur. Two [[Courmayeur]] guides reached about {{convert|21,000|ft}} but this only proved the party as a whole would not manage the climb. They then went on the western side of K2, up the Savoia Glacier to a place they called the Savoia Pass at {{convert|21870|ft}}, at the foot of the northwest ridge. Again they were thwarted so as a consolation they climbed high on [[Chogolisa]], to about {{convert|24275|ft}} \u2013 the highest altitude ever reached and one that would not be exceeded until the [[1922 British Mount Everest expedition]].{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=77\u201380}}\n\n===1938 reconnaissance===\n[[File:The Abruzzi ridge of K2 in profile.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Abruzzi Ridge from the west (expedition photo)]]\nThroughout the two weeks in June 1938 allocated to reconnaissance there was stormy weather.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=94\u201395}} Bates and Streatfeild ventured up the [[Godwin-Austen Glacier]] from where the south face and northeast ridge of K2 seemed impossible. They explored the Savoia Glacier but on three occasions failed to reach the Savoia Pass,  the way being blocked with crevasses and walls of ice. They had been hoping to find a route from this side because the 1909 survey had observed that the rock strata on the northwest ridge provided a step-like climbing route whereas on the other side, the Abruzzi Ridge, the rocks sloped downward giving insecure footing and poor places to pitch tents.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=93\u201394}}\n \nNear base camp the Abruzzi Ridge appeared to be a very difficult climb on mixed rock, ice and snow, continuously steep for over {{convert|8000|ft}} up to a shoulder at about {{convert|26000|ft}}. Above this the summit pyramid could be glimpsed where there was a hanging glacier threatening both the northeast and Abruzzi ridges. On June 28 Petzoldt and House favored attempting the Abruzzi Ridge whereas Houston and Burdsall preferred investigating the northeast ridge further. On the Abruzzi Ridge it was difficult to find anywhere at all suitable for pitching a tent until on July 2 Petzoldt found a small saddle point hidden away but suitable for several tents. This decided the line of attack and the location was to become Camp II.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=93\u201396}}\n\n== Abruzzi Ridge line of ascent ==\n[[File:K2 Abruzzi Spur 1939 American route and camps.svg|thumb|Abruzzi Ridge route]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | Locations of camps on mountain\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Camp \n! colspan=\"2\" | Altitude{{sfnp|Kauffman|Putnam|1992|pp=25\u201327}}\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Camp<br />established<br />{{refn|group=note|Dates in parentheses are when a camp was first used rather than when it was established (fully set up and stocked).

Streatfeild led a small party to the foot of [[Gasherbrum]] hoping to find the supply left by a French group in 1936. It turned out porters had looted the fuel but Streatfeild in turn acquired some cans of food. Pemba Kitar, and the cook, Ahdoo, went off down to Askole, a march expected to take seven days, to get porters to bring up a supply of firewood. Only eight days later they arrived back at Base Camp with ten porters bringing a massive amount of cedar wood. By using this for heat at Base Camp there was sufficient fuel on the mountain.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=96\u201398}}\n\nWhile this was going on supplies were being carried up the Ridge and, in awkward places, fixed ropes were being placed. Petzoldt's pitons were of tremendous help. [[Jumar]]s had not yet been invented so the climbing technique was to knot the hemp ropes in places and simply heave upwards, hand over hand. Pasang Kikuli, Phinsoo and Tse Tendrup did most of the load carrying as well as shifting rocks to level the platforms for tents.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|p=98}}{{refn|group=note|These three Sherpas were all on the [[1939 American Karakoram expedition to K2|1939 American K2 expedition]] where Pasang Kikuli and Phinsoo both died trying to rescue [[Dudley Wolfe]].}} As it turned out Camp III was sited in a dangerous position threatened by rock falls. Rocks dislodged by climbers higher up the mountain fell {{convert|500|ft}} punching holes in all three tents but fortunately no one was hit.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=98\u2013100}}{{refn|group=note|This site for Camp III was avoided by future expeditions as a major camp location.}} At this stage Streatfeild, Burdsall and three Sherpas left to go on further reconnaissance around the mountain and only Pasang Kikuli was  the only Sherpa to go any higher up the mountain.{{sfnp|Curran|2005|loc=911/3989}}\n\nCamp IV was close to the foot of an {{convert|80|ft}} vertical cliff and on July 14 Bill House managed to surmount the cliff (which they called [[House's Chimney]]) taking two and a half hours. In those days pitons were of rather soft metal and were ineffective on hard rock so at {{convert|21500|ft}} House effectively had to [[Free climbing|free climb]] his way up the chimney without [[Climbing protection|protection]] because there were no alternatives for getting further up the ridge.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=99\u2013102}} It had been the hardest rock climb at that time at any comparable altitude.{{sfnp|Sale|2011|p=76}} There was then rapid progress through the Black Pyramid to reach above {{convert|25000|ft}} on July 19.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=100\u2013103}}\n\nWith everyone together at Camp VI they reviewed their situation \u2013 there was only ten days of fuel and food remaining. Concerned in case bad weather would delay a descent, they decided by a vote that Houston and Petzoldt would be the climbers to up to as high as possible.{{sfnp|Curran|2005|loc=938/3989}} It was thought that the mountaineering was now technically too difficult for Sherpas so that only the four sahibs would carry supplies up to  establish Camp VII \u2013 however they agreed to include Pasang Kikuli after he had pleaded with them. With Houston and Petzoldt at Camp VII on July 20 Houston was sure a summit attempt would be out of the question.{{refn|group=note|Petzoldt much later claimed that he had wanted to go on and that Houston had too much seen the purpose as reconnaissance and had never been sufficiently determined to reach the summit.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=107\u2013110}}}} They then discovered no matches had been included in their supplies but fortunately Houston had nine matches in his pocket. After preparing them carefully with grease they got the stove to light with the third match. In the morning three more matches were used for lighting the breakfast stove. On July 21, heading without camping gear towards the Shoulder in knee-deep snow Petzoldt was the stronger climber. By 13:00 there reached the more level Shoulder and traversed over to just {{convert|900|ft}} below the couloir (known later as [[Bottleneck (K2)|the Bottleneck]]).{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nAt that point Houston could go no higher and they turned back at 16:00 after Petzoldt had reached about {{convert|26000|ft}} where he found a site suitable for a tent for a future expedition.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|pp=104\u2013105}}{{sfnp|Sale|2011|pp=77\u201378}} As darkness fell they got back to their tent where they managed to light the stove with their third and last remaining match.{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|p=105}} Below Camp III on the way down Pasang Kikuli shouted out when he spotted a large rock shooting down towards them and they were only just able to take cover in time. He explained that the \"snow men\" had warned him to look up just at the time.{{sfnp|Conefrey|2015|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|Conefrey writes of \"yeti\" but ''Five Miles High'' uses the term \"snow men\".{{sfnp|Bates|Burdsall|1939|p=247}}}}\n\n== Return to Srinagar and assessment==\n[[File:Skoro La - panoramio (5324).jpg|thumb|Skoro La (the low point between the two most prominent peaks)]]\nThe party got back to Base Camp by July 25, leaving the fixed ropes in place, and made the six-day trek back to Askole. Eleven more days took them to Srinagar \u2013 they were able to take a shorter route over the [[Skoro La]] pass and across the [[Deosai Plains]] because the snow had cleared since their outward trek.{{sfnp|Houston|1939b}}{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|p=105}}\n\nPetzoldt stayed on in India at an [[ashram]] but after the leader of the ashram (who was himself American) died in controversial circumstances he returned hurriedly home after there was the possibility of a charge of manslaughter.{{sfnp|Sale|2011|pp=77\u201378}}\n\nThe expedition was relatively small-scale and low-cost compared with the [[eight-thousander]] expeditions of the 1950s but it found a good route \u2013 the best route \u2013 to the summit, scaling the most difficult point and getting back without serious injury. It was a well run, united and successful reconnaissance. [[Ed Viesturs]] has described it as \"a magnificent achievement\".{{sfnp|Viesturs|Roberts|2009|p=110}} Speaking of the book of the expedition, ''Five Miles High'' {{harv|Bates|Burdsall|1939}}, Curran says that it shows a harmonious expedition at its very best and that it should be compulsory reading for anyone contemplating going to K2\".{{sfnp|Curran|2005|loc=965/3989}}  Sale describes it as \"one of the great expedition books\".{{sfnp|Sale|2011|p=78}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n*{{cite web |author1=American Alpine Club Library|title=K2 1938: The First American Karakoram Expedition |url=https://americanalpineclub.org/library-blog/2018/2/9/k2-1938-the-first-american-karakoram-expedition|publisher=American Alpine Club |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217225323/https://americanalpineclub.org/library-blog/2018/2/9/k2-1938-the-first-american-karakoram-expedition|archivedate=February 17, 2019|url-status=live|date=February 9, 2018|ref=harv|df=mdy-all}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bates |first1=Robert H. |last2=Burdsall|first2=Richard L.|display-authors=etal|title=Five miles high: the story of an attack on the second highest mountain in the world by the members of the first American Karakoram expedition |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.209003/page/n3|date=1940 |orig-year=1939|publisher=Robert Hale |location=London|ref={{sfnref|Bates|Burdsall|1939}}|df=mdy-all}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Conefrey|first1=Mick |title=The Ghosts of K2: the Epic Saga of the First Ascent |date=2015 |publisher=Oneworld |chapter=Chapter 2, The Harvard Boys|pages = 31\u201365|location=London |isbn=978-1-78074-595-4|ref=harv|df=mdy-all}}\n*{{cite book|last=Curran|first=Jim|title=K2: The Story Of The Savage Mountain|date=2005|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|isbn=978 1 444 77835 9|chapter=Chapter 6.
