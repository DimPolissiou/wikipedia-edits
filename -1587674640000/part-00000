It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including \"[[The Waste Land]]\" (1922), \"[[The Hollow Men]]\" (1925), \"[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]\" (1930), and ''[[Four Quartets]]'' (1943).<ref name=EB>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184705/T-S-Eliot \"Thomas Stearns Eliot\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.

Retrieved 6 March 2012.</ref>\n\n==Life==\n===Early life and education===\nThe [[Eliot family (America)|Eliots]] were a [[Boston Brahmin]] family with roots in England and [[New England]]. Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S.

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness.

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S.

His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America.

He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B.

Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, \"As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\"<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe poem is known for its obscure nature\u2014its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin.

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when a person who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in \"Ash-Wednesday\" showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about \"Ash-Wednesday\". [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone.

This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: \"[[Burnt Norton]]\" (1936), \"[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]\" (1940), \"[[The Dry Salvages]]\" (1941) and \"[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]\" (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n\"Burnt Norton\" is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds such as the bird, the roses, clouds and an empty pool. The meditation leads the narrator to reach \"the still point\" in which there is no attempt to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n\"East Coker\" continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n\"The Dry Salvages\" treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n\"Little Gidding\" (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the ''Quartets''. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the ''Quartets'' (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the ''Quartets'' end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p. 209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in \"East Coker\", the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S.

I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A.

S. |title=The Waste Land|publisher=Bartleby.com |year= 1922|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T.

Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]].

It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including \"[[The Waste Land]]\" (1922), \"[[The Hollow Men]]\" (1925), \"[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]\" (1930), and ''[[Four Quartets]]'' (1943).<ref name=EB>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184705/T-S-Eliot \"Thomas Stearns Eliot\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.

Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address \"American Literature and the American Language\" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].''

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

In 1915 he taught English at [[Birkbeck, University of London]].\n\nBy 1916, he had completed a doctoral dissertation for Harvard on \"Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of [[F. H.

The philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] took an interest in Vivienne while the newlyweds stayed in his flat.

Knopf Publishing Group, 2001, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe marriage was markedly unhappy, in part because of Vivienne's health problems. In a letter addressed to Ezra Pound, she covers an extensive list of her symptoms, which included a habitually high temperature, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[insomnia]], [[migraine]]s, and [[colitis]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Letters of T.S. Eliot: Volume 1, 1898\u20131922|year=1988|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|page=533}}</ref> This, coupled with apparent mental instability, meant that she was often sent away by Eliot and her doctors for extended periods of time in the hope of improving her health, and as time went on, he became increasingly detached from her. The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of mind out of which came ''The Waste Land''.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot, Volume 1, 1898\u20131922.''

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America.

He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B.

Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, \"As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\"<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe poem is known for its obscure nature\u2014its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.</ref>\n\nAmong its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and ''\"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]\"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.\n\n===\"The Hollow Men\"===\n{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}\n\"The Hollow Men\" appeared in 1925. For the critic [[Edmund Wilson]], it marked \"The nadir of the phase of despair and desolation given such effective expression in \"The Waste Land\".\"<ref>[[Edmund Wilson|Wilson, Edmund]]. \"Review of Ash Wednesday\", ''New Republic'', 20 August 1930.</ref> It is Eliot's major poem of the late 1920s. Similar to Eliot's other works, its themes are overlapping and fragmentary. Post-war Europe under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (which Eliot despised), the difficulty of hope and religious conversion, Eliot's failed marriage.<ref>See, for instance, the biographically oriented work of one of Eliot's editors and major critics, Ronald Schuchard.</ref>\n\n[[Allen Tate]] perceived a shift in Eliot's method, writing, \"The mythologies disappear altogether in 'The Hollow Men'.\" This is a striking claim for a poem as indebted to [[Dante]] as anything else in Eliot's early work, to say little of the modern English mythology\u2014the \"Old [[Guy Fawkes]]\" of the [[Gunpowder Plot]]\u2014or the colonial and [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] mythos of [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[James George Frazer]], which, at least for reasons of textual history, echo in ''The Waste Land''.<ref>Grant, Michael (ed.).

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when a person who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in \"Ash-Wednesday\" showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about \"Ash-Wednesday\". [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone.

This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: \"[[Burnt Norton]]\" (1936), \"[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]\" (1940), \"[[The Dry Salvages]]\" (1941) and \"[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]\" (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n\"Burnt Norton\" is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds such as the bird, the roses, clouds and an empty pool. The meditation leads the narrator to reach \"the still point\" in which there is no attempt to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n\"East Coker\" continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n\"The Dry Salvages\" treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n\"Little Gidding\" (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the ''Quartets''. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the ''Quartets'' (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the ''Quartets'' end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p. 209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in \"East Coker\", the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S. Eliot at the Institute for Advanced Study], ''The Institute Letter'', Spring 2007, p. 6.</ref><ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 Eliot, Thomas Stearns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119203650/https://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 |date=19 January 2015 }} IAS profile.</ref>\n\nRegarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, \"If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A.

S. |title=The Waste Land|publisher=Bartleby.com |year= 1922|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T. S. Eliot :: The Waste Land And Criticism |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=4 January 1965 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nLate in his career, Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing, in essays such as \"Poetry and Drama\",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/poetryanddrama029231mbp|title=Poetry And Drama|first=T.

S. |year= 1921|work= The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism|publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref> focused on the aesthetics of writing drama in verse.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n===Responses to his poetry===\nThe writer Ronald Bush notes that Eliot's early poems like \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]].

It is a generalization of the notion of a \"[[Line (mathematics)|straight line]]\" to a more general setting. \n\nThe term \"geodesic\" comes from ''[[geodesy]]'', the science of measuring the size and shape of [[Earth]]. In the original sense, a geodesic was the shortest route between two points on the Earth's [[Planetary surface|surface]]. For a [[spherical Earth]], it is a [[line segment|segment]] of a [[great circle]].  The term has been generalized to include measurements in much more general mathematical spaces; for example, in [[graph theory]], one might consider a [[Distance (graph theory)|geodesic]] between two [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]/nodes of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].\n\nIn a Riemannian manifold or submanifold geodesics are characterised by the property of having vanishing [[geodesic curvature]]. More generally, in the presence of an [[affine connection]], a geodesic is defined to be a curve whose [[Tangent space|tangent vector]]s remain parallel if they are [[parallel transport|transported]] along it. Applying this to the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of a [[Riemannian metric]] recovers the previous notion.\n\nGeodesics are of particular importance in [[general relativity]].  Timelike [[geodesics in general relativity]] describe the motion of [[free fall]]ing [[test particles]].\n\n==Introduction==\nThe shortest path between two given points in a curved space, assumed to be a [[differential manifold]], can be defined by using the [[equation]] for the [[Arc length|length]] of a [[curve]] (a function ''f'' from an [[open interval]] of '''[[Real number line|R]]''' to the space), and then minimizing this length between the points using the [[calculus of variations]]. This has some minor technical problems, because there is an infinite dimensional space of different ways to parameterize the shortest path. It is simpler to restrict the set of curves to those that are parameterized \"with constant speed\" 1, meaning that  the distance from ''f''(''s'') to ''f''(''t'') along the curve equals |''s''&minus;''t''|. Equivalently, a different quantity may be used, termed the energy of the curve; minimizing the energy leads to the same equations for a geodesic (here \"constant velocity\" is a consequence of minimization).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Intuitively, one can understand this second formulation by noting that an [[elastic band]] stretched between two points will contract its length, and in so doing will minimize its energy.  The resulting shape of the band is a geodesic.\n\nIt is possible that several different curves between two points minimize the distance, as is the case for two diametrically opposite points on a sphere. In such a case, any of these curves is a geodesic.\n\nA contiguous segment of a geodesic is again a geodesic.\n\nIn general, geodesics are not the same as \"shortest curves\" between two points, though the two concepts are closely related. The difference is that geodesics are only ''locally'' the shortest distance between points, and are parameterized with \"constant speed\". Going the \"long way round\" on a [[great circle]] between two points on a sphere is a geodesic but not the shortest path between the points. The map ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''t''<sup>2</sup> from the unit interval on the real number line to itself gives the shortest path between 0 and 1, but is not a geodesic because the velocity of the corresponding motion of a point is not constant.\n\nGeodesics are commonly seen in the study of [[Riemannian geometry]] and more generally [[metric geometry]]. In [[general relativity]], geodesics in [[spacetime]] describe the motion of [[point particle]]s under the influence of gravity alone. In particular, the path taken by a falling rock, an orbiting [[satellite]], or the shape of a [[planetary orbit]] are all geodesics in curved spacetime. More generally, the topic of [[sub-Riemannian geometry]] deals with the paths that objects may take when they are not free, and their movement is constrained in various ways.\n\nThis article presents the mathematical formalism involved in defining, finding, and proving the existence of geodesics, in the case of [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] and [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.  The article [[geodesic (general relativity)]] discusses the special case of general relativity in greater detail.\n\n===Examples===\n[[File:Transpolar geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid case A.svg|thumb|right|200px|\nA [[geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid|geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid]].]]\n[[File:Insect on a torus tracing out a non-trivial geodesic.gif|thumb|right|If an insect is placed on a surface and continually walks \"forward\", by definition it will trace out a geodesic.]]\nThe most familiar examples are the straight lines in [[Euclidean geometry]]. On a  [[sphere]], the images of geodesics are the  [[great circle]]s. The shortest path from point ''A'' to point ''B'' on a sphere is given by the shorter [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of the great circle passing through ''A'' and ''B''. If ''A'' and ''B'' are [[antipodal point]]s, then there are ''infinitely many'' shortest paths between them.  [[Geodesics on an ellipsoid]] behave in a more complicated way than on a sphere; in particular, they are not closed in general (see figure).\n\n==Metric geometry==\nIn [[metric geometry]], a geodesic is a curve which is everywhere [[locally]] a [[distance]] minimizer. More precisely, a [[curve]] {{nowrap|''\u03b3'' : ''I'' \u2192 ''M''}} from an interval ''I'' of the reals to the [[metric space]] ''M'' is a '''geodesic''' if there is a [[mathematical constant|constant]] {{nowrap|''v'' \u2265 0}} such that for any {{nowrap|''t'' \u2208 ''I''}} there is a neighborhood ''J'' of ''t'' in ''I'' such that for any {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>,\u2009''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''J''}} we have\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = v \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nThis generalizes the notion of geodesic for Riemannian manifolds. However, in metric geometry the geodesic considered is often equipped with [[Curve#Lengths of curves|natural parameterization]], i.e. in the above identity ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nIf the last equality is satisfied for all {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''I''}}, the geodesic is called a '''minimizing geodesic''' or '''shortest path'''.\n\nIn general, a metric space may have no geodesics, except constant curves. At the other extreme, any two points in a [[length metric space]] are joined by a minimizing sequence of [[rectifiable path]]s, although this minimizing sequence need not converge to a geodesic.\n\n==Riemannian geometry==\nIn a [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M'' with [[metric tensor]] ''g'', the length ''L'' of a continuously differentiable curve \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' is defined by\n:<math>L(\\gamma)=\\int_a^b \\sqrt{  g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t)) }\\,dt.</math>\nThe distance ''d''(''p'',\u2009''q'') between two points ''p'' and ''q'' of ''M'' is defined as the [[infimum]] of the length taken over all continuous, piecewise continuously differentiable curves \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' such that \u03b3(''a'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p'' and \u03b3(''b'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''. In Riemannian geometry, all geodesics are locally distance-minimizing paths, but the converse is not true. In fact, only paths that are both locally distance minimizing and parameterized proportionately to arc-length are geodesics. Another equivalent way of defining geodesics on a Riemannian manifold, is to define them as the minima of the following [[action (physics)|action]] or [[energy functional]]\n:<math>E(\\gamma)=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_a^b g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t))\\,dt.</math>\nAll minima of ''E'' are also minima of ''L'', but ''L'' is a bigger set since paths that are minima of ''L'' can be arbitrarily re-parameterized, while minima of ''E'' cannot.\nFor a piecewise <math>C^1</math> curve (more generally, a <math>W^{1,2}</math> curve), the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]] gives\n:<math>L(\\gamma)^2 \\le 2(b-a)E(\\gamma)</math>\nwith equality if and only if <math>g(\\gamma',\\gamma')</math> is equal to a constant a.e.  It happens that minimizers of <math>E(\\gamma)</math> also minimize <math>L(\\gamma)</math>, because they turn out to be affinely parameterized, and the inequality is an equality.  The usefulness of this approach is that the problem of seeking minimizers of ''E'' is a more robust variational problem.  Indeed, ''E'' is a \"convex function\" of <math>\\gamma</math>, so that within each isotopy class of \"reasonable functions\", one ought to expect existence, uniqueness, and regularity of minimizers.  In contrast, \"minimizers\" of the functional <math>L(\\gamma)</math> are generally not very regular, because arbitrary reparameterizations are allowed.\n\nThe [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s of motion for the functional ''E'' are then given in local coordinates by\n:<math>\\frac{d^2x^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{dx^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{dx^\\nu }{dt} = 0,</math>\nwhere <math>\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}</math> are the [[Christoffel symbols]] of the metric.  This is the '''geodesic equation''', discussed [[#Affine geodesics|below]].\n\n===Calculus of variations===\n\nTechniques of the classical [[calculus of variations]] can be applied to examine the energy functional ''E''.  The [[first variation]] of energy is defined in local coordinates by\n\n:<math>\\delta E(\\gamma)(\\varphi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi).</math>\n\nThe [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s of the first variation are precisely the geodesics.  The [[second variation]] is defined by\n\n:<math>\\delta^2 E(\\gamma)(\\varphi,\\psi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial s \\, \\partial t} \\right|_{s=t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi + s\\psi).</math>\n\nIn an appropriate sense, zeros of the second variation along a geodesic \u03b3 arise along [[Jacobi field]]s.  Jacobi fields are thus regarded as variations through geodesics.\n\nBy applying variational techniques from [[classical mechanics]], one can also regard [[geodesics as Hamiltonian flows]].  They are solutions of the associated [[Hamilton equation]]s, with (pseudo-)Riemannian metric taken as [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].\n\n==Affine geodesics==\n{{See also|Geodesics in general relativity}}\nA '''geodesic''' on a [[Differentiable manifold|smooth manifold]]  ''M'' with an [[affine connection]]  \u2207 is defined as a [[curve]] \u03b3(''t'') such that [[parallel transport]] along the curve preserves the tangent vector to the curve, so\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nat each point along the curve,  where <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> is the derivative with respect to <math>t</math>.  More precisely, in order to define the covariant derivative of <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> it is necessary first to extend <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> to a continuously differentiable [[vector field]] in an [[open set]].  However, the resulting value of ({{EquationNote|1}}) is independent of the choice of extension.\n\nUsing [[local coordinates]] on ''M'', we can write the '''geodesic equation''' (using the [[summation convention]]) as\n:<math>\\frac{d^2\\gamma^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{d\\gamma^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{d\\gamma^\\nu }{dt} = 0\\ ,</math>\nwhere <math>\\gamma^\\mu = x^\\mu \\circ \\gamma (t)</math> are the coordinates of the curve \u03b3(''t'') and <math>\\Gamma^{\\lambda }_{\\mu \\nu }</math> are the [[Christoffel symbol]]s of the connection \u2207.  This is an [[ordinary differential equation]] for the coordinates.  It has a unique solution, given an initial position and an initial velocity.  Therefore, from the point of view of [[classical mechanics]], geodesics can be thought of as trajectories of [[free particle]]s in a manifold. Indeed, the equation <math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math> means that the [[Acceleration (differential geometry)|acceleration vector]] of the curve has no components in the direction of the surface (and therefore it is perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at each point of the curve). So, the motion is completely determined by the bending of the surface. This is also the idea of general relativity where particles move on geodesics and the bending is caused by the gravity.\n\n===Existence and uniqueness===\nThe ''local existence and uniqueness theorem'' for geodesics states that geodesics on a smooth manifold with an [[affine connection]] exist, and are unique.  More precisely:\n\n:For any point ''p'' in ''M'' and for any vector ''V'' in ''T<sub>p</sub>M'' (the [[tangent space]] to ''M'' at ''p'') there exists a unique geodesic <math>\\gamma \\,</math> : ''I'' &rarr; ''M'' such that\n::<math>\\gamma(0) = p \\,</math> and\n::<math>\\dot\\gamma(0) = V,</math>\n:where ''I'' is a maximal [[open interval]] in '''R''' containing 0.\n\nThe proof of this theorem follows from the theory of  [[ordinary differential equation]]s, by noticing that the geodesic equation is a second-order ODE. Existence and uniqueness then follow from the [[Picard&ndash;Lindel\u00f6f theorem]] for the solutions of ODEs with prescribed initial conditions. \u03b3 depends [[smooth function|smoothly]] on both ''p'' and&nbsp;''V''.  \n\nIn general, ''I'' may not be all of '''R''' as for example for an open disc in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. Any {{mvar|\u03b3}} extends to all of {{mvar|\u211d}} if and only if {{mvar|M}} is [[geodesic manifold|geodesically complete]].\n\n===Geodesic flow===\nGeodesic [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]] is a local '''R'''-[[Group action (mathematics)|action]] on the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' of a manifold ''M'' defined in the following way\n\n:<math>G^t(V)=\\dot\\gamma_V(t)</math>\n\nwhere ''t''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''R''', ''V''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''TM'' and <math>\\gamma_V</math> denotes the geodesic with initial data <math>\\dot\\gamma_V(0)=V</math>. Thus,  ''<math>G^t</math>''(''V'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;exp(''tV'') is the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] of the vector ''tV''.  A closed orbit of the geodesic flow corresponds to a [[closed geodesic]] on&nbsp;''M''.\n\nOn a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, the geodesic flow is identified with a [[Hamiltonian flow]] on the cotangent bundle.  The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] is then given by the inverse of the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric, evaluated against the [[canonical one-form]]. In particular the flow preserves the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric <math>g</math>, i.e.\n\n: <math>g(G^t(V),G^t(V))=g(V,V). \\, </math>\n\nIn particular, when ''V'' is a unit vector, <math>\\gamma_V</math> remains unit speed throughout, so the geodesic flow is tangent to the [[unit tangent bundle]].  [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] implies invariance of a kinematic measure on the unit tangent bundle.\n\n===Geodesic spray===\nThe geodesic flow defines a family of curves in the [[tangent bundle]]. The derivatives of these curves define a [[vector field]]  on the [[total space]] of the tangent bundle, known as the [[spray (mathematics)|geodesic spray]].\n\nMore precisely, an affine connection gives rise to a splitting of the [[double tangent bundle]] TT''M'' into [[horizontal bundle|horizontal]] and [[vertical bundle]]s:\n:<math>TTM = H\\oplus V.</math>\nThe geodesic spray is the unique horizontal vector field ''W'' satisfying\n:<math>\\pi_* W_v = v\\,</math>\nat each point ''v''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''; here \u03c0<sub>\u2217</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;TT''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;T''M'' denotes the [[pushforward (differential)]] along the projection \u03c0&nbsp;:&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' associated to the tangent bundle.\n\nMore generally, the same construction allows one to construct a vector field for any [[Ehresmann connection]] on the tangent bundle.  For the resulting vector field to be a spray (on the deleted tangent bundle T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0}) it is enough that the connection be equivariant under positive rescalings: it need not be linear.  That is, (cf. [[Ehresmann connection#Vector bundles and covariant derivatives]]) it is enough that the horizontal distribution satisfy\n:<math>H_{\\lambda X} = d(S_\\lambda)_X H_X\\,</math>\nfor every ''X''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0} and \u03bb&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.  Here ''d''(''S''<sub>\u03bb</sub>) is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] along the scalar homothety <math>S_\\lambda: X\\mapsto \\lambda X.</math>  A particular case of a non-linear connection arising in this manner is that associated to a [[Finsler manifold]].\n\n===Affine and projective geodesics===\nEquation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is invariant under affine reparameterizations; that is, parameterizations of the form\n:<math>t\\mapsto at+b</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are constant real numbers. Thus apart from specifying a certain class of embedded curves, the geodesic equation also determines a preferred class of parameterizations on each of the curves. Accordingly, solutions of ({{EquationNote|1}}) are called geodesics with '''affine parameter'''.\n\nAn affine connection is ''determined by'' its family of affinely parameterized geodesics, up to [[torsion tensor|torsion]] {{harv|Spivak|1999|loc=Chapter 6, Addendum I}}.  The torsion itself does not, in fact, affect the family of geodesics, since the geodesic equation depends only on the symmetric part of the connection.  More precisely, if <math>\\nabla, \\bar{\\nabla}</math> are two connections such that the difference tensor\n:<math>D(X,Y) = \\nabla_XY-\\bar{\\nabla}_XY</math>\nis [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]], then <math>\\nabla</math> and <math>\\bar{\\nabla}</math> have the same geodesics, with the same affine parameterizations. Furthermore, there is a unique connection having the same geodesics as  <math>\\nabla</math>, but with vanishing torsion.\n\nGeodesics without a particular parameterization are described by a [[projective connection]].\n\n==Computational methods==\nEfficient solvers for the minimal geodesic problem on surfaces posed as [[eikonal equation]]s have been proposed by Kimmel and others.<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Kimmel |first2=A. |last2=Amir |first3=A.

It is a generalization of the notion of a \"[[Line (mathematics)|straight line]]\" to a more general setting. \n\nThe term \"geodesic\" comes from ''[[geodesy]]'', the science of measuring the size and shape of [[Earth]]. In the original sense, a geodesic was the shortest route between two points on the Earth's [[Planetary surface|surface]]. For a [[spherical Earth]], it is a [[line segment|segment]] of a [[great circle]].  The term has been generalized to include measurements in much more general mathematical spaces; for example, in [[graph theory]], one might consider a [[Distance (graph theory)|geodesic]] between two [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]/nodes of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].\n\nIn a Riemannian manifold or submanifold geodesics are characterised by the property of having vanishing [[geodesic curvature]]. More generally, in the presence of an [[affine connection]], a geodesic is defined to be a curve whose [[Tangent space|tangent vector]]s remain parallel if they are [[parallel transport|transported]] along it. Applying this to the [[Levi-Civita connection]] of a [[Riemannian metric]] recovers the previous notion.\n\nGeodesics are of particular importance in [[general relativity]].  Timelike [[geodesics in general relativity]] describe the motion of [[free fall]]ing [[test particles]].\n\n==Introduction==\nThe shortest path between two given points in a curved space, assumed to be a [[differential manifold]], can be defined by using the [[equation]] for the [[Arc length|length]] of a [[curve]] (a function ''f'' from an [[open interval]] of '''[[Real number line|R]]''' to the space), and then minimizing this length between the points using the [[calculus of variations]]. This has some minor technical problems, because there is an infinite dimensional space of different ways to parameterize the shortest path. It is simpler to restrict the set of curves to those that are parameterized \"with constant speed\" 1, meaning that  the distance from ''f''(''s'') to ''f''(''t'') along the curve equals |''s''&minus;''t''|. Equivalently, a different quantity may be used, termed the energy of the curve; minimizing the energy leads to the same equations for a geodesic (here \"constant velocity\" is a consequence of minimization).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Intuitively, one can understand this second formulation by noting that an [[elastic band]] stretched between two points will contract its length, and in so doing will minimize its energy.  The resulting shape of the band is a geodesic.\n\nIt is possible that several different curves between two points minimize the distance, as is the case for two diametrically opposite points on a sphere. In such a case, any of these curves is a geodesic.\n\nA contiguous segment of a geodesic is again a geodesic.\n\nIn general, geodesics are not the same as \"shortest curves\" between two points, though the two concepts are closely related. The difference is that geodesics are only ''locally'' the shortest distance between points, and are parameterized with \"constant speed\". Going the \"long way round\" on a [[great circle]] between two points on a sphere is a geodesic but not the shortest path between the points. The map ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''t''<sup>2</sup> from the unit interval on the real number line to itself gives the shortest path between 0 and 1, but is not a geodesic because the velocity of the corresponding motion of a point is not constant.\n\nGeodesics are commonly seen in the study of [[Riemannian geometry]] and more generally [[metric geometry]]. In [[general relativity]], geodesics in [[spacetime]] describe the motion of [[point particle]]s under the influence of gravity alone. In particular, the path taken by a falling rock, an orbiting [[satellite]], or the shape of a [[planetary orbit]] are all geodesics in curved spacetime. More generally, the topic of [[sub-Riemannian geometry]] deals with the paths that objects may take when they are not free, and their movement is constrained in various ways.\n\nThis article presents the mathematical formalism involved in defining, finding, and proving the existence of geodesics, in the case of [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] and [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.  The article [[geodesic (general relativity)]] discusses the special case of general relativity in greater detail.\n\n===Examples===\n[[File:Transpolar geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid case A.svg|thumb|right|200px|\nA [[geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid|geodesic on a triaxial ellipsoid]].]]\n[[File:Insect on a torus tracing out a non-trivial geodesic.gif|thumb|right|If an insect is placed on a surface and continually walks \"forward\", by definition it will trace out a geodesic.]]\nThe most familiar examples are the straight lines in [[Euclidean geometry]]. On a  [[sphere]], the images of geodesics are the  [[great circle]]s. The shortest path from point ''A'' to point ''B'' on a sphere is given by the shorter [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of the great circle passing through ''A'' and ''B''. If ''A'' and ''B'' are [[antipodal point]]s, then there are ''infinitely many'' shortest paths between them.  [[Geodesics on an ellipsoid]] behave in a more complicated way than on a sphere; in particular, they are not closed in general (see figure).\n\n==Metric geometry==\nIn [[metric geometry]], a geodesic is a curve which is everywhere [[locally]] a [[distance]] minimizer. More precisely, a [[curve]] {{nowrap|''\u03b3'' : ''I'' \u2192 ''M''}} from an interval ''I'' of the reals to the [[metric space]] ''M'' is a '''geodesic''' if there is a [[mathematical constant|constant]] {{nowrap|''v'' \u2265 0}} such that for any {{nowrap|''t'' \u2208 ''I''}} there is a neighborhood ''J'' of ''t'' in ''I'' such that for any {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>,\u2009''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''J''}} we have\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = v \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nThis generalizes the notion of geodesic for Riemannian manifolds. However, in metric geometry the geodesic considered is often equipped with [[Curve#Lengths of curves|natural parameterization]], i.e. in the above identity ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and\n\n:<math>d(\\gamma(t_1),\\gamma(t_2)) = \\left| t_1 - t_2 \\right| .</math>\n\nIf the last equality is satisfied for all {{nowrap|''t''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''I''}}, the geodesic is called a '''minimizing geodesic''' or '''shortest path'''.\n\nIn general, a metric space may have no geodesics, except constant curves. At the other extreme, any two points in a [[length metric space]] are joined by a minimizing sequence of [[rectifiable path]]s, although this minimizing sequence need not converge to a geodesic.\n\n==Riemannian geometry==\nIn a [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M'' with [[metric tensor]] ''g'', the length ''L'' of a continuously differentiable curve \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' is defined by\n:<math>L(\\gamma)=\\int_a^b \\sqrt{  g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t)) }\\,dt.</math>\nThe distance ''d''(''p'',\u2009''q'') between two points ''p'' and ''q'' of ''M'' is defined as the [[infimum]] of the length taken over all continuous, piecewise continuously differentiable curves \u03b3&nbsp;:&nbsp;[''a'',''b'']&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' such that \u03b3(''a'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p'' and \u03b3(''b'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''. In Riemannian geometry, all geodesics are locally distance-minimizing paths, but the converse is not true. In fact, only paths that are both locally distance minimizing and parameterized proportionately to arc-length are geodesics. Another equivalent way of defining geodesics on a Riemannian manifold, is to define them as the minima of the following [[action (physics)|action]] or [[energy functional]]\n:<math>E(\\gamma)=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_a^b g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot\\gamma(t),\\dot\\gamma(t))\\,dt.</math>\nAll minima of ''E'' are also minima of ''L'', but ''L'' is a bigger set since paths that are minima of ''L'' can be arbitrarily re-parameterized, while minima of ''E'' cannot.\nFor a piecewise <math>C^1</math> curve (more generally, a <math>W^{1,2}</math> curve), the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]] gives\n:<math>L(\\gamma)^2 \\le 2(b-a)E(\\gamma)</math>\nwith equality if and only if <math>g(\\gamma',\\gamma')</math> is equal to a constant a.e.  It happens that minimizers of <math>E(\\gamma)</math> also minimize <math>L(\\gamma)</math>, because they turn out to be affinely parameterized, and the inequality is an equality.  The usefulness of this approach is that the problem of seeking minimizers of ''E'' is a more robust variational problem.  Indeed, ''E'' is a \"convex function\" of <math>\\gamma</math>, so that within each isotopy class of \"reasonable functions\", one ought to expect existence, uniqueness, and regularity of minimizers.  In contrast, \"minimizers\" of the functional <math>L(\\gamma)</math> are generally not very regular, because arbitrary reparameterizations are allowed.\n\nThe [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s of motion for the functional ''E'' are then given in local coordinates by\n:<math>\\frac{d^2x^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{dx^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{dx^\\nu }{dt} = 0,</math>\nwhere <math>\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}</math> are the [[Christoffel symbols]] of the metric.  This is the '''geodesic equation''', discussed [[#Affine geodesics|below]].\n\n===Calculus of variations===\n\nTechniques of the classical [[calculus of variations]] can be applied to examine the energy functional ''E''.  The [[first variation]] of energy is defined in local coordinates by\n\n:<math>\\delta E(\\gamma)(\\varphi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi).</math>\n\nThe [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s of the first variation are precisely the geodesics.  The [[second variation]] is defined by\n\n:<math>\\delta^2 E(\\gamma)(\\varphi,\\psi) = \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial s \\, \\partial t} \\right|_{s=t=0} E(\\gamma + t\\varphi + s\\psi).</math>\n\nIn an appropriate sense, zeros of the second variation along a geodesic \u03b3 arise along [[Jacobi field]]s.  Jacobi fields are thus regarded as variations through geodesics.\n\nBy applying variational techniques from [[classical mechanics]], one can also regard [[geodesics as Hamiltonian flows]].  They are solutions of the associated [[Hamilton equation]]s, with (pseudo-)Riemannian metric taken as [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].\n\n==Affine geodesics==\n{{See also|Geodesics in general relativity}}\nA '''geodesic''' on a [[Differentiable manifold|smooth manifold]]  ''M'' with an [[affine connection]]  \u2207 is defined as a [[curve]] \u03b3(''t'') such that [[parallel transport]] along the curve preserves the tangent vector to the curve, so\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nat each point along the curve,  where <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> is the derivative with respect to <math>t</math>.  More precisely, in order to define the covariant derivative of <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> it is necessary first to extend <math>\\dot\\gamma</math> to a continuously differentiable [[vector field]] in an [[open set]].  However, the resulting value of ({{EquationNote|1}}) is independent of the choice of extension.\n\nUsing [[local coordinates]] on ''M'', we can write the '''geodesic equation''' (using the [[summation convention]]) as\n:<math>\\frac{d^2\\gamma^\\lambda }{dt^2} + \\Gamma^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }\\frac{d\\gamma^\\mu }{dt}\\frac{d\\gamma^\\nu }{dt} = 0\\ ,</math>\nwhere <math>\\gamma^\\mu = x^\\mu \\circ \\gamma (t)</math> are the coordinates of the curve \u03b3(''t'') and <math>\\Gamma^{\\lambda }_{\\mu \\nu }</math> are the [[Christoffel symbol]]s of the connection \u2207.  This is an [[ordinary differential equation]] for the coordinates.  It has a unique solution, given an initial position and an initial velocity.  Therefore, from the point of view of [[classical mechanics]], geodesics can be thought of as trajectories of [[free particle]]s in a manifold. Indeed, the equation <math> \\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} \\dot\\gamma= 0</math> means that the [[Acceleration (differential geometry)|acceleration vector]] of the curve has no components in the direction of the surface (and therefore it is perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at each point of the curve). So, the motion is completely determined by the bending of the surface. This is also the idea of general relativity where particles move on geodesics and the bending is caused by the gravity.\n\n===Existence and uniqueness===\nThe ''local existence and uniqueness theorem'' for geodesics states that geodesics on a smooth manifold with an [[affine connection]] exist, and are unique.  More precisely:\n\n:For any point ''p'' in ''M'' and for any vector ''V'' in ''T<sub>p</sub>M'' (the [[tangent space]] to ''M'' at ''p'') there exists a unique geodesic <math>\\gamma \\,</math> : ''I'' &rarr; ''M'' such that\n::<math>\\gamma(0) = p \\,</math> and\n::<math>\\dot\\gamma(0) = V,</math>\n:where ''I'' is a maximal [[open interval]] in '''R''' containing 0.\n\nThe proof of this theorem follows from the theory of  [[ordinary differential equation]]s, by noticing that the geodesic equation is a second-order ODE. Existence and uniqueness then follow from the [[Picard&ndash;Lindel\u00f6f theorem]] for the solutions of ODEs with prescribed initial conditions. \u03b3 depends [[smooth function|smoothly]] on both ''p'' and&nbsp;''V''.  \n\nIn general, ''I'' may not be all of '''R''' as for example for an open disc in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. Any {{mvar|\u03b3}} extends to all of {{mvar|\u211d}} if and only if {{mvar|M}} is [[geodesic manifold|geodesically complete]].\n\n===Geodesic flow===\nGeodesic [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]] is a local '''R'''-[[Group action (mathematics)|action]] on the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' of a manifold ''M'' defined in the following way\n\n:<math>G^t(V)=\\dot\\gamma_V(t)</math>\n\nwhere ''t''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''R''', ''V''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''TM'' and <math>\\gamma_V</math> denotes the geodesic with initial data <math>\\dot\\gamma_V(0)=V</math>. Thus,  ''<math>G^t</math>''(''V'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;exp(''tV'') is the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] of the vector ''tV''.  A closed orbit of the geodesic flow corresponds to a [[closed geodesic]] on&nbsp;''M''.\n\nOn a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, the geodesic flow is identified with a [[Hamiltonian flow]] on the cotangent bundle.  The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] is then given by the inverse of the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric, evaluated against the [[canonical one-form]]. In particular the flow preserves the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric <math>g</math>, i.e.\n\n: <math>g(G^t(V),G^t(V))=g(V,V). \\, </math>\n\nIn particular, when ''V'' is a unit vector, <math>\\gamma_V</math> remains unit speed throughout, so the geodesic flow is tangent to the [[unit tangent bundle]].  [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] implies invariance of a kinematic measure on the unit tangent bundle.\n\n===Geodesic spray===\nThe geodesic flow defines a family of curves in the [[tangent bundle]]. The derivatives of these curves define a [[vector field]]  on the [[total space]] of the tangent bundle, known as the [[spray (mathematics)|geodesic spray]].\n\nMore precisely, an affine connection gives rise to a splitting of the [[double tangent bundle]] TT''M'' into [[horizontal bundle|horizontal]] and [[vertical bundle]]s:\n:<math>TTM = H\\oplus V.</math>\nThe geodesic spray is the unique horizontal vector field ''W'' satisfying\n:<math>\\pi_* W_v = v\\,</math>\nat each point ''v''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''; here \u03c0<sub>\u2217</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;TT''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;T''M'' denotes the [[pushforward (differential)]] along the projection \u03c0&nbsp;:&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''M'' associated to the tangent bundle.\n\nMore generally, the same construction allows one to construct a vector field for any [[Ehresmann connection]] on the tangent bundle.  For the resulting vector field to be a spray (on the deleted tangent bundle T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0}) it is enough that the connection be equivariant under positive rescalings: it need not be linear.  That is, (cf. [[Ehresmann connection#Vector bundles and covariant derivatives]]) it is enough that the horizontal distribution satisfy\n:<math>H_{\\lambda X} = d(S_\\lambda)_X H_X\\,</math>\nfor every ''X''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;T''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0} and \u03bb&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.  Here ''d''(''S''<sub>\u03bb</sub>) is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] along the scalar homothety <math>S_\\lambda: X\\mapsto \\lambda X.</math>  A particular case of a non-linear connection arising in this manner is that associated to a [[Finsler manifold]].\n\n===Affine and projective geodesics===\nEquation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is invariant under affine reparameterizations; that is, parameterizations of the form\n:<math>t\\mapsto at+b</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are constant real numbers. Thus apart from specifying a certain class of embedded curves, the geodesic equation also determines a preferred class of parameterizations on each of the curves. Accordingly, solutions of ({{EquationNote|1}}) are called geodesics with '''affine parameter'''.\n\nAn affine connection is ''determined by'' its family of affinely parameterized geodesics, up to [[torsion tensor|torsion]] {{harv|Spivak|1999|loc=Chapter 6, Addendum I}}.  The torsion itself does not, in fact, affect the family of geodesics, since the geodesic equation depends only on the symmetric part of the connection.  More precisely, if <math>\\nabla, \\bar{\\nabla}</math> are two connections such that the difference tensor\n:<math>D(X,Y) = \\nabla_XY-\\bar{\\nabla}_XY</math>\nis [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]], then <math>\\nabla</math> and <math>\\bar{\\nabla}</math> have the same geodesics, with the same affine parameterizations. Furthermore, there is a unique connection having the same geodesics as  <math>\\nabla</math>, but with vanishing torsion.\n\nGeodesics without a particular parameterization are described by a [[projective connection]].\n\n==Computational methods==\nEfficient solvers for the minimal geodesic problem on surfaces posed as [[eikonal equation]]s have been proposed by Kimmel and others.<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Kimmel |first2=A. |last2=Amir |first3=A.

The most common raw material is [[cattle]] hide. It can be produced at manufacturing scales ranging from [[artisan]] to modern [[heavy industry|industrial scale]].\n\nLeather is used to make a variety of articles, including footwear, automobile seats, clothing, bags, book bindings, fashion accessories, and furniture. It is produced in a wide variety of types and styles and decorated by a wide range of techniques. The earliest record of leather artifacts dates back to 2200 BC.\n\n==Production processes==\n[[File:Ledertrocknung in Suai.jpg|thumb|Drying of leather in [[East Timor]]]]\n[[File:Leather tanning, Fes.jpg|thumb|Leather tanning in [[Fes]], [[Morocco]]]]\n[[File:Tanned leather.JPG|thumb|Tanned leather in [[Marrakech]]]]\n{{Main|Leather production processes}}\n\nThe leather manufacturing process is divided into three fundamental subprocesses: preparatory stages, tanning, and crusting. A further subprocess, finishing, can be added into the leather process sequence, but not all leathers receive finishing.\n\nThe preparatory stages are when the hide is prepared for tanning. Preparatory stages may include: soaking, hair removal, [[liming (leather processing)|liming]], [[deliming]], bating, [[bleaching]], and [[pickling]].\n\n[[Tanning (leather)|Tanning]] is a process that stabilizes the [[protein]]s, particularly [[collagen]], of the raw hide to increase the thermal, chemical and microbiological stability of the hides and skins, making it suitable for a wide variety of end applications. The principal difference between raw and tanned hides is that raw hides dry out to form a hard, inflexible material that, when rewetted, will putrefy, while tanned material dries to a flexible form that does not become putrid when rewetted.\n\nMany tanning methods and materials exist. The typical process sees tanners load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a tank that contains the tanning \"liquor\". The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis, and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide. Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the liquor's pH in a process called basification, which fixes the tanning material to the leather. The more tanning material fixed, the higher the leather's hydrothermal stability and [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinkage]] temperature resistance.\n\nCrusting is a process that thins and lubricates leather. It often includes a coloring operation. Chemicals added during crusting must be fixed in place. Crusting culminates with a drying and softening operation, and may include splitting, shaving, [[dyeing]], [[Whitening (leather processing)|whitening]] or other methods.\n\nFor some leathers, tanners apply a surface coating, called \"finishing\". Finishing operations can include oiling, brushing, buffing, coating, polishing, embossing, [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazing]], or [[Tumble finishing|tumbling]], among others.\n\nLeather can be oiled to improve its water resistance. This [[currying (leather)|currying]] process after tanning supplements the natural oils remaining in the leather itself, which can be washed out through repeated exposure to water. Frequent oiling of leather, with [[mink oil]], [[neatsfoot oil]], or a similar material keeps it supple and improves its lifespan dramatically.<ref>{{cite book|author=NIIR Board of Consultants|title=Leather Processing & Tanning Technology Handbook|date=2011|publisher=NIIR Project Consultancy Services|isbn=9788190568593|page=323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hbKkCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA324&dq=why+oil+leather&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwis0e6_lf_SAhVITrwKHXp5B9AQ6AEIJzAD#v=onepage&q=why%20oil%20leather&f=false|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Tanning methods===\nTanning processes largely differ in which chemicals are used in the tanning liquor. Some common types include:\n* '''{{visible anchor|Vegetable-tanned leather}}''' is tanned using [[tannin]]s extracted from [[vegetable matter]], such as tree [[tanbark|bark]] prepared in [[bark mill]]s. It is the oldest known method. It is supple and light brown in color, with the exact shade depending on the mix of materials and the color of the skin. The [[tan (color)|color tan]] derives its name from the appearance of undyed vegetable-tanned leather. Vegetable-tanned leather is not stable in water; it tends to discolor, and if left to soak and then dry, it shrinks and becomes harder, a feature of vegetable-tanned leather that is exploited in traditional shoemaking. In hot water, it shrinks drastically and partly congeals, becoming rigid and eventually brittle. [[Boiled leather]] is an example of this, where the leather has been hardened by being immersed in hot water, or in boiled [[wax]] or similar substances. Historically, it was occasionally used as [[armor]] after hardening, and it has also been used for [[book binding]]. \n* '''Chrome-tanned leather''', invented in 1858, is tanned using [[Chromium (III) sulfate|chromium sulfate]] and other [[chromium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s . It is also known as \"wet blue\" for the pale blue color of the undyed leather. The chrome tanning method usually takes approximately one day to complete, making it best suited for large-scale industrial use. This is the most common method in modern use. It is more supple and pliable than vegetable-tanned leather and does not discolor or lose shape as drastically in water as vegetable-tanned. However, there are environmental concerns with this tanning method, as chromium is a heavy metal.\n* '''Aldehyde-tanned leather''' is tanned using [[glutaraldehyde]] or [[oxazolidine]] compounds. It is referred to as \"wet white\" due to its pale cream color. It is the main type of \"chrome-free\" leather, often seen in shoes for infants and automobiles. [[Formaldehyde]] has been used for tanning in the past; it is being phased out due to danger to workers and sensitivity of many people to formaldehyde.\n** '''[[Chamois leather]]''' is a form of aldehyde tanning that produces a porous and highly water-absorbent leather. Chamois leather is made using marine oils (traditionally cod oil) that oxidize to produce the aldehydes that tan the leather.\n* '''Brain tanned leathers''' are made by a labor-intensive process that uses emulsified oils, often those of animal brains such as deer, cattle, and buffalo. They are known for their exceptional softness and washability.\n* '''Alum leather''' is transformed using [[aluminium]] salts mixed with a variety of binders and [[protein]] sources, such as flour and egg yolk. Alum leather is not actually tanned; rather the process is called \"tawing\", and the resulting material reverts to rawhide if soaked in water long enough to remove the alum salts.\n\n==Grades==\nIn general, leather is produced in the following grades:\n\n* '''Top-grain leather''' includes the outer layer of the hide, known as the grain, which features finer, more densely packed fibers, resulting in strength and durability. Depending on thickness, it may also contain some of the more fibrous under layer, known as the corium. Types of top-grain leather include:\n**'''Full-grain leather''' contains the entire grain layer, without any removal of the surface. Rather than wearing out, it develops a [[patina]] during its useful lifetime. It is usually considered the highest quality leather. Furniture and footwear are often made from full-grain leather. Full-grain leather is typically finished with a soluble [[Aniline leather|aniline]] dye. [[Russia leather]] is a form of full-grain leather.\n** '''Corrected grain leather''' has the surface subjected to finishing treatments to create a more uniform appearance. This usually involves buffing or sanding away flaws in the grain, then dyeing and embossing the surface.\n** '''[[Nubuck]]''' is top-grain leather that has been sanded or buffed on the grain side to give a slight nap of short protein fibers, producing a velvet-like surface.\n* '''Split leather''' is created from the corium left once the top-grain has been separated from the hide, known as the drop split. In thicker hides, the drop split can be further split into a middle split and a flesh split.\n**'''[[Bicast leather]]''' is split leather that has a polyurethane or vinyl layer applied to the surface and embossed to give it the appearance of a grain. It is slightly stiffer than top-grain leather but has a more consistent texture. \n** '''[[Patent leather]]''' is leather that has been given a high-gloss finish by the addition of a coating. Dating to the late 1700s, it became widely popular after inventor [[Seth Boyden]] developed the first mass-production process, using a linseed-oil-based lacquer, in 1818. Modern versions are usually a form of bicast leather.\n**'''[[Suede]]''' is made from the underside of a split to create a soft, napped finish. It is often made from younger or smaller animals, as the skins of adults often result in a coarse, shaggy nap.\n* '''[[Bonded leather]]''', also called ''reconstituted leather'', is a material that uses leather scraps that are shredded and bonded together with polyurethane or [[latex]] onto a fiber mesh. The amount of leather fibers in the mix varies from 10% to 90%, affecting the properties of the product.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=jSiRAAAAQBAJ&pg=SA9-PA119|title=Materials for Interior Environments |last=Binggeli |first=Corky |date=2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=9781118421604|location=|pages=119|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==From other animals==\n[[File:\u00abPhoneCases\u00bb.png|thumb|right|Phone cases in [[ostrich leather]]]]\nToday, most leather is made of [[cattle]] hides, which constitute about 65% of all leather produced. Other animals that are used include sheep, about 13%, goats, about 11%, and pigs, about 10%. Obtaining accurate figures from around the world is difficult, especially for areas where the skin may be eaten.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/economic/est/est-commodities/hides-skins/en/ FAO]</ref><ref>[http://www.leathercouncil.org/introtoleather.htm International Council of Tanners]</ref> Other animals mentioned below only constitute a fraction of a percent of total leather production.\n\nHorse hides are used to make particularly durable leathers. [[Shell cordovan]] is a horse leather made not from the outer skin but an under layer found only in equine species called the shell. It is prized for its mirror-like finish and anti-creasing properties.\n\nLamb and deerskin are used for soft leather in more expensive apparel. Deerskin is widely used in work gloves and indoor shoes.\n\nReptilian skins, such as [[Alligator leather|alligator]], crocodile, and [[snakeskin|snake]], are noted for their distinct patterns that reflect the scales of their species. This has led to hunting and farming of these species in part for their skins.\n\n[[Kangaroo leather]] is used to make items that must be strong and flexible. It is the material most commonly used in [[bullwhip]]s. Some [[motorcycle|motorcyclists]] favor kangaroo leather for [[Motorcycle safety clothing#Leathers|motorcycle leathers]] because of its light weight and abrasion resistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dainese.com/row/en/faq.html|title=FAQ|accessdate=7 February 2018|publisher=Dainese}}</ref> Kangaroo leather is also used for falconry jesses, soccer footwear,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019195909/http://soccersupremacy.com/adidas-cleat-review-adidas-profi-liga-cleat-review/|title= What type of Leather do I have?|accessdate=27 July 2010|publisher=Soccer Cleats 101}}</ref> and boxing speed bags.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedbagcentral.com/ssp/speed_bag_parts|title=Speed Bag Parts|accessdate=7 February 2018|publisher=Speed Bag Central}}</ref>\n\nAlthough originally raised for their feathers in the 19th century, [[ostrich]]es are now more popular for both meat and leather.<ref>Henrylito Tacio,\"[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/davao/why-you-should-raise-ostrich Why You Should Raise Ostrich],\" Sun.Star 18 January 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224085758/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/davao/why-you-should-raise-ostrich |date=24 December 2013 }}</ref> [[Ostrich leather]] has a characteristic \"goose bump\" look because of the large follicles where the feathers grew. Different processes produce different finishes for many applications, including upholstery, footwear, automotive products, accessories, and clothing.\n\nIn [[Thailand]], [[stingray]] leather is used in wallets and belts. Stingray leather is tough and durable. The leather is often dyed black and covered with tiny round bumps in the natural pattern of the back ridge of an animal. These bumps are then usually dyed white to highlight the decoration. Stingray rawhide is also used as grips on Chinese swords, Scottish basket hilted swords, and Japanese [[katana]]s. Stingray leather is also used for high abrasion areas in motorcycle racing leathers (especially in gloves, where its high abrasion resistance helps prevent wear through in the event of an accident.)\n\nFor a given thickness, fish leather is typically much stronger due to its criss-crossed fibers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Timmins |first1=Beth |title=Meet the fish leather pioneers |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47806892 |accessdate=7 May 2019 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental impact==\nLeather produces some environmental impact, most notably due to:\n* The carbon footprint of cattle rearing\n* Use of chemicals in the tanning process (e.g., [[chromium]], [[phthalate|phthalate esters]], [[nonoxynols|nonyl phenol ethoxylate soaps]], [[pentachlorophenol]] and [[solvent]]s)\n* Air pollution due to the transformation process ([[hydrogen sulfide]] is formed during mixing with acids and [[ammonia]] liberated during deliming, solvent vapors)\n\n===Carbon footprint===\n\nOne estimate of the [[carbon footprint]] of leather goods is 0.51&nbsp;kg of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per \u00a31 of output at 2010 retail prices, or 0.71&nbsp;kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq per \u00a31 of output at 2010 industry prices.<ref>Mike Berners-Lee, ''How Bad are Bananas: The Carbon Footprint of Everything'' (London: Profile, 2010), p. 201.</ref>\n\n===Water footprint===\n\nOne ton of hide or skin generally produces 20 to 80 m<sup>3</sup> of waste water, including chromium levels of 100\u2013400&nbsp;mg/l, sulfide levels of\n200\u2013800&nbsp;mg/l, high levels of fat and other solid wastes, and notable pathogen contamination.

These enzymes are rarely used.\n\n==Preservation and conditioning==\nThe natural fibers of leather break down with the passage of time. Acidic leathers are particularly vulnerable to [[red rot]], which causes powdering of the surface and a change in consistency. Damage from red rot is aggravated by high temperatures and relative humidities. Although it is chemically irreversible, treatments can add handling strength and prevent disintegration of red rotted leather.\n\nExposure to long periods of low relative humidities (below 40%) can cause leather to become desiccated, irreversibly changing the fibrous structure of the leather. Chemical damage can also occur from exposure to environmental factors, including ultraviolet light, ozone, acid from sulfurous and nitrous pollutants in the air, or through a chemical action following any treatment with tallow or oil compounds. Both oxidation and chemical damage occur faster at higher temperatures.\n\nVarious treatments are available such as [[Conditioner (chemistry)|conditioners]]. [[Saddle soap]] is used for cleaning, conditioning, and softening leather.

When [[motorcycle]]s were invented, some riders took to wearing heavy leather [[jackets]] to protect from [[road rash]] and wind blast; some also wear chaps or full leather pants to protect the lower body.\n\nLeather's flexibility allows it to be formed and shaped into balls and protective gear. Subsequently, many sports use equipment made from leather, such as [[baseball glove]]s and the [[Ball (gridiron football)|ball]] used in [[American football]].\n\n[[Leather fetishism]] is the name popularly used to describe a [[sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] attraction to people wearing leather, or in certain cases, to the garments themselves.\n\nMany [[rock group]]s (particularly [[Heavy Metal music|heavy metal]] and [[punk subculture|punk]] groups in the 1980s) are well known for wearing leather clothing. [[Extreme metal]] bands (especially [[black metal]] bands) and [[Goth rock]] groups have extensive [[black leather]] clothing. Leather has become less common in the punk community over the last three decades, as there is opposition to the use of leather from [[Punk ideologies#Animal rights and veganism|punks who support animal rights]].\n\nMany cars and trucks come with optional or standard leather or \"leather faced\" seating.\n\n==Religious sensitivities==\nIn countries with significant populations of individuals observing religions which place restrictions on material choices, leather vendors typically clarify the kinds of leather in their products. For example, leather shoes bear a label that identifies the animal from which the leather came. This helps a [[Muslim]] not accidentally purchase pigskin, and a [[Hindu]] to avoid cattleskin, this is to adhere to religious observance and respect. Many vegetarian Hindus do not use any kind of leather. Such [[taboo]]s increase the demand for religiously neutral leathers such as [[ostrich]] and [[deer]].\n\n[[Judaism]] forbids the comfort of wearing leather shoes on [[Yom Kippur]], [[Tisha B'Av]], and during mourning.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/281605/jewish/Wearing-Shoes.htm |title = Wearing Shoes - Mourning Observances of Shiva and Sheloshim |publisher = Chabad.org |accessdate  = 20 October 2009 |url-status = live |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091222161125/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/281605/jewish/Wearing-Shoes.htm |archivedate = 22 December 2009 |df = dmy-all}}</ref> Also, see [[Tefillin|Teffilin]] and [[Sefer Torah|Torah Scroll]].\n\n[[Jainism]] prohibits the use of leather, since it is obtained by killing animals.\n\n==Alternatives==\nMany forms of [[artificial leather]] have been developed, usually involving polyurethane or vinyl coatings applied to a cloth backing. Many names and brands for such artificial leathers exist, including \"pleather\", a portmanteau of \"plastic leather\", and the brand name [[Naugahyde]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ctsti.cn/webtec/upload/2011/7/4/20110704051836492.pdf|title=Artificial Leather- An Eco-friendly Alternative Textile Material For Leather |last1=Jahan |first1=Saurabh |last2=Jahan |first2=Shahnaz |journal=China Textile Science |date=2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016004331/http://www.ctsti.cn/webtec/upload/2011/7/4/20110704051836492.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAnother alternative is cultured leather which is lab-grown using [[cell culture]] methods,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/04/business/modern-meadow/index.html|title=Would you wear leather that's grown in a lab?|publisher=CNN|date=4 October 2018|accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/201804/alden-wicker/prototype-modern-meadow-lab-grown-leather.html|title=The Future of Leather Is Growing in a New Jersey Lab--No Animals Needed|magazine=[[Inc.

The most common raw material is [[cattle]] hide. It can be produced at manufacturing scales ranging from [[artisan]] to modern [[heavy industry|industrial scale]].\n\nLeather is used to make a variety of articles, including footwear, automobile seats, clothing, bags, book bindings, fashion accessories, and furniture. It is produced in a wide variety of types and styles and decorated by a wide range of techniques. The earliest record of leather artifacts dates back to 2200 BC.\n\n==Production processes==\n[[File:Ledertrocknung in Suai.jpg|thumb|Drying of leather in [[East Timor]]]]\n[[File:Leather tanning, Fes.jpg|thumb|Leather tanning in [[Fes]], [[Morocco]]]]\n[[File:Tanned leather.JPG|thumb|Tanned leather in [[Marrakech]]]]\n{{Main|Leather production processes}}\n\nThe leather manufacturing process is divided into three fundamental subprocesses: preparatory stages, tanning, and crusting. A further subprocess, finishing, can be added into the leather process sequence, but not all leathers receive finishing.\n\nThe preparatory stages are when the hide is prepared for tanning. Preparatory stages may include: soaking, hair removal, [[liming (leather processing)|liming]], [[deliming]], bating, [[bleaching]], and [[pickling]].\n\n[[Tanning (leather)|Tanning]] is a process that stabilizes the [[protein]]s, particularly [[collagen]], of the raw hide to increase the thermal, chemical and microbiological stability of the hides and skins, making it suitable for a wide variety of end applications. The principal difference between raw and tanned hides is that raw hides dry out to form a hard, inflexible material that, when rewetted, will putrefy, while tanned material dries to a flexible form that does not become putrid when rewetted.\n\nMany tanning methods and materials exist. The typical process sees tanners load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a tank that contains the tanning \"liquor\". The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis, and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide. Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the liquor's pH in a process called basification, which fixes the tanning material to the leather. The more tanning material fixed, the higher the leather's hydrothermal stability and [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinkage]] temperature resistance.\n\nCrusting is a process that thins and lubricates leather. It often includes a coloring operation. Chemicals added during crusting must be fixed in place. Crusting culminates with a drying and softening operation, and may include splitting, shaving, [[dyeing]], [[Whitening (leather processing)|whitening]] or other methods.\n\nFor some leathers, tanners apply a surface coating, called \"finishing\". Finishing operations can include oiling, brushing, buffing, coating, polishing, embossing, [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazing]], or [[Tumble finishing|tumbling]], among others.\n\nLeather can be oiled to improve its water resistance. This [[currying (leather)|currying]] process after tanning supplements the natural oils remaining in the leather itself, which can be washed out through repeated exposure to water. Frequent oiling of leather, with [[mink oil]], [[neatsfoot oil]], or a similar material keeps it supple and improves its lifespan dramatically.<ref>{{cite book|author=NIIR Board of Consultants|title=Leather Processing & Tanning Technology Handbook|date=2011|publisher=NIIR Project Consultancy Services|isbn=9788190568593|page=323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hbKkCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA324&dq=why+oil+leather&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwis0e6_lf_SAhVITrwKHXp5B9AQ6AEIJzAD#v=onepage&q=why%20oil%20leather&f=false|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Tanning methods===\nTanning processes largely differ in which chemicals are used in the tanning liquor. Some common types include:\n* '''{{visible anchor|Vegetable-tanned leather}}''' is tanned using [[tannin]]s extracted from [[vegetable matter]], such as tree [[tanbark|bark]] prepared in [[bark mill]]s. It is the oldest known method. It is supple and light brown in color, with the exact shade depending on the mix of materials and the color of the skin. The [[tan (color)|color tan]] derives its name from the appearance of undyed vegetable-tanned leather. Vegetable-tanned leather is not stable in water; it tends to discolor, and if left to soak and then dry, it shrinks and becomes harder, a feature of vegetable-tanned leather that is exploited in traditional shoemaking. In hot water, it shrinks drastically and partly congeals, becoming rigid and eventually brittle. [[Boiled leather]] is an example of this, where the leather has been hardened by being immersed in hot water, or in boiled [[wax]] or similar substances. Historically, it was occasionally used as [[armor]] after hardening, and it has also been used for [[book binding]]. \n* '''Chrome-tanned leather''', invented in 1858, is tanned using [[Chromium (III) sulfate|chromium sulfate]] and other [[chromium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s . It is also known as \"wet blue\" for the pale blue color of the undyed leather. The chrome tanning method usually takes approximately one day to complete, making it best suited for large-scale industrial use. This is the most common method in modern use. It is more supple and pliable than vegetable-tanned leather and does not discolor or lose shape as drastically in water as vegetable-tanned. However, there are environmental concerns with this tanning method, as chromium is a heavy metal.\n* '''Aldehyde-tanned leather''' is tanned using [[glutaraldehyde]] or [[oxazolidine]] compounds. It is referred to as \"wet white\" due to its pale cream color. It is the main type of \"chrome-free\" leather, often seen in shoes for infants and automobiles. [[Formaldehyde]] has been used for tanning in the past; it is being phased out due to danger to workers and sensitivity of many people to formaldehyde.\n** '''[[Chamois leather]]''' is a form of aldehyde tanning that produces a porous and highly water-absorbent leather. Chamois leather is made using marine oils (traditionally cod oil) that oxidize to produce the aldehydes that tan the leather.\n* '''Brain tanned leathers''' are made by a labor-intensive process that uses emulsified oils, often those of animal brains such as deer, cattle, and buffalo. They are known for their exceptional softness and washability.\n* '''Alum leather''' is transformed using [[aluminium]] salts mixed with a variety of binders and [[protein]] sources, such as flour and egg yolk. Alum leather is not actually tanned; rather the process is called \"tawing\", and the resulting material reverts to rawhide if soaked in water long enough to remove the alum salts.\n\n==Grades==\nIn general, leather is produced in the following grades:\n\n* '''Top-grain leather''' includes the outer layer of the hide, known as the grain, which features finer, more densely packed fibers, resulting in strength and durability. Depending on thickness, it may also contain some of the more fibrous under layer, known as the corium. Types of top-grain leather include:\n**'''Full-grain leather''' contains the entire grain layer, without any removal of the surface. Rather than wearing out, it develops a [[patina]] during its useful lifetime. It is usually considered the highest quality leather. Furniture and footwear are often made from full-grain leather. Full-grain leather is typically finished with a soluble [[Aniline leather|aniline]] dye. [[Russia leather]] is a form of full-grain leather.\n** '''Corrected grain leather''' has the surface subjected to finishing treatments to create a more uniform appearance. This usually involves buffing or sanding away flaws in the grain, then dyeing and embossing the surface.\n** '''[[Nubuck]]''' is top-grain leather that has been sanded or buffed on the grain side to give a slight nap of short protein fibers, producing a velvet-like surface.\n* '''Split leather''' is created from the corium left once the top-grain has been separated from the hide, known as the drop split. In thicker hides, the drop split can be further split into a middle split and a flesh split.\n**'''[[Bicast leather]]''' is split leather that has a polyurethane or vinyl layer applied to the surface and embossed to give it the appearance of a grain. It is slightly stiffer than top-grain leather but has a more consistent texture. \n** '''[[Patent leather]]''' is leather that has been given a high-gloss finish by the addition of a coating. Dating to the late 1700s, it became widely popular after inventor [[Seth Boyden]] developed the first mass-production process, using a linseed-oil-based lacquer, in 1818. Modern versions are usually a form of bicast leather.\n**'''[[Suede]]''' is made from the underside of a split to create a soft, napped finish. It is often made from younger or smaller animals, as the skins of adults often result in a coarse, shaggy nap.\n* '''[[Bonded leather]]''', also called ''reconstituted leather'', is a material that uses leather scraps that are shredded and bonded together with polyurethane or [[latex]] onto a fiber mesh. The amount of leather fibers in the mix varies from 10% to 90%, affecting the properties of the product.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=jSiRAAAAQBAJ&pg=SA9-PA119|title=Materials for Interior Environments |last=Binggeli |first=Corky |date=2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=9781118421604|location=|pages=119|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==From other animals==\n[[File:\u00abPhoneCases\u00bb.png|thumb|right|Phone cases in [[ostrich leather]]]]\nToday, most leather is made of [[cattle]] hides, which constitute about 65% of all leather produced. Other animals that are used include sheep, about 13%, goats, about 11%, and pigs, about 10%. Obtaining accurate figures from around the world is difficult, especially for areas where the skin may be eaten.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/economic/est/est-commodities/hides-skins/en/ FAO]</ref><ref>[http://www.leathercouncil.org/introtoleather.htm International Council of Tanners]</ref> Other animals mentioned below only constitute a fraction of a percent of total leather production.\n\nHorse hides are used to make particularly durable leathers. [[Shell cordovan]] is a horse leather made not from the outer skin but an under layer found only in equine species called the shell. It is prized for its mirror-like finish and anti-creasing properties.\n\nLamb and deerskin are used for soft leather in more expensive apparel. Deerskin is widely used in work gloves and indoor shoes.\n\nReptilian skins, such as [[Alligator leather|alligator]], crocodile, and [[snakeskin|snake]], are noted for their distinct patterns that reflect the scales of their species. This has led to hunting and farming of these species in part for their skins.\n\n[[Kangaroo leather]] is used to make items that must be strong and flexible. It is the material most commonly used in [[bullwhip]]s. Some [[motorcycle|motorcyclists]] favor kangaroo leather for [[Motorcycle safety clothing#Leathers|motorcycle leathers]] because of its light weight and abrasion resistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dainese.com/row/en/faq.html|title=FAQ|accessdate=7 February 2018|publisher=Dainese}}</ref> Kangaroo leather is also used for falconry jesses, soccer footwear,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019195909/http://soccersupremacy.com/adidas-cleat-review-adidas-profi-liga-cleat-review/|title= What type of Leather do I have?|accessdate=27 July 2010|publisher=Soccer Cleats 101}}</ref> and boxing speed bags.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedbagcentral.com/ssp/speed_bag_parts|title=Speed Bag Parts|accessdate=7 February 2018|publisher=Speed Bag Central}}</ref>\n\nAlthough originally raised for their feathers in the 19th century, [[ostrich]]es are now more popular for both meat and leather.<ref>Henrylito Tacio,\"[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/davao/why-you-should-raise-ostrich Why You Should Raise Ostrich],\" Sun.Star 18 January 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224085758/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/davao/why-you-should-raise-ostrich |date=24 December 2013 }}</ref> [[Ostrich leather]] has a characteristic \"goose bump\" look because of the large follicles where the feathers grew. Different processes produce different finishes for many applications, including upholstery, footwear, automotive products, accessories, and clothing.\n\nIn [[Thailand]], [[stingray]] leather is used in wallets and belts. Stingray leather is tough and durable. The leather is often dyed black and covered with tiny round bumps in the natural pattern of the back ridge of an animal. These bumps are then usually dyed white to highlight the decoration. Stingray rawhide is also used as grips on Chinese swords, Scottish basket hilted swords, and Japanese [[katana]]s. Stingray leather is also used for high abrasion areas in motorcycle racing leathers (especially in gloves, where its high abrasion resistance helps prevent wear through in the event of an accident.)\n\nFor a given thickness, fish leather is typically much stronger due to its criss-crossed fibers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Timmins |first1=Beth |title=Meet the fish leather pioneers |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47806892 |accessdate=7 May 2019 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental impact==\nLeather produces some environmental impact, most notably due to:\n* The carbon footprint of cattle rearing\n* Use of chemicals in the tanning process (e.g., [[chromium]], [[phthalate|phthalate esters]], [[nonoxynols|nonyl phenol ethoxylate soaps]], [[pentachlorophenol]] and [[solvent]]s)\n* Air pollution due to the transformation process ([[hydrogen sulfide]] is formed during mixing with acids and [[ammonia]] liberated during deliming, solvent vapors)\n\n===Carbon footprint===\n\nOne estimate of the [[carbon footprint]] of leather goods is 0.51&nbsp;kg of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per \u00a31 of output at 2010 retail prices, or 0.71&nbsp;kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq per \u00a31 of output at 2010 industry prices.<ref>Mike Berners-Lee, ''How Bad are Bananas: The Carbon Footprint of Everything'' (London: Profile, 2010), p. 201.</ref>\n\n===Water footprint===\n\nOne ton of hide or skin generally produces 20 to 80 m<sup>3</sup> of waste water, including chromium levels of 100\u2013400&nbsp;mg/l, sulfide levels of\n200\u2013800&nbsp;mg/l, high levels of fat and other solid wastes, and notable pathogen contamination.

Although it is chemically irreversible, treatments can add handling strength and prevent disintegration of red rotted leather.\n\nExposure to long periods of low relative humidities (below 40%) can cause leather to become desiccated, irreversibly changing the fibrous structure of the leather. Chemical damage can also occur from exposure to environmental factors, including ultraviolet light, ozone, acid from sulfurous and nitrous pollutants in the air, or through a chemical action following any treatment with tallow or oil compounds. Both oxidation and chemical damage occur faster at higher temperatures.\n\nVarious treatments are available such as [[Conditioner (chemistry)|conditioners]]. [[Saddle soap]] is used for cleaning, conditioning, and softening leather.  Leather shoes are widely conditioned with [[shoe polish]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Maintain Lather Bag|url=https://www.larocco.co.uk/blogs/news/160620871-maintaining-your-lather-handbag|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=larocco|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603031055/https://www.larocco.co.uk/blogs/news/160620871-maintaining-your-lather-handbag|archivedate=3 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==In modern culture==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\n\nDue to its excellent resistance to abrasion and wind, leather found a use in rugged occupations. The enduring image of a [[cowboy]] in leather [[chaps]] gave way to the leather-jacketed and leather-helmeted [[aviator]]. When [[motorcycle]]s were invented, some riders took to wearing heavy leather [[jackets]] to protect from [[road rash]] and wind blast; some also wear chaps or full leather pants to protect the lower body.\n\nLeather's flexibility allows it to be formed and shaped into balls and protective gear. Subsequently, many sports use equipment made from leather, such as [[baseball glove]]s and the [[Ball (gridiron football)|ball]] used in [[American football]].\n\n[[Leather fetishism]] is the name popularly used to describe a [[sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] attraction to people wearing leather, or in certain cases, to the garments themselves.\n\nMany [[rock group]]s (particularly [[Heavy Metal music|heavy metal]] and [[punk subculture|punk]] groups in the 1980s) are well known for wearing leather clothing. [[Extreme metal]] bands (especially [[black metal]] bands) and [[Goth rock]] groups have extensive [[black leather]] clothing. Leather has become less common in the punk community over the last three decades, as there is opposition to the use of leather from [[Punk ideologies#Animal rights and veganism|punks who support animal rights]].\n\nMany cars and trucks come with optional or standard leather or \"leather faced\" seating.\n\n==Religious sensitivities==\nIn countries with significant populations of individuals observing religions which place restrictions on material choices, leather vendors typically clarify the kinds of leather in their products. For example, leather shoes bear a label that identifies the animal from which the leather came. This helps a [[Muslim]] not accidentally purchase pigskin, and a [[Hindu]] to avoid cattleskin, this is to adhere to religious observance and respect. Many vegetarian Hindus do not use any kind of leather. Such [[taboo]]s increase the demand for religiously neutral leathers such as [[ostrich]] and [[deer]].\n\n[[Judaism]] forbids the comfort of wearing leather shoes on [[Yom Kippur]], [[Tisha B'Av]], and during mourning.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/281605/jewish/Wearing-Shoes.htm |title = Wearing Shoes - Mourning Observances of Shiva and Sheloshim |publisher = Chabad.org |accessdate  = 20 October 2009 |url-status = live |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091222161125/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/281605/jewish/Wearing-Shoes.htm |archivedate = 22 December 2009 |df = dmy-all}}</ref> Also, see [[Tefillin|Teffilin]] and [[Sefer Torah|Torah Scroll]].\n\n[[Jainism]] prohibits the use of leather, since it is obtained by killing animals.\n\n==Alternatives==\nMany forms of [[artificial leather]] have been developed, usually involving polyurethane or vinyl coatings applied to a cloth backing. Many names and brands for such artificial leathers exist, including \"pleather\", a portmanteau of \"plastic leather\", and the brand name [[Naugahyde]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ctsti.cn/webtec/upload/2011/7/4/20110704051836492.pdf|title=Artificial Leather- An Eco-friendly Alternative Textile Material For Leather |last1=Jahan |first1=Saurabh |last2=Jahan |first2=Shahnaz |journal=China Textile Science |date=2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016004331/http://www.ctsti.cn/webtec/upload/2011/7/4/20110704051836492.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAnother alternative is cultured leather which is lab-grown using [[cell culture]] methods,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/04/business/modern-meadow/index.html|title=Would you wear leather that's grown in a lab?|publisher=CNN|date=4 October 2018|accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/201804/alden-wicker/prototype-modern-meadow-lab-grown-leather.html|title=The Future of Leather Is Growing in a New Jersey Lab--No Animals Needed|magazine=[[Inc.

The film stars [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Geoff Stults]], [[Isabella Rice]], and [[Cheryl Ladd]], and follows a divorc\u00e9e who begins to torment her ex-husband's new fianc\u00e9e.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on August 17, 2015 in [[Los Angeles]]. The film was released on April 21, 2017 by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film, which received mostly negative reviews, grossed $17.8 million worldwide against its $26.9 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nJulia Banks ([[Rosario Dawson]]) is questioned for the murder of her psychotic ex-boyfriend, Michael ([[Simon Kassianides]]). Julia claims she has been set up, despite social media conversations showing her lusting after Michael.\n\nSix months earlier, Julia receives a send-off from her boss and friend, Ali ([[Whitney Cummings]]), from her job as chief online editor for a storytelling website. Julia plans to work remotely from the mansion she will share with her fianc\u00e9 David Connover ([[Geoff Stults]]) and her soon-to-be stepdaughter Lily ([[Isabella Rice]]). At David's house, Julia is greeted by his ex-wife Tessa ([[Katherine Heigl]]), who is not coping with the end of their marriage two years earlier.\n\nThe next evening, Tessa drops something off at the house, and Lily insists she stays for dinner. Tessa criticizes Julia's cooking and leaves. Julia learns that her [[restraining order]] against Michael has expired, much to her distress.\n\nTessa is visited by \"Lovey\" ([[Cheryl Ladd]]), her controlling and belittling mother. Investigating Julia online, Tessa discovers her restraining order against Michael. She sets up a [[Facebook]] account impersonating Julia, and messages Michael, telling him how much \"Julia\" misses him.\n\nJulia receives a surprise flower delivery, sent anonymously by Tessa to make it appear Julia is having an affair. While Julia is at the door, Tessa sneaks in and steals David's watch, his grandmother's wedding ring, and a pair of Julia's panties. That afternoon, while Julia and Lily visit David at a farmer's market, Lily wanders off. Julia finds her in the arms of Tessa, who is complaining to David about Julia's incompetence as a mother. When Tessa shows up at the house, Julia confronts her for trying to reenter David's life. The women have lunch together in an attempt to reconcile, and Tessa claims that David left her was because he suspected she was having an affair. Tessa mails Michael the watch and panties.\n\nTessa tries to get Lily to ride an unruly horse at her [[equestrianism|horseback riding]] practice, but Julia notices Lily\u2019s fear and takes her home, to Tessa's annoyance. That night, Tessa pleasures herself in her car while sending [[sexting|sexually explicit messages]], posing as Julia, to Michael.\n\nTessa cuts Lily's long hair short as punishment for leaving riding practice early, leading to a heated argument with Julia. Tessa throws herself down the stairs and pretends Julia accidentally pushed her when David arrives. After taking Tessa to a hospital, David castigates Julia for treating his ex-wife so badly. Julia calls on Ali for help, and they discover Tessa\u2019s child services records; as a teenager, she attempted to kill her father when he cheated on her mother.\n\nTessa messages Michael, as Julia, saying she wants him to visit for sex. Michael enters the house when Julia is alone, and when she spurns his advances, he attacks her. A badly beaten Julia stabs him in the leg with a kitchen knife and escapes the house. Tessa, waiting outside, enters and stabs Michael in the chest.\n\nIn the present, the police release Julia, stating the investigation into Michael\u2019s death will continue. David is initially supportive after a tearful Julia explains her history with Michael, but when the police show him the \"evidence\", he becomes disillusioned and goes to Tessa's house to get Lily. There, he sees burned gloves in the fireplace and his grandmother's wedding ring on Tessa's finger, realizing that Tessa framed Julia.\n\nTessa knocks David out with a fireplace poker. Julia arrives and tries to call 9-1-1, but is attacked by Tessa. Subduing Tessa, Julia rushes to revive David, but Tessa attacks her with a knife. Seeing herself in a mirror, Tessa realizes the monster she has become and stabs herself in the stomach. Dying, Tessa begs Julia to not let Lily remember her like this.\n\nSix months later, David and Julia are married and have moved into a new house with Lily. Julia answers the door to find Lovey wanting to see her granddaughter. Julia looks on in horror as Lovey hugs Lily.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- all opening credit names/order, with roles per closing credits --->\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Julia Banks, David's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Katherine Heigl]] as Tessa Connover, David's ex-wife\n* [[Geoff Stults]] as David Connover, Tessa's ex-husband and Lily's father\n* [[Cheryl Ladd]] as Helen/\"Lovey\", Tessa's mother\n* [[Sarah Burns]] as Sarah, David's friend since childhood\n* [[Whitney Cummings]] as Ali, Julia\u2019s best friend\n* [[Simon Kassianides]] as Michael Vargas, Julia's abusive and violent ex-boyfriend\n* [[Isabella Rice|Isabella Kai Rice]] as Lily Connover, Tessa and David's daughter\n* [[Robert Wisdom|Robert Ray Wisdom]] as Detective Pope\n* [[Jayson Blair (actor)|Jayson Blair]] as Jason\n\n== Production ==\nOn January 9, 2014, it was announced that [[Warner Bros.]] had hired [[Amma Asante]] to direct the [[female]]-centric thriller ''Unforgettable''.

While Julia is at the door, Tessa sneaks in and steals David's watch, his grandmother's wedding ring, and a pair of Julia's panties. That afternoon, while Julia and Lily visit David at a farmer's market, Lily wanders off. Julia finds her in the arms of Tessa, who is complaining to David about Julia's incompetence as a mother. When Tessa shows up at the house, Julia confronts her for trying to reenter David's life. The women have lunch together in an attempt to reconcile, and Tessa claims that David left her was because he suspected she was having an affair. Tessa mails Michael the watch and panties.\n\nTessa tries to get Lily to ride an unruly horse at her [[equestrianism|horseback riding]] practice, but Julia notices Lily\u2019s fear and takes her home, to Tessa's annoyance. That night, Tessa pleasures herself in her car while sending [[sexting|sexually explicit messages]], posing as Julia, to Michael.\n\nTessa cuts Lily's long hair short as punishment for leaving riding practice early, leading to a heated argument with Julia. Tessa throws herself down the stairs and pretends Julia accidentally pushed her when David arrives. After taking Tessa to a hospital, David castigates Julia for treating his ex-wife so badly. Julia calls on Ali for help, and they discover Tessa\u2019s child services records; as a teenager, she attempted to kill her father when he cheated on her mother.\n\nTessa messages Michael, as Julia, saying she wants him to visit for sex. Michael enters the house when Julia is alone, and when she spurns his advances, he attacks her. A badly beaten Julia stabs him in the leg with a kitchen knife and escapes the house. Tessa, waiting outside, enters and stabs Michael in the chest.\n\nIn the present, the police release Julia, stating the investigation into Michael\u2019s death will continue. David is initially supportive after a tearful Julia explains her history with Michael, but when the police show him the \"evidence\", he becomes disillusioned and goes to Tessa's house to get Lily. There, he sees burned gloves in the fireplace and his grandmother's wedding ring on Tessa's finger, realizing that Tessa framed Julia.\n\nTessa knocks David out with a fireplace poker. Julia arrives and tries to call 9-1-1, but is attacked by Tessa. Subduing Tessa, Julia rushes to revive David, but Tessa attacks her with a knife. Seeing herself in a mirror, Tessa realizes the monster she has become and stabs herself in the stomach. Dying, Tessa begs Julia to not let Lily remember her like this.\n\nSix months later, David and Julia are married and have moved into a new house with Lily. Julia answers the door to find Lovey wanting to see her granddaughter. Julia looks on in horror as Lovey hugs Lily.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- all opening credit names/order, with roles per closing credits --->\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Julia Banks, David's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Katherine Heigl]] as Tessa Connover, David's ex-wife\n* [[Geoff Stults]] as David Connover, Tessa's ex-husband and Lily's father\n* [[Cheryl Ladd]] as Helen/\"Lovey\", Tessa's mother\n* [[Sarah Burns]] as Sarah, David's friend since childhood\n* [[Whitney Cummings]] as Ali, Julia\u2019s best friend\n* [[Simon Kassianides]] as Michael Vargas, Julia's abusive and violent ex-boyfriend\n* [[Isabella Rice|Isabella Kai Rice]] as Lily Connover, Tessa and David's daughter\n* [[Robert Wisdom|Robert Ray Wisdom]] as Detective Pope\n* [[Jayson Blair (actor)|Jayson Blair]] as Jason\n\n== Production ==\nOn January 9, 2014, it was announced that [[Warner Bros.]] had hired [[Amma Asante]] to direct the [[female]]-centric thriller ''Unforgettable''.

Born in [[Tasmania]], she was educated in [[Hobart]] and at [[Julian Ashton]]'s art school in [[Sydney]], where one of her teachers was [[Thea Proctor]]. In London she studied under painters [[Bernard Meninsky]] and [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]].\n\nA [[modernism|modernist]] painter, Bellette was influential in mid-twentieth century Sydney art circles. She frequently painted scenes influenced by the [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]] of [[Euripides]] and [[Sophocles]] and the epics of [[Homer]]. The only woman to have won the [[Sulman Prize]] more than once, Bellette claimed the accolade in 1942 with ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'', and in 1944 with ''Iphigenia in Tauris''. She helped found the [[Blake Prize for Religious Art]], and was its inaugural judge. Bellette married artist and critic [[Paul Haefliger]] in 1935. The couple moved to [[Majorca]] in 1957; although she visited and exhibited in Australia thereafter, she did not return there to live, and became peripheral to the Australian art scene.\n\n==Early life and training==\nBellette was born in Hobart on 25 March 1908 and grew up an only child in rural Tasmania with her artist mother and postmaster father.{{sfn|Hall|1995|p=310}} Initially a student at the local [[Anglican education in Australia|Anglican school]] in [[Deloraine, Tasmania|Deloraine]], at the age of 13 she became a boarder at [[Friends' School, Hobart|Friends' School]] in Hobart, and then at Hobart's technical college.{{sfn|Hall|1995|p=310}}{{sfn|France|2004a|p=11}}<ref name=\"Hodgson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/B/Jean%20Bellette.htm|title=Jean Bellette|last=Hodgson|first=Shirley|date=2006|work=The Companion to  Tasmanian History|publisher=Centre for Tasmanian Historical Studies|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> She was subsequently a student at [[Julian Ashton Art School]] in Sydney. Her teachers included [[Thea Proctor]], and fellow students included artist [[John Passmore (artist)|John Passmore]]. Her drawings and [[watercolor painting|watercolours]] displayed in the 1934 student art exhibition attracted favourable comment from the art critic for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17115177 |title=Sydney Art School |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=New South Wales |date=25 September 1934 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> At Ashton's art school, Bellette met fellow Australian artist [[Paul Haefliger]], and in 1935 they married. The following year they travelled to Europe, and Bellette (like Passmore) studied at the [[Westminster School of Art]], where she was taught by [[figurative art|figurative]] painters [[Bernard Meninsky]] and [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]].{{sfn|Germaine|1991|p=31}}{{sfn|France|2004a|p=12}} In 1938, Bellette and her husband studied [[figure drawing|life drawing]] at [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] in Paris.{{sfn|France|2004a|p=14}}\n\n==Career==\n===Australia===\nBellette and Haefliger returned to Australia just before the outbreak of World War II.{{sfn|Hall|1995|p=310}}{{sfn|Germaine|1991|p=31}} Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's [[Macquarie Galleries]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17631319 |title=Two young artists abroad |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=New South Wales |date=28 September 1939 |accessdate=29 June 2014 |page=18 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \"fashionable\" [[modernism|moderns]] whose membership included [[William Dobell]] and [[Russell Drysdale]].{{sfn|Grishin|2013|p=312}} Bellette painted and held regular shows \u2013 \"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\". Her husband served as art critic for ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' for a decade and a half.{{sfn|Hall|1995|p=310}}\n\nIn 1942, Bellette won the [[Sir John Sulman Prize]] with ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''<!--Likely it was inspired by the Hemingway novel, but is there an image of the painting or any reference to such a connection?-->. She won it again in 1944 with her painting ''Iphigenia in Tauris'', inspired by [[Iphigenia in Tauris|Euripides' play]].<ref name=\"Sulmanlist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/sulman/|title=Sir John Sulman Prize|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\".{{sfn|Hall|2013|p=285}} The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, ''Electra'', depicting the [[Electra|sister of Iphigenia]] also prominent in Greek tragedy \u2013 but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both ''Iphigenia in Tauris'' and ''Electra'' were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Homer]]. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her [[palette (painting)|palette]] and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere.{{sfn|Edwards|1995|p=238}} Critics identified the influence of European modernists [[Aristide Maillol]] and [[Giorgio de Chirico]], as well as Italian [[Quattrocento]] painters [[Masaccio]] and [[Piero della Francesca]], about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal ''[[Art in Australia]]''.{{sfn|Edwards|1995|p=238}}<ref name=\"Gray\"/>{{sfn|Burke|1980|p=72}}\n\nThe most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of [[classical antiquity|classical subjects]].

Purchased by the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in 1976, this oil painting shows five figures, \"posed like statues in a [[tableau vivant]], [and who] possess a kind of erotic energy\".<ref name=\"Gray\"/> Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette:\n<blockquote>Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning \u2013 with the classical reference in the painting's title. [[Iphigenia]], Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess [[Artemis]] asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.<ref name=Gray/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1951, Bellette came second in the Commonwealth Jubilee Art Competition, behind the young [[Jeffrey Smart]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18214439 |title=\u00a3500 Art Prize Awarded. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=18 August 1951 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The following year, she won a competitive exhibition sponsored by [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]], with ''Girl With Still Life''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2856236 |title=M.G.M. art contest |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=29 May 1952 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Haefliger never critiqued his wife's exhibitions,{{sfn|Hall|1995|p=310}} others occasionally stepped in to provide reviews in the ''Herald''. Describing her 1950 exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries, one critic considered it \"one of the most stimulating and refreshing that has been seen here for a long time\" and that \"She paints with a strong, sombre palette and her forms are sculptured with great decision. She uses paint sensuously and passionately, as paint, not as so many contemporary Australians do, as mere colour\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18151165 |title=One-man Show By Jean Bellette |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=8 March 1950 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, the same reviewer, attending another of the artist's solo Sydney shows, observed that Bellette: \n<blockquote>is one of the few Australian artists here who combines a firm technique with a sensitive and rich emotion. In some of the lighter [[landscape painting|landscapes]] in this exhibition, Miss Bellette seems to have been trying to solve some of the particular difficulties of painting Australian landscapes. The clear, strong light tends to flatten the form and bleach the colour; a problem that doesn't lend itself to the dramatic tensions and dark moods that are characteristic of her work. It requires a colder and more dispassionate approach. But when she finds landscapes to her taste, such as the rugged hills and beetling clouds in No. 8, the earth decaying with erosion in No. 19, or the prickly desolation of \"Rough Country\", No. 14, she handles them with great skill and effectiveness. Her figure drawings are decisively drawn and firmly modelled. The girls have a pensive dignity as though they are pondering the burdens and joylessness of a future to be spent as [[caryatid]]s. The still lives and the interior are admirable exercises in formal organisation, the colours being sombre yet rich.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18252743 |title=Drawings By Jean Bellette. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 March 1952 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>{{refn|A [[caryatid]] is a sculpted female figure that functions as a column or pillar in a building.|group=notes}}</blockquote>\n\nAround this time, Bellette also held a show in Melbourne, which included some black-and-white landscape studies as well as some of her classical Greek subjects. Arnold Shore, art critic for ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'', drew a contrast between the two groups of works. He thought that one of the landscapes \"sets the heart singing with its lovely tone, pattern and sense of place\". Continuing, he noted that the landscapes and some other works \"attain at their best a standard only vaguely suggested when the painter concerned herself too much with striving after a new treatment of ancient Grecian ideals.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23191516 |title=Display \"reveals\" an artist |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=20 May 1952 |accessdate=29 June 2014 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nPaintings by Bellette were among those of twelve Australian artists included in the 1953 [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] exhibition in London, five regional British cities, and at the [[Venice Biennale]].

March 1908&nbsp;\u2013 16 March 1991) was an [[Australian art]]ist. Born in [[Tasmania]], she was educated in [[Hobart]] and at [[Julian Ashton]]'s art school in [[Sydney]], where one of her teachers was [[Thea Proctor]]. In London she studied under painters [[Bernard Meninsky]] and [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]].\n\nA [[modernism|modernist]] painter, Bellette was influential in mid-twentieth century Sydney art circles. She frequently painted scenes influenced by the [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]] of [[Euripides]] and [[Sophocles]] and the epics of [[Homer]]. The only woman to have won the [[Sulman Prize]] more than once, Bellette claimed the accolade in 1942 with ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'', and in 1944 with ''Iphigenia in Tauris''. She helped found the [[Blake Prize for Religious Art]], and was its inaugural judge. Bellette married artist and critic [[Paul Haefliger]] in 1935. The couple moved to [[Majorca]] in 1957; although she visited and exhibited in Australia thereafter, she did not return there to live, and became peripheral to the Australian art scene.\n\n==Early life and training==\nBellette was born in Hobart on 25 March 1908 and grew up an only child in rural Tasmania with her artist mother and postmaster father.{{sfn|Hall|1995|p=310}} Initially a student at the local [[Anglican education in Australia|Anglican school]] in [[Deloraine, Tasmania|Deloraine]], at the age of 13 she became a boarder at [[Friends' School, Hobart|Friends' School]] in Hobart, and then at Hobart's technical college.{{sfn|Hall|1995|p=310}}{{sfn|France|2004a|p=11}}<ref name=\"Hodgson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/B/Jean%20Bellette.htm|title=Jean Bellette|last=Hodgson|first=Shirley|date=2006|work=The Companion to  Tasmanian History|publisher=Centre for Tasmanian Historical Studies|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> She was subsequently a student at [[Julian Ashton Art School]] in Sydney. Her teachers included [[Thea Proctor]], and fellow students included artist [[John Passmore (artist)|John Passmore]]. Her drawings and [[watercolor painting|watercolours]] displayed in the 1934 student art exhibition attracted favourable comment from the art critic for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17115177 |title=Sydney Art School |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=New South Wales |date=25 September 1934 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> At Ashton's art school, Bellette met fellow Australian artist [[Paul Haefliger]], and in 1935 they married. The following year they travelled to Europe, and Bellette (like Passmore) studied at the [[Westminster School of Art]], where she was taught by [[figurative art|figurative]] painters [[Bernard Meninsky]] and [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]].{{sfn|Germaine|1991|p=31}}{{sfn|France|2004a|p=12}} In 1938, Bellette and her husband studied [[figure drawing|life drawing]] at [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] in Paris.{{sfn|France|2004a|p=14}}\n\n==Career==\n===Australia===\nBellette and Haefliger returned to Australia just before the outbreak of World War II.{{sfn|Hall|1995|p=310}}{{sfn|Germaine|1991|p=31}} Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's [[Macquarie Galleries]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17631319 |title=Two young artists abroad |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=New South Wales |date=28 September 1939 |accessdate=29 June 2014 |page=18 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \"fashionable\" [[modernism|moderns]] whose membership included [[William Dobell]] and [[Russell Drysdale]].{{sfn|Grishin|2013|p=312}} Bellette painted and held regular shows \u2013 \"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\". Her husband served as art critic for ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' for a decade and a half.{{sfn|Hall|1995|p=310}}\n\nIn 1942, Bellette won the [[Sir John Sulman Prize]] with ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''<!--Likely it was inspired by the Hemingway novel, but is there an image of the painting or any reference to such a connection?-->. She won it again in 1944 with her painting ''Iphigenia in Tauris'', inspired by [[Iphigenia in Tauris|Euripides' play]].<ref name=\"Sulmanlist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/sulman/|title=Sir John Sulman Prize|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\".{{sfn|Hall|2013|p=285}} The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, ''Electra'', depicting the [[Electra|sister of Iphigenia]] also prominent in Greek tragedy \u2013 but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both ''Iphigenia in Tauris'' and ''Electra'' were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Homer]]. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian.

Purchased by the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in 1976, this oil painting shows five figures, \"posed like statues in a [[tableau vivant]], [and who] possess a kind of erotic energy\".<ref name=\"Gray\"/> Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette:\n<blockquote>Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning \u2013 with the classical reference in the painting's title. [[Iphigenia]], Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess [[Artemis]] asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy.

Describing her 1950 exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries, one critic considered it \"one of the most stimulating and refreshing that has been seen here for a long time\" and that \"She paints with a strong, sombre palette and her forms are sculptured with great decision. She uses paint sensuously and passionately, as paint, not as so many contemporary Australians do, as mere colour\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18151165 |title=One-man Show By Jean Bellette |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=8 March 1950 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, the same reviewer, attending another of the artist's solo Sydney shows, observed that Bellette: \n<blockquote>is one of the few Australian artists here who combines a firm technique with a sensitive and rich emotion. In some of the lighter [[landscape painting|landscapes]] in this exhibition, Miss Bellette seems to have been trying to solve some of the particular difficulties of painting Australian landscapes. The clear, strong light tends to flatten the form and bleach the colour; a problem that doesn't lend itself to the dramatic tensions and dark moods that are characteristic of her work. It requires a colder and more dispassionate approach. But when she finds landscapes to her taste, such as the rugged hills and beetling clouds in No. 8, the earth decaying with erosion in No. 19, or the prickly desolation of \"Rough Country\", No. 14, she handles them with great skill and effectiveness. Her figure drawings are decisively drawn and firmly modelled. The girls have a pensive dignity as though they are pondering the burdens and joylessness of a future to be spent as [[caryatid]]s. The still lives and the interior are admirable exercises in formal organisation, the colours being sombre yet rich.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18252743 |title=Drawings By Jean Bellette. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 March 1952 |accessdate=29 May 2014 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>{{refn|A [[caryatid]] is a sculpted female figure that functions as a column or pillar in a building.|group=notes}}</blockquote>\n\nAround this time, Bellette also held a show in Melbourne, which included some black-and-white landscape studies as well as some of her classical Greek subjects. Arnold Shore, art critic for ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'', drew a contrast between the two groups of works. He thought that one of the landscapes \"sets the heart singing with its lovely tone, pattern and sense of place\". Continuing, he noted that the landscapes and some other works \"attain at their best a standard only vaguely suggested when the painter concerned herself too much with striving after a new treatment of ancient Grecian ideals.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23191516 |title=Display \"reveals\" an artist |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=20 May 1952 |accessdate=29 June 2014 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nPaintings by Bellette were among those of twelve Australian artists included in the 1953 [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] exhibition in London, five regional British cities, and at the [[Venice Biennale]].
