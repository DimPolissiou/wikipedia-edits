Devraj, the son of a former crime boss, declares himself the next leader of the crime syndicate; he is supported by some members but opposed by the rest. Ibrahim reveals to Kalki, legal advisor of the Roy group that Roy's family has been killed and he has been raising a secret for 25 years when he was alive. The secret was that he had a son who survived named Vishwank. Vishwank foils Devraj's plans by succeeding his father as the next boss. Vishwank is also determined to unmask his father's murderer and sets out to lead Waaji City.\n\nRoy had to set up a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant in India but was opposed by the external affairs minister of India. However, he manages to get the permission signature on a letter from him. Then, the gangsters' money is on a ship that gets destroyed in a bomb blast.\n\nThe story then turns to India, where a mastermind steals about two trillion [[Indian rupee|rupees]] with ease. A nationwide manhunt ensues to find the culprit. Undercover agent Ashok Chakravarthy is assigned as head of the manhunt task-force. Although he initially refuses, he relents after finding out that Amritha Nair, a woman whom he is [[infatuation|infatuated]] with, will also be on the task-force. The task-force uncovers the whereabouts of a thief named Jai and traps him during his next robbery, after Amritha and Ashok fall in love. They let Jai take a black box that Vishwank introduces to Kalki and others and that can open his locker containing treasures at a secure building in Waaji City.\n\nLater, there is a chase in which Amritha, Ashok, and David (a hacker) confront Jai at a bridge. It is then revealed that the thief was real Ashok and the officer who was with them is  Saaho, who is the actual person committing the robberies and Jai was actually the undercover police officer Ashok Chakravarthy. As Saaho escapes with his partner David, Amritha, along with the entire Indian police department, is stunned.\n\nAfterward, it is revealed that Devraj killed Roy in order to gain power and that the money of the gangsters is with him and that he was the one who planned the blast. Amritha then tracks Saaho and pretends that she is still in love with him but is actually helping Ashok. Meanwhile, Amritha actually falls for Saaho and betrays Ashok. Saaho takes Amritha to different places, which are nothing but the drawings in Amrita's book which Saaho saw when they were in [[Mumbai]]. Even after this, Amrita feels that they are opposite and can never be one but Saaho clears that and when he tries to kiss her, she is shot and taken away by Devraj. Saaho is forced by Devraj to give him the black box but later betrays him as he strikes a deal and gives the black box to Vishwank. Saaho also destroys Devraj's building and steals the money that he had with him. Amritha is then subsequently saved by Ibrahim, one of Vishwank's associates. Saaho is then chased by Ashok and the police, with Amritha in a helicopter with a sniper. As the sniper is shooting him, Amritha tries to save Saaho by distracting the sniper, but the sniper pushes her towards the very end of the helicopter. Saaho saves her with a [[jet pack]] but is later arrested by the police.\n\nKalki who was with Vishwank the whole time is revealed to be on Devraj's side. She goes to the vault and opens it with Vishwank's fingerprint which she had stolen it earlier. She accesses the vault with the black box and finds pictures of Roy and his son. She also finds a copy of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', thus revealing Roy's two most precious things in the vault, meanwhile Amritha locates and chases Alex, a man who ran away seeing her in a bar in [[Mumbai]]  and Ashok meets up with Vishwank.\n\nSaaho is taken to Karana village by Shinde, where he battles with Devraj's goons and defeats them easily. Devraj arrives, and Saaho reveals to him that he is Siddhant Nandan Saaho, the real son of Roy. He also reveals to Devraj that he did this to avenge his father's death. Vishwank and Alex also reveal this to Ashok and Amritha, respectively. Kalki also witnesses a portrait of Roy and Saaho inside the vault, thereby shocking all of them. After all of this, Saaho kills Devraj, thereby avenging Roy's death.\n\nIbrahim reveals that Vishwank was not Roy's son, but was his own son and his real name was Iqbal. He then tells them that Iqbal was there to save Roy's throne. He also reveals Saaho's real identity to the gang members, and Saaho becomes the next king of the underworld. Months later, Saaho locates Amritha in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] and confesses his love for her; they share a kiss and hug each other. In a distance, a sniper aims at Saaho as he opens his eye to the danger, hinting at a potential sequel for the movie.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prabhas]] as Ashok Chakravarthy/Siddhant Nandan Saaho\n* [[Shraddha Kapoor]] as Amritha Nair\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Narantak Roy \n* [[Neil Nitin Mukesh]] as Jai/Ashok Chakravarthy \n* [[Arun Vijay]] as Vishwank Roy/Iqbal\n* [[Chunky Pandey]] as Devraj \n* [[Vennela Kishore]] as Goswami\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as David\n* [[Lal (actor)|Lal]] as Ibrahim\n* [[Supreeth]] as Alex Fernandes\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Kalki\n* [[Prakash Belawadi]] as Shinde\n* [[Evelyn Sharma]] as Jennifer\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Prince \n* [[Tinnu Anand]] as Prithviraj \n* [[Ravi Varma (actor)|Ravi Varma]] as Ajay\n* [[Devan (actor)|Devan]] as IG\n* [[Sharath Lohitashwa]] as Mani\n* Sasha Chettri\n* Girish Garladinne\n* Damini Chopra<ref>{{cite news |title= Saaho actress Damini Chopra's gorgeous looks|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/gorgeous-alert-saaho-debutante-damini-chopra-is-a-dazzling-bombshell-on-instagram/photostory/68080477.cms|accessdate=20 February 2019 |work=Times of India |date=20 February 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* Kumar Raja Venati\n* Naveen Varma Ganapathiraju\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as an item number in the song \"Bad Boy\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Jacqueline and Prabhas sizzle in Saaho's Bad Boy|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/jacqueline-and-prabhas-sizzle-in-saahos-bad-boy/articleshow/70723531.cms|accessdate=19 August 2019 |work=Times of India |date=19 August 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Indian external affairs minister Ramaswamy Allagadda (cameo)\n{{colend}}\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as sub police\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced on a budget of {{INR}}350 [[crore]].<ref name=\"Budget\"/> The film was shot in [[Austria]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Dubai]], [[Romania]], and other parts of [[Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e.telugurajyam.com/team-saaho-lands-in-austria-for-crucial-scenes/|title=Team Saaho lands in Austria for crucial scenes|date=17 June 2019|website=telugurajyam|language=en-US|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/saaho-prabhas-and-shraddha-kapoor-chill-in-austria-after-shoot-see-viral-pics-1555557-2019-06-25|title=Saaho: Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor chill in Austria after shoot.

Devraj, the son of a former crime boss, declares himself the next leader of the crime syndicate; he is supported by some members but opposed by the rest. Ibrahim reveals to Kalki, legal advisor of the Roy group that Roy's family has been killed and he has been raising a secret for 25 years when he was alive. The secret was that he had a son who survived named Vishwank. Vishwank foils Devraj's plans by succeeding his father as the next boss. Vishwank is also determined to unmask his father's murderer and sets out to lead Waaji City.\n\nRoy had to set up a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant in India but was opposed by the external affairs minister of India. However, he manages to get the permission signature on a letter from him. Then, the gangsters' money is on a ship that gets destroyed in a bomb blast.\n\nThe story then turns to India, where a mastermind steals about two trillion [[Indian rupee|rupees]] with ease. A nationwide manhunt ensues to find the culprit. Undercover agent Ashok Chakravarthy is assigned as head of the manhunt task-force. Although he initially refuses, he relents after finding out that Amritha Nair, a woman whom he is [[infatuation|infatuated]] with, will also be on the task-force. The task-force uncovers the whereabouts of a thief named Jai and traps him during his next robbery, after Amritha and Ashok fall in love. They let Jai take a black box that Vishwank introduces to Kalki and others and that can open his locker containing treasures at a secure building in Waaji City.\n\nLater, there is a chase in which Amritha, Ashok, and David (a hacker) confront Jai at a bridge. It is then revealed that the thief was real Ashok and the officer who was with them is  Saaho, who is the actual person committing the robberies and Jai was actually the undercover police officer Ashok Chakravarthy. As Saaho escapes with his partner David, Amritha, along with the entire Indian police department, is stunned.\n\nAfterward, it is revealed that Devraj killed Roy in order to gain power and that the money of the gangsters is with him and that he was the one who planned the blast. Amritha then tracks Saaho and pretends that she is still in love with him but is actually helping Ashok. Meanwhile, Amritha actually falls for Saaho and betrays Ashok. Saaho takes Amritha to different places, which are nothing but the drawings in Amrita's book which Saaho saw when they were in [[Mumbai]]. Even after this, Amrita feels that they are opposite and can never be one but Saaho clears that and when he tries to kiss her, she is shot and taken away by Devraj. Saaho is forced by Devraj to give him the black box but later betrays him as he strikes a deal and gives the black box to Vishwank. Saaho also destroys Devraj's building and steals the money that he had with him. Amritha is then subsequently saved by Ibrahim, one of Vishwank's associates. Saaho is then chased by Ashok and the police, with Amritha in a helicopter with a sniper. As the sniper is shooting him, Amritha tries to save Saaho by distracting the sniper, but the sniper pushes her towards the very end of the helicopter. Saaho saves her with a [[jet pack]] but is later arrested by the police.\n\nKalki who was with Vishwank the whole time is revealed to be on Devraj's side. She goes to the vault and opens it with Vishwank's fingerprint which she had stolen it earlier. She accesses the vault with the black box and finds pictures of Roy and his son. She also finds a copy of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', thus revealing Roy's two most precious things in the vault, meanwhile Amritha locates and chases Alex, a man who ran away seeing her in a bar in [[Mumbai]]  and Ashok meets up with Vishwank.\n\nSaaho is taken to Karana village by Shinde, where he battles with Devraj's goons and defeats them easily. Devraj arrives, and Saaho reveals to him that he is Siddhant Nandan Saaho, the real son of Roy. He also reveals to Devraj that he did this to avenge his father's death. Vishwank and Alex also reveal this to Ashok and Amritha, respectively. Kalki also witnesses a portrait of Roy and Saaho inside the vault, thereby shocking all of them. After all of this, Saaho kills Devraj, thereby avenging Roy's death.\n\nIbrahim reveals that Vishwank was not Roy's son, but was his own son and his real name was Iqbal. He then tells them that Iqbal was there to save Roy's throne. He also reveals Saaho's real identity to the gang members, and Saaho becomes the next king of the underworld. Months later, Saaho locates Amritha in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] and confesses his love for her; they share a kiss and hug each other. In a distance, a sniper aims at Saaho as he opens his eye to the danger, hinting at a potential sequel for the movie.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prabhas]] as Ashok Chakravarthy/Siddhant Nandan Saaho\n* [[Shraddha Kapoor]] as Amritha Nair\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Narantak Roy \n* [[Neil Nitin Mukesh]] as Jai/Ashok Chakravarthy \n* [[Arun Vijay]] as Vishwank Roy/Iqbal\n* [[Chunky Pandey]] as Devraj \n* [[Vennela Kishore]] as Goswami\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as David\n* [[Lal (actor)|Lal]] as Ibrahim\n* [[Supreeth]] as Alex Fernandes\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Kalki\n* [[Prakash Belawadi]] as Shinde\n* [[Evelyn Sharma]] as Jennifer\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Prince \n* [[Tinnu Anand]] as Prithviraj \n* [[Ravi Varma (actor)|Ravi Varma]] as Ajay\n* [[Devan (actor)|Devan]] as IG\n* [[Sharath Lohitashwa]] as Mani\n* Sasha Chettri\n* Girish Garladinne\n* Damini Chopra<ref>{{cite news |title= Saaho actress Damini Chopra's gorgeous looks|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/gorgeous-alert-saaho-debutante-damini-chopra-is-a-dazzling-bombshell-on-instagram/photostory/68080477.cms|accessdate=20 February 2019 |work=Times of India |date=20 February 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* Kumar Raja Venati\n* Naveen Varma Ganapathiraju\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as an item number in the song \"Bad Boy\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Jacqueline and Prabhas sizzle in Saaho's Bad Boy|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/jacqueline-and-prabhas-sizzle-in-saahos-bad-boy/articleshow/70723531.cms|accessdate=19 August 2019 |work=Times of India |date=19 August 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Indian external affairs minister Ramaswamy Allagadda (cameo)\n{{colend}}\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as sub police\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced on a budget of {{INR}}350 [[crore]].<ref name=\"Budget\"/> The film was shot in [[Austria]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Dubai]], [[Romania]], and other parts of [[Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e.telugurajyam.com/team-saaho-lands-in-austria-for-crucial-scenes/|title=Team Saaho lands in Austria for crucial scenes|date=17 June 2019|website=telugurajyam|language=en-US|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/saaho-prabhas-and-shraddha-kapoor-chill-in-austria-after-shoot-see-viral-pics-1555557-2019-06-25|title=Saaho: Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor chill in Austria after shoot.

However a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor symptoms of PD.

In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons.<ref name=\"pmid19691125\"/> To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals.<ref name=\"pmid19691125\"/> At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.<ref name=\"pmid19691125\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\n{{See also|Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale}}\n[[File:Parkinson disease world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Global burden of Parkinson's disease, measured in [[disability-adjusted life year]]s per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants in 2004\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{legend|#b3b3b3|no data}}\n{{legend|#ffff65|<&nbsp;5}}\n{{legend|#fff200|5\u201312.5}}\n{{legend|#ffdc00|12.5\u201320}}\n{{legend|#ffc600|20\u201327.5}}\n{{legend|#ffb000|27.5\u201335}}\n{{legend|#ff9a00|35\u201342.5}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{legend|#ff8400|42.5\u201350}}\n{{legend|#ff6e00|50\u201357.5}}\n{{legend|#ff5800|57.5\u201365}}\n{{legend|#ff4200|65\u201372.5}}\n{{legend|#ff2c00|72.5\u201380}}\n{{legend|#cb0000|>&nbsp;80}}\n{{col-end}}]]\n\nPD invariably progresses with time. A severity rating method known as the [[Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale]] (UPDRS) is the most commonly used metric for clinical study. A modified version known as the MDS-UPDRS is also sometimes used. An older scaling method known as the [[Hoehn and Yahr scale]] (originally published in 1967), and a similar scale known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, have also been commonly used. The Hoehn and Yahr scale defines five basic stages of progression.\n\nMotor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in the early stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, individuals are expected to lose independent [[ambulation]] after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years.<ref name=\"pmid17131223\" /> However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use.<ref name=\"pmid17131223\" /> In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years.<ref name=\"pmid17131223\" /> However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual.<ref name=\"pmid17131223\" /> Age is the best predictor of disease progression.<ref name=\"pmid20495568\"/> The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.<ref name=\"pmid20495568\"/>\n\nSince current therapies improve motor symptoms, disability at present is mainly related to non-motor features of the disease.<ref name=\"pmid20495568\"/> Nevertheless, the relationship between disease progression and disability is not linear.

When a decision is made to perform a particular action, [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibition]] is reduced for the required motor system, thereby releasing it for activation. Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition, so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote motor activity, while low levels of dopamine function, such as occur in PD, demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement. Thus, the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce [[hypokinesia]], an overall reduction in motor output.<ref name=\"pmid18781672\"/> Drugs that are used to treat PD, conversely, may produce excessive dopamine activity, allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing [[dyskinesia]]s.<ref name=\"pmid18781672\"/>\n\n===Brain cell death===\nThere is speculation of several mechanisms by which the brain cells could be lost.<ref name=\"pmid20495568\"/> One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein [[alpha-synuclein]] bound to [[ubiquitin]] in the damaged cells.

A severity rating method known as the [[Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale]] (UPDRS) is the most commonly used metric for clinical study. A modified version known as the MDS-UPDRS is also sometimes used. An older scaling method known as the [[Hoehn and Yahr scale]] (originally published in 1967), and a similar scale known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, have also been commonly used. The Hoehn and Yahr scale defines five basic stages of progression.\n\nMotor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in the early stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, individuals are expected to lose independent [[ambulation]] after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years.<ref name=\"pmid17131223\" /> However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays.

As of 2017 some scientists hypothesized that changes in the gut flora might be an early site of PD pathology, or might be part of the pathology.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tremlett H, Bauer KC, Appel-Cresswell S, Finlay BB, Waubant E | title = The gut microbiome in human neurological disease: A review | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 369\u201382 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28220542 | doi = 10.1002/ana.24901 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8ed61b7e5b7b3db5c4635b7f3e5c771c44ca800d }} {{open access}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Klingelhoefer L, Reichmann H | title = The Gut and Nonmotor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease | journal = International Review of Neurobiology | volume = 134 | pages = 787\u2013809 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28805583 | doi = 10.1016/bs.irn.2017.05.027 | isbn = 9780128126035 }} {{open access}}</ref>\n\nVentures have been undertaken to explore antagonists of [[Adenosine receptor|adenosine receptors]] (specifically [[Adenosine A2A receptor|A<sub>2A</sub>]]) as an avenue for novel drugs for Parkinson's.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jenner|first=Peter|date=2014|title=An overview of adenosine A2A receptor antagonists in Parkinson's disease|journal=International Review of Neurobiology|volume=119|pages=71\u201386|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-801022-8.00003-9|issn=2162-5514|pmid=25175961|isbn=9780128010228}}</ref> Of these, [[istradefylline]] has emerged as the most successful medication and was approved for medical use in the United States in 2019.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-add-drug-treat-episodes-adults-parkinsons-disease|title=FDA approves new add-on drug to treat off episodes in adults with Parkinson's disease|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|date=2020-02-20|website=FDA|language=en|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> It is approved as an add-on treatment to the levodopa/carbidopa regime.<ref name=\":3\" />  \n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical condition classification and resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 9651\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|G|20||g|20}}, {{ICD10|F|02|3|f|00}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|332}}\n| ICDO            =\n| OMIM            = 168600\n| OMIM_mult       = {{OMIM2|556500}}\n| MedlinePlus     = 000755\n| eMedicineSubj   = neuro\n| eMedicineTopic  = 304\n| eMedicine_mult  = {{eMedicine2|neuro|635}} in young<br />{{eMedicine2|pmr|99}} rehab\n|MeSH=D010300\n| GeneReviewsNBK   = NBK1223\n| GeneReviewsName = Parkinson Disease Overview\n}}\n{{Sister project links|d=Q11085}}\n* {{curlie|Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders/Parkinson's_Disease/|Parkinson's Disease}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20161202234630/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/parkinsons_disease/parkinsons_disease.htm Parkinson's Disease: Hope Through Research (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061109041052/http://www.wpda.org/ World Parkinson Disease Association]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081220041909/http://www.pdgene.org/ PDGENE \u2013 Database for Parkinson's Disease genetic association studies]\n\n{{Mental and behavioral disorders|selected=neurological}}\n{{CNS diseases of the nervous system}}\n{{Antiparkinson}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{featured article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parkinson's Disease}}\n[[Category:Parkinson's disease| ]]\n[[Category:Aging-associated diseases]]\n[[Category:Ailments of unknown cause]]\n[[Category:Geriatrics]]\n[[Category:Neurodegenerative disorders]]\n[[Category:Cytoskeletal defects]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n[[Category:Psychiatric diagnosis]]\n[[Category:RTTNEURO]]\n", "name_user": "Pintoch", "label": "safe", "comment": "sources are not open access", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease"}

In 1961, Chelsea Association Football Club was formed from the refinery team and affiliated to the Auckland Football Association. In 1963, Chelsea A.F.C. was renamed as Glenfield Rovers A.F.C. and moved to its current home today of McFetridge Park.\n\nToday the club has a two-level clubrooms consisting of a formal lounge, fully licensed bar and kitchen, thirteen changing rooms, four full size fields of which three are fully floodlit, an 85-car capacity car park and 200-person grandstand.\n\nThe main local rival is [[Birkenhead United]] and is viewed by many as the biggest and bitterest rivalry in New Zealand football. It is believed the origins of this bitter rivalry started when Birkenhead AFC held their [[Chatham Cup]] parade on an open top double decker pass that passed McFetridge Park. Birkenhead fans then taunted Rovers fans by singing \"We've won it 2 times , We've won it 2 times, at [[North Harbour Stadium|Harbour Stadium]], We won it 2 times'. This song made reference to their 2 back to back Chatham Cup victories. This song infuriated Rovers fans no end.In a 1993 game between Rovers and Birkenhead, Birkenhead fans taunted Rovers striker Darren Werner by singing \" Axl wants his hair back \" and \"Poor man's Axl\" a reference to Werner's admiration of [[Guns N' Roses]] frontman W.Axl Rose. Werner also plays bass guitar in local band \"Despiser\". Locals refer to them as \"Des-pisser\".\n\n900 members enjoy a variety of levels of football which include 18 midget teams, 13 junior and 8 youth teams, 18 senior men's teams and 4 senior women's teams.\n\nFor many years Glenfield Rovers was the only [[North Shore]] team with a Premier Women's team and has a proud history in the women's game\n\nThe midget programme is run on a Friday night which enables members to enjoy other winter sports as well and gives children the novelty of playing under floodlights. The junior and youth teams as well as most of the senior teams play in the [[Northern Football Federation|Northern]] and [[Auckland Football Federation]] competitions in a season which lasts from early April through to late August.\n\nThe club also offers a seven-a-side summer tournament which goes from late October through to early March which attracts over 1000 participating members each year in what is arguably the best run summer football programme on The Shore.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Honours==\nMen's Premier Team League Honours:\n<br />\n1965&nbsp;\u2013 Northern League Division Two B\n<br />\n1976&nbsp;\u2013 Northern League Division Two\n<br />\n1987&nbsp;\u2013 Northern League Division Two\n<br />\n1996&nbsp;\u2013 Northern League Division One, Chatham Cup Quarter Finals\n<br />\n2002&nbsp;\u2013 Northern Premier League\n<br />\n2003&nbsp;\u2013 Northern Premier League\n<br />\n2008&nbsp;\u2013 Chatham Cup Semi Finals\n<br />\n2010&nbsp;\u2013 Chatham Cup Quarter Finals\n<br />\n2013&nbsp;\u2013 Northern League Division One\n<br />\n2014&nbsp;\u2013 Northern Premier League\n\n<br />\nWomen's Premier Team Honours:\n<br />\n1989&nbsp;\u2013 Northern Women's League Division One\n<br />\n1991&nbsp;\u2013 AWFA Knockout Shield runners-up\n<br />\n2007&nbsp;\u2013 National Women's Knockout Cup runners-up\n<br />\n2010&nbsp;\u2013 Northern Premier Women's League\n<br />\n2011&nbsp;\u2013 National Women's Knockout Cup winner, Northern Premier Women's League, Northern Premier Women's League Cup\n<br />\n2013&nbsp;\u2013 National Women's Knockout Cup runners-up\n<br />\n2014&nbsp;\u2013 National Women's Knockout Cup winners\n<br />\n2015&nbsp;\u2013 National Women's Knockout Cup winners\n<br />\n2016&nbsp;\u2013 National Women's Knockout Cup runners-up\n<br />\n2017&nbsp;\u2013 Kate Sheppard Women's Knockout Cup Winners\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.glenfieldrovers.org.nz Club website]\n*[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/nz05.html New Zealand 2004/05 Season Results]\n\n{{Lotto Sport Italia NRFL Premier |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Association football clubs in Auckland]]\n[[Category:1960 establishments in New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=June 2019}}\n{{Infobox football club\n|  clubname = Glenfield Rovers AFC\n|  image    = Glenfield Rovers.gif\n|  fullname = Glenfield Rovers AFC & Sports Club Inc|  league =  [[Northern League (New Zealand)]]\n|  founded = 1960|  mens premier coach = Danny Donegan\n\n|  ground = McFetridge Park, Archers Road, [[Glenfield, New Zealand|Glenfield]], [[Auckland]]\n|  chairman = Andy Moore\n\n| pattern_la1=_yellow_stripes|pattern_b1=_yellow_stripes|pattern_ra1=_yellow_stripes|\n| leftarm1=000000|body1=000000|rightarm1=000000|shorts1=000000|socks1=000000|\npattern_la2=_blue_stripes|pattern_b2=_blackstripes|pattern_ra2=_blue_stripes|leftarm2=000000|body2=0000FF|rightarm2=000000|shorts2=FFFFFF|socks2=000000|\n| title      = Glenfield Rovers\n}}\n\n'''Glenfield Rovers''' is a semi-professional [[football (soccer)]] club based in [[Glenfield, New Zealand|Glenfield]], [[New Zealand]]. that competes in the [[Northern League (New Zealand)|Lotto NRFL Premier League]]\n\n==History==\nIn 1960 Glenfield Rovers began as the \"Chelsea Sugar Refinery\" football team.
