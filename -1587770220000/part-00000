As war came to the colonies, Mathews took part in the [[Indian Wars]] and colonial revolutionary efforts.

During the [[American Revolution]], he toured the [[American frontier|western frontier]] to fortify the colonial border from Indian attacks, and oversaw sail manufacture for the [[Continental Navy]]'s Virginia fleet. When turncoat [[Benedict Arnold]] enacted a surprise [[raid of Richmond]] in January 1781, Mathews lead Virginia militia forces in defense.\n\nMathews was an original [[trustee]] of Liberty Hall (later [[Washington and Lee University]]), when it was made into a college in 1776.

It is somewhat salt-tolerant. The cultivar 'Blue Muffin' is more compact than the species and has fruit that are a deeper blue than the species.\n* ''[[Viburnum dilatatum]]'' has flat-topped flowers, reddish leaves in autumn, and bright red fruit that persist into winter.\n*[[Viburnum \u00d7 jackii|''Viburnum'' \u00d7 ''jackii'']] &ndash; Jack's viburnum\n* ''Viburnum \u00d7 juddii'' (''V. bitchiuense'' \u00d7 ''V. carlesii'')\n* ''[[Viburnum plicatum]]'' has white flowers, textured leaves, reddish-black fruit, and can grow quite large under ideal conditions.

Some species are densely hairy on the shoots and leaves, with star-shaped hairs.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are produced in [[corymb]]s 5\u201315&nbsp;cm across, each flower white to cream or pink, small, 3\u20135&nbsp;mm across, with five petals, strongly fragrant in some species. The [[gynoecium]] has three connate [[carpel]]s with the [[nectary]] on top of the gynoecium. Some species also have a fringe of large, showy sterile flowers around the perimeter of the corymb to act as a pollinator target.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is a spherical, oval, or somewhat flattened [[drupe]], red to purple, blue, or black, and containing a single [[seed]]; some are edible for humans, but many others are mildly [[poison]]ous.

It is somewhat salt-tolerant. The cultivar 'Blue Muffin' is more compact than the species and has fruit that are a deeper blue than the species.\n* ''[[Viburnum dilatatum]]'' has flat-topped flowers, reddish leaves in autumn, and bright red fruit that persist into winter.\n*[[Viburnum \u00d7 jackii|''Viburnum'' \u00d7 ''jackii'']] &ndash; Jack's viburnum\n* ''Viburnum \u00d7 juddii'' (''V. bitchiuense'' \u00d7 ''V. carlesii'')\n* ''[[Viburnum plicatum]]'' has white flowers, textured leaves, reddish-black fruit, and can grow quite large under ideal conditions.

For most of the time since then, Australia\u2013New Guinea remained a continuous landmass. When the [[last glacial period]] ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed [[Bass Strait]], separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the [[Aru Islands]], and the Australian mainland.\n\nA northern arc consisting of the [[New Guinea Highlands]], the [[Raja Ampat Islands]], and [[Halmahera]] was uplifted by the northward migration of Australia and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]].

During this time, the continent experienced numerous changes in climate, but the overall trend was towards greater aridity. When [[South America]] eventually separated from Antarctica, the development of the cold [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] changed weather patterns across the world. For Australia\u2013New Guinea, it brought a marked intensification of the drying trend. The great inland seas and lakes dried out. Much of the long-established broad-leaf [[deciduous]] forest began to give way to the distinctive hard-leaved [[sclerophyllous]] plants that characterise the modern Australian landscape. \n\nTypical Southern Hemisphere flora include the [[conifer]]s ''[[Podocarpus]]'' (eastern Australia and New Guinea), the rainforest emergents ''[[Araucaria]]'' (eastern Australia and New Guinea), ''[[Nothofagus]]'' (New Guinea and [[Tasmania]]) and ''[[Agathis]]'' (northern [[Queensland]] and New Guinea), as well as [[tree fern]]s and several species of ''Eucalyptus''. Prominent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to [[aridity]] and fire which include [[sclerophyll|scleromorphy]] and [[serotiny]]. These adaptations are common in species from the large and well-known families [[Proteaceae]] (''[[Banksia]]''), [[Myrtaceae]] (''[[Eucalyptus]]'' or gum trees, ''[[Melaleuca]]s'' and ''[[Callistemon]]s''), [[Fabaceae]] (''[[Acacia]]''s or wattles and ''[[Casuarina]]'' or she-oaks) and ''[[Grevillea]]s'', which are typically found in the Australian mainland. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many [[tropical rainforest]] species with origins in Asia, such as ''[[Castanopsis acuminatissima]],'' ''[[Lithocarpus]]'' spp., [[Elaeocarpaceae|elaeocarps]], and [[Lauraceae|laurels]], together with typically Australasian flora. In the New Guinean highlands, conifers such as ''[[Dacrycarpus]], [[Dacrydium]], [[Papuacedrus]]'' and ''[[Libocedrus]]'' are present.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/samples/australiaburningsample.pdf |title=Australia Burning: Fire Ecology, Policy and Management Issues |publisher=CSIRO Publishing}}</ref>\n\nFor many species, the primary refuge was the relatively cool and well-watered [[Great Dividing Range]]. Even today, pockets of remnant vegetation remain in the cool uplands, some species not much changed from the Gondwanan forms of 60 or 90 million years ago. Eventually, the Australia\u2013New Guinea tectonic plate collided with the [[Eurasian plate]] to the north. The collision caused the northern part of the continent to buckle upwards, forming the high and rugged mountains of New Guinea and, by reverse (downwards) buckling, the [[Torres Strait]] that now separates the two main landmasses. The collision also pushed up the islands of [[Wallacea]], which served as island 'stepping-stones' that allowed plants from [[Southeast Asia]]'s rainforests to colonise New Guinea, and some plants from Australia\u2013New Guinea to move into Southeast Asia. The ocean straits between the islands were narrow enough to allow plant dispersal, but served as an effective barrier to exchange of land mammals between Australia\u2013New Guinea and Asia.\n\nAmong the fungi, the remarkable association between ''[[Cyttaria]]'' ''gunnii'' (one of the \"golf-ball\" fungi) and its associated trees in the genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'' is evidence of that drift: the only other places where this association is known are New Zealand and southern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Korf |first=R.

There were three main reasons for the enormous diversity that developed in animal, fungal and plant life.\n\n* While much of the rest of the world underwent significant cooling and thus loss of species diversity, Australia\u2013New Guinea was drifting north at such a pace that the overall global cooling effect was roughly equalled by its gradual movement toward the [[equator]]. [[Temperature]]s in Australia\u2013New Guinea, in other words, remained reasonably constant for a very long time, and a vast number of different animal, fungal and plant species were able to evolve to fit particular [[ecological niche]]s.\n* Because the continent was more isolated than any other, very few outside species arrived to colonise, and unique native forms developed unimpeded.\n* Finally, despite the fact that the continent was already very old and thus relatively infertile, there are dispersed areas of high fertility. Where other continents had [[Volcanism|volcanic]] activity and/or massive [[Glacier|glaciation]] events to turn over fresh, unleached [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s rich in [[mineral]]s, the rocks and [[soil]]s of Australia\u2013New Guinea were left largely untouched except by gradual [[erosion]] and deep [[weathering]]. In general, fertile soils produce a profusion of life, and a relatively large number of species/level of biodiversity. This is because where [[nutrient]]s are plentiful, competition is largely a matter of outcompeting rival species, leaving great scope for innovative [[co-evolution]] as is witnessed in tropical, fertile ecosystems. In contrast, infertile soils tend to induce competition on an abiotic basis meaning individuals all face constant environmental pressures, leaving less scope for divergent evolution, a process instrumental in creating new species.\n\nAlthough New Guinea is the most northerly part of the continent, and could be expected to be the most [[tropical climate|tropical]] in climate, the altitude of the New Guinea highlands is such that a great many animals and plants that were once common across Australia\u2013New Guinea now survive only in the tropical highlands where they are severely threatened by [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Australia}}\nIn New Guinea, the climate is mostly [[monsoonal]] (December to March), southeast monsoon (May to October), and [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]] with slight seasonal temperature variation. In lower altitudes, the temperature is around 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (27&nbsp;\u00b0C) year round. But the higher altitudes, such as [[Mendi]], are constantly around 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C) with cool lows nearing 52&nbsp;\u00b0F (11&nbsp;\u00b0C), with abundant rainfall and high humidity. The [[New Guinea Highlands]] are one of the few regions close to the [[equator]] that experience [[snowfall]], which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland. Some areas in the island experience an extraordinary amount of precipitation, averaging roughly {{convert|4500|mm}} of rainfall annually.\n\nThe Australian landmass's climate is mostly [[desert]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], with the southern coastal corners having a [[Temperateness|temperate]] climate, such as [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] and [[humid subtropical]] climate in the east coast and [[Mediterranean climate]] in the west.

Prominent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to [[aridity]] and fire which include [[sclerophyll|scleromorphy]] and [[serotiny]]. These adaptations are common in species from the large and well-known families [[Proteaceae]] (''[[Banksia]]''), [[Myrtaceae]] (''[[Eucalyptus]]'' or gum trees, ''[[Melaleuca]]s'' and ''[[Callistemon]]s''), [[Fabaceae]] (''[[Acacia]]''s or wattles and ''[[Casuarina]]'' or she-oaks) and ''[[Grevillea]]s'', which are typically found in the Australian mainland. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many [[tropical rainforest]] species with origins in Asia, such as ''[[Castanopsis acuminatissima]],'' ''[[Lithocarpus]]'' spp., [[Elaeocarpaceae|elaeocarps]], and [[Lauraceae|laurels]], together with typically Australasian flora. In the New Guinean highlands, conifers such as ''[[Dacrycarpus]], [[Dacrydium]], [[Papuacedrus]]'' and ''[[Libocedrus]]'' are present.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/samples/australiaburningsample.pdf |title=Australia Burning: Fire Ecology, Policy and Management Issues |publisher=CSIRO Publishing}}</ref>\n\nFor many species, the primary refuge was the relatively cool and well-watered [[Great Dividing Range]]. Even today, pockets of remnant vegetation remain in the cool uplands, some species not much changed from the Gondwanan forms of 60 or 90 million years ago. Eventually, the Australia\u2013New Guinea tectonic plate collided with the [[Eurasian plate]] to the north. The collision caused the northern part of the continent to buckle upwards, forming the high and rugged mountains of New Guinea and, by reverse (downwards) buckling, the [[Torres Strait]] that now separates the two main landmasses. The collision also pushed up the islands of [[Wallacea]], which served as island 'stepping-stones' that allowed plants from [[Southeast Asia]]'s rainforests to colonise New Guinea, and some plants from Australia\u2013New Guinea to move into Southeast Asia. The ocean straits between the islands were narrow enough to allow plant dispersal, but served as an effective barrier to exchange of land mammals between Australia\u2013New Guinea and Asia.\n\nAmong the fungi, the remarkable association between ''[[Cyttaria]]'' ''gunnii'' (one of the \"golf-ball\" fungi) and its associated trees in the genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'' is evidence of that drift: the only other places where this association is known are New Zealand and southern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Korf |first=R.

[[Marsupial]]s and [[monotreme]]s also existed on other continents, but only in Australia\u2013New Guinea did they out-compete the [[Placentalia|placental]] [[mammals]] and come to dominate. New Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: monotremes, three orders of marsupials, [[rodent]]s and [[bat]]s; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has a rich diversity of [[coral]] life and 1,200 species of [[fish]] have been found.

There were three main reasons for the enormous diversity that developed in animal, fungal and plant life.\n\n* While much of the rest of the world underwent significant cooling and thus loss of species diversity, Australia\u2013New Guinea was drifting north at such a pace that the overall global cooling effect was roughly equalled by its gradual movement toward the [[equator]]. [[Temperature]]s in Australia\u2013New Guinea, in other words, remained reasonably constant for a very long time, and a vast number of different animal, fungal and plant species were able to evolve to fit particular [[ecological niche]]s.\n* Because the continent was more isolated than any other, very few outside species arrived to colonise, and unique native forms developed unimpeded.\n* Finally, despite the fact that the continent was already very old and thus relatively infertile, there are dispersed areas of high fertility. Where other continents had [[Volcanism|volcanic]] activity and/or massive [[Glacier|glaciation]] events to turn over fresh, unleached [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s rich in [[mineral]]s, the rocks and [[soil]]s of Australia\u2013New Guinea were left largely untouched except by gradual [[erosion]] and deep [[weathering]]. In general, fertile soils produce a profusion of life, and a relatively large number of species/level of biodiversity. This is because where [[nutrient]]s are plentiful, competition is largely a matter of outcompeting rival species, leaving great scope for innovative [[co-evolution]] as is witnessed in tropical, fertile ecosystems. In contrast, infertile soils tend to induce competition on an abiotic basis meaning individuals all face constant environmental pressures, leaving less scope for divergent evolution, a process instrumental in creating new species.\n\nAlthough New Guinea is the most northerly part of the continent, and could be expected to be the most [[tropical climate|tropical]] in climate, the altitude of the New Guinea highlands is such that a great many animals and plants that were once common across Australia\u2013New Guinea now survive only in the tropical highlands where they are severely threatened by [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Australia}}\nIn New Guinea, the climate is mostly [[monsoonal]] (December to March), southeast monsoon (May to October), and [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]] with slight seasonal temperature variation. In lower altitudes, the temperature is around 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (27&nbsp;\u00b0C) year round. But the higher altitudes, such as [[Mendi]], are constantly around 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C) with cool lows nearing 52&nbsp;\u00b0F (11&nbsp;\u00b0C), with abundant rainfall and high humidity. The [[New Guinea Highlands]] are one of the few regions close to the [[equator]] that experience [[snowfall]], which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland. Some areas in the island experience an extraordinary amount of precipitation, averaging roughly {{convert|4500|mm}} of rainfall annually.\n\nThe Australian landmass's climate is mostly [[desert]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], with the southern coastal corners having a [[Temperateness|temperate]] climate, such as [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] and [[humid subtropical]] climate in the east coast and [[Mediterranean climate]] in the west. The northern parts of the country have a [[tropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclim.html|title=BOM \u2013 Climate of Australia|first=National Climate|last=Centre|website=pandora.nla.gov.au|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclim.html|archivedate=17 March 2009}}</ref> [[Snow]] falls frequently on the [[Great Dividing Range|highlands]] near the east coast, in the states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]] and in the [[Australian Capital Territory]].

This sparked an interest early on for literature and also for the unconscious, which in turn gave rise to her interest in psychoanalysis.\n\nPizarnik was apolitical.

While most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the manga, the plot differs considerably and does not include much of the last half of the manga. The soundtrack, which draws heavily from traditional [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesian]] [[gamelan]] as well as Japanese [[noh]] music, was composed by [[Tsutomu \u014chashi|Sh\u014dji Yamashiro]] and performed by [[Geinoh Yamashirogumi]].\n\n''Akira'' premiered in Japan on July 16, 1988 by [[Toho]], but was initially unable to recoup its budget.

By 2019, Tokyo had been rebuilt. Now known as Neo-Tokyo, it is plagued by corruption, anti-government protests, terrorism, and gang violence and is on the verge of collapse. During a massive protest, the hot-headed Sh\u014dtar\u014d Kaneda leads his vigilante [[b\u014ds\u014dzoku]] motorcycle gang against the rival Clown gang. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima inadvertently crashes his motorcycle into Takashi, an esper (person with [[extrasensory perception]]) who escaped from a government laboratory with the aid of a resistance organization. The accident awakens psychic powers in Tetsuo, attracting the attention of a secret government project directed by [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] Colonel Shikishima. Assisted by esper Masaru, Shikishima recaptures Takashi, takes Tetsuo with him, and arrests Kaneda and his gang. While being interrogated by the police, Kaneda meets Kei, an activist belonging to the resistance movement, and tricks the authorities into releasing her and his gang.\n\nShikishima and his head of research, Doctor \u014cnishi, discover that Tetsuo possesses powerful psychic abilities similar to Akira, the esper responsible for Tokyo's destruction. Takashi's fellow esper Kiyoko forewarns Shikishima of Neo-Tokyo's impending destruction. However, Neo-Tokyo's parliament dismisses Shikishima's concerns, leading him to consider killing Tetsuo to prevent another cataclysm.\n\nMeanwhile, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital, steals Kaneda's motorcycle, and prepares to flee Neo-Tokyo with his girlfriend, Kaori. The Clowns ambush them, but after a severe beating are rescued by Kaneda's gang. During the intervention, however, Tetsuo begins suffering intense headaches and hallucinations, and he is returned to the hospital. Kaneda joins Kei's resistance cell after overhearing their plan to rescue Tetsuo and the other espers.\n\nAt the hospital, the espers confront Tetsuo, and he aggressively fights back with his psychokinetic powers and escapes. These powers are beginning to make him egomaniacal and unstable. Kaneda, Kei, and the resistance group infiltrate the hospital and are drawn into Shikishima and the espers' attempt to stop Tetsuo. He overpowers them all and flees the hospital after learning from Kiyoko that he can gain help from Akira, who is in cryonic storage beneath the Olympic Stadium construction site.\n\nKei and Kaneda escape military custody because of Kiyoko, who is hoping to stop Tetsuo using Kei as a medium. Shikishima stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the Neo-Tokyo government and directs all of its military forces to destroy Tetsuo. Tetsuo returns to his gang's former hangout, Harukiya Bar, to obtain drugs to control his powers. He murders the bartender and destroys the bar in the process. When his former friends Yamagata and Kai arrive and confront him, he cold-bloodedly slaughters Yamagata in front of Kai; Kaneda is informed by Kai of what happened and vows to avenge his friend. Tetsuo rampages through Neo-Tokyo, arriving at Akira's [[cryogenic storage dewar]] under the stadium. Kiyoko has Kei fight Tetsuo, but he easily defeats her and exhumes Akira's remains. Using a laser rifle, Kaneda fights Tetsuo in a duel, and Shikishima fires an [[Space weapon|orbital weapon]] at him, but both fail to stop him.\n\nShikishima and Kaori approach the stadium to find Tetsuo in great pain; Shikishima offers to return Tetsuo to the hospital, heal his injuries, and help control his abilities, while Kaori attempts to restrain Tetsuo. However, Kaneda arrives and duels with Tetsuo again. Unable to control his powers, Tetsuo mutates into a gigantic mass, consuming all matter, engulfing Kaneda and killing Kaori. As the mass grows, the espers awaken Akira to stop it. After reuniting with his friends, Akira creates another singularity that draws Tetsuo and Kaneda into another dimension. The espers teleport Shikishima to a safe distance as the singularity destroys Neo-Tokyo in a mirror of Tokyo's previous destruction, and they agree to rescue Kaneda, knowing that they will not be able to return to this dimension as a result.\n\nIn the singularity, Kaneda experiences Tetsuo's and the espers' childhood, including Tetsuo's dependence on Kaneda during their childhood, and how the children were trained and altered before Tokyo's destruction. The espers return Kaneda to his world, informing him that Akira will take Tetsuo to safety and that Kei is developing psychic powers.\n\nThe singularity disappears, and water floods the city. \u014cnishi is crushed to death when the laboratory collapses on him. Kaneda discovers that Kei and Kai have survived, and they drive off into the ruins, while Shikishima watches the sunrise. Finally, Tetsuo introduces himself at another unspecified level of existence.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Characters\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Japanese voice actor<ref name=\"CBM\" />\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| English dubbing actor<br />(Electric Media/[[Kodansha]]/[[Streamline Pictures|Streamline]], 1989)<ref name=\"Streamline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/20/akira/ |title=Akira (movie) |publisher=CrystalAcids.com |accessdate=August 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129025742/http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/20/akira/ |archive-date=November 29, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| English dubbing actor<br />([[Animaze]]/[[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer-Geneon]], 2001)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/19/akira/ |title=Akira (movie) |publisher=CrystalAcids.com |accessdate=December 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225155717/http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/19/akira/ |archive-date=February 25, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The group's assembly was necessitated by the unconventionally high budget of around \u00a51,100,000,000, intended to achieve the desired epic standard equal to Otomo's over 2,000-page manga tale. The committee consisted of [[Kodansha]], [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]], [[Bandai]], [[Hakuhodo]], [[Toho]], [[Laserdisc]] Corporation and [[Sumitomo Corporation]] who all forwarded money and promotion towards the film. The animation for the film was provided for by animation producers, Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now [[TMS Entertainment]]).<ref name=\"AK3\" />\n\n''Akira'' had [[Lip-synching#Animation|pre-scored]] dialogue (wherein the dialogue is recorded before the film starts production and the movements of the characters' lips are animated to match it;<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BFmrVHB44w |title=Interview with Akira creator Katsuhiro Otomo (3/4) | work =Akira 2019 |date= December 29, 2009 |via=YouTube |access-date=November 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417162028/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BFmrVHB44w |archive-date=April 17, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> a first for an anime production and extremely unusual even today for an anime. {{citation needed|date=July 2019}}, although the voice actors did perform with the aid of [[animatics]]),<ref name=\"CBM\">{{cite book |last= Hughes |first=David |title=Comic Book Movies |publisher=Virgin Books |isbn=0-7535-0767-6 |date=2003 |page=27}}</ref> and super-fluid motion as realized in the film's more than 160,000 animation [[cel]]s.<ref name=\"AK3\">Production insights, Akira #3 ([[Epic Comics]], 1988).</ref> [[Computer-generated imagery]] was also used in the film (created by High-Tech Lab.

The film's main production was completed in 1987, with sound recording and mixing performed in early 1988. It was released in 1988, two years before the manga officially ended in 1990. Otomo is claimed to have filled 2,000 pages of notebooks, containing various ideas and character designs for the film, but the final storyboard consisted of a trimmed-down 738 pages.<ref name=\"CBM\" /> He had great difficulty completing the manga; Otomo has stated that the inspiration for its conclusion arose from a conversation that he had with [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austinfilm.org/page.aspx?pid=2961 |title=Akira Program Notes |publisher=Austin Film Society |accessdate=December 22, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222092919/http://www.austinfilm.org/page.aspx?pid=2961 |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He later recalled that the film project had to begin with the writing of an ending that would bring suitable closure to major characters, storylines, and themes without being extraordinarily lengthy, so that he could know in reverse order which manga elements would make the cut into the anime and thus suitably resolve the manga's various elements into a lean, two-hour story.<ref name=\"DVD int\">{{cite AV media |title= Director Interview |medium= DVD |publisher= [[FUNimation Entertainment]] |date=November 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOtomo is a big fan of ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]''.

[[Katsuhiro Otomo]], produced by Ry\u014dhei Suzuki and Shunz\u014d Kat\u014d, and written by Otomo and [[Izo Hashimoto]], based on Otomo's 1982 [[Akira (manga)|manga of the same name]]. The film had a production budget of {{JPY|1.1 billion|link=yes}}<ref name=\"empire\" /> ({{US$|{{#expr:1100/128 round 0}} million|long=no}}),<ref name=\"currency\" /> making it the most expensive [[anime]] film of its time.<ref name=\"Beck\" />\n\nSet in a [[dystopia]]n 2019, ''Akira'' tells the story of Sh\u014dtar\u014d Kaneda, a leader of a  [[b\u014ds\u014dzoku|biker gang]] whose childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, acquires incredible [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] abilities after a motorcycle accident, eventually threatening an entire military complex amidst chaos and rebellion in the sprawling futuristic metropolis of Neo-Tokyo. While most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the manga, the plot differs considerably and does not include much of the last half of the manga.

By 2019, Tokyo had been rebuilt. Now known as Neo-Tokyo, it is plagued by corruption, anti-government protests, terrorism, and gang violence and is on the verge of collapse. During a massive protest, the hot-headed Sh\u014dtar\u014d Kaneda leads his vigilante [[b\u014ds\u014dzoku]] motorcycle gang against the rival Clown gang. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima inadvertently crashes his motorcycle into Takashi, an esper (person with [[extrasensory perception]]) who escaped from a government laboratory with the aid of a resistance organization. The accident awakens psychic powers in Tetsuo, attracting the attention of a secret government project directed by [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] Colonel Shikishima. Assisted by esper Masaru, Shikishima recaptures Takashi, takes Tetsuo with him, and arrests Kaneda and his gang. While being interrogated by the police, Kaneda meets Kei, an activist belonging to the resistance movement, and tricks the authorities into releasing her and his gang.\n\nShikishima and his head of research, Doctor \u014cnishi, discover that Tetsuo possesses powerful psychic abilities similar to Akira, the esper responsible for Tokyo's destruction. Takashi's fellow esper Kiyoko forewarns Shikishima of Neo-Tokyo's impending destruction. However, Neo-Tokyo's parliament dismisses Shikishima's concerns, leading him to consider killing Tetsuo to prevent another cataclysm.\n\nMeanwhile, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital, steals Kaneda's motorcycle, and prepares to flee Neo-Tokyo with his girlfriend, Kaori. The Clowns ambush them, but after a severe beating are rescued by Kaneda's gang. During the intervention, however, Tetsuo begins suffering intense headaches and hallucinations, and he is returned to the hospital. Kaneda joins Kei's resistance cell after overhearing their plan to rescue Tetsuo and the other espers.\n\nAt the hospital, the espers confront Tetsuo, and he aggressively fights back with his psychokinetic powers and escapes. These powers are beginning to make him egomaniacal and unstable. Kaneda, Kei, and the resistance group infiltrate the hospital and are drawn into Shikishima and the espers' attempt to stop Tetsuo. He overpowers them all and flees the hospital after learning from Kiyoko that he can gain help from Akira, who is in cryonic storage beneath the Olympic Stadium construction site.\n\nKei and Kaneda escape military custody because of Kiyoko, who is hoping to stop Tetsuo using Kei as a medium. Shikishima stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the Neo-Tokyo government and directs all of its military forces to destroy Tetsuo. Tetsuo returns to his gang's former hangout, Harukiya Bar, to obtain drugs to control his powers. He murders the bartender and destroys the bar in the process. When his former friends Yamagata and Kai arrive and confront him, he cold-bloodedly slaughters Yamagata in front of Kai; Kaneda is informed by Kai of what happened and vows to avenge his friend. Tetsuo rampages through Neo-Tokyo, arriving at Akira's [[cryogenic storage dewar]] under the stadium. Kiyoko has Kei fight Tetsuo, but he easily defeats her and exhumes Akira's remains. Using a laser rifle, Kaneda fights Tetsuo in a duel, and Shikishima fires an [[Space weapon|orbital weapon]] at him, but both fail to stop him.\n\nShikishima and Kaori approach the stadium to find Tetsuo in great pain; Shikishima offers to return Tetsuo to the hospital, heal his injuries, and help control his abilities, while Kaori attempts to restrain Tetsuo. However, Kaneda arrives and duels with Tetsuo again. Unable to control his powers, Tetsuo mutates into a gigantic mass, consuming all matter, engulfing Kaneda and killing Kaori. As the mass grows, the espers awaken Akira to stop it. After reuniting with his friends, Akira creates another singularity that draws Tetsuo and Kaneda into another dimension. The espers teleport Shikishima to a safe distance as the singularity destroys Neo-Tokyo in a mirror of Tokyo's previous destruction, and they agree to rescue Kaneda, knowing that they will not be able to return to this dimension as a result.\n\nIn the singularity, Kaneda experiences Tetsuo's and the espers' childhood, including Tetsuo's dependence on Kaneda during their childhood, and how the children were trained and altered before Tokyo's destruction. The espers return Kaneda to his world, informing him that Akira will take Tetsuo to safety and that Kei is developing psychic powers.\n\nThe singularity disappears, and water floods the city. \u014cnishi is crushed to death when the laboratory collapses on him. Kaneda discovers that Kei and Kai have survived, and they drive off into the ruins, while Shikishima watches the sunrise. Finally, Tetsuo introduces himself at another unspecified level of existence.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Characters\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Japanese voice actor<ref name=\"CBM\" />\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| English dubbing actor<br />(Electric Media/[[Kodansha]]/[[Streamline Pictures|Streamline]], 1989)<ref name=\"Streamline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/20/akira/ |title=Akira (movie) |publisher=CrystalAcids.com |accessdate=August 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129025742/http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/20/akira/ |archive-date=November 29, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| English dubbing actor<br />([[Animaze]]/[[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer-Geneon]], 2001)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/19/akira/ |title=Akira (movie) |publisher=CrystalAcids.com |accessdate=December 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225155717/http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/19/akira/ |archive-date=February 25, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The group's assembly was necessitated by the unconventionally high budget of around \u00a51,100,000,000, intended to achieve the desired epic standard equal to Otomo's over 2,000-page manga tale. The committee consisted of [[Kodansha]], [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]], [[Bandai]], [[Hakuhodo]], [[Toho]], [[Laserdisc]] Corporation and [[Sumitomo Corporation]] who all forwarded money and promotion towards the film.

In addition, Takashi has a \"26\" [[tattoo]]ed on his hand which closely resembles the font used in ''Tetsujin 28-go''.

On Wednesday 3 September 1890, he returned to Huddersfield with his father-in-law, James Priestley JP, to attend the grand funeral of Alderman John Varley JP (1836\u20131890), a wealthy, \"brusque\" and \"rugged\" coal-merchant with his finger in many pies, who had died of [[apoplexy]].<ref>''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 6 September 1890: Death of Alderman Varley JP</ref> This involved a very long procession, robed or uniformed, winding its way on foot to the tolling of [[Change ringing#Half-muffling|muffled bells]] from Varley's house, Springfield, [[Newsome]] to the church of St John the Evangelist, Newsome. It was headed by eighty policemen, nine firemen, over forty members of [[Kirklees|Huddersfield Borough Council]] and several [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]]. Next came two carriages bearing priests and doctors, then the [[hearse]] flanked by walking [[Pall-bearer|bearers]] from the mill of Vickerman & Sons. About eight carriages containing chief mourners and local [[Very Important Person|VIPs]] followed the hearse; then came many more VIPs on foot, including local politicians, and six private carriages containing more VIPs followed these. All along the road house-blinds were closed as the hearse drew near. When the procession passed by the [[Factory|mills]], machinery stopped, flags dropped to [[half-mast]] and the workers lined the route, heads bowed. The [[surplice]]d choir met the procession at the church [[lychgate]]. Forster was waiting in the church to attend the service, being too infirm to take part in the procession.<ref>''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 3 September 1890: Funeral of the late Alderman Varley JP</ref>\n\nAfter Forster died, he was well-remembered at St Andrews:<blockquote><nowiki>[At St Andrew's]</nowiki> he ministered in season and out of season according to his strength and power . . . labouring patiently and diligently as an able preacher, a vigorous organiser, a wise manager of the schools, a painstaking parish priest, and in all things approved himself to be a Man of God. In those days this church was crowded to overflowing, for many came from far to hear his wise and loving words.<sup> ''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 18 September 1894</sup><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Rev.

A man of strong will, sound judgement and prompt decision, he influenced to no slight extent the Church life in Huddersfield while vicar of St Andrew's in that town; where he will ever be remembered for the definiteness of his teaching, the heartiness and reverence which characterised the services of his church, and for the well organised and successful day and Sunday schools connected therewith.<sup> ''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 18 September 1894</sup><ref name=\"CT1651\" /></blockquote>\n\n===St Michael and All Angels, Beckwithshaw===\n{{Main|Church of St Michael and All Angels, Beckwithshaw}}\n[[File:Beckwithshaw Church 031.jpg|thumb|right|St Michael and All Angels, Beckwithshaw]]\nIn 1887 he resigned the living at St Andrew's and became the first vicar of the recently [[Consecration#Churches, altars, and other ritual objects|consecrated]] St Michael and All Angels Church at [[Beckwithshaw]], because it was hoped that his health would improve in the \"comparative retirement\" of this \"quiet and secluded parish\".<ref name=\"York Herald 1 Sep 1894\" /><ref name=\"H&DC 29 Aug 1894\" /><ref name=\"HC 24 Dec 1886\" >''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 24 December 1886: Local news</ref> He was nominated to the living of \u00a3200 per annum and the promise of a future vicarage by Dr Williams of Moor Park; his preferment was announced on 7 January 1887 and he was licensed to the post by the Bishop of Ripon on 17 March 1887.<ref name=\"MC&LGA 15 Jan 1887\"/><ref name=\"HC 24 Dec 1886\" /><ref>''York Herald'', 19 March 1887: Ecclesiastical news</ref><ref>''Bury and Norwich Post'', 11 January 1887: The church</ref><ref>''Nottinghamshire Guardian'', 7 January 1887: The church, preferments and appointments (from the ''Guardian'')</ref> He was a [[fellow]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and was one of many members of that society to be innocently duped by the [[Society of Science, Letters and Art]], London.

On 1 June 1887, after collecting some scrap metal, blacksmiths Thomas Sadler and Anthony Pratt of Harrogate were drinking at the Smiths Arms opposite Beckwithshaw Church. On the way home, Pratt appeared too inebriated to walk and was left in a field by his friend. Sadler returned to find Pratt foaming at the mouth and dying. It was concluded that the cause of death at age 42 was excessive drinking.<ref>''[[Leeds Times]]'', 4 June 1887: Whitsuntide in Leeds</ref><ref>Death cert: Jun 1887, Pratt, Anthony, 42, Knaresborough, 9a/77</ref>\n\nForster took an interest in clerical matters. On the afternoon of 11 April 1889, he attended a large Anglican church meeting at Harrogate Church Institute, headed by the [[Henry Lascelles, 5th Earl of Harewood|Earl of Harewood]], the [[William Boyd Carpenter|Bishop of Ripon]], the [[John Pulleine|Bishop of Penrith]], Mr Joseph Dent Dent of [[Ribston Hall]], and a large contingent of local clergy.<ref name=\"YH 12 Apr 1889\" /><ref>Note: Dent Dent is the correct name</ref> The stated subject of the meeting was the reorganisation of the Ripon Diocesan Societies, but the content was a move by the Bishop of Ripon for funds to support pensions for retired clergy, nine-tenths of whom did not have independent means.

Sadly, Forster was not to live long enough to benefit from this improvement of the clerical lot.<ref name=\"YH 12 Apr 1889\" >''York Herald'', 12 April 1889: Ripon Diocesan Societies</ref> He supported the Church Institute which in turn supported the clergy, and he attended the annual bazaar, a three-day occasion in aid of its building fund.<ref>''[[Leeds Mercury]]'', 24 July 1889: Local and general</ref><ref>[http://www.harrogatepeopleandplaces.info/publications/thorpes1891/harrogateindetail.htm Harrogate people and places: Harrogate in detail - church institute].

In Beckwithshaw, \"in all absence of gloom\" the church was crowded at the funeral service, while in the village blinds were drawn and \"signs of marked sorrow were visible on every hand.\"<ref name=\"CT1651\" /><ref name=\"HC 8 Sep 1894\" /> While the body was laid in the [[chancel]], the congregation laid [[Wreath#Funeral and memorial wreaths|wreaths]] of flowers along the [[Altar rails|altar rail]]. [[Charles Wesley]]'s hymn ''Blessing, honour, thanks and praise'' was sung, and Mark Rowntree read the lesson before the choir sang the [[canticle]] ''[[Nunc Dimittis]]''. At the graveside service were [[Physician|medical officers]] from the local hospitals, an [[alderman]], a [[councillor]], numerous curates and vicars including Frank Shaw of St Andrew's, Huddersfield, D. M. Thomas, the curate of Beckwithshaw, and Mark Rowntree, vicar of [[St Robert's Church, Pannal|Pannal]]. Mr and Mrs Henry Williams, patrons of the living of Beckwithshaw, were there too.<ref name=\"HC 8 Sep 1894\" />\n\nThe funeral ''cort\u00e8ge'' travelled on foot more than a mile to the cemetery. The clergy and choir were robed; the choirboys carrying all the flowers: a \"picturesque appearance of reverential sorrow.\" At the cemetery, the grave was lined with ivy and flowers, and W. Binner conducted the service in \"a most impressive manner.\" Numerous relatives of Charles and his wife were present, although newspaper reports do not say that Mary herself was there. The choir sang ''[[For All the Saints]]''. The polished oak coffin had heavy brass mountings and a brass cross on the lid. According to the ''Huddersfield Chronicle'' of 1894, the cross and its pedestal were inscribed, \"Charles Farrar Forster, priest, born 29th February 1848; passed to rest 28th August 1894.\"<ref name=\"HC 8 Sep 1894\" >''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 8 September 1894</ref> However the existing inscription as of 2014 is as follows:<blockquote>\"In memory of Charles Farrar Forster, priest.

There was a large congregation. The organist, H. J. Wood, ARCO, played the voluntary ''Cantilene Pastorale'' by [[Alexandre Guilmant|Guilmant]]. There were psalms and hymns, and lessons were read by the vicar, W. F. Shaw. The choir sang an anthem which was followed by a sermon from the vicar.

In those days this church was crowded to overflowing, for many came from far to hear his wise and loving words.<sup> ''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 18 September 1894</sup><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Rev. W.F. Shaw, quoted in ''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 18 September 1894: The late Rev. C.F. Forster</ref></blockquote> The ''[[Church Times]]'' published an ''In Memoriam'' for Charles:<blockquote>Mr Forster had for some years suffered a painful and distressing malady which he bore, however, with remarkable fortitude . . . A man of strong will, sound judgement and prompt decision, he influenced to no slight extent the Church life in Huddersfield while vicar of St Andrew's in that town; where he will ever be remembered for the definiteness of his teaching, the heartiness and reverence which characterised the services of his church, and for the well organised and successful day and Sunday schools connected therewith.<sup> ''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 18 September 1894</sup><ref name=\"CT1651\" /></blockquote>\n\n===St Michael and All Angels, Beckwithshaw===\n{{Main|Church of St Michael and All Angels, Beckwithshaw}}\n[[File:Beckwithshaw Church 031.jpg|thumb|right|St Michael and All Angels, Beckwithshaw]]\nIn 1887 he resigned the living at St Andrew's and became the first vicar of the recently [[Consecration#Churches, altars, and other ritual objects|consecrated]] St Michael and All Angels Church at [[Beckwithshaw]], because it was hoped that his health would improve in the \"comparative retirement\" of this \"quiet and secluded parish\".<ref name=\"York Herald 1 Sep 1894\" /><ref name=\"H&DC 29 Aug 1894\" /><ref name=\"HC 24 Dec 1886\" >''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 24 December 1886: Local news</ref> He was nominated to the living of \u00a3200 per annum and the promise of a future vicarage by Dr Williams of Moor Park; his preferment was announced on 7 January 1887 and he was licensed to the post by the Bishop of Ripon on 17 March 1887.<ref name=\"MC&LGA 15 Jan 1887\"/><ref name=\"HC 24 Dec 1886\" /><ref>''York Herald'', 19 March 1887: Ecclesiastical news</ref><ref>''Bury and Norwich Post'', 11 January 1887: The church</ref><ref>''Nottinghamshire Guardian'', 7 January 1887: The church, preferments and appointments (from the ''Guardian'')</ref> He was a [[fellow]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and was one of many members of that society to be innocently duped by the [[Society of Science, Letters and Art]], London.

On 1 June 1887, after collecting some scrap metal, blacksmiths Thomas Sadler and Anthony Pratt of Harrogate were drinking at the Smiths Arms opposite Beckwithshaw Church. On the way home, Pratt appeared too inebriated to walk and was left in a field by his friend. Sadler returned to find Pratt foaming at the mouth and dying. It was concluded that the cause of death at age 42 was excessive drinking.<ref>''[[Leeds Times]]'', 4 June 1887: Whitsuntide in Leeds</ref><ref>Death cert: Jun 1887, Pratt, Anthony, 42, Knaresborough, 9a/77</ref>\n\nForster took an interest in clerical matters. On the afternoon of 11 April 1889, he attended a large Anglican church meeting at Harrogate Church Institute, headed by the [[Henry Lascelles, 5th Earl of Harewood|Earl of Harewood]], the [[William Boyd Carpenter|Bishop of Ripon]], the [[John Pulleine|Bishop of Penrith]], Mr Joseph Dent Dent of [[Ribston Hall]], and a large contingent of local clergy.<ref name=\"YH 12 Apr 1889\" /><ref>Note: Dent Dent is the correct name</ref> The stated subject of the meeting was the reorganisation of the Ripon Diocesan Societies, but the content was a move by the Bishop of Ripon for funds to support pensions for retired clergy, nine-tenths of whom did not have independent means. The meeting enthusiastically supported this motion. Sadly, Forster was not to live long enough to benefit from this improvement of the clerical lot.<ref name=\"YH 12 Apr 1889\" >''York Herald'', 12 April 1889: Ripon Diocesan Societies</ref> He supported the Church Institute which in turn supported the clergy, and he attended the annual bazaar, a three-day occasion in aid of its building fund.<ref>''[[Leeds Mercury]]'', 24 July 1889: Local and general</ref><ref>[http://www.harrogatepeopleandplaces.info/publications/thorpes1891/harrogateindetail.htm Harrogate people and places: Harrogate in detail - church institute].

His funeral and interment took place on 1 September. In Beckwithshaw, \"in all absence of gloom\" the church was crowded at the funeral service, while in the village blinds were drawn and \"signs of marked sorrow were visible on every hand.\"<ref name=\"CT1651\" /><ref name=\"HC 8 Sep 1894\" /> While the body was laid in the [[chancel]], the congregation laid [[Wreath#Funeral and memorial wreaths|wreaths]] of flowers along the [[Altar rails|altar rail]]. [[Charles Wesley]]'s hymn ''Blessing, honour, thanks and praise'' was sung, and Mark Rowntree read the lesson before the choir sang the [[canticle]] ''[[Nunc Dimittis]]''. At the graveside service were [[Physician|medical officers]] from the local hospitals, an [[alderman]], a [[councillor]], numerous curates and vicars including Frank Shaw of St Andrew's, Huddersfield, D. M. Thomas, the curate of Beckwithshaw, and Mark Rowntree, vicar of [[St Robert's Church, Pannal|Pannal]]. Mr and Mrs Henry Williams, patrons of the living of Beckwithshaw, were there too.<ref name=\"HC 8 Sep 1894\" />\n\nThe funeral ''cort\u00e8ge'' travelled on foot more than a mile to the cemetery. The clergy and choir were robed; the choirboys carrying all the flowers: a \"picturesque appearance of reverential sorrow.\" At the cemetery, the grave was lined with ivy and flowers, and W. Binner conducted the service in \"a most impressive manner.\" Numerous relatives of Charles and his wife were present, although newspaper reports do not say that Mary herself was there. The choir sang ''[[For All the Saints]]''. The polished oak coffin had heavy brass mountings and a brass cross on the lid. According to the ''Huddersfield Chronicle'' of 1894, the cross and its pedestal were inscribed, \"Charles Farrar Forster, priest, born 29th February 1848; passed to rest 28th August 1894.\"<ref name=\"HC 8 Sep 1894\" >''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 8 September 1894</ref> However the existing inscription as of 2014 is as follows:<blockquote>\"In memory of Charles Farrar Forster, priest. First vicar of the adjoining parish of Beckwithshaw 1887 to 1894. Passed to rest on the 28th day of August 1894 aged 46. ''My presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest''. This cross was erected by the members of his congregation.\"<ref>The quotation is from Exodus 33:14</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the evening of Sunday 9 September 1894 a memorial service was held for Forster at St Andrew's Church, Huddersfield. There was a large congregation. The organist, H. J. Wood, ARCO, played the voluntary ''Cantilene Pastorale'' by [[Alexandre Guilmant|Guilmant]]. There were psalms and hymns, and lessons were read by the vicar, W. F. Shaw. The choir sang an anthem which was followed by a sermon from the vicar. The congregation stood while the organist played the [[Saul (Handel)#The \"Dead March\"|''Dead March'' from ''Saul'']]. The closing voluntary was Guilmant's ''Funeral March''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> At Beckwithshaw he was remembered thus: <blockquote><nowiki>[At Beckwithshaw]</nowiki> he preferred to labour on and to die in harness . . . He was troubled with a dangerous disease which at times caused him agonies of excruciating pain. Yet through it all he was calm, patient, collected.<sup>''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 18 September 1894</sup><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/></blockquote>\n\n''The Church Times'' said:<blockquote>Appointed first vicar of the new parish of Beckwithshaw in 1887, he set himself to build up, slowly but surely, the life of his people . . . and while he taught the fulness of the truth, and symbolised it in simple yet reverent form, he failed not by the bright example of his own life - so consistent, so nobly patient under the severest trials - to give a forcible illustration of the yielded will and godly endeavour of a Christian man.<sup>''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 18 September 1894</sup><ref name=\"CT1651\">{{Church Times\n| title = In Memoriam\n| archive = ChTm_1894_09_14_968\n| issue = 1651\n| date = 14 September 1894\n| page = 968\n| accessed = 7 June 2014\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn July 2005, over a hundred years after Forster's death, his great-nephew visited Beckwithshaw Church, showing that he is still remembered by his family.<ref>Information from Beckwithshaw Church</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat inline|St Andrew's Church, Huddersfield}}<br>\t\n{{Commonscat inline|St Michael and All Angels Church, Beckwithshaw}}\n{{Commons category|Charles Farrar Forster}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Forster, Charles Farrar}}\n[[Category:1848 births]]\n[[Category:1894 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century English Anglican priests]]\n[[Category:People from Knaresborough]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society]]\n[[Category:Alumni of St Bees Theological College]]\n", "name_user": "Infogapp1", "label": "safe", "comment": "Space", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Farrar_Forster"}

After some solo releases including 1958's \"That Crazy Feeling\", Rogers then joined a group with the  [[jazz]] singer [[Bobby Doyle (jazz vocalist)|Bobby Doyle]]. In 1966 he became a member of the [[folk music|folk]] ensemble [[the New Christy Minstrels]], playing [[double bass]] and [[bass guitar]] as well as singing.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> In 1967, he and several members of the New Christy Minstrels left to found the group [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition|the First Edition]], with whom he scored his first major hit, \"[[Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)]]\", a [[psychedelic rock]] song which peaked at number five on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. As Rogers took an increased leadership role in the First Edition, and following the success of 1969's \"[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town]]\", the band gradually changed styles to a more [[country music|country]] feel. The band broke up in 1975\u20131976, and Rogers embarked on a long and successful solo career, which included several successful collaborations, including duets with singers [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Sheena Easton]], and a songwriting partnership with [[Lionel Richie]].

Together the duo won two gold records (one of which later went platinum), two CMA Awards, an ACM nomination, two Grammy nominations and 1 Music City News Award for their two hit albums ''Every Time Two Fools Collide'' (No.&nbsp;1) and ''Classics'' (No.&nbsp;3), selling out stadiums and arenas while on tour for several years, as well as appearing on several network television specials which showcased them.

Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: \"She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion that you actually believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions.\" In a 1978 press release for their album \"Every Time Two Fools Collide\", Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences. Rogers was with West only hours before she died at age 58 after sustaining injuries in a 1991 car accident, as discussed in his 2012 biography \"Luck Or Something Like It\". In 1995 he starred as himself, alongside Michele Lee as West, in the [[CBS]] biographical film ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]''.\n\nIn 1980, a selection he recorded as a duet with [[Kim Carnes]], \"[[Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer]]\", became a major hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/2017-01-26/kenny-rogers-final-tour-retiring-includes-concert-thrasher-horne-saturday |title=Kenny Rogers' final tour before retiring includes concert at Thrasher-Horne on Saturday |author=Crumpler, David |date=January 26, 2017 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]}}</ref> Earlier that year, he sang a duet of \"You and Me\" with [[Lynda Carter]] in her television music special ''Lynda Carter Special'' (Rogers originally recorded this with Dottie West for the [[Every Time Two Fools Collide]] album).  Later in 1980 came his partnership with [[Lionel Richie]] who wrote and produced Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> Richie went on to produce Rogers' 1981 album ''Share Your Love,'' a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as \"[[I Don't Need You]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;3), \"[[Through the Years (Kenny Rogers song)|Through the Years]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;13), and \"[[Share Your Love with Me]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. In 1982, Rogers released the album ''[[Love Will Turn You Around]].'' The album's [[Love Will Turn You Around (song)|the title track]] reached No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped the country and AC charts. It was the theme song of Rogers' 1982 film ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]''. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer [[David Foster]] in 1983, recording the smash Top 10 hit [[Bob Seger]] [[cover version|cover]] \"[[We've Got Tonight]]\", a duet with [[Sheena Easton]]. Also a number 1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nIn 1981, Rogers bought the old ABC Dunhill building and built one of the most popular and state-of-the-art recording studios in Los Angeles.

Gibb insisted on doing the entire album together.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\n\"Islands in the Stream\", Rogers' duet with Dolly Parton, was the first single to be released from ''Eyes That See in the Dark'' in the United States, and it quickly went to No.&nbsp;1 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (it would prove to be the last country single to reach No.&nbsp;1 on that chart until \"[[Amazed]]\" by [[Lonestar]] did so in 2000), as well as topping ''Billboard''{{'}}s country and adult contemporary singles charts;  it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping two million copies in the United States. Rogers would reunite with Parton in 1984 for a holiday album, [[Once Upon a Christmas (Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton album)|''Once Upon a Christmas'']] and TV special ''Kenny & Dolly: A Christmas to Remember'' (which resulted in a popular video of \"Christmas Without You\"), as well as a 1985 duet \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\", which also topped the U.S. country singles chart. The two would continue to collaborate on occasional projects through subsequent years, including a 2013 duet single \"[[You Can't Make Old Friends]]\".<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nDespite the success of \"Islands in the Stream\", however, [[RCA Records]] insisted on releasing ''Eyes''{{'}} title track as the first UK single, and the song stalled at a disappointing No.&nbsp;61 there, although it did stay in the top 100 for several weeks. (When it was eventually released in the United States, it was more successful, charting high on the Adult Contemporary chart and making the country top 30.) \"Islands in the Stream\" was issued as a follow-up single in Britain and sold well, making No.&nbsp;7. The album itself reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts on both sides of the Atlantic and enjoyed multi-million sales. \"Buried Treasure\", \"This Woman\" and \"Evening Star\"/\"Midsummer Nights\" were also all successful singles from the album.\n\nShortly after came the album ''[[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers album)|What About Me?]]'', a hit whose [[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers song)|title track]]\u2014a trio performance with [[James Ingram]] and [[Kim Carnes]]\u2014was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]; the single \"Crazy\" (not to be confused with the [[Willie Nelson]]-penned [[Patsy Cline]] hit) topped the country charts. David Foster was to work again with Rogers in his 1985 album ''The Heart of the Matter,'' although this time Foster was playing backing music rather than producing, a role given to [[George Martin]]. This album was another success, going to No.&nbsp;1, with the title track making to the top ten category in the singles charts.\n\nThe next few years saw Rogers scoring several top country hits on a regular basis, including \"Twenty Years Ago\", \"Morning Desire\", \"Tomb of the Unknown Love\", among others.  On January 28, 1985, Rogers was one of the 45 artists who recorded the worldwide charity song \"[[We Are the World]]\" to support hunger victims in Africa. The following year he played at Giants Stadium.<ref name=\"Front Row King\">{{cite web|title=Kenny Rogers Concert Tickets |publisher=[[Front Row King]]|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/buy-kenny-rogers-concert-tickets/index.html|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Rogers won a Grammy Award for \"Best Country Collaboration with Vocals\" with [[Ronnie Milsap]]\u2014\"Make No Mistake, She's Mine\". In the 1990s, Rogers continued to chart with singles such as \"The Factory\" and \"Crazy In Love\", another selection that Kim Carnes provided him with, \"If You Want To Find Love\", and \"The Greatest\". His second Christmas album, titled ''Christmas in America,'' was released in 1989 for Reprise Records. From 1991\u201394, Rogers hosted ''[[The Real West]]'' on [[A&E Network|A&E]], and on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] since 1995 (Reruns only on The History Channel). He visited Miller's during this time period. From 1992\u201395, Rogers co-owned and headlined [[Branson, Missouri]]'s 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre. In 1994, Rogers released his \"dream\" album titled ''Timepiece'' on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 1930s/1940s jazz standards, the type of music he had performed in his early days with the Bobby Doyle Three in [[Houston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/arts-and-entertainment/20161201/kenny-rogers-plans-to-fold-em-after-final-concert-tour |title=Kenny Rogers plans to fold 'em after final concert tour |author=Graff, Gary |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[Oakland Press]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Rogers released an album ''Vote For Love'' where the public requested their favorite love songs and Rogers performed the songs.

The album, sold exclusively by [[QVC]], was a huge success and was later issued in stores under a variety of different titles. It reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK country charts under the title ''Love Songs'' (a title also used for various compilations) and also crossed over into the mainstream charts.\n\nIn 1999, Rogers scored with the single \"The Greatest\", a song about life from a child's point of view (looked at through a baseball game)<ref name=RugbyIndependent2007 /> The song reached the top 40 of ''Billboard's'' Country singles chart and was a [[Country Music Television]] Number One video. It was on Rogers' album ''She Rides Wild Horses'' the following year (itself a top 10 success).<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> In 1999, Rogers also produced a song, \"We've Got It All\", specifically for the series finale of the ABC show ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]].'' Not found on any album, the recording sells for a high sum at auction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===2000\u20132015===\n[[File:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|thumb|right|Rogers in 2004]]\nIn the 21st century (and at age 61), Rogers was back at No.&nbsp;1 for the first time in more than a decade with the 2000 single \"[[Buy Me a Rose]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> In doing so, he broke a 26-year-old record held by [[Hank Snow]] (who, in April 1974, was aged 59 when he scored with \"Hello Love\"). Rogers held the record until 2003, when then 70-year-old [[Willie Nelson]] became the oldest artist to have a No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts with his duet with [[Toby Keith]], \"[[Beer for My Horses]]\".\n\nAlthough Rogers did not record new albums for a couple of years, he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages.  In 2004 ''[[42 Ultimate Hits]]'', which was the first hits collection to span his days with the First Edition to the present, reached Number 6 on the American country charts and went gold.  It also featured two new songs, \"My World Is Over\" with [[Whitney Duncan]] and \"We Are the Same\".  \"My World Is Over\" was released as a single and was a minor hit. In 2005 ''The Very Best of Kenny Rogers'', a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Rogers hits album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.\n\nRogers also signed with [[Capitol Records]] and had more success with the TV advertised release ''21 Number Ones'' in January 2006. Although this CD did contain 21 chart-toppers as the title claims (recorded between 1976 and the present day), this was not a complete collection of Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 singles, omitting such singles as \"Crazy in Love\" and \"What About Me?\"\n\nCapitol followed ''21 Number Ones'' with Rogers' new studio album, ''[[Water & Bridges]]'', in March 2006 on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol Nashville Records]] label. The first single from the album was \"[[I Can't Unlove You]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;17 on the country charts, after spending over 6 months on the hit list, more than 50 years after he formed his first group and 38 years after his first major hit as leader of the First Edition; the song remains in recurrent airplay on some radio stations today. \"I Can't Unlove You\" was followed up with the second single from the album, \"The Last Ten Years (Superman)\", in September 2006. The third single, \"Calling Me\", which features [[Don Henley]], became popular in early 2007, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. Also in 2007, the 1977 ''Kenny Rogers'' album was re-issued as a double CD, also featuring the 1979 ''Kenny'' album and this once again put Rogers' name into the sales charts worldwide. The following year, another compilation album (''A Love Song Collection'') also charted.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nOn August 26, 2008, Rogers released ''50 Years''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/kenny-rogers-celebrates-new-project-of-old-classics/336423|title=Kenny Rogers Q&A\u2014Celebrates New Project with Old Classics|publisher=AOL Music Canada|date=March 24, 2009|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> exclusively at Cracker Barrel stores.

The group recorded for [[Columbia Records]]. They disbanded in 1965, and a 1966 jazzy rock single Rogers recorded for [[Mercury Records]], called \"[[Here's That Rainy Day]]\", failed. Rogers also worked as a producer, writer and session musician for other performers, including country artists [[Mickey Gilley]] and [[Eddy Arnold]].

Together the duo won two gold records (one of which later went platinum), two CMA Awards, an ACM nomination, two Grammy nominations and 1 Music City News Award for their two hit albums ''Every Time Two Fools Collide'' (No.&nbsp;1) and ''Classics'' (No.&nbsp;3), selling out stadiums and arenas while on tour for several years, as well as appearing on several network television specials which showcased them.

Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: \"She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion that you actually believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions.\" In a 1978 press release for their album \"Every Time Two Fools Collide\", Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences. Rogers was with West only hours before she died at age 58 after sustaining injuries in a 1991 car accident, as discussed in his 2012 biography \"Luck Or Something Like It\". In 1995 he starred as himself, alongside Michele Lee as West, in the [[CBS]] biographical film ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]''.\n\nIn 1980, a selection he recorded as a duet with [[Kim Carnes]], \"[[Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer]]\", became a major hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/2017-01-26/kenny-rogers-final-tour-retiring-includes-concert-thrasher-horne-saturday |title=Kenny Rogers' final tour before retiring includes concert at Thrasher-Horne on Saturday |author=Crumpler, David |date=January 26, 2017 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]}}</ref> Earlier that year, he sang a duet of \"You and Me\" with [[Lynda Carter]] in her television music special ''Lynda Carter Special'' (Rogers originally recorded this with Dottie West for the [[Every Time Two Fools Collide]] album).  Later in 1980 came his partnership with [[Lionel Richie]] who wrote and produced Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> Richie went on to produce Rogers' 1981 album ''Share Your Love,'' a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as \"[[I Don't Need You]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;3), \"[[Through the Years (Kenny Rogers song)|Through the Years]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;13), and \"[[Share Your Love with Me]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. In 1982, Rogers released the album ''[[Love Will Turn You Around]].'' The album's [[Love Will Turn You Around (song)|the title track]] reached No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped the country and AC charts. It was the theme song of Rogers' 1982 film ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]''. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer [[David Foster]] in 1983, recording the smash Top 10 hit [[Bob Seger]] [[cover version|cover]] \"[[We've Got Tonight]]\", a duet with [[Sheena Easton]]. Also a number 1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nIn 1981, Rogers bought the old ABC Dunhill building and built one of the most popular and state-of-the-art recording studios in Los Angeles. The song \"[[We Are the World]]\" was recorded there and at [[Jim Henson Company Lot|A & M Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FyUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=kenny+rogers+lion+share+recording+studio#v=onepage|title=Rogers Buys Studio|last=McCullaugh|first=Jim|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 6, 1982|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nRogers went on to work with [[Barry Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] who produced his 1983 hit album ''[[Eyes That See in the Dark]]'', featuring the title track and yet another No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\", a duet with [[Dolly Parton]].

Gibb insisted on doing the entire album together.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\n\"Islands in the Stream\", Rogers' duet with Dolly Parton, was the first single to be released from ''Eyes That See in the Dark'' in the United States, and it quickly went to No.&nbsp;1 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (it would prove to be the last country single to reach No.&nbsp;1 on that chart until \"[[Amazed]]\" by [[Lonestar]] did so in 2000), as well as topping ''Billboard''{{'}}s country and adult contemporary singles charts;  it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping two million copies in the United States. Rogers would reunite with Parton in 1984 for a holiday album, [[Once Upon a Christmas (Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton album)|''Once Upon a Christmas'']] and TV special ''Kenny & Dolly: A Christmas to Remember'' (which resulted in a popular video of \"Christmas Without You\"), as well as a 1985 duet \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\", which also topped the U.S. country singles chart. The two would continue to collaborate on occasional projects through subsequent years, including a 2013 duet single \"[[You Can't Make Old Friends]]\".<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nDespite the success of \"Islands in the Stream\", however, [[RCA Records]] insisted on releasing ''Eyes''{{'}} title track as the first UK single, and the song stalled at a disappointing No.&nbsp;61 there, although it did stay in the top 100 for several weeks. (When it was eventually released in the United States, it was more successful, charting high on the Adult Contemporary chart and making the country top 30.) \"Islands in the Stream\" was issued as a follow-up single in Britain and sold well, making No.&nbsp;7. The album itself reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts on both sides of the Atlantic and enjoyed multi-million sales. \"Buried Treasure\", \"This Woman\" and \"Evening Star\"/\"Midsummer Nights\" were also all successful singles from the album.\n\nShortly after came the album ''[[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers album)|What About Me?]]'', a hit whose [[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers song)|title track]]\u2014a trio performance with [[James Ingram]] and [[Kim Carnes]]\u2014was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]; the single \"Crazy\" (not to be confused with the [[Willie Nelson]]-penned [[Patsy Cline]] hit) topped the country charts. David Foster was to work again with Rogers in his 1985 album ''The Heart of the Matter,'' although this time Foster was playing backing music rather than producing, a role given to [[George Martin]]. This album was another success, going to No.&nbsp;1, with the title track making to the top ten category in the singles charts.\n\nThe next few years saw Rogers scoring several top country hits on a regular basis, including \"Twenty Years Ago\", \"Morning Desire\", \"Tomb of the Unknown Love\", among others.  On January 28, 1985, Rogers was one of the 45 artists who recorded the worldwide charity song \"[[We Are the World]]\" to support hunger victims in Africa. The following year he played at Giants Stadium.<ref name=\"Front Row King\">{{cite web|title=Kenny Rogers Concert Tickets |publisher=[[Front Row King]]|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/buy-kenny-rogers-concert-tickets/index.html|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Rogers won a Grammy Award for \"Best Country Collaboration with Vocals\" with [[Ronnie Milsap]]\u2014\"Make No Mistake, She's Mine\". In the 1990s, Rogers continued to chart with singles such as \"The Factory\" and \"Crazy In Love\", another selection that Kim Carnes provided him with, \"If You Want To Find Love\", and \"The Greatest\". His second Christmas album, titled ''Christmas in America,'' was released in 1989 for Reprise Records. From 1991\u201394, Rogers hosted ''[[The Real West]]'' on [[A&E Network|A&E]], and on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] since 1995 (Reruns only on The History Channel). He visited Miller's during this time period. From 1992\u201395, Rogers co-owned and headlined [[Branson, Missouri]]'s 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre. In 1994, Rogers released his \"dream\" album titled ''Timepiece'' on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 1930s/1940s jazz standards, the type of music he had performed in his early days with the Bobby Doyle Three in [[Houston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/arts-and-entertainment/20161201/kenny-rogers-plans-to-fold-em-after-final-concert-tour |title=Kenny Rogers plans to fold 'em after final concert tour |author=Graff, Gary |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[Oakland Press]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Rogers released an album ''Vote For Love'' where the public requested their favorite love songs and Rogers performed the songs. (Several of his own hits were in the final version.) The album was the first for the TV shopping channel QVC's record label, onQ Music. The album, sold exclusively by [[QVC]], was a huge success and was later issued in stores under a variety of different titles. It reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK country charts under the title ''Love Songs'' (a title also used for various compilations) and also crossed over into the mainstream charts.\n\nIn 1999, Rogers scored with the single \"The Greatest\", a song about life from a child's point of view (looked at through a baseball game)<ref name=RugbyIndependent2007 /> The song reached the top 40 of ''Billboard's'' Country singles chart and was a [[Country Music Television]] Number One video. It was on Rogers' album ''She Rides Wild Horses'' the following year (itself a top 10 success).<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> In 1999, Rogers also produced a song, \"We've Got It All\", specifically for the series finale of the ABC show ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]].'' Not found on any album, the recording sells for a high sum at auction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===2000\u20132015===\n[[File:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|thumb|right|Rogers in 2004]]\nIn the 21st century (and at age 61), Rogers was back at No.&nbsp;1 for the first time in more than a decade with the 2000 single \"[[Buy Me a Rose]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> In doing so, he broke a 26-year-old record held by [[Hank Snow]] (who, in April 1974, was aged 59 when he scored with \"Hello Love\"). Rogers held the record until 2003, when then 70-year-old [[Willie Nelson]] became the oldest artist to have a No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts with his duet with [[Toby Keith]], \"[[Beer for My Horses]]\".\n\nAlthough Rogers did not record new albums for a couple of years, he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages.  In 2004 ''[[42 Ultimate Hits]]'', which was the first hits collection to span his days with the First Edition to the present, reached Number 6 on the American country charts and went gold.  It also featured two new songs, \"My World Is Over\" with [[Whitney Duncan]] and \"We Are the Same\".  \"My World Is Over\" was released as a single and was a minor hit. In 2005 ''The Very Best of Kenny Rogers'', a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Rogers hits album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.\n\nRogers also signed with [[Capitol Records]] and had more success with the TV advertised release ''21 Number Ones'' in January 2006. Although this CD did contain 21 chart-toppers as the title claims (recorded between 1976 and the present day), this was not a complete collection of Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 singles, omitting such singles as \"Crazy in Love\" and \"What About Me?\"\n\nCapitol followed ''21 Number Ones'' with Rogers' new studio album, ''[[Water & Bridges]]'', in March 2006 on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol Nashville Records]] label. The first single from the album was \"[[I Can't Unlove You]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;17 on the country charts, after spending over 6 months on the hit list, more than 50 years after he formed his first group and 38 years after his first major hit as leader of the First Edition; the song remains in recurrent airplay on some radio stations today. \"I Can't Unlove You\" was followed up with the second single from the album, \"The Last Ten Years (Superman)\", in September 2006. The third single, \"Calling Me\", which features [[Don Henley]], became popular in early 2007, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. Also in 2007, the 1977 ''Kenny Rogers'' album was re-issued as a double CD, also featuring the 1979 ''Kenny'' album and this once again put Rogers' name into the sales charts worldwide. The following year, another compilation album (''A Love Song Collection'') also charted.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nOn August 26, 2008, Rogers released ''50 Years''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/kenny-rogers-celebrates-new-project-of-old-classics/336423|title=Kenny Rogers Q&A\u2014Celebrates New Project with Old Classics|publisher=AOL Music Canada|date=March 24, 2009|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> exclusively at Cracker Barrel stores.
