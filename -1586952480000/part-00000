It has been operational since 1982. When needed, it is closed (raised) during high tide; at low tide it can be opened to restore the river's flow towards the sea. Built approximately {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on|}} due east of the [[Isle of Dogs]], its northern bank is in [[Silvertown]] in the [[London Borough of Newham]] and its southern bank is in the [[New Charlton]] area of the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nFlooding in London has been a problem since the city was first established in Roman times.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Kendrick|first=Mary|date=1988|title=The Thames Barrier|url=|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=16|pages=57-68|via=ScienceDirect}}</ref>\u00a0In 1954 the Waverley Committee, established to investigate the serious [[North Sea flood of 1953]] which affected parts of the Thames Estuary and parts of London, recommended that \"''as an alternative to raising the banks, the possibility and cost of erecting a structure across the Thames which could be closed in a surge should be urgently investigated''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1954/jun/03/coastal-flooding-committees-report|title=Coastal Flooding (Committee's Report) (Hansard, 3 June 1954)|website=api.parliament.uk|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> A large number of designs were put forward, ranging from a huge road viaduct with two 500 foot (150 m) sluice gates crossing the Thames at Crayfordness to flap gates lying on the river bed and floated up by compressed air.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Gilbert, Stuart (Stuart K.)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11594001|title=The Thames barrier|date=1984|publisher=T.

He considered the estimated construction costs and the probability of a flood and of damage if the barrier was not built.\u00a0He strongly recommended that a barrier should be built in order to avoid the catastrophe of flooding central London, and a site was agreed at Woolwich.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe barrier protects central London against a storm surge, caused when a deep depression forms to the north of Scotland and progresses across the North Sea and south-easterly towards southern Scandinavia. When such a surge coincides with a high [[spring tide]], the high winds associated with the depression can funnel the water up the Thames Estuary and cause surges of up to 3.5 metres. The planners assessed that in the absence of a barrier, such a surge could inundate 45 square miles (117 km<sup>2</sup>) of land, put hospitals, powers stations and the London Underground out of action and cause damage estimated in 1966 at \u00a32.0 billion<ref>The Thames Barrier:  The Background and Basic Engineering Requirements.  D Ayres Director of Public Health Engineering, GLC.  1983. Paper presented to a meeting of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 8th June 1983</ref> (about \u00a350 billion at 2020 prices). The barrier was designed to provide a flood defence capable of resisting a once in 1000 year surge tide at a base date of 2030.\n\n=== Design and construction ===\n[[File:Thames Barrier - simple operation diagram.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Diagram showing how the gates work, though the barrier actually rises further than this to allow water to \"underspill\" under the barrier in a controlled fashion]]\n\nThe concept of the rising sector gates was devised by (Reginald) Charles Draper. In 1969, from his parents' house in Pellatt Grove, [[Wood Green]], London, he constructed a working model. The novel rotating cylinders were based on the design of the taps on his gas cooker. The barrier was designed by Rendel, Palmer and Tritton for the [[Greater London Council]] and the concept tested at the [[Hydraulics Research Station]], Wallingford<ref name=\":1\" />. The site at New Charlton was chosen because of the relative straightness of the banks, and because the underlying river chalk was strong enough to support the barrier. \n\nThe Thames Barrier and Flood Prevention Act, authorising construction, was passed in 1972.  In 1974 the GLC placed the two major construction contracts. Civil construction was undertaken by a [[Costain Group|Costain]]/[[Royal BAM Group|Hollandsche Beton Maatschappij]]/[[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Construction]] consortium.   Work began at the barrier site in 1974 and progressed in two phases. The southern piers (9 to 6) were built first, with river traffic diverted to the north side, then traffic routed through the completed southern spans whilst the north side piers (1 to 5) were built. During construction of the piers, precast concrete sills were built in a cofferdam on the north side of the river and floated out and sunk between the piers to form the gate recesses, with access tunnels in the upstream and downstream ends.,<ref>[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/regions/thames/323150/335688/341764/341785/?version=1&lang=_e Environment Agency] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917221210/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/regions/thames/323150/335688/341764/341785/?version=1&lang=_e |date=17 September 2008 }}</ref> .

He considered the estimated construction costs and the probability of a flood and of damage if the barrier was not built.\u00a0He strongly recommended that a barrier should be built in order to avoid the catastrophe of flooding central London, and a site was agreed at Woolwich.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe barrier protects central London against a storm surge, caused when a deep depression forms to the north of Scotland and progresses across the North Sea and south-easterly towards southern Scandinavia. When such a surge coincides with a high [[spring tide]], the high winds associated with the depression can funnel the water up the Thames Estuary and cause surges of up to 3.5 metres. The planners assessed that in the absence of a barrier, such a surge could inundate 45 square miles (117 km<sup>2</sup>) of land, put hospitals, powers stations and the London Underground out of action and cause damage estimated in 1966 at \u00a32.0 billion:<ref>The Thames Barrier:  The Background and Basic Engineering Requirements.  D Ayres Director of Public Health Engineering, GLC.  1983. Paper presented to a meeting of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 8th June 1983</ref> (about \u00a350 billion at 2020 prices). The barrier was designed to provide a flood defence capable of resisting a once in 1000 year surge tide at a base date of 2030.\n\n=== Design and construction ===\n[[File:Thames Barrier - simple operation diagram.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Diagram showing how the gates work, though the barrier actually rises further than this to allow water to \"underspill\" under the barrier in a controlled fashion]]\n\nThe concept of the rising sector gates was devised by (Reginald) Charles Draper. In 1969, from his parents' house in Pellatt Grove, [[Wood Green]], London, he constructed a working model. The novel rotating cylinders were based on the design of the taps on his gas cooker. The barrier was designed by Rendel, Palmer and Tritton for the [[Greater London Council]] and the concept tested at the [[Hydraulics Research Station]], Wallingford<ref name=\":1\" />. The site at New Charlton was chosen because of the relative straightness of the banks, and because the underlying river chalk was strong enough to support the barrier. \n\nThe Thames Barrier and Flood Prevention Act, authorising construction, was passed in 1972.  In 1974 the GLC placed the two major construction contracts. Civil construction was undertaken by a [[Costain Group|Costain]]/[[Royal BAM Group|Hollandsche Beton Maatschappij]]/[[Tarmac Group|Tarmac Construction]] consortium.   Work began at the barrier site in 1974 and progressed in two phases. The southern piers (9 to 6) were built first, with river traffic diverted to the north side, then traffic routed through the completed southern spans whilst the north side piers (1 to 5) were built. During construction of the piers, precast concrete sills were built in a cofferdam on the north side of the river and floated out and sunk between the piers to form the gate recesses, with access tunnels in the upstream and downstream ends.,<ref>[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/regions/thames/323150/335688/341764/341785/?version=1&lang=_e Environment Agency] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917221210/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/regions/thames/323150/335688/341764/341785/?version=1&lang=_e |date=17 September 2008 }}</ref> .

The book's sequel, ''The Lost World'', was also adapted by Spielberg into a [[The Lost World: Jurassic Park|film]] in 1997. A [[Jurassic Park III|third film]], directed by [[Joe Johnston]] and released in 2001, drew several elements, themes, and scenes from both books that were ultimately not utilized in either of the previous films, such as the aviary and boat scenes.\n\nThe novel began as a [[screenplay]] Crichton wrote in 1983, about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur.<ref>{{Cite AV media | people = Crichton, Michael | title = Michael Crichton on the Jurassic Park Phenomenon | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal | date = 2001}}</ref> Eventually, given his reasoning that genetic research is expensive and \"there is no pressing need to create a dinosaur\", Crichton concluded that it would emerge from a \"desire to entertain\", leading to a [[Wildlife refuge|wildlife park]] of extinct animals.<ref>\"Return to Jurassic Park: Dawn of a New Era\", ''Jurassic Park'' Blu-ray (2011)</ref> Originally, the story was told from the point of view of a child, but Crichton changed it as everyone who read the draft felt it would be better if told by an adult.<ref>[http://www.michaelcrichton.net/books-jurassicpark-mcnotes.html Michael Crichton's notes on Jurassic Park]</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn 1989, a series of strange animal attacks occur in [[Costa Rica]] and on the nearby fictional island of [[Isla Nublar]],<ref>Means approximately \"Clouded Island\" or \"Obscured Island\" in Spanish.</ref> the story's main setting, one of which is a worker severely injured on a construction project on Isla Nublar, whose employers refuse to disclose any information about. One of the species is eventually identified as a ''[[Procompsognathus]]''. [[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Alan Grant|Alan Grant]] and his [[Paleobotany|paleobotanist]] graduate student, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Ellen Sattler|Ellie Sattler]], are contacted to confirm the identification, but are abruptly whisked away by billionaire [[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Hammond|John Hammond]]&nbsp;\u2014 founder and chief executive officer of International Genetic Technologies, or InGen&nbsp;\u2014 for a weekend visit to a \"biological preserve\" he has established on Isla Nublar.\n\nUpon arrival, the preserve is revealed to be Jurassic Park, a [[Amusement park|theme park]] showcasing [[Cloning#Artificial cloning of organisms|cloned]] dinosaurs. The animals have been recreated using [[Ancient DNA|damaged dinosaur DNA]] found in blood inside of gnats, ticks, and mosquitoes fossilized and preserved in [[amber]]. Gaps in the genetic code have been filled in with \"compatible\" [[Reptile|reptilian]], [[Bird|avian]] or [[amphibian]] [[DNA]]. To control the population, all specimens on the island are [[lysine]]-[[Auxotrophy|deficient]] and X-Ray sterilized females. Hammond proudly touts InGen's advances in [[genetic engineering]] and shows his guests through the island's vast array of automated systems.\n\n[[File:Curva del drag\u00f3n.png|thumb|left|Ian Malcolm created [[dragon curve]]s to simulate the actions that were to take place in the park.]]\n\nRecent incidents in the park have spooked Hammond's investors. To placate them, Hammond uses Grant and Sattler as fresh consultants. They stand in counterbalance to a famous mathematician and [[Chaos theory|chaos theorist]], [[Ian Malcolm (character)|Ian Malcolm]], and a lawyer representing the investors, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Donald Gennaro|Donald Gennaro]], who are pessimistic about the park's prospects. Malcolm, having been consulted before the park's creation, is especially emphatic in his prediction that the park will collapse, as it is an unsustainable simple structure bluntly forced upon a [[complex system]] with too many unpredictable variables, such as an uncontrollable population, attempting to contain animals with no real equivalent to extant animals with no predictable behavior patterns, and an untested computer system that continually fails to monitor and feed the population.\n\nCountering Malcolm's dire predictions with youthful energy, Hammond groups the consultants with his grandchildren, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Timothy Murphy|Tim]] and [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Alexis Murphy|Alexis \"Lex\" Murphy]]. While touring the park, Grant finds a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' eggshell, seemingly proving Malcolm's earlier assertion that the dinosaurs have somehow been breeding against the geneticists' design.\n\nMeanwhile, the disgruntled chief programmer of Jurassic Park's controlling software, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dennis Nedry|Dennis Nedry]], attempts [[Industrial espionage|corporate espionage]] for [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Lewis Dodgson|Lewis Dodgson]], a geneticist and agent of InGen's archrival, Biosyn. By activating a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] he wrote into the park's computer system, Nedry shuts down its security systems and steals frozen embryos for each of the park's fifteen species in an attempt to smuggle them to a contact waiting at an auxiliary dock at the eastern end of the park. However, during a sudden [[Tropical cyclone#Tropical storm|tropical storm]], he exits his vehicle to get his bearings and is killed by a ''[[Dilophosaurus]]''. Without Nedry to reactivate the park's security, the electrified fences remain off and all the dinosaurs escape. The park's adult ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' attacks the guests on tour, with a juvenile ''T. rex'' attacking and killing Ed Regis, the park's public relations manager. In the aftermath, Grant and the children become lost in the park. Malcolm is gravely injured during the incident, but is found by Gennaro and park game warden [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Robert Muldoon|Robert Muldoon]], spending the remainder of the novel slowly dying as {{ndash}} between lucid lectures and morphine-induced rants {{ndash}} he tries to help the others understand their predicament and survive.\n\nThe park's upper management&nbsp;\u2014 engineer and park supervisor [[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Raymond Arnold|John Arnold]], [[biotechnology|biotechnologist]] [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Henry Wu|Henry Wu]], Muldoon, and Hammond&nbsp;\u2014 struggle to return power to the park, while the veterinarian, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Harding|Dr. Harding]], takes care of Malcolm. They manage to temporarily get the park largely back in order, restoring the computer system by shutting down and restarting the power and resetting the system. When trying to restore the park to working order, they fail to notice that the system has been running on auxiliary power since the restart; this power soon runs out, shutting the park down a second time. The park's intelligent and aggressive raptors escape their enclosure, and kill Wu and Arnold. Meanwhile, Grant and the children slowly make their way back to the Visitor Center by rafting down the jungle river, carrying news that several young raptors were on board the island's supply ship when it departed for the mainland. After the three return to the visitor's center, they are contacted by the others, who instruct Grant to switch on the park's generators. Tim is then able to reactivate the park's main power, allowing Gennaro to force the supply ship to return.\n\nGennaro orders that the island be destroyed, but Grant rejects his authority, claiming that they must first inspect the whole situation. Grant, Sattler, Muldoon, and Gennaro set out into the park to find the wild raptor nests and compare hatched eggs with the island's revised population tally, and return unscathed. Meanwhile, Hammond, taking a walk and contemplating building a new park improving on his previous mistakes, hears a ''T. rex'' roar and, startled, falls down a hill, where he is eaten by a pack of ''Procompsognathus''.\n\nWith regard to the dinosaurs' breeding, it eventually transpires that using frog DNA to fill gaps in the dinosaurs' genetic code enabled a measure of [[Sequential hermaphroditism|dichogamy]], in which some of the female animals changed into males in response to the same-sex environment. The computer tally failed to include newborn animals, having been programmed to stop counting once the assumed correct total number of animals had been found.\n\nThe survivors are rescued by the fictitious Costa Rican Air Force, where Grant reveals that the dinosaurs have been killing people. The Costa Rican Air Force then declare the island hazardous and unsafe, and proceed to raze the island with [[napalm]]. Survivors of the incident are indefinitely detained by the United States and Costa Rican governments at a hotel. Weeks later, Grant is visited by [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Martin \"Marty\" Gutierrez|Dr. Martin Guitierrez]], an American doctor who lives in Costa Rica. Guitierrez informs Grant that an unknown pack of animals has been migrating through the Costa Rican jungle, eating lysine-rich crops and chickens. He also informs Grant that none of them, with the possible exception of Tim and Lex, are going to leave any time soon.\n\n== Themes==\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus skeletal diagram.jpg|thumb|1917 skeletal diagram of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' published by [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], which was the basis of the novel's cover]] \nJurassic Park critiques the dystopian potentialities of science. There are Christian undertones in the skepticism of Ian Malcolm, though Christian terminology and imagery is never used. Malcolm is the conscience that reminds John Hammond of the sacrilegious path that has been taken. The final condition of the park is epitomized by the word 'hell', which highlights the nature of Hammond's sacrilegious attempt.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CH1100078863|title=Rediscovering the Island as Utopian Locus: Michael Crichton\u2019s Jurassic Park.|last=Gallardo-Terrano|first=Pedro|date=2000|via=Gale Academic OneFile|access-date=2018-08-02}}</ref>\n\nMichael Crichton's novel is another version of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' tale where humanity creates without knowing.

A [[Jurassic Park III|third film]], directed by [[Joe Johnston]] and released in 2001, drew several elements, themes, and scenes from both books that were ultimately not utilized in either of the previous films, such as the aviary and boat scenes.\n\nThe novel began as a [[screenplay]] Crichton wrote in 1983, about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur.<ref>{{Cite AV media | people = Crichton, Michael | title = Michael Crichton on the Jurassic Park Phenomenon | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal | date = 2001}}</ref> Eventually, given his reasoning that genetic research is expensive and \"there is no pressing need to create a dinosaur\", Crichton concluded that it would emerge from a \"desire to entertain\", leading to a [[Wildlife refuge|wildlife park]] of extinct animals.<ref>\"Return to Jurassic Park: Dawn of a New Era\", ''Jurassic Park'' Blu-ray (2011)</ref> Originally, the story was told from the point of view of a child, but Crichton changed it as everyone who read the draft felt it would be better if told by an adult.<ref>[http://www.michaelcrichton.net/books-jurassicpark-mcnotes.html Michael Crichton's notes on Jurassic Park]</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn 1989, a series of strange animal attacks occur in [[Costa Rica]] and on the nearby fictional island of [[Isla Nublar]],<ref>Means approximately \"Clouded Island\" or \"Obscured Island\" in Spanish.</ref> the story's main setting, one of which is a worker severely injured on a construction project on Isla Nublar, whose employers refuse to disclose any information about. One of the species is eventually identified as a ''[[Procompsognathus]]''. [[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Alan Grant|Alan Grant]] and his [[Paleobotany|paleobotanist]] graduate student, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Ellen Sattler|Ellie Sattler]], are contacted to confirm the identification, but are abruptly whisked away by billionaire [[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Hammond|John Hammond]]&nbsp;\u2014 founder and chief executive officer of International Genetic Technologies, or InGen&nbsp;\u2014 for a weekend visit to a \"biological preserve\" he has established on Isla Nublar.\n\nUpon arrival, the preserve is revealed to be Jurassic Park, a [[Amusement park|theme park]] showcasing [[Cloning#Artificial cloning of organisms|cloned]] dinosaurs. The animals have been recreated using [[Ancient DNA|damaged dinosaur DNA]] found in blood inside of gnats, ticks, and mosquitoes fossilized and preserved in [[amber]]. Gaps in the genetic code have been filled in with \"compatible\" [[Reptile|reptilian]], [[Bird|avian]] or [[amphibian]] [[DNA]]. To control the population, all specimens on the island are [[lysine]]-[[Auxotrophy|deficient]] and X-Ray sterilized females. Hammond proudly touts InGen's advances in [[genetic engineering]] and shows his guests through the island's vast array of automated systems.\n\n[[File:Curva del drag\u00f3n.png|thumb|left|Ian Malcolm created [[dragon curve]]s to simulate the actions that were to take place in the park.]]\n\nRecent incidents in the park have spooked Hammond's investors. To placate them, Hammond uses Grant and Sattler as fresh consultants. They stand in counterbalance to a famous mathematician and [[Chaos theory|chaos theorist]], [[Ian Malcolm (character)|Ian Malcolm]], and a lawyer representing the investors, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Donald Gennaro|Donald Gennaro]], who are pessimistic about the park's prospects. Malcolm, having been consulted before the park's creation, is especially emphatic in his prediction that the park will collapse, as it is an unsustainable simple structure bluntly forced upon a [[complex system]] with too many unpredictable variables, such as an uncontrollable population, attempting to contain animals with no real equivalent to extant animals with no predictable behavior patterns, and an untested computer system that continually fails to monitor and feed the population.\n\nCountering Malcolm's dire predictions with youthful energy, Hammond groups the consultants with his grandchildren, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Timothy Murphy|Tim]] and [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Alexis Murphy|Alexis \"Lex\" Murphy]]. While touring the park, Grant finds a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' eggshell, seemingly proving Malcolm's earlier assertion that the dinosaurs have somehow been breeding against the geneticists' design.\n\nMeanwhile, the disgruntled chief programmer of Jurassic Park's controlling software, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dennis Nedry|Dennis Nedry]], attempts [[Industrial espionage|corporate espionage]] for [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Lewis Dodgson|Lewis Dodgson]], a geneticist and agent of InGen's archrival, Biosyn. By activating a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] he wrote into the park's computer system, Nedry shuts down its security systems and steals frozen embryos for each of the park's fifteen species in an attempt to smuggle them to a contact waiting at an auxiliary dock at the eastern end of the park. However, during a sudden [[Tropical cyclone#Tropical storm|tropical storm]], he exits his vehicle to get his bearings and is killed by a ''[[Dilophosaurus]]''. Without Nedry to reactivate the park's security, the electrified fences remain off and all the dinosaurs escape. The park's adult ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' attacks the guests on tour, with a juvenile ''T. rex'' attacking and killing Ed Regis, the park's public relations manager. In the aftermath, Grant and the children become lost in the park. Malcolm is gravely injured during the incident, but is found by Gennaro and park game warden [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Robert Muldoon|Robert Muldoon]], spending the remainder of the novel slowly dying as {{ndash}} between lucid lectures and morphine-induced rants {{ndash}} he tries to help the others understand their predicament and survive.\n\nThe park's upper management&nbsp;\u2014 engineer and park supervisor [[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Raymond Arnold|John Arnold]], [[biotechnology|biotechnologist]] [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Henry Wu|Henry Wu]], Muldoon, and Hammond&nbsp;\u2014 struggle to return power to the park, while the veterinarian, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Harding|Dr. Harding]], takes care of Malcolm. They manage to temporarily get the park largely back in order, restoring the computer system by shutting down and restarting the power and resetting the system. When trying to restore the park to working order, they fail to notice that the system has been running on auxiliary power since the restart; this power soon runs out, shutting the park down a second time. The park's intelligent and aggressive raptors escape their enclosure, and kill Wu and Arnold. Meanwhile, Grant and the children slowly make their way back to the Visitor Center by rafting down the jungle river, carrying news that several young raptors were on board the island's supply ship when it departed for the mainland. After the three return to the visitor's center, they are contacted by the others, who instruct Grant to switch on the park's generators. Tim is then able to reactivate the park's main power, allowing Gennaro to force the supply ship to return.\n\nGennaro orders that the island be destroyed, but Grant rejects his authority, claiming that they must first inspect the whole situation. Grant, Sattler, Muldoon, and Gennaro set out into the park to find the wild raptor nests and compare hatched eggs with the island's revised population tally, and return unscathed. Meanwhile, Hammond, taking a walk and contemplating building a new park improving on his previous mistakes, hears a ''T. rex'' roar and, startled, falls down a hill, where he is eaten by a pack of ''Procompsognathus''.\n\nWith regard to the dinosaurs' breeding, it eventually transpires that using frog DNA to fill gaps in the dinosaurs' genetic code enabled a measure of [[Sequential hermaphroditism|dichogamy]], in which some of the female animals changed into males in response to the same-sex environment. The computer tally failed to include newborn animals, having been programmed to stop counting once the assumed correct total number of animals had been found.\n\nThe survivors are rescued by the fictitious Costa Rican Air Force, where Grant reveals that the dinosaurs have been killing people. The Costa Rican Air Force then declare the island hazardous and unsafe, and proceed to raze the island with [[napalm]]. Survivors of the incident are indefinitely detained by the United States and Costa Rican governments at a hotel. Weeks later, Grant is visited by [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Martin \"Marty\" Gutierrez|Dr. Martin Guitierrez]], an American doctor who lives in Costa Rica. Guitierrez informs Grant that an unknown pack of animals has been migrating through the Costa Rican jungle, eating lysine-rich crops and chickens. He also informs Grant that none of them, with the possible exception of Tim and Lex, are going to leave any time soon.\n\n== Themes==\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus skeletal diagram.jpg|thumb|1917 skeletal diagram of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' published by [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], which was the basis of the novel's cover]] \nJurassic Park critiques the dystopian potentialities of science. There are Christian undertones in the skepticism of Ian Malcolm, though Christian terminology and imagery is never used. Malcolm is the conscience that reminds John Hammond of the sacrilegious path that has been taken. The final condition of the park is epitomized by the word 'hell', which highlights the nature of Hammond's sacrilegious attempt.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CH1100078863|title=Rediscovering the Island as Utopian Locus: Michael Crichton\u2019s Jurassic Park.|last=Gallardo-Terrano|first=Pedro|date=2000|via=Gale Academic OneFile|access-date=2018-08-02}}</ref>\n\nMichael Crichton's novel is another version of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' tale where humanity creates without knowing.

Stevens was last seen in the episode, \"[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked (Grey's Anatomy)|I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]]\" in 2010, and appears for the first time again in archive footage, as details of her current situation are revealed, along with Chambers' character. Chambers returns for the episode in voice-over, as the episode takes a retrospective approach, as he narrates much of what has happened to him since.\n\nThe episode's original broadcast was watched by 6.30 million viewers and registered the show's best ratings in six weeks, since the mid-season premiere. It received a polarizing response from fans and critics alike, who were divided on the show's handling of Alex's exit, but many largely felt it made sense given the circumstances of Chambers' abrupt departure.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens with archive footage of [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]])'s speech to the original interns in the pilot episode. It features [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]) and [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]). Meredith Grey then provides her signature episodic [[voice-over]], telling a \"lame joke\" about a patient saying, \"Hey doc, it hurts when I go like this\" to which the doctor responds, \"Well don't go like this\" and says that while lame, \"it is nonetheless true that as human beings, we cannot help but want to follow our own instincts, guts and primal urges no matter how much it hurts\". A sequence follows, showing [[Jo Karev]] ([[Camilla Luddington]]), [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) and Meredith Grey (Pompeo) receiving letters from Alex Karev (Chambers). As the three begin reading the letters, Alex (Chambers) provides voice-over of his written letters, declaring that he's not leaving, but has already left \u2015 he is gone.\n\nThe episode then provides a retrospective of landmark storylines in the series integral to Alex's whole journey, from his arrogant, smart-mouth days in the early seasons to his maturation as a successful pediatrics surgeon, devoted friend and partner to Izzie and later Jo. It also shows flashbacks of his relationship with Izzie, her cancer battle and their wedding. It also shows flashbacks of the original five interns' friendship and Meredith's growing friendship with Alex throughout all sixteen seasons. Alex explains to Meredith that the form of a letter was not the way he wanted to say goodbye. He tells Meredith that she was always the one to set him straight, and it provides flashbacks to Alex having to face up to his problems, rather than run away. Alex then says he does not want to be set straight, or for Meredith to say the right thing, because the one right thing isn't in Seattle. Alex then reveals he is with Izzie (Katherine Heigl).\n\nFollowing this revelation, flashbacks of Alex and Izzie's early relationship is shown. As this goes on, Alex reveals he contacted her during Meredith's trial to maintain her medical license for a recommendation letter. He admits the trial gave him an excuse to finally contact Izzie, to know if she was alive and well. After brief exchange on the phone, Alex says he heard little voices in the background and asked if Izzie had kids and after a silence, she revealed that she did. And it turns out they are his children.\n\n[[File:Alex16x08final.png|thumb|225px|right|[[Alex Karev]]'s ([[Justin Chambers]]) last physical appearance includes this scene in the 350th episode \"[[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)#ep350|My Shot]]\".<ref name=\"last\" />]]\n\nAlex reveals Izzie was single, wanted kids and because the cancer nuked her eggs, she could not have biological children but she had their embryos. Flashbacks from the fifth season show Alex and Izzie's scenes revolving around the embryos. Alex explains he was too freaked out to care what she did with them so he signed papers off so that she could do whatever she wanted with them, as a flashback to Alex's worries of her surviving cancer is shown. He says he is aware he should have told Jo and Meredith, but instead of telling them, he got through the trial and went to see his children. His children \u2015 twins named Alexis and Eli \u2015 are described as \"hilarious and stubborn\" like Izzie, Alexis having Izzie's eyes and Eli's smile being crooked like his, that the kids want to be doctors and they bake like Izzie, and that he lives on a farm in the middle of no-where in Kansas. He also reveals Izzie works as a surgical oncologist and has made so much progress. Alex again says she could come up and bring him back to Seattle, but he hopes she does not do that and that he is finally where he should be, and that he has never had that before. Alex says he hopes when she is ready and not mad that she can come up and meet his children.\n\nFlashbacks also show Jo and Alex's relationship, as well as Jo's own journey briefly, as Jo reads her letter from him. Alex details how deeply sorry he is, but that he is in love with Izzie as well. Alex admits the letter is the worst thing he is done, and that Jo has earned so much better, but also mentions the children he has with her. Alex tells Jo he felt he and Izzie had unfinished business and that they spoke as if no time had passed, that they were frozen in time. Alex says he needs to give the children the life he and Jo never had. Alex reveals he went to a lawyer, signed divorce papers and left her his shares at Grey Sloan.\n\nWebber, at an AA meeting, relates Alex's situation with Jo and Izzie to Ellis and Adele, and that he wishes he got to see [[Maggie Pierce]] ([[Kelly McCreary]]) grow up, so he cannot be mad at him no matter how hard he wants to be, although admits his bitterness that he could not say goodbye simply as a teacher. It finally shows another sequence of Izzie and Alex's relationship, this time through dialogue of Izzie's declarations of love and finally shows the resemblance of Izzie's children to her.\n\nBailey talks to Ben ([[Jason George]]) about Joey, and relates the situation to Alex's upbringing. They decide to keep caring for him. Meanwhile, Jo swallows her emotions and decides to continue to work casually after reading the letter as Link ([[Chris Carmack]]) calls her his hero. Jo responds, \"Mine too\". The episode ends with Meredith talking to her daughter, Zola (Aniela Gumbs) and preparing to tell her that Uncle Alex is gone, with a voice-over of Meredith to say there really is no good way to say goodbye.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Katherine Heigl LF adjust.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Katherine Heigl]]'s long-departed character was a source of critical analysis, as Chambers' character's decision to leave his wife for her drew many wide ranging responses.]]\nThe episode was written by [[Elisabeth Finch]] and directed by [[Debbie Allen]]. Several former characters appear in the episode through archive footage such as [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R.

Alex and Izzie's storyline was left unresolved in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 6)|sixth season]], after Heigl departed the series abruptly during her maternity leave. In a [[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked (Grey's Anatomy)|January 2010 episode]], Stevens leaves after she is unable to repair things with Alex. [[Joan Rater]], the episode's writer, explained that Stevens getting better propelled Karev to let her go.<ref name=Matter>{{cite web|url=http://www.greyswriters.com/2010/01/joan-rater-on-i-like-you-so-much-better-when-youre-naked.html |title=Joan Rater on \"I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked\"... |publisher=ABC |work=Grey Matter |date=January 21, 2010 |access-date=June 26, 2012 |author=Rater, Joan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513155822/http://www.greyswriters.com/2010/01/joan-rater-on-i-like-you-so-much-better-when-youre-naked.html |archive-date=May 13, 2013 |df= }}</ref> Izzie's absence after this was intended to be temporary, with the character returning in the season's final five episodes. However, Heigl did not show up for filming on March 1, 2010 for the season's twentieth episode. Heigl's three month family leave in Utah propelled her to quit the show entirely, feeling she needed more time to bond with her adoptive daughter. She explained, \"So before I was due back, I spoke again to [[Shonda Rhimes|Shonda]] about wanting to leave. Then I waited at home until I was given the formal okay that I was off the show. The rumors that I refused to return were totally untrue.\" While Heigl felt the departure was \u201camicable\u201d, despite the shock and feeling that something could have worked out, Heigl felt Izzie returning only to leave again after already having done so twice would \"feel a little manipulative\" and she felt that she had not created a bond with her adoptive daughter yet that made her feel like she needed her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/03/24/katherine-heigl-greys-anatomy-official-ew/|title=This week's cover (exclusive!): Katherine Heigl confirms 'Grey's Anatomy' departure|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Ausiello|date=March 24, 2010|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=April 5, 2010}}</ref> \n\nIn August 2010, Rhimes stated that she did not feel Alex and Izzie's arc had fully concluded, and hoped to give proper closure to their relationship in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name=\"Closure\">{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/08/22/greys-anatomy-closure-for-alex-izzie/|title='Grey's Anatomy' Exclusive: Closure is coming for Alex/Izzie fans |first=Michael|last=Ausiello|authorlink=Michael Ausiello |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|date=August 22, 2010|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> She later confirmed that she had intended to kill off Izzie off-screen, but opted against this a day later as she felt that it would destroy Alex, rather than give him closure.

Then Fremont elaborated, \"It just felt like Alex dying, although tragic, would\u2019ve been the only way to write the character off that made sense after everything he went through\" and that \"Alex Karev we\u2019ve watched for \u2014 holy hell, almost two decades if we\u2019re rounding up \u2014 wouldn\u2019t do that\" although admitted the exit \"almost works\", as Alex chooses to not miss a second with his children and to be a great dad, but that \"Alex not being mad for one single second about the fact that Izzie had secret kids five years ago and never told him\" made \"less sense\". Fremont also noted that Alex could have asked Jo to move to Kansas to help him be there for his children so that it was obviously \"ALSO about the women he loves\". She discussed the dramatic nature of Richard's speech saying, \"I\u2019m sorry, Richard\u2019s speech is lovely and all, but he\u2019s acting like he can\u2019t just go to Kansas and see the guy. Richard thrives on that drama, you guys. Fremont also commented on Jo's reaction saying, \"Poor Jo! And poor me for having to sympathize with a character I can\u2019t stand, you know? Jo\u2019s letter truly sucks\", with both commenting on the impersonal nature of the letter.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/greys-anatomy-recap-season-16-episode-16-leave-a-light-on.html|title=Grey\u2019s Anatomy Recap: A Dear Jo Letter|work=Vulture|last=Fremont|first=Maggie|date=March 6, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAshley Bissette Sumerel for ''Telltale-TV'' gave a moderately positive 3.5 out of 5 star review of the episode. She complimented how the writers worked with the circumstances of Chambers' abrupt departure feeling \"[his] sudden exit meant the writers needed to change course and figure out the best way to write out his character, and I believe they did that, with a few exceptions\" and said, I\u2019d actually told a few people that there was one ending for Alex that I felt like I\u2019d be able to accept, and low and behold, this is it.

She opined that the Izzie/Alex flashbacks \"bothered\" her. She finished saying, \"It worries me that this might mean the whole issue will largely be swept under the rug after this episode.

They noted Meredith as being \"self-absorbed\" saying, \"Meredith has been so far removed from the missing Alex storyline, and before that, she hasn't so much as visited him at Pac-North. Alex's final season had a startling lack of Merlex, so the final goodbye was even bitterer\", while also acknowledging how no goodbye, short of death, would satisfy everyone. The reviewer criticized Alex's development in the episode saying, \"Alex, who has spent years resenting people for abandoning him turned around and left those he loves. It's a struggle to wrap one's head around it.\" Blu also criticized Alex for seemingly using his sick mother as an alibi, and noted it as being uncharacteristic of the \"straight-shooter\" and \"guy who tells it like it is whether you like it or not\" that fans know him by. The reviewer also noted that it was \"already a disservice that it took so long for anyone to pay attention to his absence\" and that \"Jo probably should've contacted his mother ages ago\". Blu also criticized the storyline for how it will service Jo as a tragedy later, calling \"Woe is Joe hours [...] irritating\" and that \"so much of Alex's storylines in the last few seasons have been playing second to Jo.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvfanatic.com/2020/03/when-good-characters-cant-break-away-from-being-love-interests-w/|title=Grey's Anatomy Season 16 Episode 16 Review: Leave a Light On|work=TVFanatic|last=Blu|first=Jasmine|date=March 6, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Grey's Anatomy episodes|16}}\n\n[[Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 16) episodes]]\n[[Category:2020 American television episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE: Leave a Light On (''Grey's Anatomy'')}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n|title = Leave a Light On\n|series = [[Grey's Anatomy]]\n|image =\n|image_size = 250px\n|caption = Meredith reads the letter that Alex sent her.\n|season = 16\n|episode = 16\n|length = 43 minutes\n|airdate = {{start date|2020|3|05}}\n|music = \n|writer = [[Elisabeth Finch]]\n|director = [[Debbie Allen]]\n|guests = * [[Jason George]] as Dr. Ben Warren\n*BJ Tanner as William George Bailey Jones\n| season_article = Grey's Anatomy (season 16)\n| episode_list = List of Grey's Anatomy episodes\n|prev = Snowblind\n|next = Life on Mars?\n}}\n\n'''\"Leave a Light On\"''' is the sixteenth episode of the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)|sixteenth season]] of the American [[medical drama]]  television series ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' and the 358th episode  overall, which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on March 5, 2020.

Stevens was last seen in the episode, \"[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked (Grey's Anatomy)|I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]]\" in 2010, and appears for the first time again in archive footage, as details of her current situation are revealed, along with Chambers' character. Chambers returns for the episode in voice-over, as the episode takes a retrospective approach, as he narrates much of what has happened to him since.\n\nThe episode's original broadcast was watched by 6.30 million viewers and registered the show's best ratings in six weeks, since the mid-season premiere. It received a polarizing response from fans and critics alike, who were divided on the show's handling of Alex's exit, but many largely felt it made sense given the circumstances of Chambers' abrupt departure.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens with archive footage of [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]])'s speech to the original interns in the pilot episode. It features [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]) and [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]). Meredith Grey then provides her signature episodic [[voice-over]], telling a \"lame joke\" about a patient saying, \"Hey doc, it hurts when I go like this\" to which the doctor responds, \"Well don't go like this\" and says that while lame, \"it is nonetheless true that as human beings, we cannot help but want to follow our own instincts, guts and primal urges no matter how much it hurts\". A sequence follows, showing [[Jo Karev]] ([[Camilla Luddington]]), [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) and Meredith Grey (Pompeo) receiving letters from Alex Karev (Chambers). As the three begin reading the letters, Alex (Chambers) provides voice-over of his written letters, declaring that he's not leaving, but has already left \u2015 he is gone.\n\nThe episode then provides a retrospective of landmark storylines in the series integral to Alex's whole journey, from his arrogant, smart-mouth days in the early seasons to his maturation as a successful pediatrics surgeon, devoted friend and partner to Izzie and later Jo. It also shows flashbacks of his relationship with Izzie, her cancer battle and their wedding. It also shows flashbacks of the original five interns' friendship and Meredith's growing friendship with Alex throughout all sixteen seasons. Alex explains to Meredith that the form of a letter was not the way he wanted to say goodbye. He tells Meredith that she was always the one to set him straight, and it provides flashbacks to Alex having to face up to his problems, rather than run away. Alex then says he does not want to be set straight, or for Meredith to say the right thing, because the one right thing isn't in Seattle. Alex then reveals he is with Izzie (Katherine Heigl).\n\nFollowing this revelation, flashbacks of Alex and Izzie's early relationship is shown. As this goes on, Alex reveals he contacted her during Meredith's trial to maintain her medical license for a recommendation letter. He admits the trial gave him an excuse to finally contact Izzie, to know if she was alive and well. After brief exchange on the phone, Alex says he heard little voices in the background and asked if Izzie had kids and after a silence, she revealed that she did. And it turns out they are his children.\n\n[[File:Alex16x08final.png|thumb|225px|right|[[Alex Karev]]'s ([[Justin Chambers]]) last physical appearance includes this scene in the 350th episode \"[[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)#ep350|My Shot]]\".<ref name=\"last\" />]]\n\nAlex reveals Izzie was single, wanted kids and because the cancer nuked her eggs, she could not have biological children but she had their embryos. Flashbacks from the fifth season show Alex and Izzie's scenes revolving around the embryos. Alex explains he was too freaked out to care what she did with them so he signed papers off so that she could do whatever she wanted with them, as a flashback to Alex's worries of her surviving cancer is shown. He says he is aware he should have told Jo and Meredith, but instead of telling them, he got through the trial and went to see his children. His children \u2015 twins named Alexis and Eli \u2015 are described as \"hilarious and stubborn\" like Izzie, Alexis having Izzie's eyes and Eli's smile being crooked like his, that the kids want to be doctors and they bake like Izzie, and that he lives on a farm in the middle of no-where in Kansas. He also reveals Izzie works as a surgical oncologist and has made so much progress. Alex again says she could come up and bring him back to Seattle, but he hopes she does not do that and that he is finally where he should be, and that he has never had that before. Alex says he hopes when she is ready and not mad that she can come up and meet his children.\n\nFlashbacks also show Jo and Alex's relationship, as well as Jo's own journey briefly, as Jo reads her letter from him. Alex details how deeply sorry he is, but that he is in love with Izzie as well. Alex admits the letter is the worst thing he is done, and that Jo has earned so much better, but also mentions the children he has with her. Alex tells Jo he felt he and Izzie had unfinished business and that they spoke as if no time had passed, that they were frozen in time. Alex says he needs to give the children the life he and Jo never had. Alex reveals he went to a lawyer, signed divorce papers and left her his shares at Grey Sloan.\n\nWebber, at an AA meeting, relates Alex's situation with Jo and Izzie to Ellis and Adele, and that he wishes he got to see [[Maggie Pierce]] ([[Kelly McCreary]]) grow up, so he cannot be mad at him no matter how hard he wants to be, although admits his bitterness that he could not say goodbye simply as a teacher. It finally shows another sequence of Izzie and Alex's relationship, this time through dialogue of Izzie's declarations of love and finally shows the resemblance of Izzie's children to her.\n\nBailey talks to Ben ([[Jason George]]) about Joey, and relates the situation to Alex's upbringing. They decide to keep caring for him. Meanwhile, Jo swallows her emotions and decides to continue to work casually after reading the letter as Link ([[Chris Carmack]]) calls her his hero. Jo responds, \"Mine too\". The episode ends with Meredith talking to her daughter, Zola (Aniela Gumbs) and preparing to tell her that Uncle Alex is gone, with a voice-over of Meredith to say there really is no good way to say goodbye.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Katherine Heigl LF adjust.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Katherine Heigl]]'s long-departed character was a source of critical analysis, as Chambers' character's decision to leave his wife for her drew many wide ranging responses.]]\nThe episode was written by [[Elisabeth Finch]] and directed by [[Debbie Allen]]. Several former characters appear in the episode through archive footage such as [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]), [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), Shane Ross ([[Gaius Charles]]), [[Stephanie Edwards (Grey's Anatomy)|Stephanie Edwards]] ([[Jerrika Hinton]]), [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), Helen Karev ([[Lindsay Wagner]]) and Jimmy Evans ([[James Remar]]). The only current main cast members that appeared in new scenes were [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]), [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]]), Jo Karev ([[Camilla Luddington]]) and Atticus \"Link\" Lincoln ([[Chris Carmack]]).\n\nThe episode re-visits [[Katherine Heigl]]'s character, [[Izzie Stevens]], for the first time in over ten years. Alex and Izzie's storyline was left unresolved in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 6)|sixth season]], after Heigl departed the series abruptly during her maternity leave. In a [[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked (Grey's Anatomy)|January 2010 episode]], Stevens leaves after she is unable to repair things with Alex. [[Joan Rater]], the episode's writer, explained that Stevens getting better propelled Karev to let her go.<ref name=Matter>{{cite web|url=http://www.greyswriters.com/2010/01/joan-rater-on-i-like-you-so-much-better-when-youre-naked.html |title=Joan Rater on \"I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked\"... |publisher=ABC |work=Grey Matter |date=January 21, 2010 |access-date=June 26, 2012 |author=Rater, Joan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513155822/http://www.greyswriters.com/2010/01/joan-rater-on-i-like-you-so-much-better-when-youre-naked.html |archive-date=May 13, 2013 |df= }}</ref> Izzie's absence after this was intended to be temporary, with the character returning in the season's final five episodes. However, Heigl did not show up for filming on March 1, 2010 for the season's twentieth episode. Heigl's three month family leave in Utah propelled her to quit the show entirely, feeling she needed more time to bond with her adoptive daughter. She explained, \"So before I was due back, I spoke again to [[Shonda Rhimes|Shonda]] about wanting to leave. Then I waited at home until I was given the formal okay that I was off the show. The rumors that I refused to return were totally untrue.\" While Heigl felt the departure was \u201camicable\u201d, despite the shock and feeling that something could have worked out, Heigl felt Izzie returning only to leave again after already having done so twice would \"feel a little manipulative\" and she felt that she had not created a bond with her adoptive daughter yet that made her feel like she needed her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/03/24/katherine-heigl-greys-anatomy-official-ew/|title=This week's cover (exclusive!): Katherine Heigl confirms 'Grey's Anatomy' departure|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Ausiello|date=March 24, 2010|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=April 5, 2010}}</ref> \n\nIn August 2010, Rhimes stated that she did not feel Alex and Izzie's arc had fully concluded, and hoped to give proper closure to their relationship in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name=\"Closure\">{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/08/22/greys-anatomy-closure-for-alex-izzie/|title='Grey's Anatomy' Exclusive: Closure is coming for Alex/Izzie fans |first=Michael|last=Ausiello|authorlink=Michael Ausiello |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|date=August 22, 2010|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> She later confirmed that she had intended to kill off Izzie off-screen, but opted against this a day later as she felt that it would destroy Alex, rather than give him closure.

In the key 18-49 demographic, the episode scored a 1.3/7 [[Nielsen ratings|rating]]/share, up two tenths from the previous episode and the best since the mid-season premiere \"[[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)#ep352|Help Me Through the Night]]\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pucci |first1=Douglas |title=Thursday Final Ratings: NBA on TNT Tops the 10 p.m. Hour in Adults 18-49, 18-34 and Key Male Demos |url=https://programminginsider.com/thursday-final-ratings-nba-on-tnt-tops-the-10-p-m-hour-in-adults-18-49-18-34-and-key-male-demos/ |website=Programming Insider |accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reviews===\n[[File:Justin Cambers 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Justin Chambers]] made his final appearance as a series regular after fifteen years on the show.]]\n\"Leave the Light On\" received a polarizing response from television critics and fans alike.\n\n''[[USA Today]]'' noted the \"polarizing\" response for fans, and on discussing Alex's whole journey said, \"He was there for us as we watched a succession of doctors depart the series. Karev was a constant; Where else would he go? After a rough upbringing, he craved stability \u2013 making the timing of his exit all the more perplexing.

Then Fremont elaborated, \"It just felt like Alex dying, although tragic, would\u2019ve been the only way to write the character off that made sense after everything he went through\" and that \"Alex Karev we\u2019ve watched for \u2014 holy hell, almost two decades if we\u2019re rounding up \u2014 wouldn\u2019t do that\" although admitted the exit \"almost works\", as Alex chooses to not miss a second with his children and to be a great dad, but that \"Alex not being mad for one single second about the fact that Izzie had secret kids five years ago and never told him\" made \"less sense\". Fremont also noted that Alex could have asked Jo to move to Kansas to help him be there for his children so that it was obviously \"ALSO about the women he loves\". She discussed the dramatic nature of Richard's speech saying, \"I\u2019m sorry, Richard\u2019s speech is lovely and all, but he\u2019s acting like he can\u2019t just go to Kansas and see the guy. Richard thrives on that drama, you guys. Fremont also commented on Jo's reaction saying, \"Poor Jo! And poor me for having to sympathize with a character I can\u2019t stand, you know? Jo\u2019s letter truly sucks\", with both commenting on the impersonal nature of the letter.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/greys-anatomy-recap-season-16-episode-16-leave-a-light-on.html|title=Grey\u2019s Anatomy Recap: A Dear Jo Letter|work=Vulture|last=Fremont|first=Maggie|date=March 6, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAshley Bissette Sumerel for ''Telltale-TV'' gave a moderately positive 3.5 out of 5 star review of the episode. She complimented how the writers worked with the circumstances of Chambers' abrupt departure feeling \"[his] sudden exit meant the writers needed to change course and figure out the best way to write out his character, and I believe they did that, with a few exceptions\" and said, I\u2019d actually told a few people that there was one ending for Alex that I felt like I\u2019d be able to accept, and low and behold, this is it.

She opined that the Izzie/Alex flashbacks \"bothered\" her. She finished saying, \"It worries me that this might mean the whole issue will largely be swept under the rug after this episode. It\u2019s already upsetting to see how Alex was able to walk away from Jo so quickly, and I hope they at least handle things differently on Jo\u2019s end.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hypable.com/greys-anatomy-season-16-episode-16-alex-karev-written-off-the-show/|title=\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 season 16, episode 16 review: Alex Karev says goodbye|work=Hypable|last=Field|first=Sonya|date=March 5, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nJasmine Blu for ''TV Fanatic'' gave a mostly negative response to the episode. They noted Meredith as being \"self-absorbed\" saying, \"Meredith has been so far removed from the missing Alex storyline, and before that, she hasn't so much as visited him at Pac-North. Alex's final season had a startling lack of Merlex, so the final goodbye was even bitterer\", while also acknowledging how no goodbye, short of death, would satisfy everyone. The reviewer criticized Alex's development in the episode saying, \"Alex, who has spent years resenting people for abandoning him turned around and left those he loves. It's a struggle to wrap one's head around it.\" Blu also criticized Alex for seemingly using his sick mother as an alibi, and noted it as being uncharacteristic of the \"straight-shooter\" and \"guy who tells it like it is whether you like it or not\" that fans know him by. The reviewer also noted that it was \"already a disservice that it took so long for anyone to pay attention to his absence\" and that \"Jo probably should've contacted his mother ages ago\". Blu also criticized the storyline for how it will service Jo as a tragedy later, calling \"Woe is Joe hours [...] irritating\" and that \"so much of Alex's storylines in the last few seasons have been playing second to Jo.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvfanatic.com/2020/03/when-good-characters-cant-break-away-from-being-love-interests-w/|title=Grey's Anatomy Season 16 Episode 16 Review: Leave a Light On|work=TVFanatic|last=Blu|first=Jasmine|date=March 6, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Grey's Anatomy episodes|16}}\n\n[[Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 16) episodes]]\n[[Category:2020 American television episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toDeadline(link changed toDeadline Hollywood) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_a_Light_On_(Grey%27s_Anatomy)"}

Elder advocated Anglo-Scottish union through the marriage of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]]. His advice to [[Henry VIII]] in 1543, was termed the ''Advice of a [[Redshank (soldier)|Redshank]]''.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=76781 ''Letters & Papers Henry VIII,'' vol. 18 part 2, (1902), no. 539]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=l1QJAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Bannatyne Miscellany'', Edinburgh vol. 1, (1827), 1\u20136]</ref> Another schoolmaster to the young heir was Arthur Lallart, who would later be interrogated in London for having gone to Scotland in 1562.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Domestic 1547\u20131580'', (1856), pp. 201, 203</ref>\nHenry was said to be strong, athletic, skilled in horsemanship and weaponry, and passionate about hunting and hawking. His youthful character is captured somewhat in a letter of March 1554 to [[Mary I of England]] from Temple Newsam, where he writes about making a map, the ''Utopia Nova'', and his wish that \"every haire in my heade for to be a wourthy souldiour\".<ref>Ellis, Henry, ed., ''Original Letters illustrative of British History,'' 2nd series vol. 2, (1827) pp. 249\u2013251</ref>\n\n==Lennox Crisis==\nThe Lennox Crisis (1558\u20131563) was a political dilemma in England that arose from the dynastic ambition of the Lennoxes: Matthew Stewart, the 4th Earl of Lennox, was third in line to the Scottish throne, and his wife [[Margaret Douglas]], the Countess of Lennox, was a niece of Henry VIII (Henry's sister Margaret Tudor's daughter) and granddaughter of Henry VII, making her second in line to the English throne after Mary Queen of Scots, and her son Darnley after her, should Elizabeth not have been able to accede to or hold the throne for some reason.<ref name=\"Macauley, 2004, 267\">Macauley, (2004), p. 267</ref> The Lennox family represented an alternative line of succession to the English throne through Margaret Tudor, should Henry's heirs not have been able to hold it for the time they did. As [[Roman Catholic]]s, they posed a threat to [[Protestant]] England,<ref name=\"Macauley, 2004, 267\"/> especially in 1558, as the 25-year-old Queen Elizabeth took the throne. Although Elizabeth was bright, witty, and well-educated for her position, as a female she had to prove herself. Many Roman Catholics would have liked to have seen the next in line, the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, take the throne, as they regarded Elizabeth as illegitimate, her parents' marriage not having been recognised by the Catholic Church. And many would have preferred Darnley, as a male, to have the throne as well. All of these interrelationships made for complex intrigues, spying, strategising and manoeuvering for power at the various courts.\n\nWhen [[Henry II of France]] died in July 1559, Lennox's brother John, 5th [[Duke of Aubigny|Sieur d'Aubigny]], was elevated in the French court as kinsman of the new French queen, Mary, already Queen of Scots. Aubigny arranged for Darnley to be dispatched to the French court to congratulate Mary and [[Francis II of France]] on their accession and seek restoration for Lennox. Mary did not restore Lennox to his Scottish earldom, but she did give 1,000 crowns to Darnley and invited him to her coronation.<ref>Macauley, (2004), p. 268</ref> Lennox's plan was to appeal directly to the Queen of Scots via her ambassador, over the heads of Elizabeth and the [[House of Guise|Guise]]. The mission of Lennox's agent, one Nesbit, appears to have been a desperate one; not only was Lennox willing to hand over Darnley and his brother Charles as hostages for his restoration, but he supplied pedigrees of Darnley, indicating his right to the inheritance of England and Scotland and the houses of Hamilton and Douglas.<ref>Macauley, (2004), pp. 268\u2013269</ref> Aubigny was also later accused of supporting Mary's title to the throne of England and hinting that even his nephew had a stronger claim than Elizabeth.\n\nLennox set Nesbit to watch Mary, Darnley and Darnley's tutor, John Elder. In 1559 [[Nicholas Throckmorton]], the English ambassador in Paris, warned Elizabeth that Elder was \"as dangerous for the matters of England as any he knew.\"<ref>''Calendar State Papers Foreign Elizabeth'', vol. 1</ref>\n\nLord Darnley was the next claimant to the English throne, after the Queen of Scots, and his aging mother, and as a male, English-born Catholic, he was preferred by Elizabeth's enemies. [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|Paget]] in March 1560 wrote of 'well founded' fear that Catholics would raise Darnley to the throne on Elizabeth's death.<ref>The Lennox Crisis, 1558\u20131563; Sarah Macauley, Christ's College, Cambridge. Northern History, XLI: 2, Sept. 2004, p.276</ref>\n\nBy the summer of that year, Elizabeth's position was considerably strengthened.<ref>Macauley, (2004), p. 276</ref> [[Francis Yaxley]] was one notable spy. A Catholic, Yaxley had been a clerk of the Signet and had been employed by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] since 1549, travelling in France for him.<ref>HMC ''Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury'', vol. 1 (1883), pp. 74, 118, 121, 147; vol. 2 (1888), p. 509: ''CSP Domestic 1547\u20131580'', (1856), p. 90, 16 March 1557</ref> Yaxley had placed Mabel Fortescue and other ladies as servants in the Lennox household at Settrington in November 1560.<ref>''CSP Domestic 1547\u20131580'', (1856), pp. 164, 171, 177</ref> Yaxley had been employed by the Countess of Lennox; his interrogation at the [[Tower of London]] in February 1562 revealed that he had obtained intelligence about the English Court from the Spanish ambassador, and the ambassador had entrusted him and Hugh Allen with messages and tokens for the Lennoxes and Darnley. Yaxley admitted that his missions were intended to arrange the marriage of the Queen of Scots with Darnley, that Darnley's religion guaranteed him greater success in his suit than the [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|Earl of Arran]], and that the countess had many friends \"in the nurth\".<ref>Macauley, (2004), p. 284: ''CSP Domestic 1547\u20131580'', (1856), p. 195</ref> Although the Lennox threat never died out, Elizabeth did not convict the family of treason in 1562 after their arrest nor did she encourage steps made to annul the countess's claim to her throne for inquiring into her legitimacy. Perhaps, as has been suggested, Elizabeth feared that these investigations could also be directed at herself, or her inaction was intended merely to ensure the survival of the monarchy by not reducing the number of potential heirs. The Lennox family were released in February 1563, and within a few months, Darnley and his mother were conspicuous by their presence at Court and the favour they received there, although Elizabeth would not accommodate the earl at Court.<ref name=\"Macauley, 2004, 287\">Macauley, (2004), p. 287</ref>\n\nSarah Macauley notes three outcomes of the court's final decision of the Lennox trial:<blockquote>\"Their elevation at Court was, as it turned out in 1563, a useful complication in the succession issue. First, it presented a public statement that the preferences of Parliament (the claim of Catherine Grey in the succession crisis) could not dictate her own policy. Secondly, favouring the Lennoxes could serve as some kind of appeasement of the English Roman Catholics, who, like the Spanish ambassador, might foresee Elizabeth naming Darnley as her successor ... Such speculation would also distract them from favouring the more alarming claim of the Queen of Scots ... Thirdly, and most significantly, the elevation of the Lennoxes presented an obstacle between the Queen of Scots and the English throne. Thus was Darnley's uniquely 'British' inheritance put to use at last ... The subsequent release of Darnley into Scotland and the restoration of his father at the Scottish Court were part of this policy: the political disaster of the Darnley marriage as yet unforeseen.\"<ref>Macauley, Sarah.

Mary soon became pregnant.\n\nMary's private secretary, [[David Rizzio]], was stabbed 56 times on 9 March 1566 by Darnley and his confederates, Protestant Scottish nobles, in the presence of the queen, who was six months pregnant. According to English diplomats [[Thomas Randolph (diplomat)|Thomas Randolph]] and the [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], the murder of Rizzio (who was rumoured to be the father of Mary's unborn child) was part of Darnley's bid to force Mary to cede the Crown Matrimonial.

Around 2 A.M. on the night of 9\u201310 February 1567, while Mary was away, two explosions rocked the foundation of Kirk o' Field. These explosions were later attributed to two barrels of gunpowder that had been placed in the small room under Darnley's sleeping quarters. Darnley's body and the body of his valet William Taylor were found outside, surrounded by a cloak, a dagger, a chair, and a coat. Darnley was dressed only in his nightshirt, suggesting he had fled in some haste from his bedchamber.\n\nDarnley was apparently smothered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weir|2008|p=296}}; {{Harvnb|Wormald|1988|p=161}}</ref> There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weir|2008|p=252}}; {{Harvnb|Greig|2004}}</ref> A post-mortem revealed internal injuries, thought to have been caused by the explosion.

Bothwell had long been suspected of having designs on the throne, and his close relationship with the queen gave rise to rumours they were sexually intimate. This was viewed as a motive for Bothwell to have Darnley murdered, with help from some of the nobility and seemingly with royal approval. Mary had been looking at options for removing Darnley, though her ideas were for divorce, and none were suitable.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nSoon after Darnley's death, Bothwell and Mary left Edinburgh together. There are two points of view about the circumstances: in the first, Bothwell kidnapped the queen, took her to [[Dunbar Castle]], and raped her. In the second, Mary was a willing participant in the kidnapping, and the story of rape was a fabrication, so her honour and reputation were not ruined by her marriage to a man widely suspected of murder. Mary later miscarried twins by Bothwell.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nSuspicions that Mary colluded with conspirators in her husband's death or that she took no action to prevent his death were key factors in the downward spiral that led to her loss of the Scottish crown. The [[Casket letters]], alleged to have been written by Mary, seemed to indicate her support for the killing. The letters were purportedly found by [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton]], in Edinburgh in a silver box engraved with an F (supposedly for Francis II), along with a number of other documents, including the Mary-Bothwell marriage certificate.<ref name=\"MacRobert\">{{cite book|last=MacRobert|first=A.

They were given separate trials in England. Bothwell was found not guilty. Mary's trial took longer, ending with no definitive finding.

Darnley is portrayed as a snivelling, pathetic character who marries Mary as part of a plot by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] ([[Glenda Jackson]]) to weaken Mary's claim to the English throne. Dalton portrays Darnley as a pampered, spoiled man who beds the Queen's advisor, [[David Rizzio]] ([[Ian Holm]]), but later falls out with Rizzio and has him murdered by other plotters (referred to in the film as the Lords of the Congregation). Darnley then mourns the death of his former lover. A plot to murder Darnley is later planned and carried out by [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Lord Bothwell]] ([[Nigel Davenport]]), Mary's illegitimate half-brother [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Lord Moray]] ([[Patrick McGoohan]]), and the various Scottish Lords who participated in the murder of Rizzio ([[George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly|Huntly]], [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Morton]], Falconside, and others).

Darnley is portrayed as seeking the Scottish crown to free his mother from Elizabeth I's captivity in the Tower of London. The novel covers Darnley's life from 1563 until his death in 1567, during which he lived at Elizabeth's court and then Mary's.\n* [[Jack Lowden]] played Darnley in the 2018 film ''[[Mary Queen of Scots (2018 film)|Mary Queen of Scots]]''.

His youthful character is captured somewhat in a letter of March 1554 to [[Mary I of England]] from Temple Newsam, where he writes about making a map, the ''Utopia Nova'', and his wish that \"every haire in my heade for to be a wourthy souldiour\".<ref>Ellis, Henry, ed., ''Original Letters illustrative of British History,'' 2nd series vol. 2, (1827) pp. 249\u2013251</ref>\n\n==Lennox Crisis==\nThe Lennox Crisis (1558\u20131563) was a political dilemma in England that arose from the dynastic ambition of the Lennoxes: Matthew Stewart, the 4th Earl of Lennox, was third in line to the Scottish throne, and his wife [[Margaret Douglas]], the Countess of Lennox, was a niece of Henry VIII (Henry's sister Margaret Tudor's daughter) and granddaughter of Henry VII, making her second in line to the English throne after Mary Queen of Scots, and her son Darnley after her, should Elizabeth not have been able to accede to or hold the throne for some reason.<ref name=\"Macauley, 2004, 267\">Macauley, (2004), p. 267</ref> The Lennox family represented an alternative line of succession to the English throne through Margaret Tudor, should Henry's heirs not have been able to hold it for the time they did. As [[Roman Catholic]]s, they posed a threat to [[Protestant]] England,<ref name=\"Macauley, 2004, 267\"/> especially in 1558, as the 25-year-old Queen Elizabeth took the throne. Although Elizabeth was bright, witty, and well-educated for her position, as a female she had to prove herself. Many Roman Catholics would have liked to have seen the next in line, the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, take the throne, as they regarded Elizabeth as illegitimate, her parents' marriage not having been recognised by the Catholic Church. And many would have preferred Darnley, as a male, to have the throne as well. All of these interrelationships made for complex intrigues, spying, strategising and manoeuvering for power at the various courts.\n\nWhen [[Henry II of France]] died in July 1559, Lennox's brother John, 5th [[Duke of Aubigny|Sieur d'Aubigny]], was elevated in the French court as kinsman of the new French queen, Mary, already Queen of Scots. Aubigny arranged for Darnley to be dispatched to the French court to congratulate Mary and [[Francis II of France]] on their accession and seek restoration for Lennox. Mary did not restore Lennox to his Scottish earldom, but she did give 1,000 crowns to Darnley and invited him to her coronation.<ref>Macauley, (2004), p. 268</ref> Lennox's plan was to appeal directly to the Queen of Scots via her ambassador, over the heads of Elizabeth and the [[House of Guise|Guise]]. The mission of Lennox's agent, one Nesbit, appears to have been a desperate one; not only was Lennox willing to hand over Darnley and his brother Charles as hostages for his restoration, but he supplied pedigrees of Darnley, indicating his right to the inheritance of England and Scotland and the houses of Hamilton and Douglas.<ref>Macauley, (2004), pp. 268\u2013269</ref> Aubigny was also later accused of supporting Mary's title to the throne of England and hinting that even his nephew had a stronger claim than Elizabeth.\n\nLennox set Nesbit to watch Mary, Darnley and Darnley's tutor, John Elder. In 1559 [[Nicholas Throckmorton]], the English ambassador in Paris, warned Elizabeth that Elder was \"as dangerous for the matters of England as any he knew.\"<ref>''Calendar State Papers Foreign Elizabeth'', vol. 1</ref>\n\nLord Darnley was the next claimant to the English throne, after the Queen of Scots, and his aging mother, and as a male, English-born Catholic, he was preferred by Elizabeth's enemies. [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|Paget]] in March 1560 wrote of 'well founded' fear that Catholics would raise Darnley to the throne on Elizabeth's death.<ref>The Lennox Crisis, 1558\u20131563; Sarah Macauley, Christ's College, Cambridge. Northern History, XLI: 2, Sept. 2004, p.276</ref>\n\nBy the summer of that year, Elizabeth's position was considerably strengthened.<ref>Macauley, (2004), p. 276</ref> [[Francis Yaxley]] was one notable spy. A Catholic, Yaxley had been a clerk of the Signet and had been employed by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] since 1549, travelling in France for him.<ref>HMC ''Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury'', vol. 1 (1883), pp. 74, 118, 121, 147; vol. 2 (1888), p. 509: ''CSP Domestic 1547\u20131580'', (1856), p. 90, 16 March 1557</ref> Yaxley had placed Mabel Fortescue and other ladies as servants in the Lennox household at Settrington in November 1560.<ref>''CSP Domestic 1547\u20131580'', (1856), pp. 164, 171, 177</ref> Yaxley had been employed by the Countess of Lennox; his interrogation at the [[Tower of London]] in February 1562 revealed that he had obtained intelligence about the English Court from the Spanish ambassador, and the ambassador had entrusted him and Hugh Allen with messages and tokens for the Lennoxes and Darnley. Yaxley admitted that his missions were intended to arrange the marriage of the Queen of Scots with Darnley, that Darnley's religion guaranteed him greater success in his suit than the [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|Earl of Arran]], and that the countess had many friends \"in the nurth\".<ref>Macauley, (2004), p. 284: ''CSP Domestic 1547\u20131580'', (1856), p. 195</ref> Although the Lennox threat never died out, Elizabeth did not convict the family of treason in 1562 after their arrest nor did she encourage steps made to annul the countess's claim to her throne for inquiring into her legitimacy. Perhaps, as has been suggested, Elizabeth feared that these investigations could also be directed at herself, or her inaction was intended merely to ensure the survival of the monarchy by not reducing the number of potential heirs. The Lennox family were released in February 1563, and within a few months, Darnley and his mother were conspicuous by their presence at Court and the favour they received there, although Elizabeth would not accommodate the earl at Court.<ref name=\"Macauley, 2004, 287\">Macauley, (2004), p. 287</ref>\n\nSarah Macauley notes three outcomes of the court's final decision of the Lennox trial:<blockquote>\"Their elevation at Court was, as it turned out in 1563, a useful complication in the succession issue. First, it presented a public statement that the preferences of Parliament (the claim of Catherine Grey in the succession crisis) could not dictate her own policy. Secondly, favouring the Lennoxes could serve as some kind of appeasement of the English Roman Catholics, who, like the Spanish ambassador, might foresee Elizabeth naming Darnley as her successor ... Such speculation would also distract them from favouring the more alarming claim of the Queen of Scots ... Thirdly, and most significantly, the elevation of the Lennoxes presented an obstacle between the Queen of Scots and the English throne. Thus was Darnley's uniquely 'British' inheritance put to use at last ... The subsequent release of Darnley into Scotland and the restoration of his father at the Scottish Court were part of this policy: the political disaster of the Darnley marriage as yet unforeseen.\"<ref>Macauley, Sarah.

From then on, he was constantly in Mary's company.<ref name=Greig />\n\nDarnley was his wife's half-first cousin through two different marriages of their grandmother, [[Margaret Tudor]], putting both Mary and Darnley high in the line of succession for the English throne. Darnley was also a descendant of a daughter of [[James II of Scotland]], and so also in line for the throne of Scotland.\n\nAs a preliminary to the marriage, Darnley was made Lord of Ardmanoch and [[Earl of Ross]] at [[Stirling Castle]] on 15 May 1565. An entourage of 15 men were made knights, including one of Mary's half brothers, Sir [[Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney|Robert Stewart of Strathdon]], [[Robert Drummond of Carnock]], and James Stewart of [[Doune Castle]].<ref>Goodare, Julian, 'Queen Mary's Catholic Interlude', in ''Mary Stewart Queen in Three Kingdoms: Innes Review'', vol.37 (1987), p.158: ''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), p. 161 no.181:</ref> In England, a concerned [[Privy council]] debated the perils of the intended marriage on 4 June 1565.

A proclamation was made at the [[Mercat cross|Cross]] of Edinburgh on 28 July that government would be in the joint names of the king and queen of Scots, thus giving Darnley equality with, and precedence over, Mary.

Mary soon became pregnant.\n\nMary's private secretary, [[David Rizzio]], was stabbed 56 times on 9 March 1566 by Darnley and his confederates, Protestant Scottish nobles, in the presence of the queen, who was six months pregnant. According to English diplomats [[Thomas Randolph (diplomat)|Thomas Randolph]] and the [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], the murder of Rizzio (who was rumoured to be the father of Mary's unborn child) was part of Darnley's bid to force Mary to cede the Crown Matrimonial.

These explosions were later attributed to two barrels of gunpowder that had been placed in the small room under Darnley's sleeping quarters. Darnley's body and the body of his valet William Taylor were found outside, surrounded by a cloak, a dagger, a chair, and a coat. Darnley was dressed only in his nightshirt, suggesting he had fled in some haste from his bedchamber.\n\nDarnley was apparently smothered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weir|2008|p=296}}; {{Harvnb|Wormald|1988|p=161}}</ref> There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weir|2008|p=252}}; {{Harvnb|Greig|2004}}</ref> A post-mortem revealed internal injuries, thought to have been caused by the explosion.

Bothwell had long been suspected of having designs on the throne, and his close relationship with the queen gave rise to rumours they were sexually intimate. This was viewed as a motive for Bothwell to have Darnley murdered, with help from some of the nobility and seemingly with royal approval. Mary had been looking at options for removing Darnley, though her ideas were for divorce, and none were suitable.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nSoon after Darnley's death, Bothwell and Mary left Edinburgh together. There are two points of view about the circumstances: in the first, Bothwell kidnapped the queen, took her to [[Dunbar Castle]], and raped her. In the second, Mary was a willing participant in the kidnapping, and the story of rape was a fabrication, so her honour and reputation were not ruined by her marriage to a man widely suspected of murder. Mary later miscarried twins by Bothwell.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nSuspicions that Mary colluded with conspirators in her husband's death or that she took no action to prevent his death were key factors in the downward spiral that led to her loss of the Scottish crown. The [[Casket letters]], alleged to have been written by Mary, seemed to indicate her support for the killing. The letters were purportedly found by [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton]] in Edinburgh in a silver box engraved with an F (supposedly for Francis II), along with a number of other documents, including the Mary-Bothwell marriage certificate.<ref name=\"MacRobert\">{{cite book|last=MacRobert|first=A.

The investiture was performed after the celebration of mass in the Chapel-Royal}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n* [[Douglas Walton (actor)|Douglas Walton]] played the part of Lord Darnley in the 1936 film ''[[Mary of Scotland (film)|Mary of Scotland]]'', directed by [[John Ford]] and starring [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Fredric March]].\n* [[Axel von Ambesser]] played the part of Lord Darnley in the 1940 film ''[[Das Herz der K\u00f6nigin]]''.\n* [[Timothy Dalton]] played the part of Darnley in the 1971 film ''[[Mary, Queen of Scots (1971 film)|Mary, Queen of Scots]]'', starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]]. Darnley is portrayed as a snivelling, pathetic character who marries Mary as part of a plot by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] ([[Glenda Jackson]]) to weaken Mary's claim to the English throne. Dalton portrays Darnley as a pampered, spoiled man who beds the Queen's advisor, [[David Rizzio]] ([[Ian Holm]]), but later falls out with Rizzio and has him murdered by other plotters (referred to in the film as the Lords of the Congregation). Darnley then mourns the death of his former lover. A plot to murder Darnley is later planned and carried out by [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Lord Bothwell]] ([[Nigel Davenport]]), Mary's illegitimate half-brother [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Lord Moray]] ([[Patrick McGoohan]]), and the various Scottish Lords who participated in the murder of Rizzio ([[George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly|Huntly]], [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Morton]], Falconside, and others). The plot is depicted in the film as having Mary's tacit approval.\n* Rizzio's murder at Holyroodhouse is also a crucial plot point in ''[[The Italian Secretary]]'', a [[Sherlock Holmes]]-[[pastiche]] by [[Caleb Carr]].\n* The years of Darnley's marriage to Mary, including the murder of David Rizzio and Darnley's subsequent suspicious death, are covered in Jesse Blackadder's historical novel, ''The Raven's Heart,'' HarperCollins (Australia) Pty (2011)\n* On the highly fictionalized CW television show ''[[Reign (TV series)|Reign]]'', which first aired on 13 October 2013, [[Will Kemp (actor, born 1977)|Will Kemp]] played the part of Lord Darnley. His version of the character is arrogant, manipulative, and hot-headed with ambitions for the crowns of both Scotland and England. His ambitions are complicated, however, by latent affection for a past love and Mary's distrust of him.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2710394/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast</ref>\n* Darnley is the protagonist of Steven Veerapen's novel, ''The Queen\u2019s Consort'' (Sharpe Books, 2018). Darnley is portrayed as seeking the Scottish crown to free his mother from Elizabeth I's captivity in the Tower of London. The novel covers Darnley's life from 1563 until his death in 1567, during which he lived at Elizabeth's court and then Mary's.\n* [[Jack Lowden]] played Darnley in the 2018 film ''[[Mary Queen of Scots (2018 film)|Mary Queen of Scots]]''. Closely following the 1971 film, Darnley is shown as weak, alcoholic, and homosexual; as in the earlier film, he has sex with the Queen's advisor, [[David Rizzio]] ([[Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova]]).\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|1= '''Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley'''\n|2= [[Matthew Stuart, 4th Earl of Lennox]]\n|3= [[Margaret Douglas]]\n|4= [[John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox]]\n|5= Elizabeth Stewart\n|6= [[Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus]]\n|7= [[Margaret Tudor]]\n|8= [[Matthew Stewart, 2nd Earl of Lennox]]\n|9= Elizabeth Hamilton\n|10=[[John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl]]\n|11=Eleanor Sinclair\n|12=[[George Douglas, Master of Angus]]\n|13=Elizabeth Drummond\n|14=[[Henry VII of England]]\n|15=[[Elizabeth of York]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{commons category}}\n* ''Darnley: A Life of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, Consort of Mary Queen of Scots'' by Caroline Bingham\n* [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/nhi/2004/00000041/00000002/art00005 Macauley, Sarah, 'Lennox Crisis', in ''Northern History'' vol.41.2 (2004)] subscription or ATHENS login required.\n* {{cite encyclopedia|last=Greig|first=Elaine Finnie|title=Stewart, Henry, duke of Albany <nowiki>[</nowiki>Lord Darnley<nowiki>]</nowiki> (1545/6\u20131567)|volume=1|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/26/101026473/|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/26473|accessdate=3 March 2012|ref=harv}} {{ODNBsub}}\n* {{cite book|last=Weir|first=Alison|authorlink=Alison Weir|year=2008|origyear=2003|title=Mary, Queen of Scots and the Murder of Lord Darnley|publisher=Random House|location=London|isbn=978-0-09-952707-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Wormald|first=Jenny|authorlink=Jenny Wormald|year=1988|title=Mary, Queen of Scots|publisher=George Philip|location=London|isbn=978-0-540-01131-5|ref=harv}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-roy|sc}}\n|-\n{{S-vac|last=[[Francis II of France]]}}\n{{S-ttl|title=[[List of Scottish consorts|King consort of Scots]]|years=1565\u20131567}}\n{{S-vac|next=[[Anne of Denmark]]}}\n{{S-reg|sct}}\n{{S-new|creation}}\n{{S-ttl|title=[[Duke of Albany]]|creation=4th creation|years=1565\u20131567}}\n{{S-aft|after=[[James VI and I|James Stuart]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Scottish consort}}\n{{Dukes of Albany}}\n{{Earls of Ross}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darnley, Henry Stuart, Lord}}\n[[Category:House of Stewart of Darnley|Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]]\n[[Category:Kings consort]]\n[[Category:English people of Scottish descent]]\n[[Category:Dukes of Albany]]\n[[Category:Earls of Ross]]\n[[Category:Peers created by Mary, Queen of Scots]]\n[[Category:People from Leeds]]\n[[Category:Murdered royalty]]\n[[Category:Scottish murderers]]\n[[Category:Scottish murder victims]]\n[[Category:1545 births]]\n[[Category:1567 deaths]]\n[[Category:Assassinated royalty]]\n[[Category:People murdered in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Jure uxoris kings]]\n[[Category:Knights of the Order of Saint Michael]]\n[[Category:Burials at Holyrood Abbey]]\n[[Category:Court of Mary, Queen of Scots]]\n[[Category:16th-century Scottish peers]]\n", "name_user": "Deb", "label": "safe", "comment": "punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stuart,_Lord_Darnley"}

Rishabh is not convinced with the idea of marriage.\n\nWhen Preeta convinces Rishabh, he agrees to marry Sherlyn Khurana in an apparent misunderstanding, assuming it to be Preeta. Sherlyn realises Rishabh's affections and vows to get Preeta out of her life. After Rishabh and Sherlyn get engaged, Preeta realises Sherlyn isn't the girl everyone thinks. She finds out Sherlyn has a boyfriend and confieds her doubts to Karan.\n\nAt first, Karan belittles and calls Preeta gold digger, but because the matter is in regards to Rishabh, he checks for evidence himself and is convinced of Sherlyn's affair. Karan and Preeta join forces in there mission to save Rishabh from Sherlyn and their alliance slowly blossoms into friendship.\n\nPreeta's engagement gets fixed with Sherlyn's boyfriend Prithvi Malhotra. Karan and Rishabh are both uneasy with Prithvi and soon realises that he isn't right for her. Karan and Preeta try innumerable times to get evidence against Sherlyn furthermore. He and Rishabh try to convince Preeta and her family about Prithvi. \n\nHowever, despite all the efforts by Preeta at Rishabh and Sherlyn's wedding to actually stop it from happening, Rishabh and Sherlyn get married. Karan had vowed that the matter would get personal and would take his revenge personally if Rishabh's life was ruined by Preeta. He fulfils his end of the bargain. He humiliatingly drags Preeta out of the Luthra house after Rishabh's wedding.\n\nAt Preeta's wedding day with Prithvi, Karan does a groom swap and marries her without her knowledge. He convinces her and her entire family that his reason for marrying Preeta was love. It is revealed Karan married Preeto just for taking revenge as he believes Preeta betrayed him by joining hands with Sherlyn. He leaves Preeta after the wedding. \n\nAs per current track, Karan has shown a more sympathetic and supportive side to Preeta and family, but despite being married to her, he has gotten engaged to Mahira Khanna and neither apologised to Preeta nor made any attempts to stop his own second wedding.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Shraddha Arya]] as Dr. Preeta Karan Luthra : Sarla and Raghuveer's daughter; Pragya, Bulbul and Srishti's sister; Karan\u2019s wife (2017\u2013present)\n* [[Dheeraj Dhoopar]] as Karan Luthra: Rakhi and Mahesh's son; Rishabh's brother; Preeta\u2019s husband (2017\u2013present)\n* [[Manit Joura]] as Rishabh Luthra: Rakhi and Mahesh's son; Karan's brother, Sherlyn\u2019s husband (2017\u2013present)\n* [[Anjum Fakih]] as Srishti Arora: Sarla and Raghuveer's daughter; Pragya, Bulbul and Preeta's sister (2017\u2013present)\n* [[Abhishek Kapur]] as Sameer Luthra: Rishabh and Karan's cousin (2017-present)\n* [[Ruhi Chaturvedi]] as Sherlyn Rishabh Luthra: Rishabh\u2019s wife (2017-present)\n\n===Recurring===\n*[[Sanjay Gagnani]] as Prithvi Malhotra, Preeta\u2019s former fianc\u00e9  (2017\u20132019)\n* Madhu Raja as Daljeet Arora: Matriarch of Arora family; Raghuveer's mother; Pragya, Bulbul, Preeta and Srishti's grandmother (2017\u2013present)\n*[[Supriya Shukla]] as Sarla Arora: Raghuveer's wife; Pragya, Bulbul, Preeta and Srishti's mother (2017\u2013present)\n*Jasjeet Babbar as Janki Aunty (2017\u2013present)\n*Twinkle R Vashisht as Kritika Luthra: Kareena\u2019s daughter, Karan and Rishabh\u2019s cousin (2017\u2013present)\n*[[Neelam Mehra]] as Bani Luthra (2017\u2013present)\n*Anisha Hinduja as Rakhi Luthra: Mahesh's wife; Karan and Rishabh's mother (2017\u2013present)\n*[[Naveen Saini]] as Mahesh Luthra: Rakhi's husband; Karan and Rishabh's father (2017\u2013present)\n*[[Pyumori Mehta Ghosh]]/[[Usha Bachani]] as Kareena Luthra (2017\u2013present)\n* Merry Singh as Ruchika Luthra: Mahesh and Rakhi's daughter, Rishabh and Karan's sister (2017\u20132018)\n*[[Sriti Jha]] as Pragya Mehra (2017\u20132018)\n*[[Shabbir Ahluwalia]] as Abhishek Mehra (2017\u20132018)\n*[[Vin Rana]] as Purab Khanna (2017)\n*[[Ruchi Savarn]] as Disha Jha (2017)\n*[[Shikha Singh]] as Aliya Mehra (2017)\n*[[Leena Jumani]] as Tanushree Mehta (2017)\n*[[Mahira Sharma]] as Monisha Sharma, Karan's former fianc\u00e9 (2018\u20132019)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zeetv.zee5.com/5-best-scenes-of-mahira-sharma-with-dheeraj-dhoopar-in-the-serial-kundali-bhagya/|title=5 Best Scenes Of Mahira Sharma With Dheeraj Dhoopar In The Serial Kundali Bhagya|website=Zee TV|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n*[[Swati Kapoor]] as Mahira Khanna (2019-present)\n*Akshay Raj Jawrani as Shiv (2019\u2013present)\n\n===Guests===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#ffaa44\"\n!
