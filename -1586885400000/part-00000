The Chiefs then went three-and-out on their first drive, with tight end [[Travis Kelce]] dropping a potential first down pass on third down. [[Dustin Colquitt]]\u2019s ensuing punt was blocked by [[Barkevious Mingo]] and recovered by [[Lonnie Johnson Jr.]], who returned it 10 yards for a touchdown that put the Texans up 14\u20130 less than five minutes into the game.\n\nAfter both teams punted on their next drives, Chiefs returner [[Tyreek Hill]] muffed the ball inside his own 10-yard line which was recovered by [[Keion Crossen]] for Houston. Two plays later, Watson found tight end [[Darren Fells]] in the end zone for a 4-yard touchdown and a 21\u20130 lead late in the first quarter.\n\nThe next time Houston got the ball, they drove 48 yards in nine plays to a fourth-and-inches on the Chiefs 13-yard line. Rather than risk a conversion, the Texans settled for [[Ka'imi Fairbairn]]'s 31-yard field goal to go up by 24 four minutes into the second quarter. However, this would be the extent of their success, as they went on to be outscored 51\u20137 for the rest of the game. First, [[Mecole Hardman]] returned the ensuing kickoff 58 yards to Houston's 42-yard line. [[Patrick Mahomes]] then threw a 25-yard pass to Kelce to get in the red zone before hitting running back [[Damien Williams]] for a 17-yard touchdown. After Houston went three-and-out on their next drive, they attempted a fake punt on fourth-and-4 with a direct snap to [[Justin Reid]] who was tackled by [[Daniel Sorensen]] two yards short, giving Kansas City the ball at the Texans 33. Johnson was then called for pass interference to put the ball at the five before Mahomes hit Kelce in the end zone to cut the deficit to 10. On the ensuing kickoff, [[DeAndre Carter]] fumbled the ball due to a hit by Sorenson, and it went right into the arms of Kansas City's [[Darwin Thompson]], who returned it to the Houston 6-yard line. Mahomes then threw his third touchdown pass in less than four minutes, and his second to Kelce, to make the score 24\u201321.\n\nTaking possession at their own 10 with 2:47 left in the quarter, the Chiefs went on a 90-yard drive that included another pass interference on Johnson, while Mahomes rushed twice for 35 yards and completed a pair of 20-yard passes to Hill and Kelce. Finally, with 44 seconds left in the half, Mahomes threw another five-yard touchdown to Kelce to give the Chiefs their first lead of the game, 28\u201324. Mahomes\u2019 four touchdown passes in the second quarter tied an NFL postseason record set by [[Doug Williams (quarterback)|Doug Williams]] in [[Super Bowl XXII]]. Fairbairn missed a 51-yard field goal as time expired in the half as the Chiefs became the first team in NFL history to fall behind by as many as 20 points in the first half but still lead at halftime.\n\nThe Chiefs would extend their lead on the opening possession of the third quarter, going 85 yards in seven plays, the longest a 48-yard catch by [[Sammy Watkins]]. Williams ran the ball in from the goal-line, increasing their lead to 34\u201324 after [[Harrison Butker]] missed the extra point. After forcing another Texans punt, the Chiefs took advantage of another pass interference penalty against Houston and a 28-yard completion from Mahomes to Kelce, scoring on their sixth straight possession with another Williams touchdown run to give them a 41\u201324 lead with 4:39 left in the quarter. Houston finally snapped Kansas City's 41-point run when Watson completed 4 passes for 80 yards and finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown run, making the score 41\u201331 with 24 seconds left in the third quarter.\n\nKansas City would make it seven touchdowns in a row, setting a new postseason record, on a drive that included a 23-yard pass to Kelce and a 28-yard completion to Watkins, putting the ball at the Houston 8. Mahomes then found [[Blake Bell]] in the end zone, making the score 48\u201331. On Houston's next drive, they turned the ball over on downs at the Chiefs 42. A pair of runs by Williams for gains of 11 and 26 yard to set up Butker's 24-yard field goal with 8:06 left to put Kansas City up by 20. Houston then turned the ball over on downs on their final two possessions, the last coming when [[Frank Clark (American football)|Frank Clark]] sacked Watson for a 17-yard loss on fourth-and-8 from the Kansas City 8-yard line. \n\nMahomes finished the game 23/35 for 321 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions. He was also the leading rusher with 53 yards on seven carries. Kelce had 10 catches for 134 yards and three touchdowns, tying a Super Bowl-era postseason record. Hardman had six kickoff returns for 142 yards. Williams rushed for 47 yards, caught two passes for 21 yards, and scored three touchdowns. Watson threw for 388 yards and two touchdowns, while [[DeAndre Hopkins]] had 118 yards on nine catches.

Later in the quarter, Seattle receiver [[David Moore (American football)|David Moore]]'s 10-yard punt return gave the Seahawks a first down on their own 42. [[Russell Wilson]]'s subsequent 28-yard completion to [[Tyler Lockett]] set up a 45-yard field goal by [[Jason Myers]] that made the score 7\u20133.\n\nRodgers then completed 4/5 passes for 52 yards on a nine-play, 75-yard drive. Jones finished it off with a 1-yard touchdown run to give Green Bay a 14\u20133 lead in the second quarter. Then, after Myers missed a 50-yard field goal attempt, the Packers got the ball on their own 40. Receiver [[Tyler Ervin]] opened the drive with an 18-yard run on an end around play. Nine plays later, Jones finished the drive with his second 1-yard touchdown run, increasing Green Bay's lead to 21\u20133 with 1:30 left in the half.\n\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Wilson ran for a 24-yard gain and completed a 24-yard pass to [[DK Metcalf]] as the Seahawks drove 69 yards in 10 plays to score on [[Marshawn Lynch]]'s 1-yard touchdown run, cutting their deficit to 21\u201310. However, Green Bay stormed right back in just five plays, as Rodgers completed a 27-yard pass to tight end [[Jimmy Graham]] before throwing the ball to Adams for a 40-yard score, putting them back up at 28\u201310. Seattle responded with Wilson completing 5/6 passes for 48 yards and rushing four times for 26 on the way to a 28\u201317 score on his 7-yard touchdown pass to Lockett with 39 seconds left in the quarter.\n\nAfter a Green Bay punt, Wilson completed four consecutive passes for 68 yards on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by Lynch, making the score 28\u201323 after a failed two-point conversion try. But the next time they got the ball, Seattle had to punt with 2:41 left on the clock. Green Bay was able to run out the time with their ensuing possession, picking up two key first downs on third down completions. When faced with third-and-8 after two plays, Rodgers completed a 32-yard pass to Adams. Then when faced with third-and-9, Rodgers' 9-yard pass to Graham picked a first down that enabled the team to run out the rest of the clock.\n\nRodgers completed 16/27 passes for 243 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 14 yards. Adams caught eight passes for 160 yards and two scores. Green Bay defensive ends [[Za'Darius Smith]] and [[Preston Smith (linebacker)|Preston Smith]] each had two sacks.

Gould finished the drive with a 27-yard field goal, increasing the team's lead to 20\u20130 after the two minute warning. Then Rodgers threw a pass that was intercepted by [[Emmanuel Moseley]], who returned it 9 yards to the Green Bay 30-yard line. Mostert then took the ball to the end zone with three straight carries, the last an 18-yard touchdown run that gave San Francisco a 27\u20130 lead with 16 seconds left in the second quarter.\n\nGreen Bay managed to cut the score to 27\u20137 on the opening drive of the second half, moving the ball 80 yards in 11 plays. Rogers completed 9/10 passes for 75 yards on the drive, the last a 9-yard touchdown throw to Aaron Jones. But the 49ers stormed right back, with a pair of runs by Samuel for gains of 11 and 32 yards aiding a seven-play, 79-yard drive that ended on Mostert's 22-yard touchdown run. This gave the 49ers a 34\u20137 lead with five minutes left in the third quarter. Green Bay responded by going 80 yards in 10 plays, including Rodgers' 4-yard pass to [[Allen Lazard]] on fourth-and-2, and a 42-yard completion from Rodgers to tight end [[Jimmy Graham]]. On the next play, Jones ran for a touchdown that made the score 34\u201313 after a failed two-point conversion attempt. Then after a punt, Rodgers completed a 65-yard pass to [[Davante Adams]] on the 49ers 22-yard line. Three plays later, his 8-yard touchdown pass to [[Jace Sternberger]] made the score 34\u201320 with just under six minutes left in the game. However, San Francisco crushed any hope of a comeback with their ensuing 10-play, 44-yard drive, starting with Garoppolo's 19-yard completion to [[George Kittle]]. Gould completed the scoring with a 42-yard field goal to put the 49ers up 37\u201320 with 3:36 to play, before Richard Sherman intercepted a pass from Rodgers that enabled San Francisco to run out the rest of the clock and earn the franchise's seventh trip to the Super Bowl.\n\nMostert had 29 carries for 220 yards and four touchdowns, along with two receptions for 9 yards. Garoppolo set an NFC championship record for fewest pass attempts, completing 6/8 passes for 77 yards. Williams had seven solo tackles and a sack. Rodgers completed 31/39 passes for 326 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. Adams had nine receptions for 138 yards.\n\n==Super Bowl LIV: Kansas City Chiefs 31, San Francisco 49ers 20==\n{{main article|Super Bowl LIV}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle=text-align:center; {{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\n|title=Super Bowl LIV&nbsp;\u2013 San Francisco 49ers vs. Kansas City Chiefs&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=February 2, 2020\n|time=3:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]/5:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CST]]/6:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|road=49ers\n|R1=3|R2=7|R3=10|R4=0\n|home='''Chiefs'''\n|H1=7|H2=3|H3=0|H4=21\n|stadium=[[Hard Rock Stadium]], [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]\n|attendance=62,417\n|weather={{convert|64|F|C}}\n|referee=Bill Vinovich (52)\n|TV=[[Fox NFL|Fox]]\n|TVAnnouncers=Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, Erin Andrews, Chris Myers, Mike Pereira and [[Dean Blandino]]\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2020020200/2019/POST22/49ers@chiefs Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/58167/KC_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*SF \u2013 [[Robbie Gould]] 38-yard field goal, 7:57.

The Chiefs then went three-and-out on their first drive, with tight end [[Travis Kelce]] dropping a potential first down pass on third down. [[Dustin Colquitt]]\u2019s ensuing punt was blocked by [[Barkevious Mingo]] and recovered by [[Lonnie Johnson Jr.]], who returned it 10 yards for a touchdown that put the Texans up 14\u20130 less than five minutes into the game.\n\nAfter both teams punted on their next drives, Chiefs returner [[Tyreek Hill]] muffed the ball inside his own 10-yard line which was recovered by [[Keion Crossen]] for Houston. Two plays later, Watson found tight end [[Darren Fells]] in the end zone for a 4-yard touchdown and a 21\u20130 lead late in the first quarter.\n\nThe next time Houston got the ball, they drove 48 yards in nine plays to a fourth-and-inches on the Chiefs 13-yard line. Rather then risk a conversion, the Texans settled for [[Ka'imi Fairbairn]]'s 31-yard field goal to go up by 24 four minutes into the second quarter. However, this would be the extent of their success, as they went on to be outscored 51\u20137 for the rest of the game. First, [[Mecole Hardman]] returned the ensuing kickoff 58 yards to Houston\u2019s 42-yard line. [[Patrick Mahomes]] then threw a 25-yard pass to Kelce to get in the red zone before hitting running back [[Damien Williams]] for a 17-yard touchdown. After Houston went three-and-out on their next drive, they attempted a fake punt on fourth-and-4 with a direct snap to [[Justin Reid]] who was tackled by [[Daniel Sorensen]] two yards short, giving Kansas City the ball at the Texans 33. Johnson was then called for pass interference to put the ball at the five before Mahomes hit Kelce in the end zone to cut the deficit to 10. On the ensuing kickoff, [[DeAndre Carter]] fumbled the ball due to a hit by Sorenson, and it went right into the arms of Kansas City's [[Darwin Thompson]], who returned it to the Houston 6-yard line. Mahomes then threw his third touchdown pass in less than four minutes, and his second to Kelce, to make the score 24\u201321.\n\nTaking possession at their own 10 with 2:47 left in the quarter, the Chiefs went on a 90-yard drive that included another pass interference on Johnson, while Mahomes rushed twice for 35 yards and completed a pair of 20-yard passes to Hill and Kelce. Finally, with 44 seconds left in the half, Mahomes threw another five-yard touchdown to Kelce to give the Chiefs their first lead of the game, 28\u201324. Mahomes\u2019 four touchdown passes in the second quarter tied an NFL postseason record set by [[Doug Williams (quarterback)|Doug Williams]] in [[Super Bowl XXII]]. Fairbairn missed a 51-yard field goal as time expired in the half as the Chiefs became the first team in NFL history to fall behind by as many as 20 points in the first half but still lead at halftime.\n\nThe Chiefs would extend their lead on the opening possession of the third quarter, going 85 yards in seven plays, the longest a 48-yard catch by [[Sammy Watkins]]. Williams ran the ball in from the goal-line, increasing their lead to 34\u201324 after [[Harrison Butker]] missed the extra point. After forcing another Texans punt, the Chiefs took advantage of another pass interference penalty against Houston and a 28-yard completion from Mahomes to Kelce, scoring on their sixth straight possession with another Williams touchdown run to give them a 41\u201324 lead with 4:39 left in the quarter. Houston finally snapped Kansas City\u2019s 41-point run when Watson completed 4 passes for 80 yards and finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown run, making the score 41\u201331 with 24 seconds left in the third quarter.\n\nKansas City would make it seven touchdowns in a row, setting a new postseason record, on a drive that included a 23-yard pass to Kelce and a 28-yard completion to Watkins, putting the ball at the Houston 8. Mahomes then found [[Blake Bell]] in the end zone, making the score 48\u201331. On Houston's next drive, they turned the ball over on downs at the Chiefs 42. A pair of runs by Williams for gains of 11 and 26 yard to set up Butker's 24-yard field goal with 8:06 left to put Kansas City up by 20. Houston then turned the ball over on downs on their final two possessions, the last coming when [[Frank Clark (American football)|Frank Clark]] sacked Watson for a 17-yard loss on fourth-and-8 from the Kansas City 8-yard line. \n\nMahomes finished the game 23/35 for 321 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions. He was also the leading rusher with 53 yards on seven carries. Kelce had 10 catches for 134 yards and three touchdowns, tying a Super Bowl-era postseason record. Hardman had six kickoff returns for 142 yards. Williams rushed for 47 yards, caught two passes for 21 yards, and scored three touchdowns. Watson threw for 388 yards and two touchdowns, while [[DeAndre Hopkins]] had 118 yards on nine catches.

Later in the quarter, Seattle receiver [[David Moore (American football)|David Moore]]'s 10-yard punt return gave the Seahawks a first down on their own 42. [[Russell Wilson]]'s subsequent 28-yard completion to [[Tyler Lockett]] set up a 45-yard field goal by [[Jason Myers]] that made the score 7\u20133.\n\nRodgers then completed 4/5 passes for 52 yards on a nine-play, 75-yard drive. Jones finished it off with a 1-yard touchdown run to give Green Bay a 14\u20133 lead in the second quarter. Then, after Myers missed a 50-yard field goal attempt, the Packers got the ball on their own 40. Receiver [[Tyler Ervin]] opened the drive with an 18-yard run on an end around play. Nine plays later, Jones finished the drive with his second 1-yard touchdown run, increasing Green Bay's lead to 21\u20133 with 1:30 left in the half.\n\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Wilson ran for a 24-yard gain and completed a 24-yard pass to [[DK Metcalf]] as the Seahawks drove 69 yards in 10 plays to score on [[Marshawn Lynch]]'s 1-yard touchdown run, cutting their deficit to 21\u201310. However, Green Bay stormed right back in just five plays, as Rodgers completed a 27-yard pass to tight end [[Jimmy Graham]] before throwing the ball to Adams for a 40-yard score, putting them back up at 28\u201310. Seattle responded with Wilson completing 5/6 passes for 48 yards and rushing four times for 26 on the way to a 28\u201317 score on his 7-yard touchdown pass to Lockett with 39 seconds left in the quarter.\n\nAfter a Green Bay punt, Wilson completed four consecutive passes for 68 yards on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by Lynch, making the score 28\u201323 after a failed two-point conversion try. But the next time they got the ball, Seattle had to punt with 2:41 left on the clock. Green Bay was able to run out the time with their ensuing possession, picking up two key first downs on third down completions. When faced with third-and-8 after two plays, Rodgers completed a 32-yard pass to Adams. Then when faced with third-and-9, Rodgers' 9-yard pass to Graham picked a first down that enabled the team to run out the rest of the clock.\n\nRodgers completed 16/27 passes for 243 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 14 yards. Adams caught eight passes for 160 yards and two scores. Green Bay defensive ends [[Za'Darius Smith]] and [[Preston Smith (linebacker)|Preston Smith]] each had two sacks.

The Packers responded with a drive to the 49ers 25-yard line, only to lose the ball when quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] fumbled a snap, which was recovered by San Francisco lineman [[DeForest Buckner]]. The 49ers went on to drive 60 yards in 8 plays, including a 34-yard burst from Mostert. Gould finished the drive with a 27-yard field goal, increasing the team's lead to 20\u20130 after the two minute warning. Then Rodgers threw a pass that was intercepted by [[Emmanuel Moseley]], who returned it 9 yards to the Green Bay 30-yard line. Mostert then took the ball to the end zone with three straight carries, the last an 18-yard touchdown run that gave San Francisco a 27\u20130 lead with 16 seconds left in the second quarter.\n\nGreen Bay managed to cut the score to 27\u20137 on the opening drive of the second half, moving the ball 80 yards in 11 plays. Rogers completed 9/10 passes for 75 yards on the drive, the last a 9-yard touchdown throw to Aaron Jones. But the 49ers stormed right back, with a pair of runs by Samuel for gains of 11 and 32 yards aiding a seven-play, 79-yard drive that ended on Mostert's 22-yard touchdown run. This gave the 49ers a 34\u20137 lead with five minutes left in the third quarter. Green Bay responded by going 80 yards in 10 plays, including Rodgers' 4-yard pass to [[Allen Lazard]] on fourth-and-2, and a 42-yard completion from Rodgers to tight end [[Jimmy Graham]]. On the next play, Jones ran for a touchdown that made the score 34\u201313 after a failed two-point conversion attempt. Then after a punt, Rodgers completed a 65-yard pass to [[Davante Adams]] on the 49ers 22-yard line. Three plays later, his 8-yard touchdown pass to [[Jace Sternberger]] made the score 34\u201320 with just under six minutes left in the game. However, San Francisco crushed any hope of a comeback with their ensuing 10-play, 44-yard drive, starting with Garoppolo's 19-yard completion to [[George Kittle]]. Gould completed the scoring with a 42-yard field goal to put the 49ers up 37\u201320 with 3:36 to play, before Richard Sherman intercepted a pass from Rodgers that enabled San Francisco to run out the rest of the clock and earn the franchise's seventh trip to the Super Bowl.\n\nMostert had 29 carries for 220 yards and four touchdowns, along with two receptions for 9 yards. Garoppolo set an NFC championship record for fewest pass attempts, completing 6/8 passes for 77 yards. Williams had seven solo tackles and a sack. Rodgers completed 31/39 passes for 326 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. Adams had nine receptions for 138 yards.\n\n==Super Bowl LIV: Kansas City Chiefs 31, San Francisco 49ers 20==\n{{main article|Super Bowl LIV}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle=text-align:center; {{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\n|title=Super Bowl LIV&nbsp;\u2013 San Francisco 49ers vs. Kansas City Chiefs&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=February 2, 2020\n|time=3:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]/5:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CST]]/6:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|road=49ers\n|R1=3|R2=7|R3=10|R4=0\n|home='''Chiefs'''\n|H1=7|H2=3|H3=0|H4=21\n|stadium=[[Hard Rock Stadium]], [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]\n|attendance=62,417\n|weather={{convert|64|F|C}}\n|referee=Bill Vinovich (52)\n|TV=[[Fox NFL|Fox]]\n|TVAnnouncers=Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, Erin Andrews, Chris Myers, Mike Pereira and [[Dean Blandino]]\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2020020200/2019/POST22/49ers@chiefs Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/58167/KC_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*SF \u2013 [[Robbie Gould]] 38-yard field goal, 7:57.

Z. Carr''' is a contemporary Canadian poet who resides in [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]]. A full member of the League of Canadian Poets and the Federation of BC Writers, Fern G. Z. Carr is the author of ''Shards of Crystal'' (Silver Bow Publishing, 2018).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1927616964/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1542292047&sr=8-1&keywords=Shards+of+Crystal+Fern+G.+Z.+Carr|title=Shards of Crystal: Amazon.ca: Fern G.

Retrieved on May 22, 2019.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and education==\nFern G. Z. Carr was born in 1956 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. Carr attended the [[University of Manitoba]] where she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) and her Bachelor of Laws degree (LLB). She received her Call to the Bar from the [[Law Society of Manitoba]]. After briefly practising law, Carr decided to pursue her interest in languages. She enrolled at le Coll\u00e8ge Universitaire de Saint-Boniface where she received her Certificat en \u00c9ducation and was the recipient of the Manitoba Government Book Prize for highest standing in her program.<ref>{{cite book |title=The University of Manitoba 104th Annual Convocation |date=1983}}</ref> She subsequently taught French Immersion before moving to [[Kelowna]] with her family in 1999. She is married and is the sister-in-law of [[James Gordon Carr]], Member of Parliament.\n\n==Writing style and influences==\nCarr's early poetry from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s is more representative of traditional meter and rhyme. She subsequently began to experiment with different forms and styles while continuing to compose traditional poetry in set forms such as [[pantoum]] and [[ghazal]]. An admirer of [[Emily Dickinson]], Carr liked the use of [[em dashes]] and often incorporated them into her poems. In the 2000s, Carr's poetry style became more eclectic as she experimented with design. This was particularly evident in her [[Visual poetry|visual]] and [[concrete poetry]] as well as in her experimental math / science poems such as \"The Fickle Nature of the Parabola\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=The Fickle Nature of the Parabola |journal=Windsor Review |date=Fall 2018 |volume=43 |issue=2 |page=128}}</ref> and \"Holocaust Genealogy\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=Holocaust Genealogy |journal=mgversion2 |date=July 2016 |volume=85 |page=84}}</ref> To date, her stylistic focus is [[free verse]].\n\nWhile Carr's poetry primarily is written in English, she also composes poems in [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Yiddish]] and the [[Chinese Mandarin]] dialect. Even though she occasionally translates the works of other poets, she tends to focus on bilingual and trilingual side-by-side translations of her own poetry.\n\nMany of Carr's poems were influenced by her early years in Winnipeg's West End where she bore witness to poverty and crime. While this darkness is evident in some of her poetry, she also composes poems which evoke a diverse array of human emotions.\n\n==''Shards of Crystal''==\n''Shards of Crystal'' reflects a dichotomy and as such, is described as a metamorphosis of darkness to light. Dealing with issues such as suicide, trauma, dementia, cruelty to animals, and the death of a child, the book then gradually changes course. It begins its transformative move towards the beauty of life with poems about musicality, spiritual liberation and the philosophy of existence. It culminates in a philosophical examination of mankind's place in the universe with Carr's signature poem, \"I Am\".<ref name=\"parl.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://bdp.parl.ca/About/Parliament/Poet/poem-selected-former-poet-laureate2-e.html?id=1&id4=254|title=The Parliamentary Poet Laureate|website=Bdp.parl.ca|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe imagery in ''Shards of Crystal'' parallels the darkness-to-light chronology of Carr's poems. This transition is essentially a redemptive move both literally and metaphorically, reconciling the pain of \"Shards\" at the outset of the book with the beauty and enlightenment of \"Crystal\" at the conclusion. Beginning with the darkness of night and becoming progressively lighter, her poems ultimately achieve the illumination of the eternal. This is in keeping with the overarching theme of hope as expressed by the Victor Hugo quote at the start of the book: \"Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hugo |first1=Victor |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables |date=1987 |publisher=Signet Classics |isbn=9780451525260 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/lesmisrablessign00vict }}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nCarr has been published extensively worldwide in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Cyprus, Finland, France, Holland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malawi, Mauritius, Mayotte Island, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Romania, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom (in England, Scotland and Wales) and USA.\n\nAdditionally, she has written literary non-fiction articles which have been published in The Federation of B.C.

Z. Carr''' is a contemporary Canadian poet who resides in [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]]. A full member of the League of Canadian Poets and the Federation of BC Writers, Fern G. Z. Carr is the author of ''Shards of Crystal'' (Silver Bow Publishing, 2018).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1927616964/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1542292047&sr=8-1&keywords=Shards+of+Crystal+Fern+G.+Z.+Carr|title=Shards of Crystal: Amazon.ca: Fern G.

She composes and translates poetry in six languages including Mandarin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferngzcarr.com/|title=Fern G. Z.

Retrieved on May 22, 2019.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and education==\nFern G. Z. Carr was born in 1956 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. Carr attended the [[University of Manitoba]] where she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) and her Bachelor of Laws degree (LLB). She received her Call to the Bar from the [[Law Society of Manitoba]]. After briefly practising law, Carr decided to pursue her interest in languages. She enrolled at le Coll\u00e8ge Universitaire de Saint-Boniface where she received her Certificat en \u00c9ducation and was the recipient of the Manitoba Government Book Prize for highest standing in her program.<ref>{{cite book |title=The University of Manitoba 104th Annual Convocation |date=1983}}</ref> She subsequently taught French Immersion before moving to [[Kelowna]] with her family in 1999. She is married and is the sister-in-law of [[James Gordon Carr]], Member of Parliament.\n\n==Writing style and influences==\nCarr's early poetry from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s is more representative of traditional meter and rhyme. She subsequently began to experiment with different forms and styles while continuing to compose traditional poetry in set forms such as [[pantoum]] and [[ghazal]]. An admirer of [[Emily Dickinson]], Carr liked the use of [[em dashes]] and often incorporated them into her poems. In the 2000s, Carr's poetry style became more eclectic as she experimented with design. This was particularly evident in her [[Visual poetry|visual]] and [[concrete poetry]] as well as in her experimental math / science poems such as \"The Fickle Nature of the Parabola\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=The Fickle Nature of the Parabola |journal=Windsor Review |date=Fall 2018 |volume=43 |issue=2 |page=128}}</ref> and \"Holocaust Genealogy\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=Holocaust Genealogy |journal=mgversion2 |date=July 2016 |volume=85 |page=84}}</ref> To date, her stylistic focus is [[free verse]].\n\nWhile Carr's poetry primarily is written in English, she also composes poems in [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Yiddish]] and the [[Chinese Mandarin]] dialect. Even though she occasionally translates the works of other poets, she tends to focus on bilingual and trilingual side-by-side translations of her own poetry.\n\nMany of Carr's poems were influenced by her early years in Winnipeg's West End where she bore witness to poverty and crime. While this darkness is evident in some of her poetry, she also composes poems which evoke a diverse array of human emotions.\n\n==''Shards of Crystal''==\n''Shards of Crystal'' reflects a dichotomy and as such, is described as a metamorphosis of darkness to light. Dealing with issues such as suicide, trauma, dementia, cruelty to animals, and the death of a child, the book then gradually changes course. It begins its transformative move towards the beauty of life with poems about musicality, spiritual liberation and the philosophy of existence. It culminates in a philosophical examination of mankind's place in the universe with Carr's signature poem, \"I Am\".<ref name=\"parl.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://bdp.parl.ca/About/Parliament/Poet/poem-selected-former-poet-laureate2-e.html?id=1&id4=254|title=The Parliamentary Poet Laureate|website=Bdp.parl.ca|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe imagery in ''Shards of Crystal'' parallels the darkness-to-light chronology of Carr's poems. This transition is essentially a redemptive move both literally and metaphorically, reconciling the pain of \"Shards\" at the outset of the book with the beauty and enlightenment of \"Crystal\" at the conclusion. Beginning with the darkness of night and becoming progressively lighter, her poems ultimately achieve the illumination of the eternal. This is in keeping with the overarching theme of hope as expressed by the Victor Hugo quote at the start of the book: \"Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hugo |first1=Victor |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables |date=1987 |publisher=Signet Classics |isbn=9780451525260 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/lesmisrablessign00vict }}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nCarr has been published extensively worldwide in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Cyprus, Finland, France, Holland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malawi, Mauritius, Mayotte Island, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Romania, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom (in England, Scotland and Wales) and USA.\n\n===Books===\n*''Shards of Crystal'' (Silver Bow Publishing, 2018) {{ISBN|978-1-927616-96-3}}\n\n===Selected anthologies===\n*''Dreamscapes'' - 2019\n*''Lost and Found'' - 2019\n*''Celestial Musings'' - 2018\n*''Climate of Opinion'' - 2017\n*''Nuclear Impact: Broken Atoms in Our Hands'' - 2017\n*''Fire and Sky'' - 2016\n*''Memory and Loss'' - 2016\n*''Childhood Regained'' - 2016\n*''Amsterdam Quarterly 2015 Yearbook'' - 2015\n*''Contemporary Poetry - An Anthology of Present Day Best Poems'' Vol. 2 - 2015\n*''Love Where the Nights are Twice as Long'' - 2015\n*''A Quiet Shelter There'' - 2015\n*''Storm Cycle 2013 - The Best of Kind of a Hurricane Press'' - 2014\n*''The Body Electric'' - 2013\n*''Voices Israel'' - 2012\n*''Sol: English Writing in Mexico'' - 2012\n*''Butterfly Away'' - 2011\n*''Van Gogh's Ear'' 7 - 2010\n\n===Selected journals===\n*''The Laurel Review'' 51.2 - 2018\n*''The London Reader'' - Autumn, 2017\n*''The Caf\u00e9 Review'' 27 - Winter, 2016\n*''Slant'' - Summer, 2015\n*''Pasque Petals'' - Fall 2015\n*''Whole Terrain'' 21 - 2014\n*''Zona de Carga'' No. 6 - August 2014\n*''MaLa - The Chengdu Bookworm Literary Journal'' 3 - June 2013\n*''Legal Studies Forum'' XXXVII, No. 1 - 2013\n*''phati'tude Literary Magazine'' 3, No. 3 - Fall 2011\n*''The Toronto Quarterly'' 8 - Nov. 2011\n*''White Wall Review'' 135 - 2011\n*''new contrast South African Literary Journal'' 38.4, No. 152 - Summer 2010\n*''The Nashwaak Review'' 24-25, No. 1 - Summer/Fall 2010\n*''Prairie Fire'' 31, No. 3 - Fall 2010\n*''Poetry New Zealand'' 41 - September 2010\n*''Windsor Review'' 42, No. - 2009\n\n==Selected awards and honours==\n*Haiku included on the Going to Mars Contest DVD aboard NASA's MAVEN spacecraft to the planet Mars<ref>http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/2013/07/15/public-voting-opens-on-maven-haiku-contest/.

By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nThe arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]]. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the [[Illiniwek]], [[Meskwaki]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], and [[Sauk people|Sauk]].<ref name=\"iaarch\">Alex, Lynn M.

By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nThe arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]]. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the [[Illiniwek]], [[Meskwaki]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], and [[Sauk people|Sauk]].<ref name=\"iaarch\">Alex, Lynn M.

As they do typically remain monogamous, are non-migratory, and remain on their breeding territories year-round, a male and female in one territory will compete for food resources during non-breeding times. Competition is reduced somewhat by slightly different foraging methods; however, they will steal from their mate's cache if given the opportunity.<ref name=Powlesland/> Males do dominate females, and thus will aggressively exclude females from food, such that females will only access food sources when unattended by the males.<ref name=SteerBurns>{{cite journal|last1=Steer|first1=Jamie|last2=Burns|first2=KC|year=2008|title=Seasonal variation in male-female competition, cooperation and selfish hoarding in a monogamous songbird|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=7|pages=1175\u20131183|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0546-z}}</ref> During breeding season, the female is solely responsible for nest building and incubation, and the male will provide the female and the hatchlings with food.<ref name=\"ref2\"/>\n\nSouth Island robins become sexually mature between six and 12 months of age. They begin their breeding season fairly early in August or September (Southern Hemisphere spring) and thus can make use of the winter's remaining food stores during this time.<ref name=Powlesland/> They build open-cup nests in tree-forks or inside tree cavities. Incubation lasts 18 days, and chicks leave the nest after 21 days. Five to 25 days after fledglings leave the nest, the pair may breed again.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=Powlesland>{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=\"ref2\"/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=\"ref2\"/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]].

The species is also trapped for the local [[pet]] market, but as it is on [[CITES Appendix I]], such trade is generally illegal. Internationally, [[captive breeding]] is able to supply the birds demanded by [[zoo]]s, where this attractive and unusual bird is often seen. Direct exploitation of the species, even including the illegal trade, might be sustainable on its own; however, its available nesting [[habitat]] is decreasing. The offshore islets which it requires are often [[logging|logged]] for [[plantation]]s, destroyed by construction activity, or polluted by nearby [[industry]] or [[harbour]]s. Also, increased travel introduces predators to more and more of the breeding sites, and colonies of the Nicobar pigeon may be driven to desert such locations or be destroyed outright. Though the bird is widely distributed and in some locations very common&nbsp;--even on small Palau it is still reasonably plentiful, with an estimated 1,000 adult birds remaining\u2014its long-term future is increasingly jeopardized. For these reasons, the [[IUCN]] considers ''C. nicobarica'' a [[near threatened]] species.<ref>BLI (2009).</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Fuller, Errol (2000): ''Extinct Birds'' (2nd ed.).

Hence, the Nicobar pigeon may well constitute another now-[[monotypic]] subfamily. And while any of the semi-[[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] pigeons of [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Wallacea]] cannot be excluded as possible closest living relative of the Raphinae, the Nicobar pigeon makes a more plausible candidate than for example the group of [[imperial-pigeon]]s and [[fruit-dove]]s, which seems to be part of the same radiation.{{sfnm|1a1=Johnson|1a2=Clayton|1y=2000|2a1=Shapiro et al.|2y=2002}}\n\nWhether it is possible to clarify such deep-time [[phylogenies]] without a comprehensive study of all major lineages of living [[Columbidae]] remains to be seen.

The species is also trapped for the local [[pet]] market, but as it is on [[CITES Appendix I]], such trade is generally illegal. Internationally, [[captive breeding]] is able to supply the birds demanded by [[zoo]]s, where this attractive and unusual bird is often seen. Direct exploitation of the species, even including the illegal trade, might be sustainable on its own; however, its available nesting [[habitat]] is decreasing. The offshore islets which it requires are often [[logging|logged]] for [[plantation]]s, destroyed by construction activity, or polluted by nearby [[industry]] or [[harbour]]s. Also, increased travel introduces predators to more and more of the breeding sites, and colonies of the Nicobar pigeon may be driven to desert such locations or be destroyed outright. Though the bird is widely distributed and in some locations very common&nbsp;--even on small Palau it is still reasonably plentiful, with an estimated 1,000 adult birds remaining\u2014its long-term future is increasingly jeopardized. For these reasons, the [[IUCN]] considers ''C. nicobarica'' a [[near threatened]] species.<ref>BLI (2009).</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Fuller, Errol (2000): ''Extinct Birds'' (2nd ed.).

Duesenberg's engineering expertise influenced the development of the automobile, especially during the 1910s and 1920s. He is credited with introducing an eight-[[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] engine, also known as the [[Duesenberg Straight-8 engine]], and four-wheel [[hydraulic brake]]s, a first for American cars, in addition to other mechanical innovations. Duesenberg was also patentholder of his designs for a four-wheel hydraulic brake, an early automatic transmission, and a cooling system, among others. Fred and his younger brother, [[August Duesenberg|August \"Augie\" Duesenberg]], shared the [[patent]]s, filed in 1913 and renewed in 1918, for their \"walking beam\" four-cylinder engine and the Duesenberg Straight 8 (an eight-cylinder engine with a single, [[overhead camshaft]]).\n\n[[File:August_and_Fred_Duesenberg,_1925.jpg|thumb|right|August Duesenberg (left) and Fred Duesenberg (right), 1925]]\n\nIn 1913 the Duesenberg brothers founded the [[Duesenberg]] Motor Company, Incorporated, which was subsequently sold, and in 1920 were among the founders of the Duesenberg Automobile and Motor Company, which manufactured passenger cars in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], from 1921 until 1937, including the [[Duesenberg Model A]], the brothers' first [[mass produced|mass-produced]] vehicle. Fred Duesenberg served as the chief engineer at both companies. From 1926 until his death in 1932, Fred Duesenberg focused on designs for luxury passenger cars, which included the Duesenberg models X, S, and [[Duesenberg Model J|J]], while serving as vice president of engineering and later in the 1920s as president of the company. Duesenberg died from complications following a car accident in 1932; Duesenberg passenger-car production ended five years later.\n\nIn addition to designing passenger cars, Fred and Augie Duesenberg were involved in auto racing for more than a decade. Although Fred was no longer driving racecars by 1912, he remained active for another twelve years as a racecar designer and team owner. In April 1920 a Duesenberg racecar driven by [[Tommy Milton]] set a land-speed record of {{convert|156.046|mph|km/h}} for a measured mile on the sands at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. In 1921 [[James Anthony Murphy|Jimmy Murphy]] drove a Duesenberg racer to become the first American car to win the prestigious [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] at [[Le Mans, France]]. Duesenberg-made entries also participated in [[Indianapolis 500]]-mile auto races between 1912 and 1932, including winning the annual event at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] in 1924, 1925, and 1927 before Fred Duesenberg retired from racing in 1931.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Duesenberg_Family.jpg|thumb|right|Duesenberg Family (Fred, second row, left; August, second row, right)]]\n\n'''Friedrich \"Fred\" S. D\u00fcsenberg''' (or '''Frederick \"Fred\" Duesenberg''' as his name was spelled after his arrival in the United States) was born on December 6, 1876, in [[Lippe]], [[Lippe-Detmold]], [[Germany]], to Konrad (Conrad) and Luise D\u00fcsenberg. Fred and his younger brother, [[August Duesenberg|August \"Augie\" Samuel D\u00fcsenberg]], were the youngest of the family's seven children (four boys and three girls). Fred's father died in 1881, and his older brother, Henry, immigrated to America in 1884. Fred's mother sold the family farm in Germany and immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1885 and joined Henry in [[Iowa]] with her other children, including Fred, who was nearly nine years old. The eldest son, Conrad, purchased a {{convert|200|acre|hectare|adj=on}} farm in [[Floyd County, Iowa]], near [[Rockford, Iowa|Rockford]], where the family finally settled.<ref name=GS105>{{cite book | author=Gugin, Linda C., and James E.

He attended public schools through the eighth grade and completed at least one correspondence course in mechanical drafting. He received no additional classroom training. Most of his engineering and automotive skills were acquired though apprenticeships and other hands-on work experience, including early work repairing farm machinery and windmills near the family home in Rockford, Iowa. During his early years, Duesenberg also took up bicycle racing.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Ema, Randy| title =Duesenberg: The Man Behind the Machine: Friedrich S.

They also began experimenting with [[gasoline]]-powered, [[internal combustion engine]]s. The brothers designed one of their own engines around 1900, as well as building [[motorcycles]]. After working at a garage in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], Fred and Augie had a bicycle repair shop in Rockford, but the business went bankrupt in 1903. A short time later the brothers established another shop in [[Garner, Iowa]], but Fred left the business in 1903 to work for the Thomas B. Jeffery Company, a manufacturer of Rambler bicycles and early automobiles in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]].<ref name=GS105/><ref name=Ema7-8>Ema, pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Fred returned to Iowa a year later to work as a machinist in a Des Moines auto supply company before opening a garage with Cheney Prouty and working as a sales agent for Rambler.<ref name=Marsh/><ref name=Ema7-8/>\n\n[[File:Mason_20_HP_Model_A_touring_(1912)_Mason_Motor_Car_Co_picture.jpg|thumb|left|Fred developed the two-cylinder \u201cwalking beam\u201d engine for the Mason 20 HP, Model A touring car]]\n\nThrough his repair business in Des Moines, Fred met Edward Mason, an local lawyer who became a financial backer of Fred's design for a two-cylinder car. The Mason Motor Car Company, incorporated in April 1906, began manufacturing cars four months later.<ref name=GS105/> Fred worked as a superintendent and designer at the company; Augie was a patternmaker.<ref name=Ema8/> After [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[F. L. Maytag|Fred Maytag]], the future [[Maytag]] [[washing machine]] and appliance magnate, acquired a majority interest in the company, it reorganized in 1909 as the [[Maytag-Mason Motor Company]] and manufactured cars in [[Waterloo, Iowa]]. In addition to producing a two-cylinder model, the company introduced Fred's patented four-cylinder engine design. The simple, high-performance engine was also reliable. Duesenberg often demonstrated the power of his cars in public settings. For example, he drove a car up the steps of the [[Iowa State Capitol]]. He also learned from his early days as a bicycle racer that racing also helped increase product sales, so the Duesenberg brothers began entering their cars in races.<ref name=GS105/><ref name=Marsh/>\n\n[[File:Mason_Motor_Car_Co._advertisement_(1906).jpg|thumb|right|A Mason automobile being driven up the steps of the [[Iowa State Capitol]]]]\n\nMaytag and Mason proved to be inexperienced in the car-making business and the company gradually folded.Fred left the company in 1910 to focus on racing and engine designs in his shop in Des Moines. The Maytag-Mason partnership was dissolved in 1912 and its auto production ended the following year.<ref name=Marsh/><ref name=Ema8/> Around 1910 Fred and Augie Duesenberg began work on their \"walking beam\" four-cylinder automobile and racing engine, which was later replaced by the Duesenberg straight-eight engine.

The two brothers contracted with [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] James A. Pugh of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to build a racing-boat engine and used the proceeds from the contract to further develop their racing business.

Fred was the chief engineer and later in the 1920s served as president of the company; his brother, Augie, was assistant engineer. Beginning in May 1921 the Duesenberg company manufactured passenger cars with advanced racing-car features at its new factory in Indianapolis at the corner of Washington and Harding Streets. The facility was also close to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which was used as a test track.<ref name=GS106/><ref name=Ema12>Ema, p. 12.</ref><ref>Roe, p. 28.</ref>\n\nThe first passenger car to bear the Duesenberg family surname was introduced in New York in late 1920.

The [[Duesenberg Model A]], their company's first [[mass produced|mass-produced]] vehicle,was manufactured between 1921 and 1927.<ref name=Marsh/> The Model A proved to be unpopular with car buyers because of its high cost (US$8,500 for the chassis alone) and unstylish exterior.

A year later the company's leadership was discussing a merger with [[Du Pont Motors]], once again indicating possible financial concerns. [[E. L. Cord]], president of the [[Auburn Automobile|Auburn Automobile Company]], admired the Duesenberg Model A and proposed a financial rescue to acquire the Duesenberg company. Cord wanted to manufacture a faster and more prestigious \"supercar\" to round out the offerings of his other automotive brands, the Auburn and [[Cord Automobile|Cord]]. E. L.

From 1926 until his death in 1932, Fred Duesenberg focused on designs for luxury passenger cars, which included the Duesenberg models X, S, and [[Duesenberg Model J|J]], while serving as vice president of engineering and later in the 1920s as president of the company. Duesenberg died from complications following a car accident in 1932; Duesenberg passenger-car production ended five years later.\n\nIn addition to designing passenger cars, Fred and Augie Duesenberg were involved in auto racing for more than a decade. Although Fred was no longer driving racecars by 1912, he remained active for another twelve years as a racecar designer and team owner. In April 1920 a Duesenberg racecar driven by [[Tommy Milton]] set a land-speed record of {{convert|156.046|mph|km/h}} for a measured mile on the sands at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. In 1921 [[James Anthony Murphy|Jimmy Murphy]] drove a Duesenberg racer to become the first American car to win the prestigious [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] at [[Le Mans, France]]. Duesenberg-made entries also participated in [[Indianapolis 500]]-mile auto races between 1912 and 1932, including winning the annual event at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] in 1924, 1925, and 1927 before Fred Duesenberg retired from racing in 1931.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Duesenberg_Family.jpg|thumb|right|Duesenberg Family (Fred, second row, left; August, second row, right)]]\n\n'''Friedrich \"Fred\" S. D\u00fcsenberg''' (or '''Frederick \"Fred\" Duesenberg''' as his name was spelled after his arrival in the United States) was born on December 6, 1876, in [[Lippe]], [[Lippe-Detmold]], [[Germany]], to Konrad (Conrad) and Luise D\u00fcsenberg. Fred and his younger brother, [[August Duesenberg|August \"Augie\" Samuel D\u00fcsenberg]], were the youngest of the family's seven children (four boys and three girls). Fred's father died in 1881, and his older brother, Henry, immigrated to America in 1884. Fred's mother sold the family farm in Germany and immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1885 and joined Henry in [[Iowa]] with her other children, including Fred, who was nearly nine years old. The eldest son, Conrad, purchased a {{convert|200|acre|hectare|adj=on}} farm in [[Floyd County, Iowa]], near [[Rockford, Iowa|Rockford]], where the family finally settled.<ref name=GS105>{{cite book | author=Gugin, Linda C., and James E.

He attended public schools through the eighth grade and completed at least one correspondence course in mechanical drafting. He received no additional classroom training. Most of his engineering and automotive skills were acquired though apprenticeships and other hands-on work experience, including early work repairing farm machinery and windmills near the family home in Rockford, Iowa.

After working at a garage in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], Fred and Augie had a bicycle repair shop in Rockford, but the business went bankrupt in 1903. A short time later the brothers established another shop in [[Garner, Iowa]], but Fred left the business in 1903 to work for the Thomas B.

In addition to producing a two-cylinder model, the company introduced Fred's patented four-cylinder engine design. The simple, high-performance engine was also reliable. Duesenberg often demonstrated the power of his cars in public settings. For example, he drove a car up the steps of the [[Iowa State Capitol]].

Fred was the chief engineer and later in the 1920s served as president of the company; his brother, Augie, was assistant engineer. Beginning in May 1921 the Duesenberg company manufactured passenger cars with advanced racing-car features at its new factory in Indianapolis at the corner of Washington and Harding Streets.

A year later the company's leadership was discussing a merger with [[Du Pont Motors]], once again indicating possible financial concerns. [[E. L. Cord]], president of the [[Auburn Automobile|Auburn Automobile Company]], admired the Duesenberg Model A and proposed a financial rescue to acquire the Duesenberg company. Cord wanted to manufacture a faster and more prestigious \"supercar\" to round out the offerings of his other automotive brands, the Auburn and [[Cord Automobile|Cord]]. E. L. Cord's acquisition of the Duesenberg company in 1926 also included Fred, who was tasked with designing faster and more powerful luxury cars than the Duesenberg competitors.<ref name=Marsh/><ref name=GS107>Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 107.</ref> From 1926 until his death in 1932, Fred focused on designs for passenger cars, which included the X, S, and [[Duesenberg Model J|J]] models, and served as vice president of engineering at Duesenberg, a subsidiary of the Cord Corporation.

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE). The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death. This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nFacing the prospect of an unmanageable influx of patients both in his city and in others across the United States, New York City mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] called on the [[U.S. federal government]] to recruit additional medical staff to help meet demand.

Consumers began fearing both supply chain disruption and the possibility of being forced into extended quarantines that would prevent them from purchasing toilet paper and related products, despite reassurance from industry and government that neither was likely to occur.<ref name=\"Forbes TP 1\" /> As a result, some consumers began hoarding toilet paper, leading to reports of empty shelves, which in turn led to additional fear of a toilet paper shortage that prompted others to hoard toilet paper as well.<ref name=\"Forbes TP 1\">{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Bruce Y. |title=Is COVID-19 Coronavirus Leading To Toilet Paper Shortages?

In particular, as a result of [[Curfews and lockdowns related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|stay-at-home orders]], people have been spending much less time at schools, workplaces, and other public venues and much more time at home, thus using public toilets less frequently and home toilets more frequently.<ref name=\"Vox TP\" /> This has caused a strain on supply chains, since public toilets and home toilets generally use two different grades of toilet paper: commercial toilet paper and consumer toilet paper, respectively. [[Georgia-Pacific]] predicted a 40 percent increase in the use of consumer toilet paper as a result of people staying at home.<ref name=\"Vox TP\" /> Due to differences in roll size, packaging, and supply and distribution networks between the two grades, toilet paper manufacturers are expected to have difficulty shifting production to meet the shift in demand from commercial to home use, leading to lingering shortages even after panic buying subsides.<ref name=\"Vox TP\">{{cite news |last1=Nguyen |first1=Terry |title=The toilet paper shortage is more complicated than you think |url=https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/4/3/21206942/toilet-paper-coronavirus-shortage-supply-chain |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Others ==\nIn France, due to closed borders and the impossibility for foreign seasonal workers to come over,<ref name=\":10\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/coronavirus-la-cueillette-des-fraises-menacee-par-le-manque-de-main-d-oeuvre-et-de-debouches-1881783.html|title=Coronavirus: la cueillette des fraises menac\u00e9e par le manque de main d'oeuvre et de d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s|last=BFMTV|publisher=BFMTV|language=fr|access-date=26 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326150948/https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/coronavirus-la-cueillette-des-fraises-menacee-par-le-manque-de-main-d-oeuvre-et-de-debouches-1881783.html|archive-date=26 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> the government's [[Didier Guillaume|Minister of Agriculture]] called for jobless volunteers to contact [[Strawberry|strawberries farms]] and help collect the harvest for the usual [[Minimum wage|minimal wage]].<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nLaboratory mice are being culled, and some strains are at risk of shortage due to lockdowns.<ref name=20200323sciencemag>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/it-s-heartbreaking-labs-are-euthanizing-thousands-mice-response-coronavirus-pandemic|title='It's heartbreaking.'

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE). The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death. This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nFacing the prospect of an unmanageable influx of patients both in his city and in others across the United States, New York City mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] called on the [[U.S. federal government]] to recruit additional medical staff to help meet demand.

In March 2020 at numerous stores throughout these countries, shoppers reported empty shelves in both the toilet paper section as well as sections for related products such as [[paper towel]]s, [[Tissue paper|tissue]]s, and [[diaper]]s.<ref name=\"Forbes TP 1\" /> Initially, much of this was blamed on panic buying. Consumers began fearing both supply chain disruption and the possibility of being forced into extended quarantines that would prevent them from purchasing toilet paper and related products, despite reassurance from industry and government that neither was likely to occur.<ref name=\"Forbes TP 1\" /> As a result, some consumers began hoarding toilet paper, leading to reports of empty shelves, which in turn led to additional fear of a toilet paper shortage that prompted others to hoard toilet paper as well.<ref name=\"Forbes TP 1\">{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Bruce Y. |title=Is COVID-19 Coronavirus Leading To Toilet Paper Shortages?

In particular, as a result of [[Curfews and lockdowns related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|stay-at-home orders]], people have been spending much less time at schools, workplaces, and other public venues and much more time at home, thus using public toilets less frequently and home toilets more frequently.<ref name=\"Vox TP\" /> This has caused a strain on supply chains, since public toilets and home toilets generally use two different grades of toilet paper: commercial toilet paper and consumer toilet paper, respectively. [[Georgia-Pacific]] predicted a 40 percent increase in the use of consumer toilet paper as a result of people staying at home.<ref name=\"Vox TP\" /> Due to differences in roll size, packaging, and supply and distribution networks between the two grades, toilet paper manufacturers are expected to have difficulty shifting production to meet the shift in demand from commercial to home use, leading to lingering shortages even after panic buying subsides.<ref name=\"Vox TP\">{{cite news |last1=Nguyen |first1=Terry |title=The toilet paper shortage is more complicated than you think |url=https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/4/3/21206942/toilet-paper-coronavirus-shortage-supply-chain |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Others ==\nIn France, due to closed borders and the impossibility for foreign seasonal workers to come over,<ref name=\":10\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/coronavirus-la-cueillette-des-fraises-menacee-par-le-manque-de-main-d-oeuvre-et-de-debouches-1881783.html|title=Coronavirus: la cueillette des fraises menac\u00e9e par le manque de main d'oeuvre et de d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s|last=BFMTV|publisher=BFMTV|language=fr|access-date=26 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326150948/https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/coronavirus-la-cueillette-des-fraises-menacee-par-le-manque-de-main-d-oeuvre-et-de-debouches-1881783.html|archive-date=26 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> the government's [[Didier Guillaume|Minister of Agriculture]] called for jobless volunteers to contact [[Strawberry|strawberries farms]] and help collect the harvest for the usual [[Minimum wage|minimal wage]].<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nLaboratory mice are being culled, and some strains are at risk of shortage due to lockdowns.<ref name=20200323sciencemag>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/it-s-heartbreaking-labs-are-euthanizing-thousands-mice-response-coronavirus-pandemic|title='It's heartbreaking.'

He died while his daughter was too young to remember him. By the time Bessie was nine, her mother and a brother had also died.

She sang and danced as he played the guitar. Their favorite location was in front of the White Elephant Saloon at Thirteenth and Elm streets, in the heart of the city's African-American community.\n\nIn 1904, her oldest brother Clarence left home, joining a small traveling troupe owned by [[Moses Stokes]]. \"If Bessie had been old enough, she would have gone with him,\" said Clarence's widow, Maud. \"That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence told me she was ready, even then. Of course, she was only a child.\"<ref>Albertson, 2003, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn 1912, Clarence returned to Chattanooga with the Stokes troupe and arranged an audition for his sister with the troupe managers, Lonnie and Cora Fisher. She was hired as a dancer rather than a singer, because the company already included the well-known singer [[Ma Rainey]]. Smith eventually moved on to performing in various chorus lines, making the \"81\" Theater in Atlanta her home base. She also performed in shows on the black-owned ([[Theater Owners Booking Association]]) (T.O.B.A.) circuit and became its biggest star after she signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].\n\nSmith's recording career began in 1923.<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books |location=Dubai|page=12|isbn=978-1-85868-255-6}}</ref> Despite her success, neither she nor her music was accepted in all circles.

She was then living in Philadelphia, when she met Jack Gee, a security guard, whom she married on June 7, 1923, just as her first record was being released. During the marriage Smith became the highest-paid black entertainer of the day, heading her own shows, which sometimes featured as many as 40 troupers, and touring in her own custom-built railroad car.

In 1929, when she learned of his affair with another singer, [[Gertrude Saunders]], Smith ended the relationship, although neither of them sought a divorce.\n\nSmith later entered a [[common-law marriage]] with an old friend, Richard Morgan, who was [[Lionel Hampton]]'s uncle. She stayed with him until her death.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Bessiesmith3.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Smith by Carl Van Vechten]]\nAll contemporary accounts indicate that while Rainey did not teach Smith to sing, she probably helped her develop a stage presence.<ref>Albertson, 2003, pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Smith began forming her own act around 1913, at Atlanta's \"81\" Theater. By 1920, she had established a reputation in the [[American South|South]] and along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nIn 1920, sales of over 100,000 copies of \"Crazy Blues,\" recorded for [[Okeh Records]] by the singer [[Mamie Smith]] (no relation), pointed to a new market. The recording industry had not directed its product to black people, but the success of the record led to a search for female blues singers. Bessie Smith was signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 1923 by [[Frank Buckley Walker|Frank Walker]], a talent agent who had seen her perform years earlier. Her first session for Columbia was on February 15, 1923; it was engineered by [[Dan Hornsby]]. For most of 1923, her records were issued on Columbia's regular A-series. When the company established a \"[[race records]]\" series, Smith's \"Cemetery Blues\" (September 26, 1923) was the first issued.\n\nBoth sides of her first record, \"[[Downhearted Blues]]\" backed with \"Gulf Coast Blues\", were hits (an earlier recording of \"Downhearted Blues\" by its co-writer [[Alberta Hunter]] had previously been released by [[Paramount Records]]).<ref>Lieb, Sandra R.

Additionally, she incorporated commentary on social issues like poverty, intra-racial conflict, and female sexuality into her lyrics. Her lyrical sincerity and public behavior were not widely accepted as appropriate expressions for African American women; therefore, her work was often written off as distasteful or unseemly, rather than as an accurate representation of the African-American experience. Her work challenged elitist norms by encouraging working-class women to embrace their right to drink, party, and satisfy their sexual needs as a means of coping with stress and dissatisfaction in their daily lives. Smith advocated for a wider vision of African-American womanhood beyond domesticity, piety, and conformity; she sought empowerment and happiness through independence, sassiness, and sexual freedom.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although Smith was a voice for many minority groups and one of the most gifted blues performers of her time, the themes in her music were precocious, which led to many believing that her work was undeserving of serious recognition.\n\n===Broadway===\nSmith's career was cut short by the Great Depression, which nearly put the recording industry out of business, and the advent of [[sound film|sound in film]], which spelled the end of vaudeville. She never stopped performing, however. The days of elaborate vaudeville shows were over, but Smith continued touring and occasionally sang in clubs. In 1929, she appeared in a [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical, ''Pansy''. The play was a flop; top critics said she was its only asset.\n\n===Film===\n[[File:St Louis Blues (1929).webm|thumb|thumbtime=396|start=396|end=633|''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', Smith's only film,1929]]\nIn 1929, Smith made her only film appearance, starring in a [[short film|two-reeler]], ''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', based on [[W. C. Handy]]'s [[St. Louis Blues (song)|song]] of the same name. In the film, directed by [[Dudley Murphy]] and shot in [[Astoria, Queens]], she sings the title song accompanied by members of [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s orchestra, the Hall Johnson Choir, the pianist [[James P. Johnson]] and a string section\u2014a musical environment radically different from that of any of her recordings.\n\n===Swing era===\nIn 1933, [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]], who also mentored [[Billie Holiday]], asked Smith to record four sides for Okeh (which had been acquired by Columbia Records in 1925). He claimed to have found her in semi-obscurity, working as a hostess in a speakeasy on Ridge Avenue in Philadelphia.<ref>Hammond, John. ''John Hammond on Record''. p. 120.</ref> Smith worked at Art's Cafe on Ridge Avenue, but not as a hostess and not until the summer of 1936. In 1933, when she made the Okeh sides, she was still touring. Hammond was known for his selective memory and gratuitous embellishments.<ref>Albertson, ''Bessie'', pp. 224\u2013225.</ref>\n\nSmith was paid a non-royalty fee of $37.50 for each selection on these Okeh sides, which were her last recordings. Made on November 24, 1933, they serve as a hint of the transformation she made in her performances as she shifted her blues artistry into something that fit the [[swing era]]. The relatively modern accompaniment is notable. The band included such swing era musicians as the [[trombone|trombonist]] [[Jack Teagarden]], the trumpeter [[William Frank Newton|Frankie Newton]], the [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[Chu Berry]], the pianist Buck Washington, the guitarist Bobby Johnson, and the bassist [[Billy Taylor]]. [[Benny Goodman]], who happened to be recording with [[Ethel Waters]] in the adjoining studio, dropped by and is barely audible on one selection. Hammond was not entirely pleased with the results, preferring to have Smith revisit her old blues sound. \"Take Me for a Buggy Ride\" and \"Gimme a Pigfoot (And a Bottle of Beer)\", both written by [[Wesley Wilson]], were among her most popular recordings.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n==Death==\nOn September 26, 1937, Smith was critically injured in a car crash on [[U.S. Route 61]] between [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]]. Her lover, Richard Morgan, was driving, and misjudged the speed of a slow-moving truck ahead of him. Tire marks at the scene suggested that Morgan tried to avoid the truck by driving around its left side, but he hit the rear of the truck side-on at high speed. The tailgate of the truck sheared off the wooden roof of Smith's old Packard. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, probably with her right arm or elbow out the window, took the full brunt of the impact. Morgan escaped without injuries.\n\nThe first person on the scene was a Memphis surgeon, Dr. Hugh Smith (no relation). In the early 1970s, Hugh Smith gave a detailed account of his experience to Bessie's biographer [[Chris Albertson]]. This is the most reliable eyewitness testimony about the events surrounding her death.\n\nArriving at the scene, Hugh Smith examined Smith, who was lying in the middle of the road with obviously severe injuries. He estimated she had lost about a half pint of blood, and immediately noted a major traumatic injury: her right arm was almost completely severed at the elbow.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a2VGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ecMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1073,6477849&dq=theater+owners+booking+association&hl=en|title=Blues Legend Bessie Smith Dead 50 Years|date=September 26, 1987|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=November 16, 2010}}</ref> He stated that this injury alone did not cause her death. Though the light was poor, he observed only minor head injuries. He attributed her death to extensive and severe crush injuries to the entire right side of her body, consistent with a sideswipe collision.<ref>Albertson, Chris (1972). ''Bessie: Empress of the Blues''. London: Sphere Books. pp. 192\u2013195. {{ISBN|0-300-09902-9}}.</ref>\n\nHenry Broughton (a fishing partner of Dr. Smith's) helped him move Bessie Smith to the shoulder of the road. Dr. Smith dressed her arm injury with a clean handkerchief and asked Broughton to go to a house about 500 feet off the road to call an ambulance.\n\nBy the time Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith was in shock. Time passed with no sign of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith suggested that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat when they heard the sound of a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and plowed into his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.<ref>Albertson (1972), p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe young couple in the new car did not have life-threatening injuries. Two ambulances then arrived from Clarksdale\u2014one from the black hospital, summoned by Broughton, the other from the white hospital, acting on a report from the truck driver, who had not seen the accident victims.\n\nBessie Smith was taken to the [[Riverside Hotel (Clarksdale, Mississippi)|G.&nbsp;T. Thomas Afro-American Hospital]] in Clarksdale, where her right arm was [[amputate]]d. She died that morning without regaining consciousness. After her death, an often repeated but now discredited story emerged that she died because a [[Jim Crow laws|whites-only]] hospital in Clarksdale refused to admit her. The jazz writer and producer [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] gave this account in an article in the November 1937 issue of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine.

They altered the apparent [[Key signature|key]] of her performances (sometimes raised or lowered by as much as a [[semitone]]). The \"center hole\" in some of the master recordings had not been in the true middle of the master disc, so that there were wide variations in tone, pitch, key and phrasing, as commercially released records revolved around the spindle.\n\nGiven those historic limitations, the current [[Remaster|digitally remastered]] versions of her work deliver significant improvements in the sound quality of Smith's performances.

Davies]] for [[Frog Records]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/6515486/100-Best-Jazz-Recordings.html |title=100 Best Jazz Recordings |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The popular musical ''Bessie: The Life & Music of Bessie Smith'', by the playwright Douglas M.

He died while his daughter was too young to remember him. By the time Bessie was nine, her mother and a brother had also died.

She sang and danced as he played the guitar. Their favorite location was in front of the White Elephant Saloon at Thirteenth and Elm streets, in the heart of the city's African-American community.\n\nIn 1904, her oldest brother Clarence left home, joining a small traveling troupe owned by [[Moses Stokes]]. \"If Bessie had been old enough, she would have gone with him,\" said Clarence's widow, Maud. \"That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence told me she was ready, even then. Of course, she was only a child.\"<ref>Albertson, 2003, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn 1912, Clarence returned to Chattanooga with the Stokes troupe and arranged an audition for his sister with the troupe managers, Lonnie and Cora Fisher. She was hired as a dancer rather than a singer, because the company already included the well-known singer [[Ma Rainey]]. Smith eventually moved on to performing in various chorus lines, making the \"81\" Theater in Atlanta her home base. She also performed in shows on the black-owned ([[Theater Owners Booking Association]]) (T.O.B.A.) circuit and became its biggest star after she signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].\n\nSmith's recording career began in 1923.<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books |location=Dubai|page=12|isbn=978-1-85868-255-6}}</ref> Despite her success, neither she nor her music was accepted in all circles. She once auditioned for Black Swan records ([[W. E. B. Du Bois]] was on its board of directors) and was dismissed because she was considered too rough, she supposedly stopped singing to spit.<ref name=\":0\" /> In fact, even her admirers, white and black, considered her a \"rough\" (i.e., working class or even \"low class\") woman. She was then living in Philadelphia, when she met Jack Gee, a security guard, whom she married on June 7, 1923, just as her first record was being released. During the marriage Smith became the highest-paid black entertainer of the day, heading her own shows, which sometimes featured as many as 40 troupers, and touring in her own custom-built railroad car. Their marriage was stormy with infidelity on both sides, including numerous female lovers for Bessie.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Devi|first1=Debra|title=Bessie Smith: Music's Original, Bitchinest Bad Girl|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/debra-devi/bessie-smith_b_1450477.html|accessdate=February 17, 2017|work=HuffPost|date=June 25, 2012}}</ref> Gee was impressed by the money but never adjusted to show business life or to Smith's [[bisexuality]]. In 1929, when she learned of his affair with another singer, [[Gertrude Saunders]], Smith ended the relationship, although neither of them sought a divorce.\n\nSmith later entered a [[common-law marriage]] with an old friend, Richard Morgan, who was [[Lionel Hampton]]'s uncle. She stayed with him until her death.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Bessiesmith3.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Smith by Carl Van Vechten]]\nAll contemporary accounts indicate that while Rainey did not teach Smith to sing, she probably helped her develop a stage presence.<ref>Albertson, 2003, pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Smith began forming her own act around 1913, at Atlanta's \"81\" Theater. By 1920, she had established a reputation in the [[American South|South]] and along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nIn 1920, sales of over 100,000 copies of \"Crazy Blues,\" recorded for [[Okeh Records]] by the singer [[Mamie Smith]] (no relation), pointed to a new market. The recording industry had not directed its product to black people, but the success of the record led to a search for female blues singers. Bessie Smith was signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 1923 by [[Frank Buckley Walker|Frank Walker]], a talent agent who had seen her perform years earlier. Her first session for Columbia was on February 15, 1923; it was engineered by [[Dan Hornsby]]. For most of 1923, her records were issued on Columbia's regular A-series. When the company established a \"[[race records]]\" series, Smith's \"Cemetery Blues\" (September 26, 1923) was the first issued.\n\nBoth sides of her first record, \"[[Downhearted Blues]]\" backed with \"Gulf Coast Blues\", were hits (an earlier recording of \"Downhearted Blues\" by its co-writer [[Alberta Hunter]] had previously been released by [[Paramount Records]]).<ref>Lieb, Sandra R.

''Poor Man's Blues'' and ''Washwoman's Blues'' are widely considered to be an early form of African American protest music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rabaka |first=Reiland |title=Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the Hip Hop Movement |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2012 |page=78}}</ref>\n\nWhat becomes evident after listening to her music and studying her lyrics is that Smith emphasized and channeled a subculture within the African American working class. Additionally, she incorporated commentary on social issues like poverty, intra-racial conflict, and female sexuality into her lyrics. Her lyrical sincerity and public behavior were not widely accepted as appropriate expressions for African American women; therefore, her work was often written off as distasteful or unseemly, rather than as an accurate representation of the African-American experience. Her work challenged elitist norms by encouraging working-class women to embrace their right to drink, party, and satisfy their sexual needs as a means of coping with stress and dissatisfaction in their daily lives. Smith advocated for a wider vision of African-American womanhood beyond domesticity, piety, and conformity; she sought empowerment and happiness through independence, sassiness, and sexual freedom.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although Smith was a voice for many minority groups and one of the most gifted blues performers of her time, the themes in her music were precocious, which led to many believing that her work was undeserving of serious recognition.\n\n===Broadway===\nSmith's career was cut short by the Great Depression, which nearly put the recording industry out of business, and the advent of [[sound film|sound in film]], which spelled the end of vaudeville. She never stopped performing, however. The days of elaborate vaudeville shows were over, but Smith continued touring and occasionally sang in clubs. In 1929, she appeared in a [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical, ''Pansy''. The play was a flop; top critics said she was its only asset.\n\n===Film===\n[[File:St Louis Blues (1929).webm|thumb|thumbtime=396|start=396|end=633|''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', Smith's only film,1929]]\nIn 1929, Smith made her only film appearance, starring in a [[short film|two-reeler]], ''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', based on [[W. C. Handy]]'s [[St. Louis Blues (song)|song]] of the same name. In the film, directed by [[Dudley Murphy]] and shot in [[Astoria, Queens]], she sings the title song accompanied by members of [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s orchestra, the Hall Johnson Choir, the pianist [[James P. Johnson]] and a string section\u2014a musical environment radically different from that of any of her recordings.\n\n===Swing era===\nIn 1933, [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]], who also mentored [[Billie Holiday]], asked Smith to record four sides for Okeh (which had been acquired by Columbia Records in 1925). He claimed to have found her in semi-obscurity, working as a hostess in a speakeasy on Ridge Avenue in Philadelphia.<ref>Hammond, John. ''John Hammond on Record''. p. 120.</ref> Smith worked at Art's Cafe on Ridge Avenue, but not as a hostess and not until the summer of 1936. In 1933, when she made the Okeh sides, she was still touring. Hammond was known for his selective memory and gratuitous embellishments.<ref>Albertson, ''Bessie'', pp. 224\u2013225.</ref>\n\nSmith was paid a non-royalty fee of $37.50 for each selection on these Okeh sides, which were her last recordings. Made on November 24, 1933, they serve as a hint of the transformation she made in her performances as she shifted her blues artistry into something that fit the [[swing era]]. The relatively modern accompaniment is notable. The band included such swing era musicians as the [[trombone|trombonist]] [[Jack Teagarden]], the trumpeter [[William Frank Newton|Frankie Newton]], the [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[Chu Berry]], the pianist Buck Washington, the guitarist Bobby Johnson, and the bassist [[Billy Taylor]]. [[Benny Goodman]], who happened to be recording with [[Ethel Waters]] in the adjoining studio, dropped by and is barely audible on one selection. Hammond was not entirely pleased with the results, preferring to have Smith revisit her old blues sound. \"Take Me for a Buggy Ride\" and \"Gimme a Pigfoot (And a Bottle of Beer)\", both written by [[Wesley Wilson]], were among her most popular recordings.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n==Death==\nOn September 26, 1937, Smith was critically injured in a car crash on [[U.S. Route 61]] between [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]]. Her lover, Richard Morgan, was driving, and misjudged the speed of a slow-moving truck ahead of him. Tire marks at the scene suggested that Morgan tried to avoid the truck by driving around its left side, but he hit the rear of the truck side-on at high speed. The tailgate of the truck sheared off the wooden roof of Smith's old Packard. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, probably with her right arm or elbow out the window, took the full brunt of the impact. Morgan escaped without injuries.\n\nThe first person on the scene was a Memphis surgeon, Dr. Hugh Smith (no relation). In the early 1970s, Hugh Smith gave a detailed account of his experience to Bessie's biographer Chris Albertson. This is the most reliable eyewitness testimony about the events surrounding her death.\n\nArriving at the scene, Hugh Smith examined Smith, who was lying in the middle of the road with obviously severe injuries. He estimated she had lost about a half pint of blood, and immediately noted a major traumatic injury: her right arm was almost completely severed at the elbow.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a2VGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ecMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1073,6477849&dq=theater+owners+booking+association&hl=en|title=Blues Legend Bessie Smith Dead 50 Years|date=September 26, 1987|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=November 16, 2010}}</ref> He stated that this injury alone did not cause her death. Though the light was poor, he observed only minor head injuries. He attributed her death to extensive and severe crush injuries to the entire right side of her body, consistent with a sideswipe collision.<ref>Albertson, Chris (1972). ''Bessie: Empress of the Blues''. London: Sphere Books. pp. 192\u2013195. {{ISBN|0-300-09902-9}}.</ref>\n\nHenry Broughton (a fishing partner of Dr. Smith's) helped him move Bessie Smith to the shoulder of the road. Dr. Smith dressed her arm injury with a clean handkerchief and asked Broughton to go to a house about 500 feet off the road to call an ambulance.\n\nBy the time Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith was in shock. Time passed with no sign of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith suggested that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat when they heard the sound of a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and plowed into his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.<ref>Albertson (1972), p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe young couple in the new car did not have life-threatening injuries. Two ambulances then arrived from Clarksdale\u2014one from the black hospital, summoned by Broughton, the other from the white hospital, acting on a report from the truck driver, who had not seen the accident victims.\n\nBessie Smith was taken to the [[Riverside Hotel (Clarksdale, Mississippi)|G.&nbsp;T. Thomas Afro-American Hospital]] in Clarksdale, where her right arm was [[amputate]]d. She died that morning without regaining consciousness. After her death, an often repeated but now discredited story emerged that she died because a [[Jim Crow laws|whites-only]] hospital in Clarksdale refused to admit her. The jazz writer and producer [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] gave this account in an article in the November 1937 issue of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine. The circumstances of Smith's death and the rumor promoted by Hammond formed the basis for [[Edward Albee]]'s 1959 one-act play ''[[The Death of Bessie Smith]]''.<ref name=Love-1997>{{cite book|last=Love|first=Spencie|title=One Blood: The Death and Resurrection of Charles R.

They altered the apparent [[Key signature|key]] of her performances (sometimes raised or lowered by as much as a [[semitone]]). The \"center hole\" in some of the master recordings had not been in the true middle of the master disc, so that there were wide variations in tone, pitch, key and phrasing, as commercially released records revolved around the spindle.\n\nGiven those historic limitations, the current [[Remaster|digitally remastered]] versions of her work deliver significant improvements in the sound quality of Smith's performances. Some critics believe that the American [[Columbia Records]] compact disc releases are somewhat inferior to subsequent transfers made by the late [[John R. T. Davies]] for [[Frog Records]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/6515486/100-Best-Jazz-Recordings.html |title=100 Best Jazz Recordings |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The popular musical ''Bessie: The Life & Music of Bessie Smith'', by the playwright Douglas M.

Originally known as the ''Cappella Magna'' ('Great Chapel'), the chapel takes its name from [[Pope Sixtus IV]], who restored it between 1473 and 1481. Since that time, the chapel has served as a place of both religious and functionary papal activity. Today, it is the site of the [[papal conclave]], the process by which a new pope is selected. The fame of the Sistine Chapel lies mainly in the [[fresco]]s that decorate the interior, most particularly the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] and ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' by [[Michelangelo]].\n\nDuring the reign of Sixtus IV, a team of [[Italian Renaissance painting|Renaissance painters]] that included [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Pinturicchio]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]], created a series of frescos depicting the ''Life of Moses'' and the ''Life of Christ'', offset by papal portraits above and ''[[trompe-l'\u0153il]]'' drapery below. These paintings were completed in 1482, and on 15 August 1483 Sixtus IV celebrated the first [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] in the Sistine Chapel for the Feast of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].<ref name=\"Pietrangeli1986\">{{Harvnb|Pietrangeli|1986|p=28}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Monfasani |first=John |year=1983 |title=A Description of the Sistine Chapel under Pope Sixtus IV |journal=Artibus et Historiae |volume=4 |issue=7 |pages=9\u201318 |issn=0391-9064 |url=http://www.artibusethistoriae.org/?menu=art&gdzie=artibusChapterResult&id=68 |doi=10.2307/1483178 |publisher=IRSA s.c. |postscript=. |jstor=1483178}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1508 and 1512, under the patronage of [[Pope Julius II]], [[Michelangelo]] painted [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|the chapel's ceiling]], a project which changed the course of Western art and is regarded as one of the major artistic accomplishments of human civilization.<ref>Gardner, Helen (1970) ''Art through the Ages'', p. 469, Harcourt, Brace and World. {{ISBN|978-0-15-508315-8}}</ref><ref>Robert Coughlan, ''The World of Michelangelo'', Time-Life International, (1966) p. 116</ref> In a different climate, after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], he returned and, between 1535 and 1541, painted ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' for Popes [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] and [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]].<ref>Robert Coughlan,  p. 127</ref> The fame of Michelangelo's paintings has drawn multitudes of visitors to the chapel ever since they were revealed five hundred years ago.\n\n== History ==\nWhile known as the location of [[Papal conclave]]s, the primary function of the Sistine Chapel is as the chapel of the [[Papal Chapel]] (''Cappella Pontificia''), one of the two bodies of the [[Papal household]], called until 1968 the ''Papal Court'' (''Pontificalis Aula''). At the time of Pope Sixtus IV in the late 15th century, the [[Papal Chapel]] comprised about 200 people, including clerics, officials of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and distinguished laity. There were 50 occasions during the year on which it was prescribed by the Papal Calendar that the whole Papal Chapel should meet.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pietrangeli|1986|p=24}}</ref> Of these 50 occasions, 35 were masses, of which 8 were held in Basilicas, in general [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]], and were attended by large congregations. These included the Christmas Day and Easter masses, at which the Pope himself was the [[Liturgy|celebrant]]. The other 27 masses could be held in a smaller, less public space, for which the ''Cappella Maggiore'' was used before it was rebuilt on the same site as the Sistine Chapel.\n\nThe ''Cappella Maggiore'' derived its name, the Greater Chapel, from the fact that there was another chapel also in use by the Pope and his retinue for daily worship. At the time of Pope Sixtus IV, this was the Chapel of [[Pope Nicholas V]], which had been decorated by [[Fra Angelico]]. The ''Cappella Maggiore ''is recorded as existing in 1368. According to a communication from Andreas of Trebizond to Pope Sixtus IV, by the time of its demolition to make way for the present chapel, the ''Cappella Maggiore ''was in a ruinous state with its walls leaning.<ref name=\"Shearman\">John Shearman, \"The Chapel of Sixtus IV\".

There is a permanent choir, the [[Sistine Chapel Choir]], for whom much original music has been written, the most famous piece being [[Gregorio Allegri]]'s ''[[Miserere (Allegri)|Miserere]]''.<ref>[[Abel Stevens|Stevens, Abel]] & Floy, James. \"Allegri's Miserere\". ''The National Magazine'', Carlton & Phillip, 1854. 531.</ref>\n\n=== Papal conclave ===\n{{Main|Papal conclave}}\nOne of the functions of the Sistine Chapel is as a venue for the election of each successive pope in a [[Papal conclave|conclave]] of the [[College of Cardinals]]. On the occasion of a conclave, a chimney is installed in the roof of the chapel, from which smoke arises as a signal. If white smoke, which is created by burning the ballots of the election, appears, a new Pope has been elected. If a candidate receives less than a two-thirds vote, the cardinals send up black smoke\u2014created by burning the ballots along with wet straw and chemical additives\u2014it means that no successful election has yet occurred.<ref>Saunders, Fr.

From 1455, conclaves have been held in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]; until the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]], they were held in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] convent of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Chambers |first=D.

After the new Pope accepts his election, he would give his new name; at this time, the other Cardinals would tug on a rope attached to their seats to lower their canopies. Until reforms instituted by [[Saint Pius X]], the canopies were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] abolished the canopies altogether, since, under his papacy, the population of the College of Cardinals had increased so much to the point that they would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the canopies obstruct the view of the cardinals in the back row. In the wake of a conclave taking place to preserve the integrity of the rubble floor on the Sistine Chapel, carpenters install a slightly elevated wooden floor alongside a wooden ramp in the entrance for those Cardinals who for one reason or another need to be transported in a wheelchair.\n\n== Architecture ==\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:Cappella Sistina - 2005.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Sistine Chapel]]\nThe chapel is a high rectangular building, for which absolute measurements are hard to ascertain, as available measurements are for the interior: {{convert|40.9|m|ft}} long by {{convert|13.4|m|ft}} wide, the [[dimension]]s of the [[Temple of Solomon]], as given in the [[Old Testament]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Campbell |first=Ian |title=The New St Peter's: Basilica or Temple? |journal=Oxford Art Journal |year=1981 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=3\u20138 |issn=0142-6540 |doi=10.1093/oxartj/4.1.3 |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/129:255/Readings/New%20St.%20Peter's%20Basilica%20or%20Temple.pdf |postscript=. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016125528/http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/129:255/Readings/New%20St.%20Peter's%20Basilica%20or%20Temple.pdf |archive-date=16 October 2015 }}\n</ref>\n\nIts exterior is unadorned by architectural or decorative details, as is common in many Italian churches of the [[Medieval architecture|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] eras. It has no exterior fa\u00e7ade or exterior processional doorways, as the ingress has always been from internal rooms within the [[Apostolic Palace]] (Papal Palace), and the exterior can be seen only from nearby windows and light-wells in the palace. Subsidence and cracking of masonry such as must also have affected the Cappella Maggiore has necessitated the building of very large [[buttress]]es to brace the exterior walls. The accretion of other buildings has further altered the exterior appearance of the Chapel.\n\nThe building is divided into three stories of which the lowest is a very tall basement level with several utilitarian windows and a doorway giving onto the exterior court. Internally, the basement is robustly vaulted to support the chapel. Above is the main space, the Sistine Chapel, the vaulted ceiling rising to {{convert|20.7|m|ft}}. The building had six tall arched windows down each side and two at either end, several of which have been blocked. Above the vault is a third story with wardrooms for guards. At this level, an open projecting [[wikt:gangway|gangway]] was constructed, which encircled the building supported on an arcade springing from the walls. The gangway has been roofed as it was a continual source of water leaking in to the vault of the Chapel.\n\n=== Interior of the Sistine Chapel ===\nThe general proportions of the chapel use the length as the unit of measurement. This has been divided by three to get the width and by two to get the height. Maintaining the ratio, there were six windows down each side and two at either end. Defined proportions were a feature of [[Renaissance architecture]] and reflected the growing interest in the Classical heritage of Rome.\n\n[[File:Cappella sistina, ricostruzione dell'interno prima degli interventi di Michelangelo, stampa del XIX secolo.jpg|thumb|left|A reconstruction of the appearance of the chapel in the 1480s, prior to the painting of the ceiling]]\nThe ceiling of the chapel is a flattened [[barrel vault]] springing from a course that encircles the walls at the level of the springing of the window arches. This barrel vault is cut transversely by smaller vaults over each window, which divide the barrel vault at its lowest level into a series of large [[pendentive]]s rising from shallow pilasters between each window. The barrel vault was originally painted brilliant-blue and dotted with gold stars, to the design of [[Piermatteo Lauro de' Manfredi da Amelia]].<ref name=\"Shearman\" /> The pavement is in [[opus alexandrinum]], a decorative style using marble and coloured stone in a pattern that reflects the earlier proportion in the division of the interior and also marks the processional way from the main door, used by the Pope on important occasions such as [[Palm Sunday]].\n\nA screen or ''transenna'' in marble by [[Mino da Fiesole]], [[Andrea Bregno]], and [[Giovanni Dalmata]] divides the chapel into two parts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hersey|1993|p=180}}</ref> Originally these made equal space for the members of the Papal Chapel within the sanctuary near the [[altar]] and the pilgrims and townsfolk without. However, with growth in the number of those attending the Pope, the screen was moved giving a reduced area for the faithful laity. The ''transenna'' is surmounted by a row of ornate candlesticks, once gilt, and has a wooden door, where once there was an ornate door of gilded wrought iron. The sculptors of the ''transenna'' also provided the ''cantoria'' or projecting choir gallery.\n\n== Decoration ==\n[[File:Sistine Chapel vertical scheme.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|Diagram of part of the vertical fresco decoration of the Sistine Chapel]]\n\n=== History ===\nThe first stage in the decoration of the Sistine Chapel was the painting of the ceiling in blue, studded with gilt stars,<ref name=\"Shearman\" /> and with decorative borders around the architectural details of the pendentives. This was entirely replaced when Michelangelo came to work on the ceiling in 1508.\n\nOf the present scheme of frescos, the earliest part is that of the side walls. They are divided into three main tiers. The central tier of the walls has two cycles of paintings, which complement each other, ''The Life of Moses'' and ''The Life of Christ''. They were commissioned in 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV and executed by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, [[Cosimo Roselli]] and their workshops. They originally ran all round the walls, but have since been replaced on both end walls.\n\nThe project was perhaps supervised by Perugino, who arrived at the chapel prior to the Florentines. It is probable that the commission of Ghirlandaio, Botticelli and Roselli was part of a reconciliation project between [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the ''de facto'' ruler of [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], and [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel in the spring of 1481.\n\nBeneath the cycles of ''The Life of Moses'' and ''The Life of Christ'', the lower level of the walls is decorated with frescoed hangings in silver and gold. Above the narrative frescos, the upper tier is divided into two zones. At the lower level of the windows is a ''Gallery of Popes'' painted at the same time as the ''Lives''. Around the arched tops of the windows are areas known as the ''[[lunette]]s'' which contain the ''Ancestors of Christ'', painted by Michelangelo as part of the scheme for the ceiling.\n\nThe ceiling was commissioned by [[Pope Julius II]] and painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512. The commission was originally to paint the twelve apostles on the triangular [[pendentive]]s which support the vault; however, Michelangelo demanded a free hand in the pictorial content of the scheme. He painted a series of nine pictures showing ''God's Creation of the World'', ''God's Relationship with Mankind'', and ''Mankind's Fall from God's Grace''. On the large pendentives he painted twelve Biblical and Classical men and women who prophesied that God would send Jesus Christ for the salvation of mankind, and around the upper parts of the windows, the ''[[Ancestors of Christ]]''.\n\nIn 1515, [[Raphael]] was commissioned by [[Pope Leo X]] to design a series of ten tapestries to hang around the lower tier of the walls.<ref>{{Harvnb|Talvacchia|2007|p=150}}</ref> The tapestries depict events from the ''Life of St. Peter'' and the ''Life of St. Paul'', the founders of the Christian Church in Rome, as described in the [[Gospels]] and the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. Work began in mid-1515. Due to their large size, manufacture of the hangings was carried out in Brussels, and took four years under the hands of the weavers in the shop of [[Pieter van Aelst III|Pieter van Aelst]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Talvacchia|2007|p=152}}</ref> Raphael's tapestries were looted during the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527 and were either burnt for their precious metal content or were scattered around Europe. In the late 20th century, a set was reassembled from several further sets that had been made after the first set, and displayed again in the Sistine Chapel in 1983. The tapestries continue in use at occasional ceremonies of particular importance. The full-size preparatory [[cartoon]]s for seven of the ten tapestries are known as the [[Raphael Cartoons]] and are in London.<ref>Cheney, Iris. Review of \"Raphael's Cartoons in the Collection of Her Majesty The Queen and the Tapestries for the Sistine Chapel\" by John Shearman. ''The Art Bulletin'', Volume 56, No. 4, December 1974. 607\u2013609.</ref>\n\nAt this point, the decorative scheme displayed a consistent iconographical pattern. The tier of Popes, which, in the scheme intended by Pope Julius, would have appeared immediately below the Twelve Apostles, would have emphasised the [[apostolic succession]]. It has been argued that the present scheme shows the two Biblical Testaments merged in order to reveal the Old predicting and framing the New, synthesizing, the logic of the Christian Bible.<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins \"[https://www.academia.edu/8579071/_Eng_The_Sistine_Chapel_and_the_two_Testaments The Sistine Chapel and the two Testaments]\", 2013, (online, academia.edu)</ref>\n\nThis was disrupted by a further commission to Michelangelo to decorate the wall above the altar with ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'', 1537\u20131541. The painting of this scene necessitated the obliteration of two episodes from the ''Lives'', the ''Nativity of Jesus'' and the ''[[Moses#Biblical narrative|Finding of Moses]]''; several of the ''Popes'' and two sets of ''Ancestors''.\n\n== Frescoes ==\n[[File:Eventos de la vida de Mois\u00e9s (Sandro Botticelli).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Trials of Moses (Botticelli)|Trials of Moses]]'' by Botticelli]]\n\n=== Southern wall ===\nThe southern wall is decorated with the ''Stories of Moses'', painted in 1481\u20131482.

He felt he was more of a sculptor than a painter, and was suspicious that such a large-scale project was being offered to him by enemies as a set-up for an inevitable fall. For Michelangelo, the project was a distraction from the major marble sculpture that had preoccupied him for the previous few years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Graham-Dixon|2009|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe sources of Michelangelo's inspiration are not easily determined; both Joachite and [[Augustinian]] theologians were within the sphere of Julius' influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Graham-Dixon|2009|p=xi}}</ref>\n\n==== Ceiling ====\n{{Main|Sistine Chapel ceiling}}\n{{See also|Gallery of Sistine Chapel ceiling}}\n[[File:Chapelle sixtine plafond.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A section of the Sistine Chapel ceiling]]\nTo be able to reach the ceiling, Michelangelo needed a support; the first idea was by Julius' favoured architect [[Donato Bramante]], who wanted to build for him a [[Scaffolding|scaffold]] to be suspended in the air with ropes. However, Bramante did not successfully complete the task, and the structure he built was flawed. He had perforated the vault in order to lower strings to secure the scaffold. Michelangelo laughed when he saw the structure, and believed it would leave holes in the ceiling once the work was ended. He asked Bramante what was to happen when the painter reached the perforations, but the architect had no answer.\n\nThe matter was taken before the Pope, who ordered Michelangelo to build a scaffold of his own. Michelangelo created a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from holes in the wall, high up near the top of the windows. Contrary to popular belief, he did not lie on this scaffolding while he painted, but painted from a standing position.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.history.com/news/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-sistine-chapel |title=7 Things You May Not Know About the Sistine Chapel}}</ref>\n\nMichelangelo used bright colours, easily visible from the floor. On the lowest part of the ceiling he painted the ancestors of Christ. Above this he alternated male and female prophets, with [[Jonah]] over the altar. On the highest section, Michelangelo painted nine stories from the [[Book of Genesis]]. He was originally commissioned to paint only twelve figures, the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. He turned down the commission because he saw himself as a sculptor, not a painter. The Pope offered to allow Michelangelo to paint biblical scenes of his own choice as a compromise. After the work was finished, there were more than three hundred figures. His figures showed the creation, [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], and the [[Great Flood]].\n\nThe painted area is about 40&nbsp;m (131&nbsp;ft) long by 13&nbsp;m (43&nbsp;ft) wide. This means that Michelangelo painted well over {{convert|5000|sqft|m2}} of frescoes.<ref>{{citation |url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/famous_paintings/a/sischap_ceiling.htm |title=Michelangelo \u2013 The Sistine Chapel Ceiling, \"Seven Common Questions About the Frescoes\"}}</ref>\n\n====''Last Judgement''====<!---NOTE: BRITISH English in use. Do not remove the \"e\".--->\n{{Main|The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)}}\n[[File:Rome Sistine Chapel 01.jpg|thumb|Michelangelo's [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|''The Last Judgement'']]]]\n''[[The Last Judgement]]'' was painted by Michelangelo from 1535 to 1541, between two important historic events: the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] by mercenary forces of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1527, and the [[Council of Trent]] which commenced in 1545. The work was designed on a grand scale, and spans the entire wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel. The painting depicts the second coming of Christ on the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]] as described in the [[Revelation of John]], Chapter 20. High on the wall is the heroic figure of Christ, with the saints clustered in groups around him. At the bottom left of the painting the dead are raised from their graves and ascend to be judged. To the right are those who are assigned to [[Hell]] and are dragged down by demons.\n\n''The Last Judgement'' was an object of a bitter dispute between [[Pope Paul IV|Cardinal Carafa]] and Michelangelo. Because he depicted naked figures, the artist was accused of immorality and obscenity. A censorship campaign (known as the \"Fig-Leaf Campaign\") was organized by Carafa and Monsignor Sernini ([[Mantua]]'s ambassador) to remove the frescoes.\n\nThe Pope's Master of Ceremonies [[Biagio da Cesena]] said \"it was most disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully, and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather for the public baths and taverns.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Vasari|1987|p=379}}</ref> In response Michelangelo worked da Cesena's semblance into the scene as [[Minos]], judge of the underworld. It is said that when he complained to the Pope, the pontiff responded that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell, so the portrait would have to remain. Michelangelo also painted his own portrait, on the flayed skin held by [[St Bartholomew]].\n\nThe [[Sex organs|genitalia]] in the fresco were later covered by the artist [[Daniele da Volterra]], whom history remembers by the derogatory nickname \"Il Braghettone\" (\"the breeches-painter\").\n\n== Restoration and controversy ==\n{{Main|Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes}}\nThe Sistine Chapel's ceiling restoration began on 7 November 1984. The restoration complete, the chapel was re-opened to the public on 8 April 1994. The part of the restoration in the Sistine Chapel that has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by [[Michelangelo]]. The emergence of the brightly coloured [[Ancestors of Christ]] from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe and removed the original intent of the artist.\n[[File:Sistine Chapel Daniel beforandafter.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Daniel, before and after restoration.]]\nThe problem lies in the analysis and understanding of the techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to that understanding. A close examination of the frescoes of the [[lunette]]s convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in \"[[buon fresco]]\"; that is, the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state. In other words, Michelangelo did not work \"[[Fresco-secco|a secco]]\"; he did not come back later and add details onto the dry plaster.\n\nThe restorers, by assuming that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, have taken a universal approach to the restoration. A decision was made that all of the shadowy layer of animal glue and \"lamp black\", all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of one sort or another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts, and painted definition by later restorers in an attempt to enliven the appearance of the work. Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that have been provided, the [[Chemistry|chemists]] of the restoration team decided upon a [[solvent]] that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster. After treatment, only that which was painted \"buon fresco\" would remain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n{{clear left}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Cappella sistina, ricostruzione dell'interno prima degli interventi di Michelangelo, stampa del XIX secolo.jpg|View of the West wall before ''The Last Judgement''\nFile:Sistina con arazzi.jpg|Raphael tapestries in the Sistine Chapel\nFile:Marcello Venusti Juicio Universal Tempera Grassa sobre tabla 1549 Museo di Capodimonte.jpg|View of ''The Last Judgement'' as originally painted by Michelangelo\nFile:Assumption of Mary perugino drawing.jpg|Drawing by [[Pinturicchio]] of Perugino's lost ''Assumption'' in the Sistine Chapel.\n\n</gallery>\n\n== Replicas ==\n\nThe only reproduction of the Sistine Chapel ceiling was painted by Gary Bevans at [[English Martyrs' Catholic Church, Goring-by-Sea|English Martyrs' Catholic Church]] in [[Goring-by-Sea]], [[Worthing]], West Sussex, England.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.sistinechapeluk.co.uk/ |title=Welcome to The Sistine Chapel Reproduction United Kingdom}}</ref> A full-size architectural and photographic replica of the entire building was commissioned by the Mexican Government and funded by private donors.<ref>{{citation |url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/sistine-chapel-replica-mexico-515072 |title=Vatican Approves $2.4 Million Replica of Sistine Chapel in Mexico City}}</ref> It was on view at Mexico City from 1 June to 15 July 2016; it may then be exhibited at other Mexican cities and possibly elsewhere in the world.

Originally known as the ''Cappella Magna'' ('Great Chapel'), the chapel takes its name from [[Pope Sixtus IV]], who restored it between 1473 and 1481. Since that time, the chapel has served as a place of both religious and functionary papal activity. Today, it is the site of the [[papal conclave]], the process by which a new pope is selected. The fame of the Sistine Chapel lies mainly in the [[fresco]]s that decorate the interior, most particularly the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] and ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' by [[Michelangelo]].\n\nDuring the reign of Sixtus IV, a team of [[Italian Renaissance painting|Renaissance painters]] that included [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Pinturicchio]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]], created a series of frescos depicting the ''Life of Moses'' and the ''Life of Christ'', offset by papal portraits above and ''[[trompe-l'\u0153il]]'' drapery below. These paintings were completed in 1482, and on 15 August 1483 Sixtus IV celebrated the first [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] in the Sistine Chapel for the Feast of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].<ref name=\"Pietrangeli1986\">{{Harvnb|Pietrangeli|1986|p=28}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Monfasani |first=John |year=1983 |title=A Description of the Sistine Chapel under Pope Sixtus IV |journal=Artibus et Historiae |volume=4 |issue=7 |pages=9\u201318 |issn=0391-9064 |url=http://www.artibusethistoriae.org/?menu=art&gdzie=artibusChapterResult&id=68 |doi=10.2307/1483178 |publisher=IRSA s.c. |postscript=. |jstor=1483178}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1508 and 1512, under the patronage of [[Pope Julius II]], [[Michelangelo]] painted [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|the chapel's ceiling]], a project which changed the course of Western art and is regarded as one of the major artistic accomplishments of human civilization.<ref>Gardner, Helen (1970) ''Art through the Ages'', p. 469, Harcourt, Brace and World. {{ISBN|978-0-15-508315-8}}</ref><ref>Robert Coughlan, ''The World of Michelangelo'', Time-Life International, (1966) p. 116</ref> In a different climate, after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], he returned and, between 1535 and 1541, painted ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' for Popes [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] and [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]].<ref>Robert Coughlan,  p. 127</ref> The fame of Michelangelo's paintings has drawn multitudes of visitors to the chapel ever since they were revealed five hundred years ago.\n\n== History ==\nWhile known as the location of [[Papal conclave]]s, the primary function of the Sistine Chapel is as the chapel of the [[Papal Chapel]] (''Cappella Pontificia''), one of the two bodies of the [[Papal household]], called until 1968 the ''Papal Court'' (''Pontificalis Aula''). At the time of Pope Sixtus IV in the late 15th century, the [[Papal Chapel]] comprised about 200 people, including clerics, officials of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and distinguished laity. There were 50 occasions during the year on which it was prescribed by the Papal Calendar that the whole Papal Chapel should meet.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pietrangeli|1986|p=24}}</ref> Of these 50 occasions, 35 were masses, of which 8 were held in Basilicas, in general [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]], and were attended by large congregations. These included the Christmas Day and Easter masses, at which the Pope himself was the [[Liturgy|celebrant]]. The other 27 masses could be held in a smaller, less public space, for which the ''Cappella Maggiore'' was used before it was rebuilt on the same site as the Sistine Chapel.\n\nThe ''Cappella Maggiore'' derived its name, the Greater Chapel, from the fact that there was another chapel also in use by the Pope and his retinue for daily worship. At the time of Pope Sixtus IV, this was the Chapel of [[Pope Nicholas V]], which had been decorated by [[Fra Angelico]]. The ''Cappella Maggiore ''is recorded as existing in 1368. According to a communication from Andreas of Trebizond to Pope Sixtus IV, by the time of its demolition to make way for the present chapel, the ''Cappella Maggiore ''was in a ruinous state with its walls leaning.<ref name=\"Shearman\">John Shearman, \"The Chapel of Sixtus IV\".

After its completion, the chapel was decorated with frescoes by a number of the most famous artists of the [[High Renaissance]], including [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino]], and [[Michelangelo]].<ref name=\"Shearman\" />\n\nThe first [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] in the Sistine Chapel was celebrated on 15 August 1483, the Feast of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/CSN/CSN_Storia.html |title=The Sistine Chapel |work=Vatican Museums |accessdate=9 August 2013 |postscript=}}</ref>\n\nThe Sistine Chapel has maintained its function to the present day and continues to host the important services of the Papal Calendar, unless the Pope is travelling. There is a permanent choir, the [[Sistine Chapel Choir]], for whom much original music has been written, the most famous piece being [[Gregorio Allegri]]'s ''[[Miserere (Allegri)|Miserere]]''.<ref>[[Abel Stevens|Stevens, Abel]] & Floy, James. \"Allegri's Miserere\". ''The National Magazine'', Carlton & Phillip, 1854. 531.</ref>\n\n=== Papal conclave ===\n{{Main|Papal conclave}}\nOne of the functions of the Sistine Chapel is as a venue for the election of each successive pope in a [[Papal conclave|conclave]] of the [[College of Cardinals]]. On the occasion of a conclave, a chimney is installed in the roof of the chapel, from which smoke arises as a signal. If white smoke, which is created by burning the ballots of the election, appears, a new Pope has been elected. If a candidate receives less than a two-thirds vote, the cardinals send up black smoke\u2014created by burning the ballots along with wet straw and chemical additives\u2014it means that no successful election has yet occurred.<ref>Saunders, Fr. William P. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111005421/http://www.catholicherald.com/saunders/05ws/ws050317.htm The Path to the Papacy]\". ''Arlington Catholic Herald'', 17 March 2005. Retrieved on 2 June 2008.</ref>\n\nThe first papal conclave to be held on the Sistine Chapel was the [[papal conclave, 1492|conclave of 1492]], which took place from 6 to 11 August of the same year and in which [[Pope Alexander VI]], also known as Rodrigo Borja, was elected.\n\nThe conclave also provided for the cardinals a space in which they could hear mass, and in which they could eat, sleep, and pass time attended by servants. From 1455, conclaves have been held in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]; until the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]], they were held in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] convent of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Chambers |first=D.

After the new Pope accepts his election, he would give his new name; at this time, the other Cardinals would tug on a rope attached to their seats to lower their canopies. Until reforms instituted by [[Saint Pius X]], the canopies were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] abolished the canopies altogether, since, under his papacy, the population of the College of Cardinals had increased so much to the point that they would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the canopies obstruct the view of the cardinals in the back row. In the wake of a conclave taking place to preserve the integrity of the rubble floor on the Sistine Chapel, carpenters install a slightly elevated wooden floor alongside a wooden ramp in the entrance for those Cardinals who for one reason or another need to be transported in a wheelchair.\n\n== Architecture ==\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:Cappella Sistina - 2005.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Sistine Chapel]]\nThe chapel is a high rectangular building, for which absolute measurements are hard to ascertain, as available measurements are for the interior: {{convert|40.9|m|ft}} long by {{convert|13.4|m|ft}} wide, the [[dimension]]s of the [[Temple of Solomon]], as given in the [[Old Testament]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Campbell |first=Ian |title=The New St Peter's: Basilica or Temple? |journal=Oxford Art Journal |year=1981 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=3\u20138 |issn=0142-6540 |doi=10.1093/oxartj/4.1.3 |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/129:255/Readings/New%20St.%20Peter's%20Basilica%20or%20Temple.pdf |postscript=. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016125528/http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/129:255/Readings/New%20St.%20Peter's%20Basilica%20or%20Temple.pdf |archive-date=16 October 2015 }}\n</ref>\n\nIts exterior is unadorned by architectural or decorative details, as is common in many Italian churches of the [[Medieval architecture|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] eras. It has no exterior fa\u00e7ade or exterior processional doorways, as the ingress has always been from internal rooms within the [[Apostolic Palace]] (Papal Palace), and the exterior can be seen only from nearby windows and light-wells in the palace. Subsidence and cracking of masonry such as must also have affected the Cappella Maggiore has necessitated the building of very large [[buttress]]es to brace the exterior walls. The accretion of other buildings has further altered the exterior appearance of the Chapel.\n\nThe building is divided into three stories of which the lowest is a very tall basement level with several utilitarian windows and a doorway giving onto the exterior court. Internally, the basement is robustly vaulted to support the chapel. Above is the main space, the Sistine Chapel, the vaulted ceiling rising to {{convert|20.7|m|ft}}. The building had six tall arched windows down each side and two at either end, several of which have been blocked. Above the vault is a third story with wardrooms for guards. At this level, an open projecting [[wikt:gangway|gangway]] was constructed, which encircled the building supported on an arcade springing from the walls. The gangway has been roofed as it was a continual source of water leaking in to the vault of the Chapel.\n\n=== Interior of the Sistine Chapel ===\nThe general proportions of the chapel use the length as the unit of measurement. This has been divided by three to get the width and by two to get the height. Maintaining the ratio, there were six windows down each side and two at either end. Defined proportions were a feature of [[Renaissance architecture]] and reflected the growing interest in the Classical heritage of Rome.\n\n[[File:Cappella sistina, ricostruzione dell'interno prima degli interventi di Michelangelo, stampa del XIX secolo.jpg|thumb|left|A reconstruction of the appearance of the chapel in the 1480s, prior to the painting of the ceiling]]\nThe ceiling of the chapel is a flattened [[barrel vault]] springing from a course that encircles the walls at the level of the springing of the window arches. This barrel vault is cut transversely by smaller vaults over each window, which divide the barrel vault at its lowest level into a series of large [[pendentive]]s rising from shallow pilasters between each window. The barrel vault was originally painted brilliant-blue and dotted with gold stars, to the design of [[Piermatteo Lauro de' Manfredi da Amelia]].<ref name=\"Shearman\" /> The pavement is in [[opus alexandrinum]], a decorative style using marble and coloured stone in a pattern that reflects the earlier proportion in the division of the interior and also marks the processional way from the main door, used by the Pope on important occasions such as [[Palm Sunday]].\n\nA screen or ''transenna'' in marble by [[Mino da Fiesole]], [[Andrea Bregno]], and [[Giovanni Dalmata]] divides the chapel into two parts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hersey|1993|p=180}}</ref> Originally these made equal space for the members of the Papal Chapel within the sanctuary near the [[altar]] and the pilgrims and townsfolk without. However, with growth in the number of those attending the Pope, the screen was moved giving a reduced area for the faithful laity. The ''transenna'' is surmounted by a row of ornate candlesticks, once gilt, and has a wooden door, where once there was an ornate door of gilded wrought iron. The sculptors of the ''transenna'' also provided the ''cantoria'' or projecting choir gallery.\n\n== Decoration ==\n[[File:Sistine Chapel vertical scheme.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|Diagram of part of the vertical fresco decoration of the Sistine Chapel]]\n\n=== History ===\nThe first stage in the decoration of the Sistine Chapel was the painting of the ceiling in blue, studded with gilt stars,<ref name=\"Shearman\" /> and with decorative borders around the architectural details of the pendentives. This was entirely replaced when Michelangelo came to work on the ceiling in 1508.\n\nOf the present scheme of frescos, the earliest part is that of the side walls. They are divided into three main tiers. The central tier of the walls has two cycles of paintings, which complement each other, ''The Life of Moses'' and ''The Life of Christ''. They were commissioned in 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV and executed by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, [[Cosimo Roselli]] and their workshops. They originally ran all round the walls, but have since been replaced on both end walls.\n\nThe project was perhaps supervised by Perugino, who arrived at the chapel prior to the Florentines. It is probable that the commission of Ghirlandaio, Botticelli and Roselli was part of a reconciliation project between [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the ''de facto'' ruler of [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], and [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel in the spring of 1481.\n\nBeneath the cycles of ''The Life of Moses'' and ''The Life of Christ'', the lower level of the walls is decorated with frescoed hangings in silver and gold. Above the narrative frescos, the upper tier is divided into two zones. At the lower level of the windows is a ''Gallery of Popes'' painted at the same time as the ''Lives''. Around the arched tops of the windows are areas known as the ''[[lunette]]s'' which contain the ''Ancestors of Christ'', painted by Michelangelo as part of the scheme for the ceiling.\n\nThe ceiling was commissioned by [[Pope Julius II]] and painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512. The commission was originally to paint the twelve apostles on the triangular [[pendentive]]s which support the vault; however, Michelangelo demanded a free hand in the pictorial content of the scheme. He painted a series of nine pictures showing ''God's Creation of the World'', ''God's Relationship with Mankind'', and ''Mankind's Fall from God's Grace''. On the large pendentives he painted twelve Biblical and Classical men and women who prophesied that God would send Jesus Christ for the salvation of mankind, and around the upper parts of the windows, the ''[[Ancestors of Christ]]''.\n\nIn 1515, [[Raphael]] was commissioned by [[Pope Leo X]] to design a series of ten tapestries to hang around the lower tier of the walls.<ref>{{Harvnb|Talvacchia|2007|p=150}}</ref> The tapestries depict events from the ''Life of St. Peter'' and the ''Life of St. Paul'', the founders of the Christian Church in Rome, as described in the [[Gospels]] and the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. Work began in mid-1515. Due to their large size, manufacture of the hangings was carried out in Brussels, and took four years under the hands of the weavers in the shop of [[Pieter van Aelst III|Pieter van Aelst]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Talvacchia|2007|p=152}}</ref> Raphael's tapestries were looted during the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527 and were either burnt for their precious metal content or were scattered around Europe. In the late 20th century, a set was reassembled from several further sets that had been made after the first set, and displayed again in the Sistine Chapel in 1983. The tapestries continue in use at occasional ceremonies of particular importance. The full-size preparatory [[cartoon]]s for seven of the ten tapestries are known as the [[Raphael Cartoons]] and are in London.<ref>Cheney, Iris. Review of \"Raphael's Cartoons in the Collection of Her Majesty The Queen and the Tapestries for the Sistine Chapel\" by John Shearman. ''The Art Bulletin'', Volume 56, No. 4, December 1974. 607\u2013609.</ref>\n\nAt this point, the decorative scheme displayed a consistent iconographical pattern. The tier of Popes, which, in the scheme intended by Pope Julius, would have appeared immediately below the Twelve Apostles, would have emphasised the [[apostolic succession]]. It has been argued that the present scheme shows the two Biblical Testaments merged in order to reveal the Old predicting and framing the New, synthesizing, the logic of the Christian Bible.<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins \"[https://www.academia.edu/8579071/_Eng_The_Sistine_Chapel_and_the_two_Testaments The Sistine Chapel and the two Testaments]\", 2013, (online, academia.edu)</ref>\n\nThis was disrupted by a further commission to Michelangelo to decorate the wall above the altar with ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'', 1537\u20131541. The painting of this scene necessitated the obliteration of two episodes from the ''Lives'', the ''Nativity of Jesus'' and the ''[[Moses#Biblical narrative|Finding of Moses]]''; several of the ''Popes'' and two sets of ''Ancestors''.\n\n== Frescoes ==\n[[File:Eventos de la vida de Mois\u00e9s (Sandro Botticelli).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Trials of Moses (Botticelli)|Trials of Moses]]'' by Botticelli]]\n\n=== Southern wall ===\nThe southern wall is decorated with the ''Stories of Moses'', painted in 1481\u20131482.

The work was completed between 1508 and late 1512.<ref name=\"Dixon2\">{{Harvnb|Graham-Dixon|2009|p=2}}</ref> He painted the ''[[Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]'' over the [[altar]], between 1535 and 1541, on commission from [[Pope Paul III]] Farnese.<ref>{{Citation |last=Stollhans |first=Cynthia |year=1988 |title=Michelangelo's Nude Saint Catherine of Alexandria |journal=Woman's Art Journal |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=26\u201330 |issn=0270-7993 |doi=10.2307/1358651 |publisher=Woman's Art, Inc. |postscript=. |jstor=1358651}}</ref>\n\nMichelangelo was intimidated by the scale of the commission, and made it known from the outset of Julius II's approach that he would prefer to decline. He felt he was more of a sculptor than a painter, and was suspicious that such a large-scale project was being offered to him by enemies as a set-up for an inevitable fall. For Michelangelo, the project was a distraction from the major marble sculpture that had preoccupied him for the previous few years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Graham-Dixon|2009|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe sources of Michelangelo's inspiration are not easily determined; both Joachite and [[Augustinian]] theologians were within the sphere of Julius' influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Graham-Dixon|2009|p=xi}}</ref>\n\n==== Ceiling ====\n{{Main|Sistine Chapel ceiling}}\n{{See also|Gallery of Sistine Chapel ceiling}}\n[[File:Chapelle sixtine plafond.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A section of the Sistine Chapel ceiling]]\nTo be able to reach the ceiling, Michelangelo needed a support; the first idea was by Julius' favoured architect [[Donato Bramante]], who wanted to build for him a [[Scaffolding|scaffold]] to be suspended in the air with ropes. However, Bramante did not successfully complete the task, and the structure he built was flawed. He had perforated the vault in order to lower strings to secure the scaffold. Michelangelo laughed when he saw the structure, and believed it would leave holes in the ceiling once the work was ended. He asked Bramante what was to happen when the painter reached the perforations, but the architect had no answer.\n\nThe matter was taken before the Pope, who ordered Michelangelo to build a scaffold of his own. Michelangelo created a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from holes in the wall, high up near the top of the windows. Contrary to popular belief, he did not lie on this scaffolding while he painted, but painted from a standing position.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.history.com/news/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-sistine-chapel |title=7 Things You May Not Know About the Sistine Chapel}}</ref>\n\nMichelangelo used bright colours, easily visible from the floor. On the lowest part of the ceiling he painted the ancestors of Christ. Above this he alternated male and female prophets, with [[Jonah]] over the altar. On the highest section, Michelangelo painted nine stories from the [[Book of Genesis]]. He was originally commissioned to paint only twelve figures, the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. He turned down the commission because he saw himself as a sculptor, not a painter. The Pope offered to allow Michelangelo to paint biblical scenes of his own choice as a compromise. After the work was finished, there were more than three hundred figures. His figures showed the creation, [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], and the [[Great Flood]].\n\nThe painted area is about 40&nbsp;m (131&nbsp;ft) long by 13&nbsp;m (43&nbsp;ft) wide. This means that Michelangelo painted well over {{convert|5000|sqft|m2}} of frescoes.<ref>{{citation |url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/famous_paintings/a/sischap_ceiling.htm |title=Michelangelo \u2013 The Sistine Chapel Ceiling, \"Seven Common Questions About the Frescoes\"}}</ref>\n\n====''Last Judgement''====<!---NOTE: BRITISH English in use. Do not remove the \"e\".--->\n{{Main|The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)}}\n[[File:Rome Sistine Chapel 01.jpg|thumb|Michelangelo's [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|''The Last Judgement'']]]]\n''[[The Last Judgement]]'' was painted by Michelangelo from 1535 to 1541, between two important historic events: the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] by mercenary forces of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1527, and the [[Council of Trent]] which commenced in 1545. The work was designed on a grand scale, and spans the entire wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel. The painting depicts the second coming of Christ on the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]] as described in the [[Revelation of John]], Chapter 20. High on the wall is the heroic figure of Christ, with the saints clustered in groups around him. At the bottom left of the painting the dead are raised from their graves and ascend to be judged. To the right are those who are assigned to [[Hell]] and are dragged down by demons.\n\n''The Last Judgement'' was an object of a bitter dispute between [[Pope Paul IV|Cardinal Carafa]] and Michelangelo. Because he depicted naked figures, the artist was accused of immorality and obscenity. A censorship campaign (known as the \"Fig-Leaf Campaign\") was organized by Carafa and Monsignor Sernini ([[Mantua]]'s ambassador) to remove the frescoes.\n\nThe Pope's Master of Ceremonies [[Biagio da Cesena]] said \"it was most disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully, and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather for the public baths and taverns.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Vasari|1987|p=379}}</ref> In response Michelangelo worked da Cesena's semblance into the scene as [[Minos]], judge of the underworld. It is said that when he complained to the Pope, the pontiff responded that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell, so the portrait would have to remain. Michelangelo also painted his own portrait, on the flayed skin held by [[St Bartholomew]].\n\nThe [[Sex organs|genitalia]] in the fresco were later covered by the artist [[Daniele da Volterra]], whom history remembers by the derogatory nickname \"Il Braghettone\" (\"the breeches-painter\").\n\n== Restoration and controversy ==\n{{Main|Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes}}\nThe Sistine Chapel's ceiling restoration began on 7 November 1984. The restoration complete, the chapel was re-opened to the public on 8 April 1994. The part of the restoration in the Sistine Chapel that has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by [[Michelangelo]]. The emergence of the brightly coloured [[Ancestors of Christ]] from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe and removed the original intent of the artist.\n[[File:Sistine Chapel Daniel beforandafter.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Daniel, before and after restoration.]]\nThe problem lies in the analysis and understanding of the techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to that understanding. A close examination of the frescoes of the [[lunette]]s convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in \"[[buon fresco]]\"; that is, the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state. In other words, Michelangelo did not work \"[[Fresco-secco|a secco]]\"; he did not come back later and add details onto the dry plaster.\n\nThe restorers, by assuming that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, have taken a universal approach to the restoration. A decision was made that all of the shadowy layer of animal glue and \"lamp black\", all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of one sort or another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts, and painted definition by later restorers in an attempt to enliven the appearance of the work. Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that have been provided, the [[Chemistry|chemists]] of the restoration team decided upon a [[solvent]] that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster. After treatment, only that which was painted \"buon fresco\" would remain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n{{clear left}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Cappella sistina, ricostruzione dell'interno prima degli interventi di Michelangelo, stampa del XIX secolo.jpg|View of the West wall before ''The Last Judgement''\nFile:Sistina con arazzi.jpg|Raphael tapestries in the Sistine Chapel\nFile:Marcello Venusti Juicio Universal Tempera Grassa sobre tabla 1549 Museo di Capodimonte.jpg|View of ''The Last Judgement'' as originally painted by Michelangelo\nFile:Assumption of Mary perugino drawing.jpg|Drawing by [[Pinturicchio]] of Perugino's lost ''Assumption'' in the Sistine Chapel.\n\n</gallery>\n\n== Replicas ==\n\nThe only reproduction of the Sistine Chapel ceiling was painted by Gary Bevans at [[English Martyrs' Catholic Church, Goring-by-Sea|English Martyrs' Catholic Church]] in [[Goring-by-Sea]], [[Worthing]], West Sussex, England.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.sistinechapeluk.co.uk/ |title=Welcome to The Sistine Chapel Reproduction United Kingdom}}</ref> A full-size architectural and photographic replica of the entire building was commissioned by the Mexican Government and funded by private donors.<ref>{{citation |url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/sistine-chapel-replica-mexico-515072 |title=Vatican Approves $2.4 Million Replica of Sistine Chapel in Mexico City}}</ref> It was on view at Mexico City from 1 June to 15 July 2016; it may then be exhibited at other Mexican cities and possibly elsewhere in the world.
