M. Barrie]]. A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and [[Puer aeternus|never grows up]], Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of [[Neverland]] as the leader of the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]], interacting with [[Fairy|fairies]], [[Piracy|pirate]]s, [[mermaid]]s, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.\n\nPeter Pan has become a [[cultural icon]] symbolizing youthful innocence and escapism. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include the [[Peter Pan (1924 film)|1924 silent film]], [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|1953 Disney animated film]], a [[Peter Pan (2003 film)|2003 dramatic/live-action film]], a television series and many other works.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Peter Pan, by Oliver Herford, 1907.png|thumb|170px|1907 illustration of Peter Pan by [[Oliver Herford]] ]]\n\nPeter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' (1902), an adult novel. In chapters 13\u201318, entitled \"Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens\", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to [[Kensington Gardens]] in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as a \"betwixt-and-between\" a boy and a bird. Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, [[Hodder and Stoughton]], extracted these chapters of ''The Little White Bird'' and published them in 1906 under the title ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'', with the addition of illustrations by [[Arthur Rackham]].<ref>{{cite book|title=J.M. Barrie & the Lost Boys |last=Birkin |first=Andrew |year=2003|publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=0-300-09822-7|page = 47}}</ref>\n\nBarrie returned to the character of Peter Pan as the centre of his [[stage play]] entitled ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'', which premiered on 27 December 1904 in London. Barrie later adapted and expanded the play's storyline as a [[novel]], published in 1911 as ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''.\n\nJ. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<ref>Birkin, Andrew. ''J.M. Barrie and the Lost Boys.'' Yale University Press, 1986.</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\nBarrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the reader and the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play, Peter's outfit is made of autumn leaves and cobwebs.<ref>Barrie, J. M. ''Peter Pan'' (play). Hodder & Stoughton, 1928, Act I, Scene 1</ref> His name and playing the [[Pan flute|flute or pipes]] suggest the mythological character [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. Barrie mentions in ''Peter and Wendy'' that Peter Pan still had all his \"first teeth\".<ref name=\"chap1\">Barrie, J. M. ''Peter and Wendy''. Hodder & Stoughton, 1911, Chapter 1.</ref> He describes him as a beautiful boy with a beautiful smile, \"clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that flow from trees\".<ref name=\"chap1\"/>\n\nTraditionally, the character has been played on stage by a petite adult woman.<ref>Bruce K. Hanson. ''Peter Pan on Stage and Screen 1904\u20132010''. McFarland, 2011</ref> In the original productions in the UK, Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tights, such as that worn by [[Nina Boucicault]] in 1904. This costume is exhibited at Barrie's Birthplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/j-m-barries-birthplace |title=J M Barrie's Birthplace |publisher=Nts.org.uk |date= |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref> The similar costume worn by [[Pauline Chase]] (who played the role from 1906 to 1913) is displayed in the [[Museum of London]]. Early editions of adaptations of the story also depict a red costume<ref>Daniel O'Connor, illustrated by Alice B. Woodward. ''The Peter Pan Picture Book''. Bell & Sons, 1907.</ref><ref>''Peter Pan's ABC'' illustrated by Flora White. Hodder & Stoughton, 1913</ref> but a green costume (whether or not made of leaves) becomes more usual from the 1920s,<ref>May Byron, illustrated by Mabel Lucie Atwell, ''Peter Pan and Wendy''. Hodder & Stoughton, 1921.</ref> and more so later after the release of Disney's animated movie.\n\nIn the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights apparently made of cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed [[elf]]-like ears, brown eyes and his hair is red.\n\nIn ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991), the character is played as an adult by [[Robin Williams]], with blue eyes and dark brown hair; in flashbacks to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. His ears appear pointed only when he is Peter Pan, not as Peter Banning.<!--The name is not \"Panning\"; please read the film credits--> His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap).\n\nIn the live-action [[Peter Pan (2003 film)|2003 ''Peter Pan'' film]], he is portrayed by [[Jeremy Sumpter]], with blond hair, blue eyes, bare feet and a costume made of leaves and vines.\n\n==Age==\nIn ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' (1902) and ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'' (1906), he was only seven days old.\n\nAlthough his age is not stated in Barrie's [[Peter and Wendy|play]] (1904) or [[Peter and Wendy|novel]] (1911), the novel mentions that he still had all his [[Deciduous teeth|baby teeth]]. In other ways, the character appears to be about 12\u201313 years old.\n\n==Personality==\nPeter is an exaggerated stereotype of a boastful and careless boy. He claims greatness, even when such claims are questionable (such as congratulating himself when Wendy re-attaches his shadow). In the play and book, Peter symbolises the selfishness of childhood, and is portrayed as being forgetful and self-centred.\n\nPeter has a nonchalant, devil-may-care attitude, and is fearlessly cocky when it comes to putting himself in danger. Barrie writes that when Peter thought he was going to die on Marooners' Rock, he felt scared, yet he felt only one shudder. With this blithe attitude, he says, \"To die will be an awfully big adventure\". In the play, the unseen and unnamed narrator ponders what might have been if Peter had stayed with Wendy, so that his cry might have become, \"To live would be an awfully big adventure!\", \"but he can never quite get the hang of it\".<ref>Barrie, J. M. ''Peter Pan''. Hodder & Stoughton, 1928, Act V, Scene 2.</ref>\n\n==Abilities==\nPeter's archetypal quality is his unending youth. In ''Peter and Wendy'', it is explained that Peter must forget his own adventures and what he learns about the world in order to stay childlike.\n\nPeter's ability to fly is explained, but inconsistently. In ''The Little White Bird'', he is able to fly because he is said to be part bird, like all babies. In the play and novel, he teaches the Darling children to fly using a combination of \"lovely wonderful thoughts\" and fairy dust. In Barrie's Dedication to the play ''Peter Pan, The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow up'',<ref>Barrie, J. M. ''Peter Pan''. Hodder & Stoughton, 1928, \"To the Five \u2013 A Dedication\".</ref> the author attributes the idea of fairy dust being necessary for flight to practical needs:\n<blockquote>\n...after the first production I had to add something to the play at the request of parents (who thus showed that they thought me the responsible person) about no one being able to fly until the fairy dust had been blown on him; so many children having gone home and tried it from their beds and needed surgical attention. <small> \u2013 J. M. Barrie</small>\n</blockquote>\n\nPeter has an effect on the whole of Neverland and its inhabitants when he is there. Barrie states that although Neverland appears different to every child, the island \"wakes up\" when Peter returns from his trip to London. In the chapter \"The Mermaids' Lagoon\" in the book ''Peter and Wendy'', Barrie writes that there is almost nothing that Peter cannot do. He is a skilled [[swordsman]], rivalling even Captain Hook, whose hand he cut off in a duel. He has remarkably keen vision and hearing. He is skilled in mimicry, copying the voice of Hook and the ticking of the clock in the crocodile.\n\nPeter has the ability to imagine things into existence and he is able to feel danger when it is near.\n\nIn ''Peter and Wendy'', Barrie states that the Peter Pan legend Mrs Darling heard as a child was that when children died, he accompanied them part of the way to their destination so they would not be frightened.\n\nIn the original play, Peter states that no one must ever touch him (though he does not know why). The stage directions specify that no one does so throughout the play. Wendy approaches Peter to give him a \"kiss\" (thimble), but is prevented by [[Tinker Bell]]. However, [[John Caird (director)|John Caird]] and [[Trevor Nunn|Trevor Nunn's]] introduction to the script for the 1997 [[Royal National Theatre]] production, states that this was never Barrie's original intention, and was only added for a production in 1927, where [[Jean Forbes-Robertson]] took the title role, and played the part with a lighter, more fairy-like, physicality. Robertson was to play the part almost every year until 1939.\n\n== Cultural allusions ==\nThe character's name comes from two sources: [[Peter Llewelyn Davies]], one of the five Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired the story, and [[Pan (god)|Pan]], a minor deity of Greek mythology who plays [[pan flute|pipes]] to [[nymphs]] and is part human and part goat. This is referenced in Barrie's works (particularly ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'') where Peter Pan plays pipes to the fairies and rides a goat. The god Pan represents Nature or Man's natural state in contrast to Civilisation and the effects of upbringing on human behaviour. Peter Pan is a free spirit, being too young to be burdened with the effects of education or to have an adult appreciation of moral responsibility. As a 'betwixt-and-between', who can fly and speak the language of fairies and birds, Peter is part animal and part human. According to psychologist [[Rosalind Ridley]], by comparing Peter's behaviour to adults and to other animals, Barrie raises many post-Darwinian questions about the origins of human nature and behaviour. As 'the boy who wouldn't grow up', Peter exhibits many aspects of the stages of cognitive development seen in children and can be regarded as Barrie's memory of himself as a child, being both charmingly childlike and childishly solipsistic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Peter Pan and the Mind of J. M. Barrie|last=Ridley|first=Rosalind |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4438-9107-3|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\n{{Main|Characters of Peter Pan}}\n\n===Family===\nPeter Pan ran away from his parents when he was a baby as told in ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'' and ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''. Finding the window closed and seeing a new baby in the house when he returned some time later, he believed his parents no longer wanted him and never came back. This younger sibling is referred to in the chapter \"Lock-Out Time\" in ''Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens'' but is not mentioned again.\n\n===Friends===\n\n====Maimie Mannering====\nWhile in Kensington Gardens, Peter meets a lost girl named Maimie Mannering and the two quickly become friends. Peter proposes marriage to Maimie. While Maimie wants to stay in the Gardens with Peter, she comes to realise that her mother is so worried that she must return to her. Maimie promises to always remember Peter and goes back to her mother. When Maimie grows up, she continues to think of Peter, dedicating presents and letters to him. To remember Maimie, Peter rides the imaginary goat that Maimie created for him. She is considered to be the literary predecessor of [[Wendy Darling]].<ref>Rose, Jacqueline. ''The Case of Peter Pan, Or, The Impossibility of Children's Fiction'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 1984, p. 28.</ref>\n\n====The Darlings====\n\n=====Wendy Darling=====\n{{Main|Wendy Darling}} It is hinted that Wendy may have romantic feelings for Peter, but unrequited because of his inability to love. In the 2003 film ''[[Peter Pan (2003 film)|Peter Pan]],'' the feeling is mutual. Captain Hook can only take away Peter's ability to fly by thoughts of Wendy leaving him, growing up, and replacing him with a husband. Wendy saves Peter by giving him her hidden kiss (signifying he is her true love); this gives him the will to live. In the movie ''[[Hook (movie)|Hook]],'' an older Wendy implies that she used to (and perhaps, still does) have feelings for Peter, saying that she was shocked that he did not prevent her wedding day. In the sequel to the 1953 Disney film, ''[[Return to Neverland]],'' Peter and a grown-up Wendy are briefly, but happily, reunited after many years and continue to show feelings for each other.\n\nIn the original novel, Peter later befriends Wendy's daughter Jane (and her subsequent daughter Margaret), and it is implied that this pattern will go on forever. From time to time Peter visits the real world, and befriends children. Wendy Darling, whom he recruited to be his \"mother\", is the most significant of them; he also brings her brothers [[John Darling (Peter Pan)|John]] and [[Michael Darling (Peter Pan)|Michael]] to Neverland at her request. It is mentioned that Wendy was the only girl who captured his attention.\n\n=====John Darling and Michael Darling=====\n\nJohn, the older brother of the Darlings, proves to be extremely mature for his age. He becomes fascinated with piracy and imitates Captain Hook while playing at home with his siblings. Not only sophisticated, John is also courageous and smart. Peter typically tasks John with the responsibility of directing the Lost Boys when Peter is absent. Michael, the youngest of the Darlings, is convinced that Peter Pan is a real person after hearing Wendy's passionate narratives about him. During nursery games, it is Michael who plays the role of Peter Pan whom he looks up to.\n\n=====Mary and George Darling=====\n\nThe parents of Wendy, John and Michael. Mr. Darling works as a clerk in the [[City of London|City]], and is named after George Llewelyn Davies. Mrs. Darling is named after Mary Ansell, Barrie's wife.\n\n====Neverland inhabitants====\n=====Tiger Lily=====\nTiger Lily is the daughter of Great Big Little Panther, the chief of the Piccaninny [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe resident in Neverland. Barrie refers to her as \"a princess in her own right\", and she is often described as such. She is kidnapped by the pirates and left to die on Marooners' Rock, but is rescued by Peter. It is hinted later that she may have romantic feelings for Peter but he does not return them, as he is completely oblivious of other people's feelings. In the Disney film, Tiger Lily shows her gratitude by performing a dance for Peter and kissing him. The kiss makes him turn bright red, and makes Wendy jealous of Tiger Lily.\n\n=====Tinker Bell=====\n{{Main|Tinker Bell}}\nTinker Bell is a common fairy who is Peter Pan's best friend and often jealously protective of him. She is the friend who helps him in his escapades. As his fairy, Tink\u2019s malicious actions are usually caused by her jealousy which leads to the Lost Boys shooting arrows at Wendy (or nearly stoning her to death in the Disney film), and eventually even reveals Peter\u2019s hideout to Captain Hook, thinking that Wendy will be captured rather than Peter. When Tink realises her serious mistake, she risks her own life by drinking the poison Hook has left for Peter (or pushing Hook\u2019s bomb away in Disney's movie). Her extreme loyalty and dedication to Peter is everlasting.\n\n=====The Lost Boys=====\n{{Main|Lost Boys (Peter Pan)}}\nPeter is the leader of the Lost Boys, which include Tootles, Nibs, Slightly, Curly, and The Twins. The Lost Boys is a band of boys who were lost by their parents after they \"fall out of their perambulators\" and came to live in Neverland. In Barrie's novel ''Peter and Wendy'' (but not the original play ''Peter Pan''), it is stated that Peter \"thins them out\" when they start to grow up. This is never fully explained, but it is implied that he either kills them or banishes them.\n\nIn the song \"I Won't Grow Up\" from [[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|the 1954 musical]], the boys sing \"I will stay a boy forever\", to which Peter replies \"and be banished if I don't\".\n\nIn ''[[Peter Pan in Scarlet]]'' (2006), the official sequel to Barrie's ''Peter and Wendy'', what happens to the Lost Boys when they begin to grow up is revealed when Slightly starts to grow older, as Peter banishes him to Nowhereland (which basically means that he and all his allies will ignore the banished person's existence), the home of all the Long Lost Boys whom Peter has banished in times past.\n\n=====The Crocodile=====\nThe crocodile (Tick-Tock in the Disney film) is Captain Hook's nemesis. After Peter Pan cut off Captain Hook's hand in a fight and threw it into the sea, the crocodile swallowed it and got a taste for Hook. It also swallowed a ticking clock, which alerts Hook of its presence.\n\n===Adversaries===\n\n====Captain Hook====\n{{Main|Captain Hook}}\nCaptain Hook, whose right hand was cut off in a duel, is Peter Pan's arch-enemy. Hook's crew, including [[Smee]] and Starkey, also consider him a foe. Captain Hook's two principal fears are [[Blood phobia|the sight of his own blood]] (which is supposedly an unnatural colour) and one crocodile. His name plays on the [[Transradial prosthesis|iron hook]] that replaced his hand cut off by Peter Pan and eaten by a [[saltwater crocodile]], which continues to pursue Hook.\n\nIn the [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|1953 animated film]], Hook seeks revenge on Peter Pan for having fed the crocodile his hand, and refuses to leave [[Neverland]] without satisfaction.<ref name=archives>{{cite web|work=Disney Archives|title=Captain Hook: Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/hook/hook.html}}</ref> Hook is supported by Mr. Smee. After promising Tinker Bell 'not to lay a finger (or a hook) on Peter Pan', he lays a bomb in Peter's hideout. At the conclusion of the film, Hook is chased by the crocodile into the distance. [[Walt Disney]] insisted on keeping Hook alive, as he said: \"The audience will get to liking Hook, and they don't want to see him killed.\"<ref name=villains>Thomas, Frank & Johnston, Ollie (1993) ''Disney Villain'' \"Chapter 4: Nine Old Men,\" section: \"Peter Pan\", pp. 109\u2013113. {{ISBN|978 1562827922}}.</ref> In the sequel ''[[Return to Never Land]]'', Hook mistakes Wendy's daughter Jane for Wendy, and uses her as bait to lure Peter Pan to his death.\n\n====Mr. Smee====\n{{main|Mr. Smee}}\nMr Smee is [[Captain Hook]]'s [[boatswain]] (\"bo'sun\") and right-hand man in [[J. M. Barrie]]'s play ''Peter Pan'' and the novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''. Mr Smee is Captain Hook\u2019s direct confidant. Unlike the other pirates, Smee is often clumsy and incapable of capturing any of the Lost Boys. Rather than engaging in Hook\u2019s evil schemes, Smee finds excitement in bagging loot and treasures.\n\n==Publications==\n{{main list|Works based on Peter Pan}}\n[[File:Peter Pan 1915 cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cover of 1915 edition of [[J.

He also appears in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'', ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse|Mickey's Magical Christmas]]'', and the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' video games.\n*[[J. R. R.

M. Barrie]]. A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and [[Puer aeternus|never grows up]], Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of [[Neverland]] as the leader of the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]], interacting with [[Fairy|fairies]], [[Piracy|pirate]]s, [[mermaid]]s, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.\n\nPeter Pan has become a [[cultural icon]] symbolizing youthful innocence and escapism. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include the [[Peter Pan (1924 film)|1924 silent film]], [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|1953 Disney animated film]], a [[Peter Pan (2003 film)|2003 dramatic/live-action film]], a television series and many other works.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Peter Pan, by Oliver Herford, 1907.png|thumb|170px|1907 illustration of Peter Pan by [[Oliver Herford]] ]]\n\nPeter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' (1902), an adult novel. In chapters 13\u201318, entitled \"Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens\", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to [[Kensington Gardens]] in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as a \"betwixt-and-between\" a boy and a bird. Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, [[Hodder and Stoughton]], extracted these chapters of ''The Little White Bird'' and published them in 1906 under the title ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'', with the addition of illustrations by [[Arthur Rackham]].<ref>{{cite book|title=J.M. Barrie & the Lost Boys |last=Birkin |first=Andrew |year=2003|publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=0-300-09822-7|page = 47}}</ref>\n\nBarrie returned to the character of Peter Pan as the centre of his [[stage play]] entitled ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'', which premiered on 27 December 1904 in London. Barrie later adapted and expanded the play's storyline as a [[novel]], published in 1911 as ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''.\n\nJ. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<ref>Birkin, Andrew. ''J.M. Barrie and the Lost Boys.'' Yale University Press, 1986.</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\nBarrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the reader and the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play, Peter's outfit is made of autumn leaves and cobwebs.<ref>Barrie, J. M. ''Peter Pan'' (play). Hodder & Stoughton, 1928, Act I, Scene 1</ref> His name and playing the [[Pan flute|flute or pipes]] suggest the mythological character [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. Barrie mentions in ''Peter and Wendy'' that Peter Pan still had all his \"first teeth\".<ref name=\"chap1\">Barrie, J. M. ''Peter and Wendy''. Hodder & Stoughton, 1911, Chapter 1.</ref> He describes him as a beautiful boy with a beautiful smile, \"clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that flow from trees\".<ref name=\"chap1\"/>\n\nTraditionally, the character has been played on stage by a petite adult woman.<ref>Bruce K. Hanson. ''Peter Pan on Stage and Screen 1904\u20132010''. McFarland, 2011</ref> In the original productions in the UK, Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tights, such as that worn by [[Nina Boucicault]] in 1904. This costume is exhibited at Barrie's Birthplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/j-m-barries-birthplace |title=J M Barrie's Birthplace |publisher=Nts.org.uk |date= |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref> The similar costume worn by [[Pauline Chase]] (who played the role from 1906 to 1913) is displayed in the [[Museum of London]]. Early editions of adaptations of the story also depict a red costume<ref>Daniel O'Connor, illustrated by Alice B. Woodward. ''The Peter Pan Picture Book''. Bell & Sons, 1907.</ref><ref>''Peter Pan's ABC'' illustrated by Flora White. Hodder & Stoughton, 1913</ref> but a green costume (whether or not made of leaves) becomes more usual from the 1920s,<ref>May Byron, illustrated by Mabel Lucie Atwell, ''Peter Pan and Wendy''. Hodder & Stoughton, 1921.</ref> and more so later after the release of Disney's animated movie.\n\nIn the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights apparently made of cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed [[elf]]-like ears, brown eyes and his hair is red.\n\nIn ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991), the character is played as an adult by [[Robin Williams]], with blue eyes and dark brown hair; in flashbacks to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. His ears appear pointed only when he is Peter Pan, not as Peter Banning.<!--The name is not \"Panning\"; please read the film credits--> His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap).\n\nIn the live-action [[Peter Pan (2003 film)|2003 ''Peter Pan'' film]], he is portrayed by [[Jeremy Sumpter]], with blond hair, blue eyes, bare feet and a costume made of leaves and vines.\n\n==Age==\nIn ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' (1902) and ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'' (1906), he was only seven days old.\n\nAlthough his age is not stated in Barrie's [[Peter and Wendy|play]] (1904) or [[Peter and Wendy|novel]] (1911), the novel mentions that he still had all his [[Deciduous teeth|baby teeth]]. In other ways, the character appears to be about 12\u201313 years old.\n\n==Personality==\nPeter is an exaggerated stereotype of a boastful and careless boy. He claims greatness, even when such claims are questionable (such as congratulating himself when Wendy re-attaches his shadow). In the play and book, Peter symbolises the selfishness of childhood, and is portrayed as being forgetful and self-centred.\n\nPeter has a nonchalant, devil-may-care attitude, and is fearlessly cocky when it comes to putting himself in danger. Barrie writes that when Peter thought he was going to die on Marooners' Rock, he felt scared, yet he felt only one shudder. With this blithe attitude, he says, \"To die will be an awfully big adventure\". In the play, the unseen and unnamed narrator ponders what might have been if Peter had stayed with Wendy, so that his cry might have become, \"To live would be an awfully big adventure!\", \"but he can never quite get the hang of it\".<ref>Barrie, J. M. ''Peter Pan''. Hodder & Stoughton, 1928, Act V, Scene 2.</ref>\n\n==Abilities==\nPeter's archetypal quality is his unending youth. In ''Peter and Wendy'', it is explained that Peter must forget his own adventures and what he learns about the world in order to stay childlike.\n\nPeter's ability to fly is explained, but inconsistently. In ''The Little White Bird'', he is able to fly because he is said to be part bird, like all babies. In the play and novel, he teaches the Darling children to fly using a combination of \"lovely wonderful thoughts\" and fairy dust. In Barrie's Dedication to the play ''Peter Pan, The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow up'',<ref>Barrie, J. M. ''Peter Pan''. Hodder & Stoughton, 1928, \"To the Five \u2013 A Dedication\".</ref> the author attributes the idea of fairy dust being necessary for flight to practical needs:\n<blockquote>\n...after the first production I had to add something to the play at the request of parents (who thus showed that they thought me the responsible person) about no one being able to fly until the fairy dust had been blown on him; so many children having gone home and tried it from their beds and needed surgical attention. <small> \u2013 J. M. Barrie</small>\n</blockquote>\n\nPeter has an effect on the whole of Neverland and its inhabitants when he is there. Barrie states that although Neverland appears different to every child, the island \"wakes up\" when Peter returns from his trip to London. In the chapter \"The Mermaids' Lagoon\" in the book ''Peter and Wendy'', Barrie writes that there is almost nothing that Peter cannot do. He is a skilled [[swordsman]], rivalling even Captain Hook, whose hand he cut off in a duel. He has remarkably keen vision and hearing. He is skilled in mimicry, copying the voice of Hook and the ticking of the clock in the crocodile.\n\nPeter has the ability to imagine things into existence and he is able to feel danger when it is near.\n\nIn ''Peter and Wendy'', Barrie states that the Peter Pan legend Mrs Darling heard as a child was that when children died, he accompanied them part of the way to their destination so they would not be frightened.\n\nIn the original play, Peter states that no one must ever touch him (though he does not know why). The stage directions specify that no one does so throughout the play. Wendy approaches Peter to give him a \"kiss\" (thimble), but is prevented by [[Tinker Bell]]. However, [[John Caird (director)|John Caird]] and [[Trevor Nunn|Trevor Nunn's]] introduction to the script for the 1997 [[Royal National Theatre]] production, states that this was never Barrie's original intention, and was only added for a production in 1927, where [[Jean Forbes-Robertson]] took the title role, and played the part with a lighter, more fairy-like, physicality. Robertson was to play the part almost every year until 1939.\n\n== Cultural allusions ==\nThe character's name comes from two sources: [[Peter Llewelyn Davies]], one of the five Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired the story, and [[Pan (god)|Pan]], a minor deity of Greek mythology who plays [[pan flute|pipes]] to [[nymphs]] and is part human and part goat. This is referenced in Barrie's works (particularly ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'') where Peter Pan plays pipes to the fairies and rides a goat. The god Pan represents Nature or Man's natural state in contrast to Civilisation and the effects of upbringing on human behaviour. Peter Pan is a free spirit, being too young to be burdened with the effects of education or to have an adult appreciation of moral responsibility. As a 'betwixt-and-between', who can fly and speak the language of fairies and birds, Peter is part animal and part human. According to psychologist [[Rosalind Ridley]], by comparing Peter's behaviour to adults and to other animals, Barrie raises many post-Darwinian questions about the origins of human nature and behaviour. As 'the boy who wouldn't grow up', Peter exhibits many aspects of the stages of cognitive development seen in children and can be regarded as Barrie's memory of himself as a child, being both charmingly childlike and childishly solipsistic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Peter Pan and the Mind of J. M. Barrie|last=Ridley|first=Rosalind |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4438-9107-3|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\n{{Main|Characters of Peter Pan}}\n\n===Family===\nPeter Pan ran away from his parents when he was a baby as told in ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'' and ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''. Finding the window closed and seeing a new baby in the house when he returned some time later, he believed his parents no longer wanted him and never came back. This younger sibling is referred to in the chapter \"Lock-Out Time\" in ''Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens'' but is not mentioned again.\n\n===Friends===\n\n====Maimie Mannering====\nWhile in Kensington Gardens, Peter meets a lost girl named Maimie Mannering and the two quickly become friends. Peter proposes marriage to Maimie. While Maimie wants to stay in the Gardens with Peter, she comes to realise that her mother is so worried that she must return to her. Maimie promises to always remember Peter and goes back to her mother. When Maimie grows up, she continues to think of Peter, dedicating presents and letters to him. To remember Maimie, Peter rides the imaginary goat that Maimie created for him. She is considered to be the literary predecessor of [[Wendy Darling]].<ref>Rose, Jacqueline. ''The Case of Peter Pan, Or, The Impossibility of Children's Fiction'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 1984, p. 28.</ref>\n\n====The Darlings====\n\n=====Wendy Darling=====\n{{Main|Wendy Darling}} It is hinted that Wendy may have romantic feelings for Peter, but unrequited because of his inability to love. In the 2003 film ''[[Peter Pan (2003 film)|Peter Pan]],'' the feeling is mutual. Captain Hook can only take away Peter's ability to fly by thoughts of Wendy leaving him, growing up, and replacing him with a husband. Wendy saves Peter by giving him her hidden kiss (signifying he is her true love); this gives him the will to live. In the movie ''[[Hook (movie)|Hook]],'' an older Wendy implies that she used to (and perhaps, still does) have feelings for Peter, saying that she was shocked that he did not prevent her wedding day. In the sequel to the 1953 Disney film, ''[[Return to Neverland]],'' Peter and a grown-up Wendy are briefly, but happily, reunited after many years and continue to show feelings for each other.\n\nIn the original novel, Peter later befriends Wendy's daughter Jane (and her subsequent daughter Margaret), and it is implied that this pattern will go on forever. From time to time Peter visits the real world, and befriends children. Wendy Darling, whom he recruited to be his \"mother\", is the most significant of them; he also brings her brothers [[John Darling (Peter Pan)|John]] and [[Michael Darling (Peter Pan)|Michael]] to Neverland at her request. It is mentioned that Wendy was the only girl who captured his attention.\n\n=====John Darling and Michael Darling=====\n\nJohn, the older brother of the Darlings, proves to be extremely mature for his age. He becomes fascinated with piracy and imitates Captain Hook while playing at home with his siblings. Not only sophisticated, John is also courageous and smart. Peter typically tasks John with the responsibility of directing the Lost Boys when Peter is absent. Michael, the youngest of the Darlings, is convinced that Peter Pan is a real person after hearing Wendy's passionate narratives about him. During nursery games, it is Michael who plays the role of Peter Pan whom he looks up to.\n\n=====Mary and George Darling=====\n\nThe parents of Wendy, John and Michael. Mr. Darling works as a clerk in the [[City of London|City]], and is named after George Llewelyn Davies. Mrs. Darling is named after Mary Ansell, Barrie's wife.\n\n====Neverland inhabitants====\n=====Tiger Lily=====\nTiger Lily is the daughter of Great Big Little Panther, the chief of the Piccaninny [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe resident in Neverland. Barrie refers to her as \"a princess in her own right\", and she is often described as such. She is kidnapped by the pirates and left to die on Marooners' Rock, but is rescued by Peter. It is hinted later that she may have romantic feelings for Peter but he does not return them, as he is completely oblivious of other people's feelings. In the Disney film, Tiger Lily shows her gratitude by performing a dance for Peter and kissing him. The kiss makes him turn bright red, and makes Wendy jealous of Tiger Lily.\n\n=====Tinker Bell=====\n{{Main|Tinker Bell}}\nTinker Bell is a common fairy who is Peter Pan's best friend and often jealously protective of him. She is the friend who helps him in his escapades. As his fairy, Tink\u2019s malicious actions are usually caused by her jealousy which leads to the Lost Boys shooting arrows at Wendy (or nearly stoning her to death in the Disney film), and eventually even reveals Peter\u2019s hideout to Captain Hook, thinking that Wendy will be captured rather than Peter. When Tink realises her serious mistake, she risks her own life by drinking the poison Hook has left for Peter (or pushing Hook\u2019s bomb away in Disney's movie). Her extreme loyalty and dedication to Peter is everlasting.\n\n=====The Lost Boys=====\n{{Main|Lost Boys (Peter Pan)}}\nPeter is the leader of the Lost Boys, which include Tootles, Nibs, Slightly, Curly, and The Twins. The Lost Boys is a band of boys who were lost by their parents after they \"fall out of their perambulators\" and came to live in Neverland. In Barrie's novel ''Peter and Wendy'' (but not the original play ''Peter Pan''), it is stated that Peter \"thins them out\" when they start to grow up. This is never fully explained, but it is implied that he either kills them or banishes them.\n\nIn the song \"I Won't Grow Up\" from [[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|the 1954 musical]], the boys sing \"I will stay a boy forever\", to which Peter replies \"and be banished if I don't\".\n\nIn ''[[Peter Pan in Scarlet]]'' (2006), the official sequel to Barrie's ''Peter and Wendy'', what happens to the Lost Boys when they begin to grow up is revealed when Slightly starts to grow older, as Peter banishes him to Nowhereland (which basically means that he and all his allies will ignore the banished person's existence), the home of all the Long Lost Boys whom Peter has banished in times past.\n\n=====The Crocodile=====\nThe crocodile (Tick-Tock in the Disney film) is Captain Hook's nemesis. After Peter Pan cut off Captain Hook's hand in a fight and threw it into the sea, the crocodile swallowed it and got a taste for Hook. It also swallowed a ticking clock, which alerts Hook of its presence.\n\n===Adversaries===\n\n====Captain Hook====\n{{Main|Captain Hook}}\nCaptain Hook, whose right hand was cut off in a duel, is Peter Pan's arch-enemy. Hook's crew, including [[Smee]] and Starkey, also consider him a foe. Captain Hook's two principal fears are [[Blood phobia|the sight of his own blood]] (which is supposedly an unnatural colour) and one crocodile. His name plays on the [[Transradial prosthesis|iron hook]] that replaced his hand cut off by Peter Pan and eaten by a [[saltwater crocodile]], which continues to pursue Hook.\n\nIn the [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|1953 animated film]], Hook seeks revenge on Peter Pan for having fed the crocodile his hand, and refuses to leave [[Neverland]] without satisfaction.<ref name=archives>{{cite web|work=Disney Archives|title=Captain Hook: Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/hook/hook.html}}</ref> Hook is supported by Mr. Smee. After promising Tinker Bell 'not to lay a finger (or a hook) on Peter Pan', he lays a bomb in Peter's hideout. At the conclusion of the film, Hook is chased by the crocodile into the distance. [[Walt Disney]] insisted on keeping Hook alive, as he said: \"The audience will get to liking Hook, and they don't want to see him killed.\"<ref name=villains>Thomas, Frank & Johnston, Ollie (1993) ''Disney Villain'' \"Chapter 4: Nine Old Men,\" section: \"Peter Pan\", pp. 109\u2013113. {{ISBN|978 1562827922}}.</ref> In the sequel ''[[Return to Never Land]]'', Hook mistakes Wendy's daughter Jane for Wendy, and uses her as bait to lure Peter Pan to his death.\n\n====Mr. Smee====\n{{main|Mr. Smee}}\nMr Smee is [[Captain Hook]]'s [[boatswain]] (\"bo'sun\") and right-hand man in [[J. M. Barrie]]'s play ''Peter Pan'' and the novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''. Mr Smee is Captain Hook\u2019s direct confidant. Unlike the other pirates, Smee is often clumsy and incapable of capturing any of the Lost Boys. Rather than engaging in Hook\u2019s evil schemes, Smee finds excitement in bagging loot and treasures.\n\n==Publications==\n{{main list|Works based on Peter Pan}}\n[[File:Peter Pan 1915 cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cover of 1915 edition of [[J.

Barrie adapted this play as a novel; numerous variations and other adaptations have been produced in various media.\n* ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'' (1906), an origin story wherein the infant Peter flies away from his home, takes up residence in [[Kensington Gardens]], and befriends the fairies.

He also appears in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'', ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse|Mickey's Magical Christmas]]'', and the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' video games.\n*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s biographer [[Humphrey Carpenter]] has speculated that Tolkien's impressions of a 1910 production of Barrie's ''Peter Pan'' in Birmingham \"may have had a little to do with\" his original conception of the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves of Middle Earth]].<ref name=\"Carpenter\">{{ME-ref|Biography|chapter=IV}}</ref>\n*He appears in the Italian comic series ''[[Martin Myst\u00e8re]]''.\n*In the television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', a malevolent version of Peter Pan, portrayed by [[Robbie Kay]], appears as the main villain in the first half of the show's third season. and in the second half of the fifth season. In this series, he was originally a man named Malcolm and was father to [[Rumpelstiltskin]], whom he sent away so he could be young again and took the name Peter Pan from Rumpelstiltskin's doll.\n*In the anime-styled web series ''[[RWBY]]'', the character Scarlet David is based on Peter Pan.\n*In the animated film ''[[Shrek]]'' (2001), Peter Pan is seen in a line ready to sell [[Tinker Bell]] to Duloc authorities. His only line in the film is \"He can fly!\", as a response to seeing Donkey flying thanks to Tinker Bell's fairy dust.\n*Japanese [[manga]] artist, [[Mayu Sakai]], appropriated the English term for her series, ''[[Peter Pan Syndrome (manga)|Peter Pan Syndrome]]''.<ref>{{cite web|date=20 September 2010|title=Peter Pan Syndrome|accessdate=12 September 2012|url=http://en.anime-wiki.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_Syndrome|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230213702/http://en.anime-wiki.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_Syndrome|archivedate=30 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n*Singer-songwriter [[Ruth B]] released the piano ballad \u201cLost Boy\u201d in 2015, featuring Peter Pan and Neverland.\n*Country singer-songwriter [[Kelsea Ballerini]] released a top-charting country single and song titled [[Peter Pan (Kelsea Ballerini song)|\"Peter Pan\"]], in 2016.\n*South Korean boy-band [[BTS (band)|BTS]] released a music video called \"Adult Child\", the song makes reference to the Peter Pan story.\n*British musician [[Kate Bush]] included her song \"In Search of Peter Pan\" on her second album ''[[Lionheart (Kate Bush album)|Lionheart]]'' (1978).\n*Korean boy-band [[Exo (band)|EXO]] released a track called \"Peter Pan\" on both the Mandarin and Korean versions of the album ''XOXO'' (2013).\n*Peterpan is the former name for an Indonesian pop-rock band, now called [[Noah (band)|Noah]].\n*The eleventh track of singer-songwriter [[Troye Sivan]]'s debut studio album ''[[Blue Neighbourhood]]'' (2015) is entitled \u201cLost Boy\u201d, inspired by Peter Pan.\n*In [[Chance The Rapper]]'s song '[[Same Drugs]]' ,featured in the album Coloring Book (2015), he makes multiple references to Peter Pan and Wendy, another major character in the novel.\n\n===Other uses in popular culture===\nThe name Peter Pan has been adopted for various purposes over the years:\n*Several businesses have adopted the name, including [[Peter Pan Bus Lines]], [[Peter Pan (peanut butter)|Peter Pan peanut butter]], [[Peter Pan Records]], and [[Peter Pan Seafoods]].\n*[[Peter Pan I|Three Thoroughbred racehorses]] have been given the name, the first, [[Peter Pan I]], was born in 1904.\n*In the early 1960s, some Cuban families sent their children to resettle in Miami in an emergency effort calculated to save the children from perceived potential mistreatment under the [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] socialist regime; the program was called [[Operation Peter Pan]] (or ''Operaci\u00f3n Pedro Pan'').\n*American psychologist Dr. Dan Kiley popularised the [[Puer aeternus#Peter Pan syndrome|Peter Pan syndrome]] (''puer aeternus'') in his book, ''The Peter Pan Syndrome: Men Who Have Never Grown Up'' (1983).<ref>Kiley, Dr. Dan, ''The Peter Pan Syndrome: Men Who Have Never Grown Up''.

He studied music composition with [[Eugen Kapp]] at the [[Tallinn Conservatory]], graduating in 1953. In Estonia he first became known with his song cycle ''Viis romanssi S\u00e1ndor Pet\u00f6fi luulele'' (1955) based on poetry by [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]], and with his ''[[Concerto Grosso (Tamberg)|Concerto Grosso]]'' (1956), for which he won a gold medal at an international music festival in [[Moscow]]. Tamberg was an important initiator of the anti-romantic composition movement of the late 1950s. His vision on music composition belonged to the so-called ''New Wave'' in Estonian music. He became more known outside Estonia from approximately 1960, writing music for a large variety of genres, but in particular music for theater, and symphonic music.  He died in Tallinn.\n\nTamberg was one of the most important representatives of [[neoclassicism]] in Estonian music, though his later works were more [[expressionism|expressionistic]] in style. Since 1969 he was teaching at the [[Estonian Academy of Music]], where he also held a professorship since 1983. For the 1997\u20131998 season he was composer-in-residence with the [[Estonian National Symphony Orchestra]].\n\n==Works==\nTwo of Tamberg's most notable works are the ballet ''Joanna tentata'' (1971) and the ''[[Trumpet]] Concerto No. 1'' (1972). The trumpet concerto remains one of his most popular works and was performed not only in [[Europe]], but also in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]], and was recorded by [[H\u00e5kan Hardenberger]]. Tamberg also wrote concerti for [[violin]] (1981), [[saxophone]] (1987), [[clarinet]] (1996), [[bassoon]] (2000), [[cello]] (2001) and a second trumpet concerto (1997). He has also composed four symphonies.\n\nHis second [[opera]], ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (Tamberg)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' premiered in 1976. This romantic work shows the influence of early [[Baroque]] conventions and [[bel canto]] singing.

When another general and President [[Policarpo Paz Garc\u00eda|Policarpo Paz]] took over in a coup in 1978, Callejas remained in his post. During the transition to [[democracy]] culminating in November 1981 elections, which were won by the [[Liberal Party of Honduras]] (PLH), he rose within the ranks of the [[National Party of Honduras]] (PNH), and in 1982 presided over their central committee. He supported former President [[Ricardo Maduro|Ricardo Maduro's]] ''Unidad y Cambio'' (Unity and Change) movement within the PNH that brought the party more towards the center, and a liberal economic path. Callejas then created his own faction, the ''Movimiento Nacional Callejista'' (National Callejista Movement), to advance his candidature in the 1985 presidential elections. At the time both main political parties allowed various candidates to stand, and while Callejas gained the highest vote of any candidate with 42.6%, the PLH candidates gained 51.5% of the total vote, and therefore it was their most voted for candidate, [[Jos\u00e9 Azcona Hoyo|Jos\u00e9 Azcona]], with 27.5% of the vote, who became President.\n\n==Football==\nUntil 2015, Callejas was President of the [[Federaci\u00f3n Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de F\u00fatbol de Honduras]] (FENAFUTH).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3921056/FIFA-ethics-investigator-calls-ex-Honduras-president-Rafael-Callejas-banned-football-life.html|title=FIFA ethics investigator calls on ex-Honduras president Rafael Callejas to be banned from football for life |last1=Slater |first1=Matt |date=2016-11-09 |publisher=Daily Mail|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref> Under his tenure, Honduras qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]]s in 2010 and 2014, the first time Honduras qualified for two consecutive World Cups. During his tenure, Honduras qualified for all major football soccer competitions in all age brackets, including the Olympic Games.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==President (1990-1994)==\nHis election in 1989 marked the first time since 1932 that power was transferred peacefully between Honduras' two major parties.\n\nCallejas was once again the PNH candidate in the 1989 elections where a reported 200,000 identifications from deceased Honduran citizens were used. Callejas won with 52.3% of the votes, becoming the first PNH President since 1972. He had to confront severe economic problems, and he followed the advice of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) by cutting public spending, resulting in many public servants being laid off, and by devaluing the [[Honduran lempira|Lempira]].  At the time of the devaluation of the Lempira, the Honduran Central Bank, presided at the time by Ricardo Maduro Joest, did not have any dollars available to the general public. Instead, people were given back devalued Lempiras causing a lot of suffering in what was already one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere.\nGasoline supplies were non-existent when he took office and long lines of cars were seen at the gas stations trying to obtain fuel. This led to many strikes and a lot of social agitation, until his government successfully negotiated with the United States the write-off of a $US430 million debt, in September 1991.\n\nHe presided over a liberal reformist government, opened the Honduran economy to local and foreign investment and managed steady growth during the last three years of his presidency, although during the fourth year fiscal indiscipline led to a new set of economic measures being imposed by the following government. Poverty was reduced by 8% under his tenure. Infrastructure was a priority and large investments in the rich Sula Valley area were made in more than 90 kilometers of four-lane highways.\n\nHis government had some important accomplishments in the social area, such as the creation of the Family Assistance Program (PRAF) and the Honduran Fund for Social Investment (FHIS). Expatriates of the previous Military and Liberal governments were allowed to return to Honduras, with no risk to their lives, and the irregular forces of the Nicaraguan counter-revolutionaries, the [[Contras]], were required to leave Honduras in April 1990 after intense negotiations.\n\n==Accusations==\nHe was accused of 7 counts of corruption during his term. He was also accused by an aide in the Bush White House, resulting in a Bush executive order denying him of US visa status.\n\nIn 2005, Honduran Congress revoked the law by which ex-Presidents, among other former officials, had legal immunity. Mr. Callejas voluntarily presented himself to court (first person to do so after the law was revoked). Mr. Callejas then faced trial, being acquitted by Judicial System of all counts presented against him.\n\nOn 3 December 2015, Mr. Callejas was indicted in U.S. Federal Court in connection with the ongoing [[2015 FIFA corruption case|2015 FIFA Corruption Case]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/sports/soccer/fifa-scandal-16-more-charged-after-zurich-raid.html|title=More Charges as FIFA Inquiry Widens|first1=Rebecca R.|last1=Ruiz|first2=Matt|last2=Apuzzo|first3=Sam|last3=Borden|first4=William K.|last4=Rashbaum|date=3 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> 12 days later, he flew to the United States and was taken into custody.

He studied agricultural economics at [[Mississippi State University]] becoming an expert on financial and economic issues connected to [[agronomy]].  At [[Mississippi State University]], Callejas earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1965 and a Masters of Science degree in 1966.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|title=Quayle, Callejas Deliver Commencement Addresses With AM-Bush, Bjt|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Quayle-Callejas-Deliver-Commencement-Addresses-With-AM-Bush-Bjt/id-94c20c55f5aed6183f54bba3f85d512f|accessdate=27 December 2012|newspaper=Associated Press|date=12 May 1990}}</ref>  Also in 1966, [[Mississippi State University]]'s Department of Agricultural Economics published Callejas' thesis titled [https://books.google.com/books/about/Hog_Production_Opportunities_in_Mississi.html?id=XhZfYgEACAAJ Hog Production Opportunities in Mississippi].<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last=Callejas Romero|first=Rafael|title=Hog Production Opportunities in Mississippi|year=1966|publisher=Mississippi State University Department of Agricultural Economics|location=Starkville, Mississippi, United States|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hog_Production_Opportunities_in_Mississi.html?id=XhZfYgEACAAJ}}</ref>  In 1990, Callejas was named Mississippi State University's Alumni of the Year<ref>{{cite web|title=College and School Alumni of the Year|url=http://www.cals.msstate.edu/alumni/detail.php?alumnus=callejas|work=List of Alumni of the Year Awardees|publisher=Mississippi State University|accessdate=27 December 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812033923/http://www.cals.msstate.edu/alumni/detail.php?alumnus=callejas|archivedate=12 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was invited with U.S. Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] delivered the university's commencement address.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Career==\nBetween 1967 and 1971 Callejas worked at the Council for Economic Planning ([[CONSUPLANE]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Rafael Leonardo Callejas|url=http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacio/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_central_y_caribe/honduras/rafael_callejas_romero|work=Biography of Rafael Leonardo Callejas|publisher=Centro de Estudios y Documentaci\u00f3n Internacionales de Barcelona|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>  In 1968, Callejas was made the Director of Economic Planning by the then President [[Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano|Oswaldo L\u00f3pez]]. in 1975 another General and President, [[Juan Alberto Melgar Castro|Juan Alberto Melgar]], named Callejas Minister for Agriculture and Natural Resources. When another general and President [[Policarpo Paz Garc\u00eda|Policarpo Paz]] took over in a coup in 1978, Callejas remained in his post. During the transition to [[democracy]] culminating in November 1981 elections, which were won by the [[Liberal Party of Honduras]] (PLH), he rose within the ranks of the [[National Party of Honduras]] (PNH), and in 1982 presided over their central committee. He supported former President [[Ricardo Maduro|Ricardo Maduro's]] ''Unidad y Cambio'' (Unity and Change) movement within the PNH that brought the party more towards the center, and a liberal economic path. Callejas then created his own faction, the ''Movimiento Nacional Callejista'' (National Callejista Movement), to advance his candidature in the 1985 presidential elections. At the time both main political parties allowed various candidates to stand, and while Callejas gained the highest vote of any candidate with 42.6%, the PLH candidates gained 51.5% of the total vote, and therefore it was their most voted for candidate, [[Jos\u00e9 Azcona Hoyo|Jos\u00e9 Azcona]], with 27.5% of the vote, who became President.\n\n==Football==\nUntil 2015, Callejas was President of the [[Federaci\u00f3n Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de F\u00fatbol de Honduras]] (FENAFUTH).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3921056/FIFA-ethics-investigator-calls-ex-Honduras-president-Rafael-Callejas-banned-football-life.html|title=FIFA ethics investigator calls on ex-Honduras president Rafael Callejas to be banned from football for life |last1=Slater |first1=Matt |date=2016-11-09 |publisher=Daily Mail|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref> Under his tenure, Honduras qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]]s in 2010 and 2014, the first time Honduras qualified for two consecutive World Cups. During his tenure, Honduras qualified for all major football soccer competitions in all age brackets, including the Olympic Games.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==President (1990-1994)==\nHis election in 1989 marked the first time since 1932 that power was transferred peacefully between Honduras' two major parties.\n\nCallejas was once again the PNH candidate in the 1989 elections where a reported 200,000 identifications from deceased Honduran citizens were used. Callejas won with 52.3% of the votes, becoming the first PNH President since 1972. He had to confront severe economic problems, and he followed the advice of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) by cutting public spending, resulting in many public servants being laid off, and by devaluing the [[Honduran lempira|Lempira]].  At the time of the devaluation of the Lempira, the Honduran Central Bank, presided at the time by Ricardo Maduro Joest, did not have any dollars available to the general public. Instead, people were given back devalued Lempiras causing a lot of suffering in what was already one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere.\nGasoline supplies were non-existent when he took office and long lines of cars were seen at the gas stations trying to obtain fuel. This led to many strikes and a lot of social agitation, until his government successfully negotiated with the United States the write-off of a $US430 million debt, in September 1991.\n\nHe presided over a liberal reformist government, opened the Honduran economy to local and foreign investment and managed steady growth during the last three years of his presidency, although during the fourth year fiscal indiscipline led to a new set of economic measures being imposed by the following government. Poverty was reduced by 8% under his tenure. Infrastructure was a priority and large investments in the rich Sula Valley area were made in more than 90 kilometers of four-lane highways.\n\nHis government had some important accomplishments in the social area, such as the creation of the Family Assistance Program (PRAF) and the Honduran Fund for Social Investment (FHIS). Expatriates of the previous Military and Liberal governments were allowed to return to Honduras, with no risk to their lives, and the irregular forces of the Nicaraguan counter-revolutionaries, the [[Contras]], were required to leave Honduras in April 1990 after intense negotiations.\n\n==Accusations==\nHe was accused of 7 counts of corruption during his term. He was also accused by an aide in the Bush White House, resulting in a Bush executive order denying him of US visa status.\n\nIn 2005, Honduran Congress revoked the law by which ex-Presidents, among other former officials, had legal immunity. Mr. Callejas voluntarily presented himself to court (first person to do so after the law was revoked). Mr. Callejas then faced trial, being acquitted by Judicial System of all counts presented against him.\n\nOn 3 December 2015, Mr. Callejas was indicted in U.S. Federal Court in connection with the ongoing [[2015 FIFA corruption case|2015 FIFA Corruption Case]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/sports/soccer/fifa-scandal-16-more-charged-after-zurich-raid.html|title=More Charges as FIFA Inquiry Widens|first1=Rebecca R.|last1=Ruiz|first2=Matt|last2=Apuzzo|first3=Sam|last3=Borden|first4=William K.|last4=Rashbaum|date=3 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> 12 days later, he flew to the United States and was taken into custody.
