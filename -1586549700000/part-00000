Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the [[Alsace-Lorraine|annexation]] of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], but repealed in the rest of France after 1871.

Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], [[Cardinal Mazarin]], political thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette]], and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman [[Robert Schuman]].\n\n==Law and government==\n\n===Local law===\n{{Main|Local law in Alsace-Moselle}}\nThe Local Law ({{Lang-fr|droit local}}) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with [[Law of France|French law]]. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the [[Alsace-Lorraine|annexation]] of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the [[German Empire]] between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\n\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and [[Alsace-Lorraine]] is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict [[secularism]], even though a constitutional right of [[freedom of religion]] is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-[[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law]] established by the [[Concordat of 1801]], which provides for the public subsidy of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]], and [[Calvinist Church|Calvinist]] churches and the [[Judaism|Jewish]] religion.\n\n===Administration===\n[[File:Place darmes (3658773965).jpg|thumb|The city hall on the Place d'Armes.]]\nLike every commune of the present [[French Fifth Republic|French Republic]], Metz is managed by a mayor ({{Lang-fr|maire}}) and a municipal council ({{Lang-fr|conseil municipal}}), democratically elected by [[two-round system|two-round]] [[proportional voting]] for six years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070633&idArticle=LEGIARTI000024040149&dateTexte=20120630|title=Official French general code of territorial collectivities, French Republic|date= |accessdate=30 June 2012|language=fr}}</ref> The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/organigramme/elus_photos.php|title=Official Metz municipality website, List of Metz municipal councilors.|accessdate=24 July 2012|language=fr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512092500/http://metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/organigramme/elus_photos.php|archivedate=12 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/conseil/index.php|title=Official Metz municipality website, agenda and proc\u00e8s-verbal of the Municipal Council of Metz.|accessdate=24 July 2012|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115034602/http://metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/conseil/index.php|archive-date=15 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Since March 2009, records of municipal council meetings are available as audio files in French.</ref> Since 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mairie-metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/organigramme/lesmaires.php|title=List of mayors of Metz since 1790.|accessdate=27 December 2012|language=fr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214195639/http://www.mairie-metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/organigramme/lesmaires.php|archivedate=14 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the mayor of Metz has been [[Socialist Party (France)|socialist]] Dominique Gros.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/maire.php|title=Official Metz municipality website, Resume of Dominique Gros.|accessdate=30 June 2012|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115033932/http://metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/maire.php|archive-date=15 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz [[urban agglomeration]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metzmetropole.fr/site/institution_territoire_carte.php|title=Official Metz Metropole website, list of cities webpage|accessdate=1 July 2012|language=fr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715002100/http://www.metzmetropole.fr/site/institution_territoire_carte.php|archivedate=15 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Metz is the [[prefecture]] of the [[Moselle]] based in the former [[Intendant]] Palace.<ref name=\"politic50\"/> In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the [[Grand Est]] [[R\u00e9gion in France|region]], hosted in the former [[Saint Clement of Metz|Saint-Clement]] Abbey.\n\n===City administrative divisions===\n{{Main|Neighbourhoods of Metz}}\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/mairie_quartiers/index.php|title=Official website of Metz municipality.|format=PHP|accessdate=29 June 2012|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512105419/http://metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/mairie_quartiers/index.php|archive-date=12 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

After changing their name a few times, first to Sons of Kyuss (they released an [[Sons of Kyuss EP|EP of the same name]]), they finally shortened it to Kyuss. The band garnered a [[cult following]] by the early 1990s, often driving for hours to isolated locations in the desert and plugging into generators to perform. These events, known as \"generator parties\", became [[urban legend]] among rock [[subculture]].<ref>{{Cite news|last = Billik |first = Kira L. |title = Confused punk rockers' have an identity crisis |newspaper =[[Buffalo News]] |pages =G3 |date =March 14, 1993|url = }}</ref> The band became both famous for their heavy, down tuned, groove oriented music, and infamous for their backstage fights with local LA bands when they traveled into town to play gigs. This soon brought the attention of [[Chris Goss]], who became the band's mentor, helping the band sign to a label and eventually producing them exclusively in an effort to preserve their sound. Due to Homme being younger than 18 at the time of the band's signing, his parents signed the contract on his behalf. Kyuss released four albums (''[[Wretch (album)|Wretch]]'', ''[[Blues for the Red Sun]]'', ''[[Welcome to Sky Valley]]'', and ''[[...And the Circus Leaves Town]]''), of which the final three Goss-produced efforts are often cited as cornerstones to the development of the [[stoner rock]] genre in the 1990s.

Queens of the Stone Age released their [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1998. Initially, the band consisted of various friends of Homme's from the Seattle area. Homme had asked a number of singers, including Lanegan, to perform as lead vocalist for Queens of the Stone Age, but by the time of recording the band's debut album, he had moved back to Palm Desert and the band was pared down to just Homme and ex-Kyuss drummer [[Alfredo Hernandez]]. Homme was left to cover every other instrument and ended up singing for the first time in his career. Shortly after recording, Homme and Hernandez were joined by bassist and vocalist [[Nick Oliveri]] and guitarist, keyboardist, and lapsteel player [[Dave Catching]], the band was now composed entirely of ex-Kyuss members and roadies.\n\nFollowing their debut album, by which time Hernandez left the group, Queens of the Stone Age released the next album, ''[[Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)|Rated R]]'', during which the band used a wider range of instruments to achieve a more relaxed, spacious and psychedelic sound.<ref name=\"Rated R Review\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r479243|pure_url=yes}}|title=AllMusic \u2013 Rated R Review|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}</ref> Though it differed from the band's debut, ''Rated R'' became Queens of the Stone Age's first mainstream hit.

Following a deluxe reissue of ''Rated R'', a 2011 re-release of their debut album and corresponding tour followed, featuring the album played front to back in the style in which it was recorded. This was the first time many of the songs had been performed live since the album's original release.\n\nOn June 4, 2013, after a tumultuous writing and recording process, Queens of the Stone Age released their sixth album, ''[[...Like Clockwork]]'', receiving high praise from critics<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.metacritic.com/music/like-clockwork/queens-of-the-stone-age|title=...Like Clockwork Reviews|publisher=Metacritic.com|date=June 10, 2013}}</ref> as well as topping the Billboard 200 charts.

Recordings from the band first appeared on ''[[Volumes 3 & 4]]'', released that year. Over the next few years, Hughes settled into family life while Homme focused on Queens of the Stone Age. However, after Hughes' separation from his wife in 2003 and a spurt in creativity that resulted in dozens of songs, Homme convinced Hughes to pursue a full-time music career. Hughes writes, sings, and plays rhythm guitar, while Homme produces, arranges, and plays drums, bass, and various other instruments. So far, the band has released four albums: ''[[Peace, Love, Death Metal]]'' in 2004, ''[[Death by Sexy]]'' in 2006, ''[[Heart On]]'' in 2008, and most recently ''[[Zipper Down]]'' in 2015. Due to his commitments with Queens of the Stone Age and other projects, Homme does not regularly tour with Eagles of Death Metal, but occasionally makes appearances during live performances. In an October 2008 interview, he re-affirmed his commitment to the band saying, \"This isn't a side project for me. I'm in two bands.

After changing their name a few times, first to Sons of Kyuss (they released an [[Sons of Kyuss EP|EP of the same name]]), they finally shortened it to Kyuss. The band garnered a [[cult following]] by the early 1990s, often driving for hours to isolated locations in the desert and plugging into generators to perform. These events, known as \"generator parties\", became [[urban legend]] among rock [[subculture]].<ref>{{Cite news|last = Billik |first = Kira L. |title = Confused punk rockers' have an identity crisis |newspaper =[[Buffalo News]] |pages =G3 |date =March 14, 1993|url = }}</ref> The band became both famous for their heavy, down tuned, groove oriented music, and infamous for their backstage fights with local LA bands when they traveled into town to play gigs. This soon brought the attention of [[Chris Goss]], who became the band's mentor, helping the band sign to a label and eventually producing them exclusively in an effort to preserve their sound. Due to Homme being younger than 18 at the time of the band's signing, his parents signed the contract on his behalf. Kyuss released four albums (''[[Wretch (album)|Wretch]]'', ''[[Blues for the Red Sun]]'', ''[[Welcome to Sky Valley]]'', and ''[[...And the Circus Leaves Town]]''), of which the final three Goss-produced efforts are often cited as cornerstones to the development of the [[stoner rock]] genre in the 1990s.

After a [[cease and desist]] from [[Gamma Ray (band)|a band of the same name]], this band became Queens of the Stone Age. The first release under the new name would be the ''[[Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age]]'' compilation EP featuring tracks from both Kyuss and songs recorded from the [[Gamma Ray (EP)|''Gamma Ray'']] EP sessions from 1996, released in late 1997. Queens of the Stone Age released their [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1998. Initially, the band consisted of various friends of Homme's from the Seattle area. Homme had asked a number of singers, including Lanegan, to perform as lead vocalist for Queens of the Stone Age, but by the time of recording the band's debut album, he had moved back to Palm Desert and the band was pared down to just Homme and ex-Kyuss drummer [[Alfredo Hernandez]]. Homme was left to cover every other instrument and ended up singing for the first time in his career. Shortly after recording, Homme and Hernandez were joined by bassist and vocalist [[Nick Oliveri]] and guitarist, keyboardist, and lapsteel player [[Dave Catching]], the band was now composed entirely of ex-Kyuss members and roadies.\n\nFollowing their debut album, by which time Hernandez left the group, Queens of the Stone Age released the next album, ''[[Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)|Rated R]]'', during which the band used a wider range of instruments to achieve a more relaxed, spacious and psychedelic sound.<ref name=\"Rated R Review\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r479243|pure_url=yes}}|title=AllMusic \u2013 Rated R Review|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}</ref> Though it differed from the band's debut, ''Rated R'' became Queens of the Stone Age's first mainstream hit.

This was the first time many of the songs had been performed live since the album's original release.\n\nOn June 4, 2013, after a tumultuous writing and recording process, Queens of the Stone Age released their sixth album, ''[[...Like Clockwork]]'', receiving high praise from critics<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.metacritic.com/music/like-clockwork/queens-of-the-stone-age|title=...Like Clockwork Reviews|publisher=Metacritic.com|date=June 10, 2013}}</ref> as well as topping the Billboard 200 charts. ''...Like Clockwork'' highlights Homme's collaborative recording process and features guests such as [[Elton John]], [[Dave Grohl]], [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]], [[Jake Shears]], [[Trent Reznor]], [[Mark Lanegan]], [[Nick Oliveri]], and Homme's wife [[Brody Dalle]].\n\nTheir seventh album, ''[[Villains (Queens of the Stone Age album)|Villains]]'', was released on August 25, 2017. Conversely, ''Villains'' contains no collaborations, but was produced by [[Mark Ronson]].\n\nIn 2018, the band was featured on [[Revamp & Restoration|''Revamp'']], a cover album containing various renditions of Elton John songs, on which they performed \"[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (song)|Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]\".\n\n===The Desert Sessions (1997\u2013present)===\n[[File:Queen of the Stone Edge-Josh Homme-IMG 6571.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Homme at the Eurock\u00e9ennes de Belfort in 2011]]\n{{Main|The Desert Sessions}}\nHomme founded The Desert Sessions in 1997 at the [[Rancho De La Luna]] in [[Joshua Tree, California]], describing it as a musical collective series \"that cannot be defined\". He stated, \"At Desert Sessions, you play for the sake of music. That's why it's good for musicians. If someday that's not enough anymore, or that's not the reason behind you doing it \u2013 that's not your ''raison d'\u00eatre'' \u2013 then a quick reminder like Desert Sessions can do so much for you, it's amazing. It's easy to forget that this all starts from playing in your garage and loving it.\"\n\nThe recordings are done \"on the spot\" in a matter of hours, and the line-up constantly changes, with new contributors being added for each new recording. Artists such as [[PJ Harvey]], [[Jeordie White|Twiggy Ramirez]], [[Dave Catching]], [[Nick Oliveri]], [[Mark Lanegan]], [[Ben Shepherd]], [[John McBain (musician)|John McBain]], [[Josh Freese]], [[Chris Goss]], [[Alain Johannes]], [[Dean Ween]], and many others from the [[Palm Desert Scene]] have contributed to The Desert Sessions recordings.\n\nAfter 11 years of inactivity, Homme revealed in October 2014 that he would start working on more Desert Sessions material the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2014/10/22/queens-of-the-stone-ages-josh-homme-is-our-last-real-rock-star?page=3|title=Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme Is Our Last Real Rock Star|first=Steve|last=Appleford|date=22 October 2014|website=laweekly.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> However, things remained silent until May 2019, when Homme posted an image on [[Instagram]] with the [[hashtags]] \"#Desert, #Sessions, #11, #12\". In September, it was announced that ''Desert Sessions Volumes 11 & 12'' will be released on October 25, 2019.\n\n===Eagles of Death Metal (1998\u2013present)===\n{{Main|Eagles of Death Metal}}\nIn 1998, Homme formed Eagles of Death Metal with friend [[Jesse Hughes (musician)|Jesse Hughes]] as a joke band in the context of the Desert Sessions. Recordings from the band first appeared on ''[[Volumes 3 & 4]]'', released that year. Over the next few years, Hughes settled into family life while Homme focused on Queens of the Stone Age. However, after Hughes' separation from his wife in 2003 and a spurt in creativity that resulted in dozens of songs, Homme convinced Hughes to pursue a full-time music career. Hughes writes, sings, and plays rhythm guitar, while Homme produces, arranges, and plays drums, bass, and various other instruments. So far, the band has released four albums: ''[[Peace, Love, Death Metal]]'' in 2004, ''[[Death by Sexy]]'' in 2006, ''[[Heart On]]'' in 2008, and most recently ''[[Zipper Down]]'' in 2015. Due to his commitments with Queens of the Stone Age and other projects, Homme does not regularly tour with Eagles of Death Metal, but occasionally makes appearances during live performances. In an October 2008 interview, he re-affirmed his commitment to the band saying, \"This isn't a side project for me. I'm in two bands. I have musical schizophrenia, and this is one of those personalities.\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Eagles+of+Death+Metal+Part+1%3A+Joshua+Homme/ |title = Eagles of Death Metal Part 1: Joshua Homme |publisher = [[SuicideGirls.com]] |date = October 30, 2008 |accessdate = October 31, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Them Crooked Vultures (2009\u20132010)===\n{{Main|Them Crooked Vultures}}\nIn July 2009, it was revealed that Homme, [[Dave Grohl]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] were recording together for a musical project named [[Them Crooked Vultures]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stereokill.net/2009/07/02/queens-of-the-foo-zeppelin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704134053/http://stereokill.net/2009/07/02/queens-of-the-foo-zeppelin/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 4, 2009|title=Queens of the Foo Zeppelin?|first=Andrew|last=Lindsay|publisher=stereokill}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=124540|title=Josh Homme, John Paul Jones, Dave Grohl Are The Crooked Vultures|publisher=Blabbermouth.Net|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803185235/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=124540|archivedate=August 3, 2009}}</ref>\nThough initially conceived as solely a studio project, the trio performed their first show together on August 9, 2009 in Chicago at The Metro to a crowd of approximately 1,100 ticketholders with additional live rhythm guitarist/auxiliary man Alain Johannes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/music/2009/08/them_crooked_vultures_at_metro.html |work=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Them Crooked Vultures at Metro; updated |first=Thomas |last=Conner |date=September 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008152236/http://blogs.suntimes.com/music/2009/08/them_crooked_vultures_at_metro.html |archivedate=October 8, 2010}}</ref> Their album, [[Them Crooked Vultures (album)|''Them Crooked Vultures'']], was released by [[Interscope Records]] in the United States on November 17, 2009, and by [[Sony Music]] internationally.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.antiquiet.com/interviews/2009/10/crooked-vultures-interview/ |title=Them Crooked Vultures Interview @ Antiquiet |publisher=Antiquiet |date=October 2, 2009 |accessdate=October 11, 2009 }}</ref> The band launched a world tour including performing on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest on February 6, 2010, and at [[Austin City Limits]] on October 2, 2009 as well as many festivals through 2010.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\n\"A '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} Partimenti, were central to the training of European court musicians from the later 1600s until the end of the 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at the [[music conservatories of Naples|music conservatories of Naples]], and then later at the [[Paris Conservatory|Paris Conservatory]], where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/partimenti/about_parti/hist_overview.html]}}\"\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in Naples.\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory took over the entire curriculum of the child apprentices in Naples but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony and Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition unlike today. \n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\n\"A '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} Partimenti, were central to the training of European court musicians from the later 1600s until the end of the 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at the [[music conservatories of Naples|music conservatories of Naples]], and then later at the [[Paris Conservatory|Paris Conservatory]], where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/partimenti/about_parti/hist_overview.html]}}\"\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in Naples.\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory took over the entire curriculum of the child apprentices in Naples but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n \n\"In Naples the students were lower-class child apprentices studying full time to become artisan producers of music, whether through performance, improvisation, or composition.\" Monuments of Partimento \n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony and Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition unlike today. \n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat.

Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464.

{"title_page": "Peetre theorem", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], the (linear) '''Peetre theorem,''' named after [[Jaak Peetre]], is a result of [[functional analysis]] that gives a characterisation of [[Differential operator|differential operator]]s in terms of their effect on generalized [[function space]]s, and without mentioning [[derivative|differentiation]] in explicit terms.  The Peetre theorem is an example of a [[finite order theorem]] in which a function or a [[functor]], defined in a very general way, can in fact be shown to be a polynomial because of some extraneous condition or symmetry imposed upon it.\n\nThis article treats two forms of the Peetre theorem.  The first is the original version which, although quite useful in its own right, is actually too general for most applications.\n\n== The original Peetre theorem ==\nLet ''M'' be a [[smooth manifold]] and let ''E'' and ''F'' be two [[vector bundles]] on ''M''.  Let\n:<math>\\Gamma^\\infty (E),\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\Gamma^\\infty (F)</math>\nbe the spaces of [[smooth section]]s of ''E'' and ''F''.  An ''operator''\n:<math>D:\\Gamma^\\infty (E)\\rightarrow \\Gamma^\\infty(F)</math>\nis a [[sheaf (mathematics)|morphism of sheaves]] which is linear on sections such that the [[support (mathematics)|support]] of ''D'' is [[non-increasing]]: ''supp Ds'' &sube; ''supp s'' for every smooth section ''s'' of ''E''.   The original Peetre theorem asserts that, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is a neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and an integer ''k'' (depending on ''U'') such that ''D'' is a [[differential operator]] of order ''k'' over ''U''.  This means that ''D'' factors through a linear mapping ''i''<sub>''D''</sub> from the ''k''-[[jet (mathematics)|jet of sections]] of ''E'' into the space of smooth sections of ''F'':\n:<math>D=i_D\\circ j^k</math>\nwhere\n:<math>j^k:\\Gamma^\\infty E\\rightarrow J^kE</math>\nis the ''k''-jet operator and\n:<math>i_D:J^kE\\rightarrow F</math>\nis a linear mapping of vector bundles.\n\n=== Proof ===\nThe problem is invariant under local diffeomorphism, so it is sufficient to prove it when ''M'' is an open set in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and ''E'' and ''F'' are trivial bundles.  At this point, it relies primarily on two lemmas:\n*'''Lemma 1.'''  If the hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied, then for every ''x''&isin;''M'' and ''C'' > 0, there exists a neighborhood ''V'' of ''x'' and a positive integer ''k'' such that for any ''y''&isin;''V''\\{''x''} and for any section ''s'' of ''E'' whose ''k''-jet  vanishes at ''y'' (''j<sup>k</sup>s''(''y'')=0), we have |''Ds''(''y'')|<C.\n*'''Lemma 2.'''  The first lemma is sufficient to prove the theorem.\n\nWe begin with the proof of Lemma 1.\n\n:Suppose the lemma is false.  Then there is a sequence ''x''<sub>k</sub> tending to ''x'', and a sequence of very disjoint balls ''B''<sub>k</sub> around the ''x''<sub>''k''</sub> (meaning that the geodesic distance between any two such balls is non-zero), and sections ''s''<sub>k</sub> of ''E'' over each ''B''<sub>''k''</sub> such that ''j''<sup>''k''</sup>s<sub>k</sub>(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>)=0 but |''Ds''<sub>k</sub>(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>)|&ge;C>0.\n\n:Let &rho;(''x'') denote a standard [[bump function]] for the unit ball at the origin: a smooth real-valued function which is equal to 1 on ''B''<sub>1/2</sub>(0), which vanishes to infinite order on the boundary of the unit ball.\n\n:Consider every other section ''s''<sub>''2k''</sub>.  At ''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>, these satisfy \n::''j''<sup>''2k''</sup>''s''<sub>2k</sub>(''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>)=0.\n:Suppose that ''2k'' is given.  Then, since these functions are smooth and each satisfy ''j''<sup>2k</sup>(''s''<sub>2k</sub>)(''x''<sub>2k</sub>)=0, it is possible to specify a smaller ball ''B&prime;''<sub>&delta;</sub>(''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>) such that the higher order derivatives obey the following estimate:\n::<math>\\sum_{|\\alpha|\\le k}\\ \\sup_{y\\in B'_\\delta(x_{2k})} |\\nabla^\\alpha s_k(y)|\\le \\frac{1}{M_k}\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\right)^k</math>\n:where\n::<math>M_k=\\sum_{|\\alpha|\\le k}\\sup |\\nabla^\\alpha\\rho|.</math>\n\n:Now\n::<math>\\rho_{2k}(y):=\\rho\\left(\\frac{y-x_{2k}}{\\delta}\\right)</math>\n:is a standard bump function supported in ''B&prime;''<sub>&delta;</sub>(''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>), and the derivative of the product ''s''<sub>2k</sub>&rho;<sub>2k</sub> is bounded in such a way that\n::<math>\\max_{|\\alpha|\\le k}\\ \\sup_{y\\in B'_\\delta(x_{2k})}|\\nabla^\\alpha (\\rho_{2k}s_{2k})|\\le 2^{-k}.</math>\n:As a result, because the following series and all of the partial sums of its derivatives converge uniformly\n::<math>q(y)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\rho_{2k}(y)s_{2k}(y),</math> \n:''q''(''y'') is a smooth function on all of ''V''.\n\n:We now observe that since ''s''<sub>2k</sub> and <math>\\rho</math><sub>2k</sub>''s''<sub>2k</sub> are equal in a neighborhood of ''x''<sub>2k</sub>,\n::<math>\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}|Dq(x_{2k})|\\ge C</math>\n:So by continuity |''Dq''(''x'')|&ge; C>0.  On the other hand, \n::<math>\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}Dq(x_{2k+1})=0</math>\n:since ''Dq''(''x''<sub>2k+1</sub>)=0 because ''q'' is identically zero in ''B''<sub>2k+1</sub> and ''D'' is support non-increasing.  So ''Dq''(''x'')=0.  This is a contradiction.\n\nWe now prove Lemma 2.\n\n:First, let us dispense with the constant ''C'' from the first lemma.  We show that, under the same hypotheses as Lemma 1, |Ds(y)|=0.  Pick a ''y'' in ''V''\\{''x''} so that ''j''<sup>k</sup>''s''(y)=0 but |''Ds''(''y'')|=''g''>0.  Rescale ''s'' by a factor of 2''C''/g.  Then if ''g'' is non-zero, by the linearity of ''D'', |''Ds''(''y'')|=2''C''>''C'', which is impossible by Lemma 1.  This proves the theorem in the punctured neighborhood ''V''\\{''x''}.\n\n:Now, we must continue the differential operator to the central point ''x'' in the punctured neighborhood.  ''D'' is a linear differential operator with smooth coefficients.  Furthermore, it sends germs of smooth functions to germs of smooth functions at ''x'' as well.  Thus the coefficients of ''D'' are also smooth at ''x''.\n\n== A specialized application ==\nLet ''M'' be a [[compact (topology)|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] (possibly with [[manifold|boundary]]), and ''E'' and ''F'' be finite dimensional [[vector bundle]]s on ''M''.  Let\n\n:<math>\\Gamma^\\infty (E)</math>be the collection of [[smooth section]]s of ''E''.  An ''operator''\n\n:<math>D:\\Gamma^\\infty (E)\\rightarrow \\Gamma^\\infty (F)</math>\n\nis a smooth function (of [[Fr\u00e9chet manifold]]s) which is linear on the fibres and respects the base point on ''M'':\n\n:<math>\\pi\\circ D_p=p.</math>\n\nThe Peetre theorem asserts that for each operator ''D'', there exists an integer ''k'' such that ''D'' is a [[differential operator]] of order ''k''.   Specifically, we can decompose\n\n:<math>D=i_D\\circ j^k</math>\n\nwhere <math>i_D</math> is a mapping from the [[jet (mathematics)|jet]]s of sections of ''E'' to the bundle ''F''.

The Peetre theorem is an example of a [[finite order theorem]] in which a function or a [[functor]], defined in a very general way, can in fact be shown to be a polynomial because of some extraneous condition or symmetry imposed upon it.\n\nThis article treats two forms of the Peetre theorem.  The first is the original version which, although quite useful in its own right, is actually too general for most applications.\n\n== The original Peetre theorem ==\nLet ''M'' be a [[smooth manifold]] and let ''E'' and ''F'' be two [[vector bundles]] on ''M''.  Let\n:<math>\\Gamma^\\infty (E),\\ \\hbox{and}\\ \\Gamma^\\infty (F)</math>\nbe the spaces of [[smooth section]]s of ''E'' and ''F''.  An ''operator''\n:<math>D:\\Gamma^\\infty (E)\\rightarrow \\Gamma^\\infty(F)</math>\nis a [[sheaf (mathematics)|morphism of sheaves]] which is linear on sections such that the [[support (mathematics)|support]] of ''D'' is [[non-increasing]]: ''supp Ds'' &sube; ''supp s'' for every smooth section ''s'' of ''E''.   The original Peetre theorem asserts that, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is a neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and an integer ''k'' (depending on ''U'') such that ''D'' is a [[differential operator]] of order ''k'' over ''U''.  This means that ''D'' factors through a linear mapping ''i''<sub>''D''</sub> from the ''k''-[[jet (mathematics)|jet of sections]] of ''E'' into the space of smooth sections of ''F'':\n:<math>D=i_D\\circ j^k</math>\nwhere\n:<math>j^k:\\Gamma^\\infty E\\rightarrow J^kE</math>\nis the ''k''-jet operator and\n:<math>i_D:J^kE\\rightarrow F</math>\nis a linear mapping of vector bundles.\n\n=== Proof ===\nThe problem is invariant under local diffeomorphism, so it is sufficient to prove it when ''M'' is an open set in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and ''E'' and ''F'' are trivial bundles.  At this point, it relies primarily on two lemmas:\n*'''Lemma 1.'''  If the hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied, then for every ''x''&isin;''M'' and ''C'' > 0, there exists a neighborhood ''V'' of ''x'' and a positive integer ''k'' such that for any ''y''&isin;''V''\\{''x''} and for any section ''s'' of ''E'' whose ''k''-jet  vanishes at ''y'' (''j<sup>k</sup>s''(''y'')=0), we have |''Ds''(''y'')|<C.\n*'''Lemma 2.'''  The first lemma is sufficient to prove the theorem.\n\nWe begin with the proof of Lemma 1.\n\n:Suppose the lemma is false.  Then there is a sequence ''x''<sub>k</sub> tending to ''x'', and a sequence of very disjoint balls ''B''<sub>k</sub> around the ''x''<sub>''k''</sub> (meaning that the geodesic distance between any two such balls is non-zero), and sections ''s''<sub>k</sub> of ''E'' over each ''B''<sub>''k''</sub> such that ''j''<sup>''k''</sup>s<sub>k</sub>(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>)=0 but |''Ds''<sub>k</sub>(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>)|&ge;C>0.\n\n:Let &rho;(''x'') denote a standard [[bump function]] for the unit ball at the origin: a smooth real-valued function which is equal to 1 on ''B''<sub>1/2</sub>(0), which vanishes to infinite order on the boundary of the unit ball.\n\n:Consider every other section ''s''<sub>''2k''</sub>.  At ''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>, these satisfy \n::''j''<sup>''2k''</sup>''s''<sub>2k</sub>(''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>)=0.\n:Suppose that ''2k'' is given.  Then, since these functions are smooth and each satisfy ''j''<sup>2k</sup>(''s''<sub>2k</sub>)(''x''<sub>2k</sub>)=0, it is possible to specify a smaller ball ''B&prime;''<sub>&delta;</sub>(''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>) such that the higher order derivatives obey the following estimate:\n::<math>\\sum_{|\\alpha|\\le k}\\ \\sup_{y\\in B'_\\delta(x_{2k})} |\\nabla^\\alpha s_k(y)|\\le \\frac{1}{M_k}\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\right)^k</math>\n:where\n::<math>M_k=\\sum_{|\\alpha|\\le k}\\sup |\\nabla^\\alpha\\rho|.</math>\n\n:Now\n::<math>\\rho_{2k}(y):=\\rho\\left(\\frac{y-x_{2k}}{\\delta}\\right)</math>\n:is a standard bump function supported in ''B&prime;''<sub>&delta;</sub>(''x''<sub>''2k''</sub>), and the derivative of the product ''s''<sub>2k</sub>&rho;<sub>2k</sub> is bounded in such a way that\n::<math>\\max_{|\\alpha|\\le k}\\ \\sup_{y\\in B'_\\delta(x_{2k})}|\\nabla^\\alpha (\\rho_{2k}s_{2k})|\\le 2^{-k}.</math>\n:As a result, because the following series and all of the partial sums of its derivatives converge uniformly\n::<math>q(y)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\rho_{2k}(y)s_{2k}(y),</math> \n:''q''(''y'') is a smooth function on all of ''V''.\n\n:We now observe that since ''s''<sub>2k</sub> and <math>\\rho</math><sub>2k</sub>''s''<sub>2k</sub> are equal in a neighborhood of ''x''<sub>2k</sub>,\n::<math>\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}|Dq(x_{2k})|\\ge C</math>\n:So by continuity |''Dq''(''x'')|&ge; C>0.  On the other hand, \n::<math>\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}Dq(x_{2k+1})=0</math>\n:since ''Dq''(''x''<sub>2k+1</sub>)=0 because ''q'' is identically zero in ''B''<sub>2k+1</sub> and ''D'' is support non-increasing.  So ''Dq''(''x'')=0.  This is a contradiction.\n\nWe now prove Lemma 2.\n\n:First, let us dispense with the constant ''C'' from the first lemma.  We show that, under the same hypotheses as Lemma 1, |Ds(y)|=0.  Pick a ''y'' in ''V''\\{''x''} so that ''j''<sup>k</sup>''s''(y)=0 but |''Ds''(''y'')|=''g''>0.  Rescale ''s'' by a factor of 2''C''/g.  Then if ''g'' is non-zero, by the linearity of ''D'', |''Ds''(''y'')|=2''C''>''C'', which is impossible by Lemma 1.  This proves the theorem in the punctured neighborhood ''V''\\{''x''}.\n\n:Now, we must continue the differential operator to the central point ''x'' in the punctured neighborhood.  ''D'' is a linear differential operator with smooth coefficients.  Furthermore, it sends germs of smooth functions to germs of smooth functions at ''x'' as well.  Thus the coefficients of ''D'' are also smooth at ''x''.\n\n== A specialized application ==\nLet ''M'' be a [[compact (topology)|compact]] [[smooth manifold]] (possibly with [[manifold|boundary]]), and ''E'' and ''F'' be finite dimensional [[vector bundle]]s on ''M''.  Let\n\n:<math>\\Gamma^\\infty (E)</math>be the collection of [[smooth section]]s of ''E''.  An ''operator''\n\n:<math>D:\\Gamma^\\infty (E)\\rightarrow \\Gamma^\\infty (F)</math>\n\nis a smooth function (of [[Fr\u00e9chet manifold]]s) which is linear on the fibres and respects the base point on ''M'':\n\n:<math>\\pi\\circ D_p=p.</math>\n\nThe Peetre theorem asserts that for each operator ''D'', there exists an integer ''k'' such that ''D'' is a [[differential operator]] of order ''k''.   Specifically, we can decompose\n\n:<math>D=i_D\\circ j^k</math>\n\nwhere <math>i_D</math> is a mapping from the [[jet (mathematics)|jet]]s of sections of ''E'' to the bundle ''F''.  See also [[differential operator#Coordinate-independent_description|intrinsic differential operators]].\n\n== Example: Laplacian ==\nConsider the following operator:\n\n:<math>(L f)(x_0) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{2d}{r^2}\\frac{1}{|S_r|} \\int_{S_r} (f(x)-f(x_0)) dx</math>\n\nwhere <math> f \\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^d) </math> and <math>S_r</math> is the sphere centered at <math>x_0</math> with radius <math>r</math>. This is in fact the Laplacian.

By 1864 he had accumulated marching bands and musicians to entertain him. When Maximilian's empire was defeated, many of his former army and fellow countrymen fled north and dispersed into what is now the [[southwestern United States]]. Norte\u00f1o music developed from a blending of Mexican and Spanish oral and musical traditions, military brass band instrumentation, and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] musical styles such as [[polka]] and [[Waltz (music)|waltz]].\n\nEuropean immigrants from [[Germany]], [[Poland]], & the [[Czech  Republic]] to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States also brought dance traditions such as the [[varsovienne]]. The focus on the [[accordion]] in the music of their home countries was integrated into Mexican music, and the instrument is essential in the genre today. It was called norte\u00f1o because it was most popular in the northern regions of Mexico.\n\nThe late 1910s and 1920s were the golden age of the [[corrido]], a form of [[ballad]]. Mexicans on both sides of the border came to [[San Antonio, Texas]], to record in hotels. Their songs memorialize the Mexican political revolution of the time. [[Los Alegres de Ter\u00e1n]] and [[Los Donne\u00f1os]] were among the first norte\u00f1o bands. Later in the century, the genre became more commercial with the works of [[Los Rel\u00e1mpagos del Norte]] and other groups.
