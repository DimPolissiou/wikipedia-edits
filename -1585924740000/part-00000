Since the establishment of a world fur market in the [[early modern period]], furs of [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]], polar and cold temperate mammalian animals have been the most valued. Historically the trade stimulated the exploration and colonization of [[Siberia]], northern [[North America]], and the [[South Shetland Islands|South Shetland]] and [[South Sandwich Islands]].\n\nToday the importance of the fur trade has diminished; it is based on pelts produced at fur farms and regulated fur-bearer [[trapping]], but has become controversial. [[Animal rights]] organizations oppose the fur trade, citing that animals are brutally killed and sometimes skinned alive.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://features.peta.org/ChineseFurFarms/|title = Feature: A Shocking Look Inside Chinese Fur Farms|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher =[[PETA]] |last = |first = }}</ref> Fur has been replaced in some clothing by [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] imitations, for example, as in ruffs on hoods of [[parka]]s.\n\n[[File:Alberta 1890s fur trader.jpg|thumb|right|A fur trader in [[Fort Chipewyan]], [[District of Athabasca|Northwest Territories]] in the 1890s]]\n\n==Russian fur trade==\nBefore the European colonization of the Americas, Russia was a major supplier of fur pelts to Western Europe and parts of Asia. Its trade developed in the [[Early Middle Ages]] ( 500\u20131000 AD/CE ), first through exchanges at posts around the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas. The main trading market destination was the German city of [[Leipzig]].{{sfn|Fisher|1943|p=197}} Kievan Russia, the first Russian State, was the first supplier of the Russian Fur Trade.{{sfn|Fisher|1943|p=1}}\n\nOriginally, Russia exported raw furs, consisting in most cases of the pelts of [[marten]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[squirrel]]s and [[hare]]s. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, Russians began to settle in [[Siberia]], a region rich in many mammal fur species, such as [[Arctic fox]], [[lynx]], [[sable]], [[sea otter]] and stoat ([[ermine]]). In a search for the prized [[sea otter]] pelts, first used in China, and later for the [[northern fur seal]], the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]] expanded into North America, notably [[Alaska]]. From the 17th through the second half of the 19th century, Russia was the world's largest supplier of fur. The fur trade played a vital role in the development of [[Siberia]], the [[Russian Far East]] and the [[Russian colonization of the Americas]]. As recognition of the importance of the trade to the Siberian economy, the sable is a regional symbol of the Ural [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] and the Siberian [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen]] and [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]] [[Oblast]]s of Russia.<ref>Janet Martin, ''Treasure of the Land of Darkness: The Fur Trade and Its Significance for Medieval Russia'' (2004) p. 204</ref>\n\n[[File:Fur muff manufacturer Ralph Moses, New York, 1949 advertisement.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Fur [[muff (handwarmer)|muff]] manufacturer's 1949 advertisement]]\n\nThe European discovery of North America, with its vast forests and wildlife, particularly the beaver, led to the continent becoming a major supplier in the 17th century of fur pelts for the fur [[felt]] hat and fur trimming and garment trades of Europe. Fur was relied on to make warm clothing, a critical consideration prior to the organization of coal distribution for heating. Portugal and Spain played major roles in fur trading after the 15th century with their business in fur hats.{{sfn|Fisher|1943|p=17}}\n\n===Siberian fur trade===\n{{main|Siberian fur trade}}\nFrom as early as the 10th century, merchants and boyars of [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] had exploited the fur resources \"beyond the portage\", a watershed at the [[Lake Beloye (disambiguation)|White Lake]] that represents the door to the entire northwestern part of Eurasia. They began by establishing [[trading post]]s along the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Vychegda River|Vychegda]] river networks and requiring the [[Komi peoples|Komi]] people to give them furs as [[tribute]]. Novgorod, the chief fur-trade center prospered as the easternmost trading post of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Novgorodians expanded farther east and north, coming into contact with the [[Pechora people]] of the [[Pechora River]] valley and the [[Yugra]] people residing near the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]]. Both of these native tribes offered more resistance than the Komi, killing many Russian tribute-collectors throughout the tenth and eleventh centuries.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=2\u20133}} As [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]] gained more power in the 15th century and proceeded in the \"[[Ivan III of Russia#Gathering of Russian lands|gathering of the Russian lands]]\", the Muscovite state began to rival the Novgorodians in the North. During the 15th century Moscow began subjugating many native tribes. One strategy involved exploiting antagonisms between tribes, notably the Komi and Yugra, by recruiting men of one tribe to fight in an army against the other tribe. Campaigns against native tribes in [[Siberia]] remained insignificant until they began on a much larger scale in 1483 and 1499.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=28}}\n\nBesides the Novgorodians and the indigenes, Muscovites also had to contend with the various Muslim [[Tatars|Tatar khanates]] to the east of Muscovy. In 1552 [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]], the Tsar of All the Russias, took a significant step towards securing Russian hegemony in Siberia when he sent a large army to attack the [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan Tartars]] and ended up obtaining the territory from the Volga to the [[Ural Mountains]]. At this point the phrase \"ruler of [[Obdoria|Obdor]], [[Kondia|Konda]], and all Siberian lands\" became part of the title of the [[Tsar]] in Moscow.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=10}} Even so, problems ensued after 1558 when Ivan IV sent {{Interlanguage link multi| Grigory Stroganov | ru |3= \u0421\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (ca 1533\u20131577) to colonize land on the [[Kama River|Kama]] and to subjugate and enserf the [[Komi peoples|Komi]] living there. The [[Stroganov family]] soon came into conflict (1573) with the [[Khanate of Sibir|Khan of Sibir]] whose land they encroached on. Ivan told the Stroganovs to hire [[Cossacks|Cossack]] mercenaries to protect the new settlement from the Tatars. From ca 1581 the band of Cossacks led by [[Yermak Timofeyevich]] fought many battles that eventually culminated in a Tartar victory (1584) and the temporary end to Russian occupation in the area. In 1584 Ivan's son [[Feodor I of Russia|Fyodor]] sent military governors ([[voivode|voivodas]]) and soldiers to reclaim Yermak conquests and officially to annex the land held by the [[Khanate of Sibir]]. Similar skirmishes with Tartars took place across Siberia as Russian expansion continued.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=29-33}}\n\nRussian conquerors treated the natives of Siberia as easily exploited enemies who were inferior to them. As they penetrated deeper into Siberia, traders built outposts or winter lodges called ''{{Interlanguage link multi|zimovya| ru |3=\u0417\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435}}'' where they lived and collected fur tribute from native tribes. By 1620 Russia dominated the land from the Urals eastward to the [[Yenisei River|Yenisey]] valley and to the [[Altai Mountains]] in the south, comprising about 1.25 million square miles of land.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=38}} Furs would become Russia's largest source of wealth during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Keeping up with the advances of Western Europe required significant capital and Russia did not have sources of gold and silver, but it did have furs, which became known as \"soft gold\" and provided Russia with hard currency. The Russian government received income from the fur trade through two taxes, the ''[[yasak]]'' (or iasak) tax on natives and the 10% \"Sovereign Tithing Tax\" imposed on both the catch and sale of fur pelts.{{sfn|Bychkov|Jacobs|1994|p=73}} Fur was in great demand in Western Europe, especially sable and marten, since European forest resources had been over-hunted and furs had become extremely scarce. Fur trading allowed Russia to purchase from Europe goods that it lacked, like lead, tin, precious metals, textiles, firearms, and sulphur. Russia also traded furs with [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]] and other countries in the Middle East in exchange for silk, textiles, spices, and dried fruit. The high prices that sable, black fox, and marten furs could generate in international markets spurred a \"fur fever\" in which many Russians moved to Siberia as independent trappers. From 1585 to 1680, tens of thousands of sable and other valuable pelts were obtained in Siberia each year.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=38-40}}\n\n[[File:Sbor Yasaka.jpg|thumb|[[Cossacks]] collecting ''yasak'' in Siberia]] \nThe primary way for the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite state]] to obtain furs was by exacting a fur tribute from the Siberian natives, called a ''yasak''. ''Yasak'' was usually a fixed number of sable pelts which every male tribe member who was at least fifteen years old had to supply to Russian officials. Officials enforced ''yasak'' through coercion and by taking hostages, usually the tribe chiefs or members of the chief's family. At first, Russians were content to trade with the natives, exchanging goods like pots, axes, and beads for the prized sables that the natives did not value, but greater demand for furs led to violence and force becoming the primary means of obtaining the furs. The largest problem with the ''yasak'' system was that Russian governors were prone to corruption because they received no salary. They resorted to illegal means of getting furs for themselves, including bribing customs officials to allow them to personally collect ''yasak'', extorting natives by exacting ''yasak'' multiple times over, or requiring tribute from independent trappers.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=41-42}}\n\nRussian fur trappers, called ''[[promyshlenniki]]'', hunted in one of two types of bands of 10\u201315 men, called {{Interlanguage link multi| ''vatagi'' | ru |3= \u0412\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0433\u0430}}. The first was an independent band of blood relatives or unrelated people who contributed an equal share of the hunting-expedition expenses; the second was a band of hired hunters who participated in expeditions fully funded by the trading companies which employed them. Members of an independent ''vataga'' cooperated and shared all necessary work associated with fur trapping, including making and setting traps, building forts and camps, stockpiling firewood and grain, and fishing. All fur pelts went into a common pool that the band divided equally among themselves after Russian officials exacted the tithing tax. On the other hand, a trading company provided hired fur-trappers with the money needed for transportation, food, and supplies, and once the hunt was finished, the employer received two-thirds of the pelts and the remaining ones were sold and the proceeds divided evenly among the hired laborers. During the summer, ''promyshlenniki'' would set up a summer camp to stockpile grain and fish, and many engaged in agricultural work for extra money. During late summer or early fall the ''vatagi'' left their hunting grounds, surveyed the area, and set up a winter camp. Each member of the group set at least 10 traps and the ''vatagi'' divided into smaller groups of 2 to 3 men who cooperated to maintain certain traps. ''Promyshlenniki'' checked traps daily, resetting them or replacing bait whenever necessary. The ''promyshlenniki'' employed both passive and active hunting-strategies. The passive approach involved setting traps, while the active approach involved the use of hunting-dogs and of bows-and-arrows. Occasionally, hunters also followed sable tracks to their burrows, around which they placed nets, and waited for the sable to emerge.{{sfn|Bychkov|Jacobs|1994|p=75-80}}\n\nThe hunting season began around the time of the first snow in October or November and continued until early spring. Hunting expeditions lasted two to three years on average but occasionally longer. Because of the long hunting season and the fact that passage back to Russia was difficult and costly, beginning around the 1650s\u20131660s many ''promyshlenniki'' chose to stay and settle in Siberia.{{sfn|Bychkov|Jacobs|1994|p=80-81}} From 1620 to 1680 a total of 15,983 trappers operated in Siberia.{{sfn|Bychkov|Jacobs|1994|p=74}}\n\n==North American fur trade==\n{{Main|North American fur trade}}\n\n[[File:Fur industry- hat-making, Canadian voyageurs. ( 1858- ).jpg|thumb|Fur-hat industry]]\nThe North American fur trade began as early as the 1500s with Europeans and First Nations<ref>[[North American fur trade#Origins|Early French Fur Trading]]</ref> and was a central part of the early [[European colonization of the Americas|history of contact]] between [[Europe]]ans and the native peoples of what is now the [[Native Americans in the United States|United States]] and [[First Nations|Canada]]. In 1578 there were 350 European fishing vessels at [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Sailors began to trade metal implements (particularly knives) for the natives' well-worn pelts. The first pelts in demand were beaver and sea otter, as well as occasionally deer, bear, ermine and skunk.{{sfn|Dolin|2010|p=16}}\n\nFur robes were blankets of sewn-together, native-tanned, beaver pelts. The pelts were called ''castor gras'' in French and \"coat beaver\" in English, and were soon recognized by the newly developed felt-hat making industry as particularly useful for felting. Some historians, seeking to explain the term ''castor gras'', have assumed that coat beaver was rich in human oils from having been worn so long (much of the top-hair was worn away through usage, exposing the valuable under-wool), and that this is what made it attractive to the hatters. This seems unlikely, since grease interferes with the felting of wool, rather than enhancing it.{{sfn|Dolin|2010|p=46}} By the 1580s, beaver \"wool\" was the major starting material of the French felt-hatters. Hat makers began to use it in England soon after, particularly after [[Huguenot]] refugees brought their skills and tastes with them from France.\n\n==Early organization==\n[[File:Nanfan.jpg|thumb|General map of the \"Beaver Hunting Grounds\" described in \"Deed from the Five Nations to the King, of their Beaver Hunting Ground,\" also known as the [[Nanfan Treaty]] of 1701]]\nCaptain Chauvin made the first organized attempt to control the fur trade in [[New France]]. In 1599 he acquired a [[monopoly]] from [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] and tried to establish a colony near the mouth of the [[Saguenay River]] at [[Tadoussac]]. French explorers, like   [[Samuel de Champlain]], [[voyageurs]], and [[Coureur des bois]], such as [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]], [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]], [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]], and [[Pierre-Charles Le Sueur|Le Sueur]], while seeking routes through the continent, established relationships with [[Amerindians]] and continued to expand the trade of fur pelts for items considered 'common' by the Europeans. Mammal winter pelts were prized for warmth, particularly animal pelts for beaver wool felt hats, which were an expensive status symbol in Europe. The demand for beaver wool felt hats was such that the beaver in Europe and European Russia had largely disappeared through exploitation.\n\nIn 1613 Dallas Carite and [[Adriaen Block]] headed expeditions to establish fur trade relationships with the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] and [[Mohican]]. By 1614 the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were sending vessels to secure large economic returns from fur trading. The fur trade of New Netherland, through the port of [[New Amsterdam]], depended largely on the trading depot at [[Fort Orange]] (now Albany) on the upper [[Hudson River]]. Much of the fur is believed to have originated in Canada, smuggled south by entrepreneurs who wished to avoid the colony's government-imposed monopoly there.\n\nEngland was slower to enter the American fur trade than France and the Dutch Republic, but as soon as English colonies were established, development companies learned that furs provided the best way for the colonists to remit value back to the mother country. Furs were being dispatched from Virginia soon after 1610, and the [[Plymouth Colony]] was sending substantial amounts of beaver to its London agents through the 1620s and 1630s. London merchants tried to take over France's fur trade in the St Lawrence River valley. Taking advantage of one of England's brief wars with France, [[Sir David Kirke]] captured Quebec in 1629 and brought the year's produce of furs back to London. Other English merchants also traded for furs around the [[Saint Lawrence River]] region in the 1630s, but these were officially discouraged. Such efforts ceased as France strengthened its presence in Canada. Meanwhile, the [[New England]] fur trade expanded, not only inland, but northward along the coast into the [[Bay of Fundy]] region. London's access to high-quality furs was greatly increased with the takeover of New Amsterdam, whereupon the fur trade of that colony (now called New York) fell into English hands with the 1667 [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]].\n[[File:Fur traders in canada 1777.jpg|thumb|Fur traders in Canada, trading with Native Americans, 1777]]\nIn 1668 the English fur trade entered a new phase. Two French citizens, [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[M\u00e9dard des Groseilliers]], had traded with great success west of [[Lake Superior]] in 1659\u201360, but upon their return to Canada, most of their furs were seized by the authorities. Their trading voyage had convinced them that the best fur country was far to the north and west, and could best be reached by ships sailing into [[Hudson Bay]]. Their treatment in Canada suggested that they would not find support from France for their scheme. The pair went to New England, where they found local financial support for at least two attempts to reach Hudson Bay, both unsuccessful. Their ideas had reached the ears of English authorities, however, and in 1665 Radisson and Groseilliers were persuaded to go to London. After some setbacks, a number of English investors were found to back another attempt for Hudson Bay.\n\nTwo ships were sent out in 1668. One, with Radisson aboard, had to turn back, but the other, the ''[[Nonsuch (1650 ship)|Nonsuch]],'' with Groseilliers, did penetrate the bay. There she was able to trade with the indigenes, collecting a fine cargo of beaver skins before the expedition returned to London in October 1669. The delighted investors sought a royal charter, which they obtained the next year. This charter established the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and granted it a monopoly to trade into all the rivers that emptied into Hudson Bay. From 1670 onwards, the Hudson's Bay Company sent two or three trading ships into the bay every year. They brought back furs (mainly beaver) and sold them, sometimes by private treaty but usually by public auction. The beaver was bought mainly for the English hat-making trade, while the fine furs went to the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nMeanwhile, in the [[Colonial America#Lower South|English southern colonies]], a [[deerskin trade]] was established around 1670, based at the export hub of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Word spread among Native hunters that the Europeans would exchange pelts for the European-manufactured goods that were highly desired in native communities. English traders stocked axe heads, knives, awls, fish hooks, cloth of various type and color, woolen blankets, linen shirts, kettles, jewelry, glass beads, [[musket]]s, ammunition and powder to exchange on a 'per pelt' basis.\n\nColonial trading posts in the southern colonies also introduced many types of alcohol (especially brandy and rum) for trade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montana.edu/wwwai/imsd/alcohol/Jessyca/furtrade.htm |title=Introduction of alcohol through the fur trade |work=[[University of Montana]] |access-date=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226180021/http://www.montana.edu/wwwai/imsd/alcohol/Jessyca/furtrade.htm |archive-date=26 February 2009}}</ref> European traders flocked to the North American continent and made huge profits from the exchange. A metal axe head, for example, was exchanged for one beaver pelt (also called a 'beaver blanket'). The same pelt could fetch enough to buy dozens of axe heads in England, making the fur trade extremely profitable for the Europeans. The Natives used the iron axe heads to replace stone axe heads which they had made by hand in a labor-intensive process, so they derived substantial benefits from the trade as well.  The British began to see the ill  effects of alcohol on Natives, and the chiefs objected to its sale and trade. The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] prohibited sale by European settlers of alcohol to the Indians in Canada, following the British takeover of the territory after it defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]] (known as the [[French and Indian War]] in North America).\n\n===Socioeconomic ties===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Fur trading at [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9]] in 1841]]\nOften, the political benefits of the fur trade became more important than the economic aspects. Trade was a way to forge alliances and maintain good relations between different cultures. The fur traders were men with capital and social standing. Often younger men were single when they went to North America to enter the fur trade; they made marriages or cohabited with high-ranking Indian women of similar status in their own cultures. Fur trappers and other workers usually had relationships with lower-ranking women. Many of their mixed-race descendants developed their own culture, now called ''[[M\u00e9tis]]'' in Canada, based then on fur trapping and other activities on the frontier.\n\nIn some cases both Native American and European-American cultures excluded the mixed-race descendants. If the Native Americans were a tribe with a [[patrilineal]] [[kinship]] system, they considered children born to a white father to be white, in a type of [[hypodescent]] classification, although the Native mother and tribe might care for them. The Europeans tended to classify children of Native women as Native, regardless of the father, similar to the hypodescent of their classification of the children of slaves. The M\u00e9tis in the Canadian [[Red River of the North|Red River]] region were so numerous that they developed a [[creole language]] and culture. Since the late 20th century, the M\u00e9tis have been recognized in Canada as a [[First Nations]] ethnic group. The interracial relationships resulted in a two-tier mixed-race class, in which descendants of fur traders and chiefs achieved prominence in some Canadian social, political, and economic circles. Lower-class descendants formed the majority of the separate [[M\u00e9tis]] culture based on hunting, trapping and farming.\n\nBecause of the wealth at stake, different European-American governments competed with various native societies for control of the fur trade. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] sometimes based decisions of which side to support in times of war in relation to which people had provided them with the best trade goods in an honest manner. Because trade was so politically important, the Europeans tried to regulate it in hopes (often futile) of preventing abuse. Unscrupulous traders sometimes cheated natives by plying them with alcohol during the transaction, which subsequently aroused resentment and often resulted in violence.\n\nIn 1834 [[John Jacob Astor]], who had created the huge monopoly of the [[American Fur Company]], withdrew from the fur trade. He could see the decline in fur animals and realized the market was changing, as beaver hats went out of style. Expanding European settlement displaced native communities from the best hunting grounds. European demand for furs subsided as fashion trends shifted. The [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans']] lifestyles were altered by the trade. To continue obtaining European goods on which they had become dependent and to pay off their debts, they often resorted to selling land to the European settlers. Their resentment of the forced sales contributed to future wars.\n\n[[File:George Caleb Bingham 001.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fur Traders Descending the Missouri]], c.&nbsp;1845]]\nAfter the [[United States]] became independent, it regulated trading with Native Americans by the [[Indian Intercourse Act]], first passed on July 22, 1790. The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] issued licenses to trade in the [[Indian Territory]]. In 1834 this was defined as most of the United States west of the [[Mississippi River]], where [[mountain man|mountain men]] and traders from [[Mexico]] freely operated.\n\nEarly exploration parties were often fur-trading expeditions, many of which marked the first recorded instances of Europeans' reaching particular regions of North America. For example, [[Abraham Wood]] sent fur-trading parties on exploring expeditions into the southern Appalachian Mountains, discovering the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] in the process. [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] was a fur trader who explored much of the [[Fraser River]] in British Columbia.\n\n===Role in economic anthropology===\nEconomic historians and anthropologists have studied the fur trade's important role in early North American economies, but they have been unable to agree on a theoretical framework to describe native economic patterns.\n\n[[File:Running them down; Hauling the meat in with dogs - Fort Babine 1875.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|left|Sketches of life in the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] territory, 1875]]\nJohn C. Phillips and J.W. Smurr tied the fur trade to an imperial struggle for power, positing that the fur trade served both as an incentive for expanding and as a method for maintaining dominance.

Historians such as [[Harold Innis]] had long taken the formalist position, especially in Canadian history, believing that neoclassical economic principles affect non-Western societies just as they do Western ones.<ref>{{cite book |last=Innis |first=Harold Adams |author-link=Harold Adams Innis |title=The Fur Trade in Canada: An Introduction to Canadian Economic History |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=1930 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCgps70cHV4C&printsec=frontcover |pages=463 |isbn=9780802081964 |editor=Oliver Baty Cunningham Memorial Publication Fund |editor2-first=Arthur J. |editor2-last=Ray}}</ref> Starting in the 1950s, however, substantivists such as [[Karl Polanyi]] challenged these ideas, arguing instead that primitive societies could engage in alternatives to traditional Western market trade; namely, gift trade and administered trade. Rich picked up these arguments in an influential article in which he contended that Indians had \"a persistent reluctance to accept European notions or the basic values of the European approach\" and that \"English economic rules did not apply to the Indian trade.\"<ref>{{cite journal |first=E.E. |last=Rich |title=Trade Habits and Economic Motivation Among the Indians of North America |journal=[[The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |date=February 1960 |pages=46, 47 |doi=10.2307/138817 |publisher=[[Canadian Economics Association]] |jstor=138817}}</ref> Indians were savvy traders, but they had a fundamentally different conception of property, which confounded their European trade partners. Abraham Rotstein subsequently fit these arguments explicitly into Polanyi's theoretical framework, claiming that \"administered trade was in operation at the Bay and market trade in London.\"<ref>Abraham Rotstein, \"Karl Polanyi\u2019s Concept of Non-Market Trade,\" ''The Journal of Economic History'' 30:1 (Mar., 1970): 123.

Ray permanently changed the direction of economic studies of the fur trade with two influential works that presented a modified formalist position in between the extremes of Innis and Rotstein. \"This trading system,\" Ray explained, \"is impossible to label neatly as \u2018gift trade', or \u2018administered trade', or \u2018market trade', since it embodies elements of all these forms.\"<ref>Arthur J. Ray and Donald B. Freeman, ''Give Us Good Measure: An Economic Analysis of Relations between the Indians and the Hudson's Bay Company Before 1763'', (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1978), 236.</ref> Indians engaged in trade for a variety of reasons. Reducing them to simple economic or cultural dichotomies, as the formalists and substantivists had done, was a fruitless simplification that obscured more than it revealed. Moreover, Ray used trade accounts and account books in the Hudson's Bay Company's archives for masterful qualitative analyses and pushed the boundaries of the field's methodology. Following Ray's position, Bruce M. White also helped to create a more nuanced picture of the complex ways in which native populations fit new economic relationships into existing cultural patterns.<ref>Bruce M. White, \"Give Us a Little Milk\": The Social and Cultural Meanings of Gift Giving in the Lake Superior Fur Trade\", in ''Rendezvous: Selected Papers of the Fourth North American Fur Trade Conference'', 1981, ed. Thomas C. Buckley (St. Paul, Minnesota: 1984), 185\u2013197.</ref>\n\nRichard White, while admitting that the formalist/substantivist debate was \"old, and now tired,\" attempted to reinvigorate the substantivist position.{{sfn|White|1991|p=94}} Echoing Ray's moderate position that cautioned against easy simplifications, White advanced a simple argument against formalism: \"Life was not a business, and such simplifications only distort the past.\"{{sfn|White|1991|p=95}} White argued instead that the fur trade occupied part of a \"middle ground\" in which Europeans and Indians sought to accommodate their cultural differences. In the case of the fur trade, this meant that the French were forced to learn from the political and cultural meanings with which Indians imbued the fur trade. Cooperation, not domination, prevailed.\n\n===Present===\nAccording to the [[Fur Institute of Canada]], there are about 60,000 active trappers in [[Canada]] (based on trapping licenses), of whom about 25,000 are indigenous peoples.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fur.ca/TFT_facts_figures.php |title=Canada's Fur Trade: Facts & Figures |work=[[Fur Institute of Canada]] |access-date=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103173436/http://www.fur.ca/TFT_facts_figures.php |archive-date=3 November 2012}}</ref> The fur farming industry is present in many parts of Canada.<ref>{{cite web |agency=[[Government of Canada]] |work=[[Statistics Canada]] |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/23-013-x/23-013-x2010001-eng.pdf |title=Fur Statistics, 2010 |access-date=22 July 2019 |issue=23\u2013013\u2013X |date=October 2011 |volume=8 |issn=1705-4273 |pages=20 |publisher=[[Minister of Industry (Canada)|Minister of Industry]]}}</ref> The largest producer of mink and foxes is Nova Scotia which in 2012 generated revenues of nearly $150 million and accounted for one quarter of all agricultural production in the Province.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bundale |first=Brett |title=Fur farms may not all survive new N.S. rules |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/450889-fur-farms-may-not-all-survive-new-ns-rules |access-date=12 March 2013 |newspaper=[[The Chronicle Herald]] |location=Halifax, Nova Scotia |date=January 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118155357/http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/450889-fur-farms-may-not-all-survive-new-ns-rules |archive-date=18 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Maritime fur trade ==\n{{main|Maritime fur trade}}\n[[File:Maritime Fur Trade-NorthWestCoast.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The North West Coast during the [[maritime fur trade]] era, about 1790 to 1840]]\nThe maritime fur trade was a ship-based fur trade system that focused on acquiring furs of [[sea otter]]s and other animals from the [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] and [[Alaska Natives|natives of Alaska]]. The furs were mostly traded in China for tea, silks, porcelain, and other Chinese goods, which were then sold in Europe and the United States. The maritime fur trade was pioneered by the Russians, working east from [[Kamchatka]] along the [[Aleutian Islands]] to the southern coast of Alaska. British and Americans entered during the 1780s, focusing on what is now the [[British Columbia Coast|coast of British Columbia]]. The trade boomed around the turn of the 19th century. A long period of decline began in the 1810s. As the sea otter population was depleted, the maritime fur trade diversified and was transformed, tapping new markets and commodities while continuing to focus on the Northwest Coast and China. It lasted until the middle to late 19th century. Russians controlled most of the coast of what is now Alaska during the entire era. The coast south of Alaska saw fierce competition between, and among, British and American trading vessels. The British were the first to operate in the southern sector, but were unable to compete against the Americans who dominated from the 1790s to the 1830s. The British [[Hudson's Bay Company]] entered the coast trade in the 1820s with the intention of driving the Americans away. This was accomplished by about 1840. In its late period the maritime fur trade was largely conducted by the British [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the [[Russian-American Company]].\n[[File:Vue de l'etablissement russe de la Bodega, \u00e0 la C\u00f4te de la Nouvelle Albion, en 1828 (restored).jpg|thumb|The Russian fur traders from Alaska established their largest settlement in California, [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]], in 1812]]\n\nThe term \"maritime fur trade\" was coined by historians to distinguish the coastal, ship-based fur trade from the continental, land-based fur trade of, for example, the [[North West Company]] and the [[American Fur Company]]. Historically, the maritime fur trade was not known by that name, rather it was usually called the \"North West Coast trade\" or \"North West Trade\". The term \"North West\" was rarely spelled as the single word \"Northwest\", as is common today.<ref>{{cite book |last= Mackie |first= Richard Somerset |title= Trading Beyond the Mountains: The British Fur Trade on the Pacific 1793\u20131843 |year= 1997 |publisher= University of British Columbia (UBC) Press |location= Vancouver |isbn= 0-7748-0613-3 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=VKXgJw6K088C |page= 123}}</ref>\n\nThe maritime fur trade brought the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast into a vast, new [[international trade]] network, centered on the north Pacific Ocean, global in scope, and based on [[capitalism]] but not, for the most part, on [[colonialism]]. A [[triangular trade]] network emerged linking the Pacific Northwest coast, China, the [[Hawaiian Islands]] (only recently discovered by the [[Western world]]), Britain, and the United States (especially [[New England]]). The trade had a major effect on the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest coast, especially the [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]], and [[Chinook people]]s. There was a rapid increase of wealth among the Northwest Coast natives, along with increased warfare, [[potlatch]]ing, slaving, depopulation due to [[epidemic]] disease, and enhanced importance of [[totem]]s and traditional nobility crests.<ref>For more on the use of crests on the North West Coast, see: {{cite book |last= Reynoldson |first= Fiona |title= Native Americans: The Indigenous Peoples of North America |year= 2000 |publisher= Heinemann |isbn= 978-0-435-31015-8 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=jte28Ep3BoUC |page= 34}}</ref> The indigenous culture was not however overwhelmed, it rather flourished, while simultaneously undergoing rapid change. The use of [[Chinook Jargon]] arose during the maritime fur trading era and remains a distinctive aspect of Pacific Northwest culture. [[Native Hawaiian]] society was similarly affected by the sudden influx of Western wealth and technology, as well as epidemic diseases. The trade's effect on China and Europe was minimal. For New England, the maritime fur trade and the significant profits it made helped revitalize the region, contributing to the transformation of New England from an agrarian to an industrial society. The wealth generated by the maritime fur trade was invested in industrial development, especially [[textile manufacturing]]. The New England textile industry in turn had a large effect on [[slavery in the United States]], increasing the demand for cotton and helping make possible the rapid expansion of the cotton [[plantation system]] across the [[Deep South]].<ref name=farrow>{{cite book |last= Farrow |first= Anne |author2=Joel Lang |author3=Jennifer Frank  |title= Complicity: How the North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited from Slavery |year= 2006 |publisher= Random House |isbn= 978-0-345-46783-6 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=plYsNsZWZI0C |pages= xiv, 25\u201326, 35\u201337}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sea Otter.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A sea otter, drawing by S.

Since the establishment of a world fur market in the [[early modern period]], furs of [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]], polar and cold temperate mammalian animals have been the most valued. Historically the trade stimulated the exploration and colonization of [[Siberia]], northern [[North America]], and the [[South Shetland Islands|South Shetland]] and [[South Sandwich Islands]].\n\nToday the importance of the fur trade has diminished; it is based on pelts produced at fur farms and regulated fur-bearer [[trapping]], but has become controversial. [[Animal rights]] organizations oppose the fur trade, citing that animals are brutally killed and sometimes skinned alive.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://features.peta.org/ChineseFurFarms/|title = Feature: A Shocking Look Inside Chinese Fur Farms|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher =[[PETA]] |last = |first = }}</ref> Fur has been replaced in some clothing by [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] imitations, for example, as in ruffs on hoods of [[parka]]s.\n\n[[File:Alberta 1890s fur trader.jpg|thumb|right|A fur trader in [[Fort Chipewyan]], [[District of Athabasca|Northwest Territories]] in the 1890s]]\n\n==Russian fur trade==\nBefore the European colonization of the Americas, Russia was a major supplier of fur pelts to Western Europe and parts of Asia. Its trade developed in the [[Early Middle Ages]] ( 500\u20131000 AD/CE ), first through exchanges at posts around the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas. The main trading market destination was the German city of [[Leipzig]].{{sfn|Fisher|1943|p=197}} Kievan Russia, the first Russian State, was the first supplier of the Russian Fur Trade.{{sfn|Fisher|1943|p=1}}\n\nOriginally, Russia exported raw furs, consisting in most cases of the pelts of [[marten]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[squirrel]]s and [[hare]]s. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, Russians began to settle in [[Siberia]], a region rich in many mammal fur species, such as [[Arctic fox]], [[lynx]], [[sable]], [[sea otter]] and stoat ([[ermine]]). In a search for the prized [[sea otter]] pelts, first used in China, and later for the [[northern fur seal]], the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]] expanded into North America, notably [[Alaska]]. From the 17th through the second half of the 19th century, Russia was the world's largest supplier of fur. The fur trade played a vital role in the development of [[Siberia]], the [[Russian Far East]] and the [[Russian colonization of the Americas]]. As recognition of the importance of the trade to the Siberian economy, the sable is a regional symbol of the Ural [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] and the Siberian [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen]] and [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]] [[Oblast]]s of Russia.<ref>Janet Martin, ''Treasure of the Land of Darkness: The Fur Trade and Its Significance for Medieval Russia'' (2004) p. 204</ref>\n\n[[File:Fur muff manufacturer Ralph Moses, New York, 1949 advertisement.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Fur [[muff (handwarmer)|muff]] manufacturer's 1949 advertisement]]\n\nThe European discovery of North America, with its vast forests and wildlife, particularly the beaver, led to the continent becoming a major supplier in the 17th century of fur pelts for the fur [[felt]] hat and fur trimming and garment trades of Europe. Fur was relied on to make warm clothing, a critical consideration prior to the organization of coal distribution for heating. Portugal and Spain played major roles in fur trading after the 15th century with their business in fur hats.{{sfn|Fisher|1943|p=17}}\n\n===Siberian fur trade===\n{{main|Siberian fur trade}}\nFrom as early as the 10th century, merchants and boyars of [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] had exploited the fur resources \"beyond the portage\", a watershed at the [[Lake Beloye (disambiguation)|White Lake]] that represents the door to the entire northwestern part of Eurasia. They began by establishing [[trading post]]s along the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Vychegda River|Vychegda]] river networks and requiring the [[Komi peoples|Komi]] people to give them furs as [[tribute]]. Novgorod, the chief fur-trade center prospered as the easternmost trading post of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Novgorodians expanded farther east and north, coming into contact with the [[Pechora people]] of the [[Pechora River]] valley and the [[Yugra]] people residing near the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]]. Both of these native tribes offered more resistance than the Komi, killing many Russian tribute-collectors throughout the tenth and eleventh centuries.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=2\u20133}} As [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]] gained more power in the 15th century and proceeded in the \"[[Ivan III of Russia#Gathering of Russian lands|gathering of the Russian lands]]\", the Muscovite state began to rival the Novgorodians in the North. During the 15th century Moscow began subjugating many native tribes. One strategy involved exploiting antagonisms between tribes, notably the Komi and Yugra, by recruiting men of one tribe to fight in an army against the other tribe. Campaigns against native tribes in [[Siberia]] remained insignificant until they began on a much larger scale in 1483 and 1499.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=28}}\n\nBesides the Novgorodians and the indigenes, Muscovites also had to contend with the various Muslim [[Tatars|Tatar khanates]] to the east of Muscovy. In 1552 [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]], the Tsar of All the Russias, took a significant step towards securing Russian hegemony in Siberia when he sent a large army to attack the [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan Tartars]] and ended up obtaining the territory from the Volga to the [[Ural Mountains]]. At this point the phrase \"ruler of [[Obdoria|Obdor]], [[Kondia|Konda]], and all Siberian lands\" became part of the title of the [[Tsar]] in Moscow.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=10}} Even so, problems ensued after 1558 when Ivan IV sent {{Interlanguage link multi| Grigory Stroganov | ru |3= \u0421\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (ca 1533\u20131577) to colonize land on the [[Kama River|Kama]] and to subjugate and enserf the [[Komi peoples|Komi]] living there. The [[Stroganov family]] soon came into conflict (1573) with the [[Khanate of Sibir|Khan of Sibir]] whose land they encroached on. Ivan told the Stroganovs to hire [[Cossacks|Cossack]] mercenaries to protect the new settlement from the Tatars. From ca 1581 the band of Cossacks led by [[Yermak Timofeyevich]] fought many battles that eventually culminated in a Tartar victory (1584) and the temporary end to Russian occupation in the area. In 1584 Ivan's son [[Feodor I of Russia|Fyodor]] sent military governors ([[voivode|voivodas]]) and soldiers to reclaim Yermak conquests and officially to annex the land held by the [[Khanate of Sibir]]. Similar skirmishes with Tartars took place across Siberia as Russian expansion continued.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=29-33}}\n\nRussian conquerors treated the natives of Siberia as easily exploited enemies who were inferior to them. As they penetrated deeper into Siberia, traders built outposts or winter lodges called ''{{Interlanguage link multi|zimovya| ru |3=\u0417\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435}}'' where they lived and collected fur tribute from native tribes. By 1620 Russia dominated the land from the Urals eastward to the [[Yenisei River|Yenisey]] valley and to the [[Altai Mountains]] in the south, comprising about 1.25 million square miles of land.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=38}} Furs would become Russia's largest source of wealth during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Keeping up with the advances of Western Europe required significant capital and Russia did not have sources of gold and silver, but it did have furs, which became known as \"soft gold\" and provided Russia with hard currency. The Russian government received income from the fur trade through two taxes, the ''[[yasak]]'' (or iasak) tax on natives and the 10% \"Sovereign Tithing Tax\" imposed on both the catch and sale of fur pelts.{{sfn|Bychkov|Jacobs|1994|p=73}} Fur was in great demand in Western Europe, especially sable and marten, since European forest resources had been over-hunted and furs had become extremely scarce. Fur trading allowed Russia to purchase from Europe goods that it lacked, like lead, tin, precious metals, textiles, firearms, and sulphur. Russia also traded furs with [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]] and other countries in the Middle East in exchange for silk, textiles, spices, and dried fruit. The high prices that sable, black fox, and marten furs could generate in international markets spurred a \"fur fever\" in which many Russians moved to Siberia as independent trappers. From 1585 to 1680, tens of thousands of sable and other valuable pelts were obtained in Siberia each year.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=38-40}}\n\n[[File:Sbor Yasaka.jpg|thumb|[[Cossacks]] collecting ''yasak'' in Siberia]] \nThe primary way for the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite state]] to obtain furs was by exacting a fur tribute from the Siberian natives, called a ''yasak''. ''Yasak'' was usually a fixed number of sable pelts which every male tribe member who was at least fifteen years old had to supply to Russian officials. Officials enforced ''yasak'' through coercion and by taking hostages, usually the tribe chiefs or members of the chief's family. At first, Russians were content to trade with the natives, exchanging goods like pots, axes, and beads for the prized sables that the natives did not value, but greater demand for furs led to violence and force becoming the primary means of obtaining the furs. The largest problem with the ''yasak'' system was that Russian governors were prone to corruption because they received no salary. They resorted to illegal means of getting furs for themselves, including bribing customs officials to allow them to personally collect ''yasak'', extorting natives by exacting ''yasak'' multiple times over, or requiring tribute from independent trappers.{{sfn|Forsyth|1994|p=41-42}}\n\nRussian fur trappers, called ''[[promyshlenniki]]'', hunted in one of two types of bands of 10\u201315 men, called {{Interlanguage link multi| ''vatagi'' | ru |3= \u0412\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0433\u0430}}. The first was an independent band of blood relatives or unrelated people who contributed an equal share of the hunting-expedition expenses; the second was a band of hired hunters who participated in expeditions fully funded by the trading companies which employed them. Members of an independent ''vataga'' cooperated and shared all necessary work associated with fur trapping, including making and setting traps, building forts and camps, stockpiling firewood and grain, and fishing. All fur pelts went into a common pool that the band divided equally among themselves after Russian officials exacted the tithing tax. On the other hand, a trading company provided hired fur-trappers with the money needed for transportation, food, and supplies, and once the hunt was finished, the employer received two-thirds of the pelts and the remaining ones were sold and the proceeds divided evenly among the hired laborers. During the summer, ''promyshlenniki'' would set up a summer camp to stockpile grain and fish, and many engaged in agricultural work for extra money. During late summer or early fall the ''vatagi'' left their hunting grounds, surveyed the area, and set up a winter camp. Each member of the group set at least 10 traps and the ''vatagi'' divided into smaller groups of 2 to 3 men who cooperated to maintain certain traps. ''Promyshlenniki'' checked traps daily, resetting them or replacing bait whenever necessary. The ''promyshlenniki'' employed both passive and active hunting-strategies. The passive approach involved setting traps, while the active approach involved the use of hunting-dogs and of bows-and-arrows. Occasionally, hunters also followed sable tracks to their burrows, around which they placed nets, and waited for the sable to emerge.{{sfn|Bychkov|Jacobs|1994|p=75-80}}\n\nThe hunting season began around the time of the first snow in October or November and continued until early spring. Hunting expeditions lasted two to three years on average but occasionally longer. Because of the long hunting season and the fact that passage back to Russia was difficult and costly, beginning around the 1650s\u20131660s many ''promyshlenniki'' chose to stay and settle in Siberia.{{sfn|Bychkov|Jacobs|1994|p=80-81}} From 1620 to 1680 a total of 15,983 trappers operated in Siberia.{{sfn|Bychkov|Jacobs|1994|p=74}}\n\n==North American fur trade==\n{{Main|North American fur trade}}\n\n[[File:Fur industry- hat-making, Canadian voyageurs. ( 1858- ).jpg|thumb|Fur-hat industry]]\nThe North American fur trade began as early as the 1500s with Europeans and First Nations<ref>[[North American fur trade#Origins|Early French Fur Trading]]</ref> and was a central part of the early [[European colonization of the Americas|history of contact]] between [[Europe]]ans and the native peoples of what is now the [[Native Americans in the United States|United States]] and [[First Nations|Canada]]. In 1578 there were 350 European fishing vessels at [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Sailors began to trade metal implements (particularly knives) for the natives' well-worn pelts. The first pelts in demand were beaver and sea otter, as well as occasionally deer, bear, ermine and skunk.{{sfn|Dolin|2010|p=16}}\n\nFur robes were blankets of sewn-together, native-tanned, beaver pelts. The pelts were called ''castor gras'' in French and \"coat beaver\" in English, and were soon recognized by the newly developed felt-hat making industry as particularly useful for felting. Some historians, seeking to explain the term ''castor gras'', have assumed that coat beaver was rich in human oils from having been worn so long (much of the top-hair was worn away through usage, exposing the valuable under-wool), and that this is what made it attractive to the hatters. This seems unlikely, since grease interferes with the felting of wool, rather than enhancing it.{{sfn|Dolin|2010|p=46}} By the 1580s, beaver \"wool\" was the major starting material of the French felt-hatters. Hat makers began to use it in England soon after, particularly after [[Huguenot]] refugees brought their skills and tastes with them from France.\n\n==Early organization==\n[[File:Nanfan.jpg|thumb|General map of the \"Beaver Hunting Grounds\" described in \"Deed from the Five Nations to the King, of their Beaver Hunting Ground,\" also known as the [[Nanfan Treaty]] of 1701]]\nCaptain Chauvin made the first organized attempt to control the fur trade in [[New France]]. In 1599 he acquired a [[monopoly]] from [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] and tried to establish a colony near the mouth of the [[Saguenay River]] at [[Tadoussac]]. French explorers, like   [[Samuel de Champlain]], [[voyageurs]], and [[Coureur des bois]], such as [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]], [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]], [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]], and [[Pierre-Charles Le Sueur|Le Sueur]], while seeking routes through the continent, established relationships with [[Amerindians]] and continued to expand the trade of fur pelts for items considered 'common' by the Europeans. Mammal winter pelts were prized for warmth, particularly animal pelts for beaver wool felt hats, which were an expensive status symbol in Europe. The demand for beaver wool felt hats was such that the beaver in Europe and European Russia had largely disappeared through exploitation.\n\nIn 1613 Dallas Carite and [[Adriaen Block]] headed expeditions to establish fur trade relationships with the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] and [[Mohican]]. By 1614 the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were sending vessels to secure large economic returns from fur trading. The fur trade of New Netherland, through the port of [[New Amsterdam]], depended largely on the trading depot at [[Fort Orange]] (now Albany) on the upper [[Hudson River]]. Much of the fur is believed to have originated in Canada, smuggled south by entrepreneurs who wished to avoid the colony's government-imposed monopoly there.\n\nEngland was slower to enter the American fur trade than France and the Dutch Republic, but as soon as English colonies were established, development companies learned that furs provided the best way for the colonists to remit value back to the mother country. Furs were being dispatched from Virginia soon after 1610, and the [[Plymouth Colony]] was sending substantial amounts of beaver to its London agents through the 1620s and 1630s. London merchants tried to take over France's fur trade in the St Lawrence River valley. Taking advantage of one of England's brief wars with France, [[Sir David Kirke]] captured Quebec in 1629 and brought the year's produce of furs back to London. Other English merchants also traded for furs around the [[Saint Lawrence River]] region in the 1630s, but these were officially discouraged. Such efforts ceased as France strengthened its presence in Canada. Meanwhile, the [[New England]] fur trade expanded, not only inland, but northward along the coast into the [[Bay of Fundy]] region. London's access to high-quality furs was greatly increased with the takeover of New Amsterdam, whereupon the fur trade of that colony (now called New York) fell into English hands with the 1667 [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]].\n[[File:Fur traders in canada 1777.jpg|thumb|Fur traders in Canada, trading with Native Americans, 1777]]\nIn 1668 the English fur trade entered a new phase. Two French citizens, [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[M\u00e9dard des Groseilliers]], had traded with great success west of [[Lake Superior]] in 1659\u201360, but upon their return to Canada, most of their furs were seized by the authorities. Their trading voyage had convinced them that the best fur country was far to the north and west, and could best be reached by ships sailing into [[Hudson Bay]]. Their treatment in Canada suggested that they would not find support from France for their scheme. The pair went to New England, where they found local financial support for at least two attempts to reach Hudson Bay, both unsuccessful. Their ideas had reached the ears of English authorities, however, and in 1665 Radisson and Groseilliers were persuaded to go to London. After some setbacks, a number of English investors were found to back another attempt for Hudson Bay.\n\nTwo ships were sent out in 1668. One, with Radisson aboard, had to turn back, but the other, the ''[[Nonsuch (1650 ship)|Nonsuch]],'' with Groseilliers, did penetrate the bay. There she was able to trade with the indigenes, collecting a fine cargo of beaver skins before the expedition returned to London in October 1669. The delighted investors sought a royal charter, which they obtained the next year. This charter established the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and granted it a monopoly to trade into all the rivers that emptied into Hudson Bay. From 1670 onwards, the Hudson's Bay Company sent two or three trading ships into the bay every year. They brought back furs (mainly beaver) and sold them, sometimes by private treaty but usually by public auction. The beaver was bought mainly for the English hat-making trade, while the fine furs went to the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nMeanwhile, in the [[Colonial America#Lower South|English southern colonies]], a [[deerskin trade]] was established around 1670, based at the export hub of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Word spread among Native hunters that the Europeans would exchange pelts for the European-manufactured goods that were highly desired in native communities. English traders stocked axe heads, knives, awls, fish hooks, cloth of various type and color, woolen blankets, linen shirts, kettles, jewelry, glass beads, [[musket]]s, ammunition and powder to exchange on a 'per pelt' basis.\n\nColonial trading posts in the southern colonies also introduced many types of alcohol (especially brandy and rum) for trade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montana.edu/wwwai/imsd/alcohol/Jessyca/furtrade.htm |title=Introduction of alcohol through the fur trade |work=[[University of Montana]] |access-date=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226180021/http://www.montana.edu/wwwai/imsd/alcohol/Jessyca/furtrade.htm |archive-date=26 February 2009}}</ref> European traders flocked to the North American continent and made huge profits from the exchange. A metal axe head, for example, was exchanged for one beaver pelt (also called a 'beaver blanket'). The same pelt could fetch enough to buy dozens of axe heads in England, making the fur trade extremely profitable for the Europeans. The Natives used the iron axe heads to replace stone axe heads which they had made by hand in a labor-intensive process, so they derived substantial benefits from the trade as well.  The British began to see the ill  effects of alcohol on Natives, and the chiefs objected to its sale and trade. The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] prohibited sale by European settlers of alcohol to the Indians in Canada, following the British takeover of the territory after it defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]] (known as the [[French and Indian War]] in North America).\n\n===Socioeconomic ties===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Fur trading at [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9]] in 1841]]\nOften, the political benefits of the fur trade became more important than the economic aspects. Trade was a way to forge alliances and maintain good relations between different cultures. The fur traders were men with capital and social standing. Often younger men were single when they went to North America to enter the fur trade; they made marriages or cohabited with high-ranking Indian women of similar status in their own cultures. Fur trappers and other workers usually had relationships with lower-ranking women. Many of their mixed-race descendants developed their own culture, now called ''[[M\u00e9tis]]'' in Canada, based then on fur trapping and other activities on the frontier.\n\nIn some cases both Native American and European-American cultures excluded the mixed-race descendants. If the Native Americans were a tribe with a [[patrilineal]] [[kinship]] system, they considered children born to a white father to be white, in a type of [[hypodescent]] classification, although the Native mother and tribe might care for them. The Europeans tended to classify children of Native women as Native, regardless of the father, similar to the hypodescent of their classification of the children of slaves. The M\u00e9tis in the Canadian [[Red River of the North|Red River]] region were so numerous that they developed a [[creole language]] and culture. Since the late 20th century, the M\u00e9tis have been recognized in Canada as a [[First Nations]] ethnic group. The interracial relationships resulted in a two-tier mixed-race class, in which descendants of fur traders and chiefs achieved prominence in some Canadian social, political, and economic circles. Lower-class descendants formed the majority of the separate [[M\u00e9tis]] culture based on hunting, trapping and farming.\n\nBecause of the wealth at stake, different European-American governments competed with various native societies for control of the fur trade. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] sometimes based decisions of which side to support in times of war in relation to which people had provided them with the best trade goods in an honest manner. Because trade was so politically important, the Europeans tried to regulate it in hopes (often futile) of preventing abuse. Unscrupulous traders sometimes cheated natives by plying them with alcohol during the transaction, which subsequently aroused resentment and often resulted in violence.\n\nIn 1834 [[John Jacob Astor]], who had created the huge monopoly of the [[American Fur Company]], withdrew from the fur trade. He could see the decline in fur animals and realized the market was changing, as beaver hats went out of style. Expanding European settlement displaced native communities from the best hunting grounds. European demand for furs subsided as fashion trends shifted. The [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans']] lifestyles were altered by the trade. To continue obtaining European goods on which they had become dependent and to pay off their debts, they often resorted to selling land to the European settlers. Their resentment of the forced sales contributed to future wars.\n\n[[File:George Caleb Bingham 001.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fur Traders Descending the Missouri]], c.&nbsp;1845]]\nAfter the [[United States]] became independent, it regulated trading with Native Americans by the [[Indian Intercourse Act]], first passed on July 22, 1790. The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] issued licenses to trade in the [[Indian Territory]]. In 1834 this was defined as most of the United States west of the [[Mississippi River]], where [[mountain man|mountain men]] and traders from [[Mexico]] freely operated.\n\nEarly exploration parties were often fur-trading expeditions, many of which marked the first recorded instances of Europeans' reaching particular regions of North America. For example, [[Abraham Wood]] sent fur-trading parties on exploring expeditions into the southern Appalachian Mountains, discovering the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] in the process. [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] was a fur trader who explored much of the [[Fraser River]] in British Columbia.\n\n===Role in economic anthropology===\nEconomic historians and anthropologists have studied the fur trade's important role in early North American economies, but they have been unable to agree on a theoretical framework to describe native economic patterns.\n\n[[File:Running them down; Hauling the meat in with dogs - Fort Babine 1875.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|left|Sketches of life in the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] territory, 1875]]\nJohn C. Phillips and J.W. Smurr tied the fur trade to an imperial struggle for power, positing that the fur trade served both as an incentive for expanding and as a method for maintaining dominance. Dismissing the experience of individuals, the authors searched for connections on a global stage that revealed its \"high political and economic importance.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul Chrisler |last=Phillips |first2=J.W. |last2=Smurr |title=The Fur Trade |volume=2 |location=Norman, Oklahoma |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |year=1961 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux8rAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> E.E.

Historians such as [[Harold Innis]] had long taken the formalist position, especially in Canadian history, believing that neoclassical economic principles affect non-Western societies just as they do Western ones.<ref>{{cite book |last=Innis |first=Harold Adams |author-link=Harold Adams Innis |title=The Fur Trade in Canada: An Introduction to Canadian Economic History |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=1930 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCgps70cHV4C&printsec=frontcover |pages=463 |isbn=9780802081964 |editor=Oliver Baty Cunningham Memorial Publication Fund |editor2-first=Arthur J. |editor2-last=Ray}}</ref> Starting in the 1950s, however, substantivists such as [[Karl Polanyi]] challenged these ideas, arguing instead that primitive societies could engage in alternatives to traditional Western market trade; namely, gift trade and administered trade. Rich picked up these arguments in an influential article in which he contended that Indians had \"a persistent reluctance to accept European notions or the basic values of the European approach\" and that \"English economic rules did not apply to the Indian trade.\"<ref>{{cite journal |first=E.E. |last=Rich |title=Trade Habits and Economic Motivation Among the Indians of North America |journal=[[The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |date=February 1960 |pages=46, 47 |doi=10.2307/138817 |publisher=[[Canadian Economics Association]] |jstor=138817}}</ref> Indians were savvy traders, but they had a fundamentally different conception of property, which confounded their European trade partners. Abraham Rotstein subsequently fit these arguments explicitly into Polanyi's theoretical framework, claiming that \"administered trade was in operation at the Bay and market trade in London.\"<ref>Abraham Rotstein, \"Karl Polanyi\u2019s Concept of Non-Market Trade,\" ''The Journal of Economic History'' 30:1 (Mar., 1970): 123.

Ray permanently changed the direction of economic studies of the fur trade with two influential works that presented a modified formalist position in between the extremes of Innis and Rotstein. \"This trading system,\" Ray explained, \"is impossible to label neatly as \u2018gift trade', or \u2018administered trade', or \u2018market trade', since it embodies elements of all these forms.\"<ref>Arthur J. Ray and Donald B. Freeman, ''Give Us Good Measure: An Economic Analysis of Relations between the Indians and the Hudson's Bay Company Before 1763'', (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1978), 236.</ref> Indians engaged in trade for a variety of reasons. Reducing them to simple economic or cultural dichotomies, as the formalists and substantivists had done, was a fruitless simplification that obscured more than it revealed. Moreover, Ray used trade accounts and account books in the Hudson's Bay Company's archives for masterful qualitative analyses and pushed the boundaries of the field's methodology. Following Ray's position, Bruce M. White also helped to create a more nuanced picture of the complex ways in which native populations fit new economic relationships into existing cultural patterns.<ref>Bruce M. White, \"Give Us a Little Milk\": The Social and Cultural Meanings of Gift Giving in the Lake Superior Fur Trade\", in ''Rendezvous: Selected Papers of the Fourth North American Fur Trade Conference'', 1981, ed. Thomas C. Buckley (St. Paul, Minnesota: 1984), 185\u2013197.</ref>\n\nRichard White, while admitting that the formalist/substantivist debate was \"old, and now tired,\" attempted to reinvigorate the substantivist position.{{sfn|White|1991|p=94}} Echoing Ray's moderate position that cautioned against easy simplifications, White advanced a simple argument against formalism: \"Life was not a business, and such simplifications only distort the past.\"{{sfn|White|1991|p=95}} White argued instead that the fur trade occupied part of a \"middle ground\" in which Europeans and Indians sought to accommodate their cultural differences. In the case of the fur trade, this meant that the French were forced to learn from the political and cultural meanings with which Indians imbued the fur trade. Cooperation, not domination, prevailed.\n\n===Present===\nAccording to the [[Fur Institute of Canada]], there are about 60,000 active trappers in [[Canada]] (based on trapping licenses), of whom about 25,000 are indigenous peoples.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fur.ca/TFT_facts_figures.php |title=Canada's Fur Trade: Facts & Figures |work=[[Fur Institute of Canada]] |access-date=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103173436/http://www.fur.ca/TFT_facts_figures.php |archive-date=3 November 2012}}</ref> The fur farming industry is present in many parts of Canada.<ref>{{cite web |agency=[[Government of Canada]] |work=[[Statistics Canada]] |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/23-013-x/23-013-x2010001-eng.pdf |title=Fur Statistics, 2010 |access-date=22 July 2019 |issue=23\u2013013\u2013X |date=October 2011 |volume=8 |issn=1705-4273 |pages=20 |publisher=[[Minister of Industry (Canada)|Minister of Industry]]}}</ref> The largest producer of mink and foxes is Nova Scotia which in 2012 generated revenues of nearly $150 million and accounted for one quarter of all agricultural production in the Province.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bundale |first=Brett |title=Fur farms may not all survive new N.S. rules |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/450889-fur-farms-may-not-all-survive-new-ns-rules |access-date=12 March 2013 |newspaper=[[The Chronicle Herald]] |location=Halifax, Nova Scotia |date=January 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118155357/http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/450889-fur-farms-may-not-all-survive-new-ns-rules |archive-date=18 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Maritime fur trade ==\n{{main|Maritime fur trade}}\n[[File:Maritime Fur Trade-NorthWestCoast.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The North West Coast during the [[maritime fur trade]] era, about 1790 to 1840]]\nThe maritime fur trade was a ship-based fur trade system that focused on acquiring furs of [[sea otter]]s and other animals from the [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] and [[Alaska Natives|natives of Alaska]]. The furs were mostly traded in China for tea, silks, porcelain, and other Chinese goods, which were then sold in Europe and the United States. The maritime fur trade was pioneered by the Russians, working east from [[Kamchatka]] along the [[Aleutian Islands]] to the southern coast of Alaska. British and Americans entered during the 1780s, focusing on what is now the [[British Columbia Coast|coast of British Columbia]]. The trade boomed around the turn of the 19th century. A long period of decline began in the 1810s. As the sea otter population was depleted, the maritime fur trade diversified and was transformed, tapping new markets and commodities while continuing to focus on the Northwest Coast and China. It lasted until the middle to late 19th century. Russians controlled most of the coast of what is now Alaska during the entire era. The coast south of Alaska saw fierce competition between, and among, British and American trading vessels. The British were the first to operate in the southern sector, but were unable to compete against the Americans who dominated from the 1790s to the 1830s. The British [[Hudson's Bay Company]] entered the coast trade in the 1820s with the intention of driving the Americans away. This was accomplished by about 1840. In its late period the maritime fur trade was largely conducted by the British [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the [[Russian-American Company]].\n[[File:Vue de l'etablissement russe de la Bodega, \u00e0 la C\u00f4te de la Nouvelle Albion, en 1828 (restored).jpg|thumb|The Russian fur traders from Alaska established their largest settlement in California, [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]], in 1812]]\n\nThe term \"maritime fur trade\" was coined by historians to distinguish the coastal, ship-based fur trade from the continental, land-based fur trade of, for example, the [[North West Company]] and the [[American Fur Company]]. Historically, the maritime fur trade was not known by that name, rather it was usually called the \"North West Coast trade\" or \"North West Trade\". The term \"North West\" was rarely spelled as the single word \"Northwest\", as is common today.<ref>{{cite book |last= Mackie |first= Richard Somerset |title= Trading Beyond the Mountains: The British Fur Trade on the Pacific 1793\u20131843 |year= 1997 |publisher= University of British Columbia (UBC) Press |location= Vancouver |isbn= 0-7748-0613-3 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=VKXgJw6K088C |page= 123}}</ref>\n\nThe maritime fur trade brought the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast into a vast, new [[international trade]] network, centered on the north Pacific Ocean, global in scope, and based on [[capitalism]] but not, for the most part, on [[colonialism]]. A [[triangular trade]] network emerged linking the Pacific Northwest coast, China, the [[Hawaiian Islands]] (only recently discovered by the [[Western world]]), Britain, and the United States (especially [[New England]]). The trade had a major effect on the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest coast, especially the [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]], and [[Chinook people]]s. There was a rapid increase of wealth among the Northwest Coast natives, along with increased warfare, [[potlatch]]ing, slaving, depopulation due to [[epidemic]] disease, and enhanced importance of [[totem]]s and traditional nobility crests.<ref>For more on the use of crests on the North West Coast, see: {{cite book |last= Reynoldson |first= Fiona |title= Native Americans: The Indigenous Peoples of North America |year= 2000 |publisher= Heinemann |isbn= 978-0-435-31015-8 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=jte28Ep3BoUC |page= 34}}</ref> The indigenous culture was not however overwhelmed, it rather flourished, while simultaneously undergoing rapid change. The use of [[Chinook Jargon]] arose during the maritime fur trading era and remains a distinctive aspect of Pacific Northwest culture. [[Native Hawaiian]] society was similarly affected by the sudden influx of Western wealth and technology, as well as epidemic diseases. The trade's effect on China and Europe was minimal. For New England, the maritime fur trade and the significant profits it made helped revitalize the region, contributing to the transformation of New England from an agrarian to an industrial society. The wealth generated by the maritime fur trade was invested in industrial development, especially [[textile manufacturing]]. The New England textile industry in turn had a large effect on [[slavery in the United States]], increasing the demand for cotton and helping make possible the rapid expansion of the cotton [[plantation system]] across the [[Deep South]].<ref name=farrow>{{cite book |last= Farrow |first= Anne |author2=Joel Lang |author3=Jennifer Frank  |title= Complicity: How the North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited from Slavery |year= 2006 |publisher= Random House |isbn= 978-0-345-46783-6 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=plYsNsZWZI0C |pages= xiv, 25\u201326, 35\u201337}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sea Otter.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A sea otter, drawing by S.

His name sometimes appears as '''Burke Cochran''' in contemporary newspaper reports. He served as a [[United States Representative]] from the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side of Manhattan]] for seven terms.\n\nCockran switched parties four times, but is best known as a Democrat. He was a leading orator of the late 19th and early 20th century, and an important influence on British statesman Winston Churchill, who noted that Cockran was a pacifist and capitalist, who vigorously fought against socialists, silver inflationists and advocates of high tariffs.<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Churchill: Walking with Destiny'' (2018) p 35.</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn in Carrowkeel, [[County Sligo, Ireland]], he was educated in France and in his native country, and emigrated to the United States when seventeen years of age. He was a teacher in a private academy and principal of a public school in [[Westchester County, New York]]. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1876, and practiced in [[Mount Vernon, New York]]; two years later, he moved to New York City and continued the practice of law.  A devout [[Roman Catholic]],  he became deeply involved in support of Irish nationalism.<ref>Eoin Butler, \"The Irish orator who taught Winston Churchill how to win a crowd.''

M. Bell Studio]]\nBeginning in 1886, Cockran, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], was a frequent candidate for the US House of Representatives and won several times; he served a number of non-consecutive terms. He was a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]]s in 1884, 1892, 1904, and 1920. At the 1920 convention, he delivered the nominating speech for [[Al Smith]].<ref>James McGurrin, ''Bourke Cockran: a free lance in American politics'' (Arno Press, 1972).</ref>\n\nCockran was a member of the commission to revise the judiciary article of the [[New York Constitution]] in 1890. Cockran publicly broke with his party in 1896, opposing the [[Free Silver]] platform of Democratic presidential candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]]. Cockran campaigned instead for Republican presidential candidate [[William McKinley]], which helped bring Gold Democrats over to McKinley's winning coalition.\n\nIn 1900, Cockran returned to the Democratic Party, supporting Bryan's second presidential campaign. Cockran returned to Congress in 1904 after he won a special election to fill the seat of [[George B. McClellan Jr.]], who had resigned to become [[mayor of New York City]].  He served his final years, 1921\u20131923, as a congressman, dying in Washington, D.C. He is buried in [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery]], [[Hawthorne, New York]].\n\nCockran, a friend of Britain's [[Churchill family]] and reputed one-time lover of [[Jennie Churchill]], introduced her 20-year-old son, [[Winston Churchill]], to American high society during Churchill's first trip to New York in 1895. Years later, Churchill credited Cockran as his first political mentor and the chief role model for his own success as an orator.  Churchill wrote in the 1930s that Cockran was, \"A pacifist, individualist, democrat, capitalist, and a 'Gold-bug'....He was equally opposed to socialists, inflationist, and Protectionists, and he resisted them on all occasions.\" Churchill never became a pacifist but he did adopt all the rest of Cockran's stances during his own political career, and carefully read and reread his speeches for oratorical advice.<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Churchill: Walking with Destiny'' (2018) p 35.</ref>  Churchill quoted Cockran in his 1946 \"Iron Curtain speech\" recalling: \u201cwords which I learned 50 years ago from a great Irish-American orator, a friend of mine, Mr Bourke Cockran: \u2018There is enough for all. The earth is a generous mother. She will provide, in plentiful abundance, food for all her children, if they will but cultivate her soil in justice and in peace.\u2019\u201d [https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/abroad/the-irish-orator-who-taught-winston-churchill-how-to-win-a-crowd-1.2975643?mode=amp&mode=print&ot=example.AjaxPageLayout.ot]\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States Congress members who died in office (1900\u201349)]]\n{{Portal bar|Biography|New York (state)}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gibson, Florence E.

His name sometimes appears as '''Burke Cochran''' in contemporary newspaper reports. He served as a [[United States Representative]] from New York City.  He switched parties four times, but is best known as a Democrat. He was a leading orator of the late 19th and early 20th century, and an important influence on British statesman Winston Churchill, who noted that Cockran was a pacifist and capitalist, who vigorously fought against socialists, silver inflationists and advocates of high tariffs.<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Churchill: Walking with Destiny'' (2018) p 35.</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn in Carrowkeel, [[County Sligo, Ireland]], he was educated in France and in his native country, and emigrated to the United States when seventeen years of age. He was a teacher in a private academy and principal of a public school in [[Westchester County, New York]]. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1876, and practiced in [[Mount Vernon, New York]]; two years later, he moved to New York City and continued the practice of law.  A devout [[Roman Catholic]],  he became deeply involved in support of Irish nationalism.<ref>Eoin Butler, \"The Irish orator who taught Winston Churchill how to win a crowd.''

M. Bell Studio]]\nBeginning in 1886, Cockran, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], was a frequent candidate for the US House of Representatives and won several times; he served a number of non-consecutive terms. He was a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]]s in 1884, 1892, 1904, and 1920. At the 1920 convention, he delivered the nominating speech for [[Al Smith]].<ref>James McGurrin, ''Bourke Cockran: a free lance in American politics'' (Arno Press, 1972).</ref>\n\nCockran was a member of the commission to revise the judiciary article of the [[New York Constitution]] in 1890. Cockran publicly broke with his party in 1896, opposing the [[Free Silver]] platform of Democratic presidential candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]]. Cockran campaigned instead for Republican presidential candidate [[William McKinley]], which helped bring Gold Democrats over to McKinley's winning coalition.\n\nIn 1900, Cockran returned to the Democratic Party, supporting Bryan's second presidential campaign. Cockran returned to Congress in 1904 after he won a special election to fill the seat of [[George B. McClellan Jr.]], who had resigned to become [[mayor of New York City]].  He served his final years, 1921\u20131923, as a congressman, dying in Washington, D.C. He is buried in [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery]], [[Hawthorne, New York]].\n\nCockran, a friend of Britain's [[Churchill family]] and reputed one-time lover of [[Jennie Churchill]], introduced her 20-year-old son, [[Winston Churchill]], to American high society during Churchill's first trip to New York in 1895. Years later, Churchill credited Cockran as his first political mentor and the chief role model for his own success as an orator.  Churchill wrote in the 1930s that Cockran was, \"A pacifist, individualist, democrat, capitalist, and a 'Gold-bug'....He was equally opposed to socialists, inflationist, and Protectionists, and he resisted them on all occasions.\" Churchill never became a pacifist but he did adopt all the rest of Cockran's stances during his own political career, and carefully read and reread his speeches for oratorical advice.<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Churchill: Walking with Destiny'' (2018) p 35.</ref>  Churchill quoted Cockran in his 1946 \"Iron Curtain speech\" recalling: \u201cwords which I learned 50 years ago from a great Irish-American orator, a friend of mine, Mr Bourke Cockran: \u2018There is enough for all. The earth is a generous mother. She will provide, in plentiful abundance, food for all her children, if they will but cultivate her soil in justice and in peace.\u2019\u201d [https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/abroad/the-irish-orator-who-taught-winston-churchill-how-to-win-a-crowd-1.2975643?mode=amp&mode=print&ot=example.AjaxPageLayout.ot]\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States Congress members who died in office (1900\u201349)]]\n{{Portal bar|Biography|New York (state)}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gibson, Florence E.

In spite of releasing mostly singles, he released a well-received [[blues music|blues]]-inflected LP in 1963, ''[[Night Beat (Sam Cooke album)|Night Beat]]'', and his most critically acclaimed studio album, ''[[Ain't That Good News (album)|Ain't That Good News]]'', which featured five singles, in 1964.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/sam-cooke|title=Sam Cooke \u2013 Billboard Charts|website=2019 Billboard|access-date=3 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963 Cooke signed a five-year contract for [[Allen Klein]] to manage Kags Music and SAR Records and made him his manager.

Franklin said the woman was not in the office and that she told Cooke this, but the enraged Cooke did not believe her and violently grabbed her, demanding again to know the woman's whereabouts. According to Franklin, she grappled with Cooke, the two of them fell to the floor, and she then got up and ran to retrieve a gun. She said she then fired at Cooke in [[self-defense]] because she feared for her life. Cooke was struck once in the [[torso]]. According to Franklin, he exclaimed, \"Lady, you shot me,\" before mounting a last charge at her. She said she beat him over his head with a broomstick before he finally fell, mortally wounded by the gunshot.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=619, 628}}\n\nThe motel's owner, Evelyn Carr,<ref group=note>Some sources identify the motel owner's last name as \"Card,\" according to Guralnick</ref> said that she had been on the telephone with Franklin at the time of the incident. Carr said she overheard Cooke's intrusion and the ensuing conflict and gunshot. She called the police to request that officers go to the motel, telling them she believed a shooting had occurred.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=619}}\n\nA [[coroner]]'s [[inquest]] was convened to investigate the incident. The woman who had accompanied Cooke to the motel was identified as Elisa Boyer, who had also called the police that night shortly before Carr had. Boyer had called from a telephone booth near the motel, telling them she had just escaped being kidnapped.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=619, 627}}\n\nBoyer told the police that she had first met Cooke earlier that night and had spent the evening in his company. She said that after they left a local nightclub together, she had repeatedly requested that he take her home, but he instead took her against her will to the Hacienda Motel. She said that once in one of the motel's rooms, Cooke physically forced her onto the bed, and that she was certain he was going to rape her. According to Boyer, when Cooke stepped into the bathroom for a moment, she quickly grabbed her clothes and ran from the room. She said that in her haste, she had also scooped up most of Cooke's clothing by mistake. She said she ran first to the manager's office and knocked on the door seeking help. However, she said that the manager took too long in responding, so, fearing Cooke would soon be coming after her, she fled from the motel before the manager ever opened the door. She said she then put her clothing back on, hid Cooke's clothing, went to a telephone booth, and called the police.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=616\u2013619}}\n\nBoyer's story is the only account of what happened between her and Cooke that night; however, her story has long been called into question. Inconsistencies between her version of events and details reported by diners at Martoni's Restaurant, where Cooke dined and drank earlier in the evening, suggest that Boyer may have gone willingly to the motel with Cooke, then slipped out of the room with his clothing to rob him, rather than to escape an attempted rape.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=643}}<ref name=Wolff /> Cooke was reportedly carrying a tremendous amount of money at Martoni's, according to restaurant employees and friends. However a search of Boyer's purse by police revealed nothing except a $20 bill, and a search of Cooke's Ferrari found only a money clip with $108 and a few loose coins. On January 11th, 1965, one month to the day after Cooke's death, Boyer was arrested for [[prostitution]] when a man offered her $40 for sex, only to promptly show her a badge. The charges were dismissed after it was determined to be a case of entrapment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/11.html |title=The Death of Sam Cooke |last=Krajicek |first=David |publisher=CrimeLibrary.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210053736/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/11.html |archive-date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHowever, questions about Boyer's role were beyond the scope of the inquest, the purpose of which was only to establish the circumstances of Franklin's role in the shooting. Boyer's leaving the motel room with almost all of Cooke's clothing, and the fact that tests showed Cooke was inebriated at the time, provided a plausible explanation to the inquest jurors for Cooke's bizarre behavior and state of dress.

Franklin said the woman was not in the office and that she told Cooke this, but the enraged Cooke did not believe her and violently grabbed her, demanding again to know the woman's whereabouts. According to Franklin, she grappled with Cooke, the two of them fell to the floor, and she then got up and ran to retrieve a gun. She said she then fired at Cooke in [[self-defense]] because she feared for her life. Cooke was struck once in the [[torso]]. According to Franklin, he exclaimed, \"Lady, you shot me,\" before mounting a last charge at her. She said she beat him over his head with a broomstick before he finally fell, mortally wounded by the gunshot.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=619, 628}}\n\nThe motel's owner, Evelyn Carr,<ref group=note>Some sources identify the motel owner's last name as \"Card,\" according to Guralnick</ref> said that she had been on the telephone with Franklin at the time of the incident. Carr said she overheard Cooke's intrusion and the ensuing conflict and gunshot. She called the police to request that officers go to the motel, telling them she believed a shooting had occurred.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=619}}\n\nA [[coroner]]'s [[inquest]] was convened to investigate the incident. The woman who had accompanied Cooke to the motel was identified as Elisa Boyer, who had also called the police that night shortly before Carr had. Boyer had called from a telephone booth near the motel, telling them she had just escaped being kidnapped.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=619, 627}}\n\nBoyer told the police that she had first met Cooke earlier that night and had spent the evening in his company. She said that after they left a local nightclub together, she had repeatedly requested that he take her home, but he instead took her against her will to the Hacienda Motel. She said that once in one of the motel's rooms, Cooke physically forced her onto the bed, and that she was certain he was going to rape her. According to Boyer, when Cooke stepped into the bathroom for a moment, she quickly grabbed her clothes and ran from the room. She said that in her haste, she had also scooped up most of Cooke's clothing by mistake. She said she ran first to the manager's office and knocked on the door seeking help. However, she said that the manager took too long in responding, so, fearing Cooke would soon be coming after her, she fled from the motel before the manager ever opened the door. She said she then put her clothing back on, hid Cooke's clothing, went to a telephone booth, and called the police.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=616\u2013619}}\n\nBoyer's story is the only account of what happened between her and Cooke that night; however, her story has long been called into question. Inconsistencies between her version of events and details reported by diners at Martoni's Restaurant, where Cooke dined and drank earlier in the evening, suggest that Boyer may have gone willingly to the motel with Cooke, then slipped out of the room with his clothing to rob him, rather than to escape an attempted rape.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=643}}<ref name=Wolff /> Cooke was reportedly carrying much more money at Martoni's than the $108 cash found at his death scene, and Boyer was arrested for prostitution in January 1965, though the charge was dismissed and she gained no more notoriety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/11.html |title=The Death of Sam Cooke |last=Krajicek |first=David |publisher=CrimeLibrary.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210053736/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/11.html |archive-date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHowever, questions about Boyer's role were beyond the scope of the inquest, the purpose of which was only to establish the circumstances of Franklin's role in the shooting.

He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival.<ref name=\"Austin2017\">{{cite book|author=Greta Austin|title=Shaping Church Law Around the Year 1000: The Decretum of Burchard of Worms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4|date=15 May 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-90055-3|pages=4\u2013}}</ref> \n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]] the Elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year.

The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016.

Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017.

The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At [[Augsburg]] Conrad received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]]. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to highest office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as successor of emmpire's founder [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad needed to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed. Only a third synod in 1030 solved the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his royal tour at Augsburg, Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] engaged into an argument, that although not entirely clear, was related to the younger Conrad's demands of yet unpaid compensation, king Conrad had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men must have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 after which Conrad the Younger no longer opposed Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad came into contact with members of the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, bishops from [[Northern Italy]], led by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], crossed the Alps in order to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain administrative privileges, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|King]]. However,the situation in Italy had become increasingly unstable after the death of the Henry II. Amidst occasional riots many Italian aristocrats demanded the secession of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The local aristocrats and merchants increasingly considered the idea of Frankish [[Ultramontanism|ultramontan]] protection against Saracen and Byzantine threats to be obsolete. The Italian throne was now viewed as vacant and not available for Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles had offered the Italian crown to the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After the offer was rejected, they approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]], who, initially intrigued by the offer, rejected as well.{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}}\n\nWhen the news of Henry's death spread, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted and destroyed the local imperial palace of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]], built during the 5th century.<ref name=\"Morgan-Owenson1821\">{{cite book|author=Sydney Morgan-Owenson|title=Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lupQAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA200|year=1821|publisher=H.

Pavia, had thanks to its strategic location on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France become an important commercial center. The local merchants and aristocrats demanded the greatest possible autonomy from imperial control.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the ecclesiastical mission, a party of noblemen from [[Pavia]] traveled north to meet Conrad. According to Wipo of Burgundy, the Italian kingship was not compatible with the German throne. Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

During the festivities a power struggle between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna ensued and was settled in favor of Milan. Subsequently Conrad left Rome and toured south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the Southern Italian principalities of [[Principality of Capua|Capua]] and [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]] and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees, that outlined the reorganisation of the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the explicit objective to bring the [[Patriarchate of Venice]] under imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the emperor addressed the matter acknowledging the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]] superior to the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Aquileian [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad's action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He made the unprecedented decision of chosing his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.\n\nThe young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree, that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to list and report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over the ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}<ref name=brit/>\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|240px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\n[[File:Adalbero of Eppenstein, Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Verona.jpg|thumb|Emperor Conrad disapproved of [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero's]] increasingly indiscreet and quasi-independent rule of his estates [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona|Verona]], that compromized the stability at the crossroads of the empire]]\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]].

To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=209}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Herzog-Mieszko-II-Lambert-Piast/6000000000768959047  |title= Herzog Mieszko II.

In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.is/20130701012634/http://bsbndb.bsb.lrz-muenchen.de/sfz58985.html |title= Mathilde von Schwaben  |publisher=  Neue deutsche Biographie | date=  | author=Eckhard Freise    | accessdate= April 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century.

In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031.

When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/><ref name=mie/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], that lasted from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and guaranteed protection against Polish aggression. Jaromir ruled only a small territory, however, as Poland had occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. During the following civil war, Mieszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Mieszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref><ref name=mie/>\n\nPoland did not stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Mieszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear at the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was a complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]].

While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew.

However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute.

Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9.

{{nowrap|'''Conrad the Elder'''}} and {{nowrap|'''Conrad the Salic'''}}, was [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role and [[Imperial Church System|organisation of the Church]] and the status and affairs of [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival.<ref name=\"Austin2017\">{{cite book|author=Greta Austin|title=Shaping Church Law Around the Year 1000: The Decretum of Burchard of Worms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4|date=15 May 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-90055-3|pages=4\u2013}}</ref> \n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]] the Elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela had married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Through this marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] upon the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}<ref name=brit>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Conrad-II |title=  Conrad II Holy Roman emperor | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=   |author=Peter Munz   |accessdate= April 2, 2020  }}</ref>\n\nConrad II's hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II eventually reconciled and he returned to Germany.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/><ref name=brit/>\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Royal election===\nEmperor Henry II died in 1024.

Without a clear successor as [[King of Germany]], Henry's widow [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] served as regent while the German dukes gathered to elect a new king. Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers [[Dietrich I of Metz|Bishop Dietrich I of Metz]] and [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]].

The [[Duchy of Saxony]] adopted a neutral strategy while the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] favored the younger Conrad. A majority of the assembled princes favored the elder Conrad, as the father of a seven-year-old son implied a more stable dynastic future for the kingdom. As president of the assembly, Archbishop Aribo cast the first vote and supported the elder Conrad. He was joined by the other clerics in support of him.

The political reorientation of Pilgrim also weakened the opposition towards the new king.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/0001/bsb00016322/images/index.html?seite=427 |title= Gisela  |publisher=  Neue deutsche Biographie | date=  | author=Otto zu  Stolberg-Wernigerode,    | accessdate= April 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n===Early reign===\n\n[[File:Adelaide, Abbess of Quedlinburg and Sophia, Abbess of Gandersheim.jpg|thumb|left|Adelaide, Abbess of Quedlinburg and Sophia, Abbess of Gandersheim]]\n[[File:Bad-Gandersheim-Stiftskirche-Seite-vorn.JPG|thumb|[[Collegiate Church]], [[Bad Gandersheim]], (from southwest)]]\n[[File:Bad Gandersheim - Stiftskirche - innen - Kirchenschiff.JPG|thumb|nave of [[Collegiate Church]], [[Bad Gandersheim]]]]\nConrad inherited a kingdom troubled by problems. The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At [[Augsburg]] Conrad received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]]. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to highest office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as successor of emmpire's founder [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad needed to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed. Only a third synod in 1030 solved the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his royal tour at Augsburg, Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] engaged into an argument, that although not entirely clear, was related to the younger Conrad's demands of yet unpaid compensation, king Conrad had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men must have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 after which Conrad the Younger no longer opposed Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad came into contact with members of the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, bishops from [[Northern Italy]], led by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], crossed the Alps in order to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain administrative privileges, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|King]]. However,the situation in Italy had become increasingly unstable after the death of the Henry II. Amidst occasional riots many Italian aristocrats demanded the secession of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The local aristocrats and merchants increasingly considered the idea of Frankish [[Ultramontanism|ultramontan]] protection against Saracen and Byzantine threats to be obsolete. The Italian throne was now viewed as vacant and not available for Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles had offered the Italian crown to the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After the offer was rejected, they approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]], who, initially intrigued by the offer, rejected as well.{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}}\n\nWhen the news of Henry's death spread, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted and destroyed the local imperial palace of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]], built during the 5th century.<ref name=\"Morgan-Owenson1821\">{{cite book|author=Sydney Morgan-Owenson|title=Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lupQAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA200|year=1821|publisher=H.

Pavia, had thanks to its strategic location on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France become an important commercial center. The local merchants and aristocrats demanded the greatest possible autonomy from imperial control.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the ecclesiastical mission, a party of noblemen from [[Pavia]] traveled north to meet Conrad. According to Wipo of Burgundy, the Italian kingship was not compatible with the German throne. Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

During the festivities a power struggle between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna ensued and was settled in favor of Milan. Subsequently Conrad left Rome and toured south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the Southern Italian principalities of [[Principality of Capua|Capua]] and [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]] and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees, that outlined the reorganisation of the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the explicit objective to bring the [[Patriarchate of Venice]] under imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the emperor addressed the matter acknowledging the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]] superior to the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Aquileian [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad's action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He made the unprecedented decision of chosing his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.\n\nThe young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree, that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to list and report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over the ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}<ref name=brit/>\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|240px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\n[[File:Adalbero of Eppenstein, Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Verona.jpg|thumb|Emperor Conrad disapproved of [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero's]] increasingly indiscreet and quasi-independent rule of his estates [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona|Verona]], that compromized the stability at the crossroads of the empire]]\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]].

Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]].

In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.is/20130701012634/http://bsbndb.bsb.lrz-muenchen.de/sfz58985.html |title= Mathilde von Schwaben  |publisher=  Neue deutsche Biographie | date=  | author=Eckhard Freise    | accessdate= April 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.<ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 71\">Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mieszko-II-Lambert  |title= Mieszko II Lambert King of Poland | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=   |author=   |accessdate= April 3, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=mie>{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2852030?seq=1  |title= The Fall of the Monarchy of Mieszko II, Lambert  | publisher = Jstor |date=   |author=Henry Joseph Lang   |accessdate= April 3, 2020  }}</ref>\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/><ref name=mie/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], that lasted from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and guaranteed protection against Polish aggression. Jaromir ruled only a small territory, however, as Poland had occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. During the following civil war, Mieszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Mieszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland did not stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Mieszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear at the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was a complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]].

While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by emperor Conrad.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=227}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by granting lands between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] in eastern Bavaria to Hungary.

However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II.

Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire.

One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\n-->\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles.

Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]].
