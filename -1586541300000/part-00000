Herron]]'s Division of the [[Army of the Frontier]] was transferred down the [[Mississippi River]] to become a part of the [[XIII Corps (ACW)|13th Corps]]. Arriving at [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]] on July 25, they remained there until August 13, 1863, when they were moved to [[Carrollton, New Orleans|Carrollton]], above [[New Orleans]].\n\nUnion Major General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] had been ordered to invade and \u201cplant the Flag in [[Texas]]\u201d, which plans resulted in the [[Second Battle of Sabine Pass]] on September 8, 1863. As a part of his overall plan, Herron's division was to be transported to [[Morganza, Louisiana]] below the mouth of the Red River. Both [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[Thomas Green (general)|Tom Green's]] cavalry and Brigadier General [[Alfred Mouton]]\u2019s small infantry division were operating on the upper [[Atchafalaya River]]. Herron's movement would distract the Confederates from the invasion of Texas, and they hoped it would prevent the Confederate forces from moving to Texas had the Sabine Pass effort been successful.\n\nOn September 5, Herron's division was dispatched up the Mississippi on transports and made a landing below Morganza on the 7th. On the 8th the entire force marched through Morganza, and down the Opelousas road, reaching the Atchafalaya in the late afternoon. They retired to the Fordoche and camped there for the night. The next day the Division marched to Morganza where they went into camp.<ref>Leake Diary, entries for September 7, 8 and 9, 1863</ref><br /> [[File:Battle of Stirling's Plantation.jpg|305px|right|thumb|Map of Sterling Plantation and vicinity]]\n\nOn September 11, Herron proposed to send a detachment back to the bridge over the Fordoche to monitor Confederate activity on the west bank of the Atchafalaya, and from Morganza in an attempt to draw out Green's cavalry from the west bank of the Atchafalaya.  Lt. Col. [[Joseph Bloomfield Leake]] of the [[20th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] was to be in command. A small provisional brigade was formed consisting of the [[19th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] under Maj. John Bruce, the [[26th Indiana Infantry Regiment]] under Col. A.D. Rose, a section of [[Battery B, 1st Missouri Light Artillery]], and a battalion of the [[6th Missouri Volunteer Cavalry]] under Major Samuel Montgomery. To supplement the cavalry, a company of mounted infantry was created by drawing men from every regiment in the division and was led by Lt. Henry Walton of the [[34th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]. The road from Morganza to the Fordoche crossing followed the east bank of Bayou Fordoche, running west to a point about three miles from Morganza, then following a turn in the bayou, ran south three and a half miles to a loop in the bayou by Norwood's plantation. Just west of Norwoods, the Opelousas Road forked to the northwest, crossed the Fordoche, and ran on to the Atchafalaya across from present day [[Melville, Louisiana]].<ref>Leake Diary, entries for September 11\u201312, 1863</ref>\n \nShortly after leaving Morganza, the force encountered Confederate pickets and skirmished with them throughout the day until they reached the Norwood plantation, about six miles from the Archafalaya, where they went into camp.  The country was unknown and Leake had no adequate maps. Mouton saw Leake's exposed position as an opportunity to destroy this force around Fordoche Bridge.\n\n==Battle==\nUpon scouting the area on the 13th, Leake discovered that the position at Norwoods was not very tenable. There were several old roads and a half completed railbed in the vicinity that would make it easy for Confederates to move and get in his rear. Pickets and posts were set out and Leake requested to withdraw about a mile closer to the Stirling plantation, but this request was refused by Herron.\n\nOn the evening of the 15th Leake learned from a citizen and from Negroes that an attack was expected which resulted in his withdrawing north two miles to the Stirling plantation and establishing his camps there. This position, though better than Norwoods, still had defects due to the roads that gave the Confederates easy ability to move around the federal position.<br />[[File:Lt. Col J.B. Leake.gif|right|thumb|Lt. Col. J.B. Leake Cir. 1863]]\n\nA levee ran along the east side of the road by the Stirling plantation, and Leake had a gap cut in it north of the house so that artillery could be moved through it if necessary. Pickets were maintained constantly, but the force was so small that they were deemed to be inadequate, and the whole brigade was uneasy as to their position.\n\nThe Confederates were becoming increasingly visible, and were often observed in small groups between  Stirlings and Morganza. Although Herron was apprised of the rebels between him and Leake, he took no efforts to secure their rear. Herron was ill, and on the evening of the 28th turned over the command to Major General [[Napoleon J.T. Dana]], and left for New Orleans.\n\nMouton had realized the opportunity to gobble up this small force and on the 19th had ordered Green to plan an attack, with the final decision made on the 25th. Green's 3,000 troops were at Centerpoint on the Atchafalaya on the 28th and commenced crossing by ferry at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. Wallers and Roundtree's cavalry battalions together with Semme's battery were crossed by dark. Next to cross were Speight's and Mouton's infantry brigades, and finally the 4th, 5th and 7th Texas Cavalry, the last crossing by 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on the 29th. The weather was very rainy.\n\nOn the morning of the 29th Mouton's and Speight's brigades were sent by a trail through the woods and swamps that intersected the Opelousas road about two miles north of the Stirling plantation. Mouton was to remain in this position to block any relief force that might be sent from Morganza, and Speight's brigade would launch the primary attack on Leakes right and rear.\n\nThe balance of the Confederate cavalry marched via the road toward the Fordoche Bridge near the Norwood house. Arriving there around 11:00&nbsp;a.m. and commenced skirmishing with the Federal cavalry pickets at the Fordoche bridge. After about a half hour, sounds of firing was heard to the north at the Stirling farm.\n\nJust before noon, a shot was heard from the picket post north of camp at Stirling's, and then a number more shots were  heard from the cane fields to the north and east of the house. Mouton had begun his attack. Leake ordered the artillery up the road and in position at the gap in the levee to fire across the cane fields.  The 19th Iowa was ordered to a fence running east to west behind the house and commence firing.  The 26th Indiana was then posted to the left of the 19th, facing west, and ordered to fire obliquely to the right.<br/>[[File:Stirling%27s_Plantation_Battlefield_Louisiana.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Map of Stirling's Plantation Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\n\nFor some reason, the artillery had not made it to the gap in the levee and were being moved by hand among the outbuildings behind the house, where they were totally useless.\n\nLeake had available only 450 infantry, as so many were on picket. Both the 19th and 26th were pushed back from their position through the Stirling buildings, and took up a position on the levee, now facing east, with the levee serving as an excellent breastwork.\n\nThe Confederates were in overwhelming force, and initially attempted to turn the right of the 19th. The 26th was pulled out and placed on the 19ths right, with the 26th now facing south. Seeing the change in front, the Confederates now moved to their right and poured through the gap in the levee, attempting to turn the left flank of the 19th. The weather was hot and the men were spent. Leake had been shot in his foot, unhorsed and captured, and due to the confusion, no other officer assumed command.\n\nMeanwhile, the Confederate cavalry had completely routed the federal cavalry to the south near the Norwood farm. The Federal cavalry streamed away toward Morganza with such rapidity that none of them were captured. The routed cavalry passed to the east of the Stirling plantation and the fight raging there. The infantry at Stirling's were so involved with their own fight that they were not aware of what had happened to their cavalry. Most of Green's cavalry were clothed in Union uniforms that had been captured at Brashear City three months before. With the flight of the Union cavalry, Green advanced his column up the road from Norwoods to the Sterling plantation. The Union infantry observed the advancing column and supposed them to be the 6th Missouri. Not until they were fired upon did the Union infantry realize that this was Green's cavalry coming in on their other flank. Vastly outnumbered, leaderless, and assailed from all sides, the Federals surrendered piecemeal.<ref>History of the 19th Iowa Infantry, pp 84-103</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOnly a few Union infantry managed to escape. The Federals lost 16 dead, 45 wounded, and 454 prisoners. Confederate losses were 26 dead, 85 wounded and ten missing. Additionally, the Confederates took two ten pounder parrot rifles with caissons, two new ambulances, one hospital wagon loaded with medical supplies, and all of the arms of the captured men. Green quickly consolidated his prisoners and spoils and moved back to the river, crossing it as quickly as possible. The prisoners were then marched via Alexandria, Natchitoches, Mansfield and Shreveport to the Camp Ford prison camp near [[Tyler, Texas]], where they arrived on October 23, 1863.<ref>Leake Diary, entries from September 29-October 24, 1863</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bergeron, Arthur W., ''Guide to Louisiana Confederate Military Units 1861-1865''.

Herron]]'s Division of the [[Army of the Frontier]] was transferred down the [[Mississippi River]] to become a part of the [[XIII Corps (ACW)|13th Corps]]. Arriving at [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]] on July 25, they remained there until August 13, 1863, when they were moved to [[Carrollton, New Orleans|Carrollton]], above [[New Orleans]].\n\nUnion Major General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] had been ordered to invade and \u201cplant the Flag in [[Texas]]\u201d, which plans resulted in the [[Second Battle of Sabine Pass]] on September 8, 1863. As a part of his overall plan, Herron's division was to be transported to [[Morganza, Louisiana]] below the mouth of the Red River. Both [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[Thomas Green (general)|Tom Green's]] cavalry and Brigadier General [[Alfred Mouton]]\u2019s small infantry division were operating on the upper [[Atchafalaya River]]. Herron's movement would distract the Confederates from the invasion of Texas, and they hoped it would prevent the Confederate forces from moving to Texas had the Sabine Pass effort been successful.\n\nOn September 5, Herron's division was dispatched up the Mississippi on transports and made a landing below Morganza on the 7th. On the 8th the entire force marched through Morganza, and down the Opelousas road, reaching the Atchafalaya in the late afternoon. They retired to the Fordoche and camped there for the night. The next day the Division marched to Morganza where they went into camp.<ref>Leake Diary, entries for September 7, 8 and 9, 1863</ref><br /> [[File:Battle of Stirling's Plantation.jpg|305px|right|thumb|Map of Sterling Plantation and vicinity]]\n\nOn September 11, Herron proposed to send a detachment back to the bridge over the Fordoche to monitor Confederate activity on the west bank of the Atchafalaya, and from Morganza in an attempt to draw out Green's cavalry from the west bank of the Atchafalaya.  Lt. Col. [[Joseph Bloomfield Leake]] of the [[20th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] was to be in command. A small provisional brigade was formed consisting of the [[19th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] under Maj. John Bruce, the [[26th Indiana Infantry Regiment]] under Col. A.D. Rose, a section of [[Battery B, 1st Missouri Light Artillery]], and a battalion of the [[6th Missouri Volunteer Cavalry]] under Major Samuel Montgomery. To supplement the cavalry, a company of mounted infantry was created by drawing men from every regiment in the division and was led by Lt. Henry Walton of the [[34th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]. The road from Morganza to the Fordoche crossing followed the east bank of Bayou Fordoche, running west to a point about three miles from Morganza, then following a turn in the bayou, ran south three and a half miles to a loop in the bayou by Norwood's plantation. Just west of Norwoods, the Opelousas Road forked to the northwest, crossed the Fordoche, and ran on to the Atchafalaya across from present day [[Melville, Louisiana]].<ref>Leake Diary, entries for September 11\u201312, 1863</ref>\n \nShortly after leaving Morganza, the force encountered Confederate pickets and skirmished with them throughout the day until they reached the Norwood plantation, about six miles from the Archafalaya, where they went into camp.  The country was unknown and Leake had no adequate maps. Mouton saw Leake's exposed position as an opportunity to destroy this force around Fordoche Bridge.\n\n==Battle==\nUpon scouting the area on the 13th, Leake discovered that the position at Norwoods was not very tenable. There were several old roads and a half completed railbed in the vicinity that would make it easy for Confederates to move and get in his rear. Pickets and posts were set out and Leake requested to withdraw about a mile closer to the Stirling plantation, but this request was refused by Herron.\n\nOn the evening of the 15th Leake learned from a citizen and from Negroes that an attack was expected which resulted in his withdrawing north two miles to the Stirling plantation and establishing his camps there. This position, though better than Norwoods, still had defects due to the roads that gave the Confederates easy ability to move around the federal position.<br />[[File:Lt. Col J.B. Leake.gif|right|thumb|Lt. Col. J.B. Leake Cir. 1863]]\n\nA levee ran along the east side of the road by the Stirling plantation, and Leake had a gap cut in it north of the house so that artillery could be moved through it if necessary. Pickets were maintained constantly, but the force was so small that they were deemed to be inadequate, and the whole brigade was uneasy as to their position.\n\nThe Confederates were becoming increasingly visible, and were often observed in small groups between  Stirlings and Morganza. Although Herron was apprised of the rebels between him and Leake, he took no efforts to secure their rear. Herron was ill, and on the evening of the 28th turned over the command to Major General [[Napoleon J.T. Dana]], and left for New Orleans.\n\nMouton had realized the opportunity to gobble up this small force and on the 19th had ordered Green to plan an attack, with the final decision made on the 25th.

{"title_page": "Digital Millennium Copyright Act", "text_new": "8The '''Digital Millennium Copyright Act''' ('''DMCA''') is a 1998 [[United States]] [[copyright]] [[law]] that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as [[digital rights management]] or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the [[Internet]].<ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf DMCA p7.]</ref><ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title17/html/USCODE-2010-title17-chap5-sec506.htm United States Code (2010) Title 17 CHAPTER 5, COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND REMEDIES, Sec. 506 \u2013 Criminal offenses]</ref> Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the [[United States Senate]] and signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended [[Title 17 of the United States Code|Title 17]] of the [[United States Code]] to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of the [[Online service provider|providers of online services]] for [[copyright infringement]] by their users.\n\nThe DMCA's principal innovation in the field of copyright is the exemption from direct and [[indirect liability]] of [[Internet service provider]]s and other intermediaries. This exemption was adopted by the [[European Union]] in the [[Electronic Commerce Directive]] 2000. The [[Information Society Directive]] 2001 implemented the 1996 [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]] in the EU.\n\n==Provisions==\n\n===Title I: WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act===\nDMCA Title I, the [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]], amends U.S. copyright law to comply with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]] and the [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]], adopted at the WIPO Diplomatic Conference in December 1996. The treaties have two major portions. One portion includes works covered by several treaties in U.S. copy prevention laws and gave the title its name. For further analysis of this portion of the Act and of cases under it, see [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]].\n\nThe second portion (17 U.S.C. 1201) is often known as the DMCA [[anti-circumvention]] provisions. These provisions changed the remedies for the circumvention of copy-prevention systems (also called \"technical protection measures\") and required that all analog video recorders have support for a specific form of copy prevention created by Macrovision (now [[Rovi Corporation]]) built in, giving Macrovision an effective monopoly on the analog video-recording copy-prevention market. The section contains a number of specific limitations and exemptions, for such things as government research and [[reverse engineering]] in specified situations. Although, section 1201(c) of the title stated that the section does not change the underlying substantive copyright infringement rights, remedies, or defenses, it did not make those defenses available in circumvention actions. The section does not include a [[fair use]] exemption from criminality nor a [[scienter]] requirement, so criminal liability could attach to even unintended circumvention for legitimate purposes.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Band, Jonathan |author2=Katoh, Masanobu|year=2011|title=Interfaces on Trial 2.0|location=|publisher=MIT Press|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFMUBhojiA0C&pg=PA92 92]|isbn=978-0-262-01500-4}}</ref>\n\n===Title II: Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act===\nDMCA Title II, the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]] (\"OCILLA\"), creates a [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] for [[online service provider]]s (OSPs, including [[Internet service provider|ISPs]]) against copyright infringement liability, provided they meet specific requirements.<ref>Cullins, Ashley [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/music-industry-a-listers-call-879718 Music Industry A-Listers Call on Congress to Reform Copyright Act] ''Hollywood Reporter''.

OCILLA also includes a counternotification provision that offers OSPs a safe harbor from liability to their users when users claim that the material in question is not, in fact, infringing. OCILLA also facilitates issuing of [[subpoena]]s against OSPs to provide their users' identity.\n\n===Title III: Computer Maintenance Competition Assurance Act===\nDMCA Title III modified [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/117.html section 117] of the copyright title so that those repairing computers could make certain temporary, limited copies while working on a computer. It reversed the precedent set in ''[[MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.]]'', 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993).\n\n===Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions===\nDMCA Title IV contains an assortment of provisions:\n* Clarified and added to the duties of the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]].\n* Added ephemeral copy for broadcasters provisions, including certain [[statutory license]]s.\n* Added provisions to facilitate [[distance education]].\n* Added provisions to assist libraries with keeping phonorecords of sound recordings.\n* Added provisions relating to collective bargaining and the transfer of movie rights.\n\n===Title V: Vessel Hull Design Protection Act===\n'''DMCA''' Title V added sections [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1301.html 1301] through [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1332.html 1332] to add a ''[[sui generis]]'' protection for boat hull designs. Boat hull designs were not considered covered under copyright law because boats are useful articles whose form cannot be separated from their function.<ref>17 U.S.C. 101 (defining \"Pictorial, graphic and sculptural works\" as \"Such works shall include works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned; the design of a useful article, as defined in this section, shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\")</ref><ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/docs/hr2696.html \"Vessel Hull Design Protection Act of 1997 (H.R. 2696)\"], Statement of MaryBeth Peters, The Register of Copyrights, before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, Oct. 23, 1997 (\"It is a long-held view of the Office that a gap exists in legal protection for the designs of useful articles. Existing bodies of federal intellectual property law do not provide appropriate and practical coverage for such designs, while state law is largely preempted in this area. Consequently, while considerable investment and creativity may go into the creation of innovative designs, they often can be copied with impunity.\").</ref>\n\n==Anti-circumvention exemptions==\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=May 2013}}\nIn addition to the safe harbors and exemptions the statute explicitly provides, [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html#1201 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)] requires that the [[Librarian of Congress]] issue exemptions from the prohibition against circumvention of access-control technology. Exemptions are granted when it is shown that access-control technology has had a substantial adverse effect on the ability of people to make non-infringing uses of copyrighted works.\n\nThe exemption rules are revised every three years. Exemption proposals are submitted by the public to the Registrar of Copyrights, and after a process of hearings and public comments, the final rule is recommended by the Registrar and issued by the Librarian. Exemptions expire after three years and must be resubmitted for the next rulemaking cycle. Consequently, only the most recent rulemaking is valid, and prior exemptions issued (in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2010 and 2013) are no longer valid. As of 2017 (for the 2018 rulemaking), the Copyright Office is considering re-authorizing such exemptions if no new evidence is submitted to the contrary.\n\n=== Section 1201 Study ===\nAfter much criticism (see [[#Criticisms|below]]), on December 29, 2015, the Copyright Office initiated a study to assess the operation of section 1201 and the triennial rulemaking process. This is different from usual public comments on exemption proposals. It includes the role of the anti-trafficking provisions and permanent exemptions, and the requirements of the rulemaking itself. The Office has issued a Notice of Inquiry requesting public comment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/policy/1201/ |title=Section 1201 Study |work=U.S. Copyright Office |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral comments were posted by individuals and organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=84&so=ASC&sb=docId&po=0&dct=PS&D=COLC-2015-0012&refD=COLC-2015-0012-0088 |title=Docket Browser: Request for Public Comments: Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Access to Copyrighted Works}}</ref>\nAn individual recalls that the [[Copyright Clause]] has limitations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=COLC-2015-0012-0014 |title=Initial Comments - David Oster |author=David Oster |date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n[[Association of American Publishers]] ''et al.'' hold there is no need to amend the statute or to significantly alter the rulemaking.

Instead, video files are uploaded through an automated process which is initiated entirely at the volition of Veoh's users.</blockquote>\n\nThe Court has granted the Veoh's motion for [[summary judgment]], on the basis of the DMCA, holding that the defendant's video-sharing web site complied and was entitled to the protection of the statute's \"safe harbor\" provision.<ref>{{cite web|author=August 27th, 2008|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/27/transcoding-is-not-a-crime-says-court-in-veoh-porn-case/|title=Transcoding Is Not A Crime, Says Court In Veoh Porn Case|publisher=TechCrunch|date=2008-08-27|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Even though Veoh won the court case, it blamed the litigation as one of the causes of its preparing to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy and its subsequent sale to Qlipso.<ref>\"Content sharing company Qlipso buys Veoh\" (Apr 9, 2010) Athena Information Solutions Pvt.

Four months after the video was originally uploaded, [[Universal Music Group]], which owned the copyrights to the song, ordered YouTube to remove the video enforcing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\n\nLenz notified YouTube immediately that her video was within the scope of fair use, and demanded that it be restored. YouTube complied after six weeks\u2014not two weeks, as required by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\u2014to see whether Universal planned to sue Lenz for infringement.

First, fair use has been a legal gray area, and subject to opposing interpretations. This has caused inequity in the treatment of individual cases. Second, the DMCA has often been invoked overbearingly, favoring larger copyright holders over smaller ones. This has caused accidental takedowns of legitimate content, such as a record company accidentally removing a music video from their own artist. Third, the lack of consequences for perjury in claims encourages censorship. This has caused temporary takedowns of legitimate content that can be financially damaging to the legitimate copyright holder, who has no recourse for reimbursement. This has been used by businesses to censor competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cobia|first=Jeffrey|year=2008|title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act Takedown Notice Procedure: Misuses, Abuses, and Shortcomings of the Process|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mipr10&g_sent=1&collection=journals&id=391|journal=Minnesota Journal of Law Science & Technology|volume=1|pages=391\u2013393|via=Hein Online}}</ref>\n\n===Abuse of the anti-circumvention provision===\n\nIn 2015 [[Volkswagen]] abused the DMCA to hide their vehicles [[Volkswagen emissions scandal|emissions cheat]].<ref>[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/researchers-could-have-uncovered-volkswagens-emissions-cheat-if-not-hindered-dmca Researchers Could Have Uncovered Volkswagen's Emissions Cheat If Not Hindered by the DMCA | Electronic Frontier Foundation]</ref> It has been suggested that had the DMCA not prevented access to the software \"..a researcher with legal access to Volkswagen's software could have discovered the code that changed how the cars behave in testing..\"<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2015/09/epa-opposes-rules-couldve-exposed-vws-cheating/ Wired]</ref>\n\n=== Effect on analog video equipment ===\n\n[[Analog Copy Protection]] (ACP), the encryption technology created by [[Rovi Corporation]] (formerly Macrovision, now TiVo), is designed to thwart users' attempts to reproduce content via analog cables. When a DVD is played through an analog video cable and recorded using a [[VCR]], Rovi's ACP technology will distort the copy partially or completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rovicorp.com/products/content_producers/protect/acp.htm|title=ACP|access-date=2010-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327214055/http://www.rovicorp.com/products/content_producers/protect/acp.htm|archive-date=2010-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe technology works by adding additional lines to the video signal. In the [[NTSC]] video standard, blank lines ([[vertical blanking interval]]s) that the user cannot see are used for functions like closed captioning. Rovi Corporation uses these blank lines to implement its ACP technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci213677,00.html|title=Vertical blanking interval}}</ref>\n\nThe implementation of ACP has been ill-regarded by some video enthusiasts. Many claim that the technology has led to signal issues with VCRs and analog video equipment. Some VCRs misread the encryption used to prevent copying, distorting the video image regardless of whether the recording is original or a copy.\n\nThe DMCA has been criticized for forcing all producers of analog video equipment to support the proprietary copy protection technology of Rovi Corporation, a commercial firm. The producers of video equipment are forced by law to support and implement the corporation's proprietary technology. This benefits Rovi Corporation financially, whereas those forced to implement it receive neither profit nor compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/19|title=Analog Off|website=Publicknowledge.org|access-date=2010-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627184546/http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/19|archive-date=2010-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Another DMCA Misuse: Macrovision v. Sima|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2006/08/another-dmca-misuse-macrovision-v-sima|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, some criticize the implementation of ACP as a violation of their [[fair use]] rights. A recently developed TV-streaming product called the [[Slingbox]] uses analog signals to convey video from television to a mobile device. However, the encryption used by ACP blocks analog transmission, rendering the Slingbox unusable. Additionally ACP blocks the use of recording for educational purposes. On one or more accounts, students have not been able to cite and record cable sources properly due to ACP restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/analog-hole|title=Analog Hole|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2013-01-13}}</ref>\n\n===Effect on research===\n{{Main|Digital rights management}}\n\nThe DMCA has affected the worldwide [[cryptography]] research community, since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violates, or might violate, the DMCA.

In 2014, the [[Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act]] was passed, granting a specific exemption for unlocking cell phones, without affecting the other provisions of the DMCA.\n\nBills in 2015 included the Unlocking Technology Act of 2015,<ref>[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr1587/text Govtrack.us]</ref> and the Breaking Down Barriers to Innovation Act of 2015.<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/990 Congress.gov]</ref> Republicans are considering legislation as well, as it becomes clear that Section 1201 is impeding the country's security. Facing escalating numbers of cyberthreats, cybersecurity researchers petitioned to conduct research to keep pace with evolving cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, stating: \"Without such an exemption, security risks will lie unaddressed and the public will be substantially less safe.\"<ref>[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=lawfac_reports Engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu]</ref> The bills are intended to address the fact that section 1201 prevents circumvention even when doing so is not copyright infringement. In addition, the section requires exemption proponents to bear the burden of proof every time their exemption comes up for triennial review, instead of there being a presumption of renewal for an exemption whose importance was previously proven.\n\n[[Rick Boucher]], a congressman from Virginia, led previous efforts by introducing the [[Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act]] (DMCRA).\n\nA prominent bill related to the DMCA is the [[Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act]] (CBDTPA), known in early drafts as the Security Systems and Standards Certification Act (SSSCA). This bill, if it had passed, would have dealt with the devices used to access digital content and would have been even more restrictive than the DMCA.{{vague|date=February 2015}}\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the DMCA, and several times afterwards, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] documented harmful consequences of the anti-circumvention provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-under-dmca |title=Unintended Consequences: Twelve Years under the DMCA &#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2010-03-03 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> They document that the DMCA:\n\n# Stifles free expression, such as in its use against Russian programmer [[Dmitry Sklyarov]], Princeton Professor [[Edward Felten]], and journalists;\n# Jeopardizes [[fair use]];\n# Impedes competition, such as blocking aftermarket competition in toner cartridges, garage door openers, and enforcing [[walled garden (technology)|walled gardens]] around the [[iPod]];<ref>[[OdioWorks v.

It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as [[digital rights management]] or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the [[Internet]].<ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf DMCA p7.]</ref><ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title17/html/USCODE-2010-title17-chap5-sec506.htm United States Code (2010) Title 17 CHAPTER 5, COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND REMEDIES, Sec. 506 \u2013 Criminal offenses]</ref> Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the [[United States Senate]] and signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended [[Title 17 of the United States Code|Title 17]] of the [[United States Code]] to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of the [[Online service provider|providers of online services]] for [[copyright infringement]] by their users.\n\nThe DMCA's principal innovation in the field of copyright is the exemption from direct and [[indirect liability]] of [[Internet service provider]]s and other intermediaries. This exemption was adopted by the [[European Union]] in the [[Electronic Commerce Directive]] 2000. The [[Information Society Directive]] 2001 implemented the 1996 [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]] in the EU.\n\n==Provisions==\n\n===Title I: WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act===\nDMCA Title I, the [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]], amends U.S. copyright law to comply with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]] and the [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]], adopted at the WIPO Diplomatic Conference in December 1996. The treaties have two major portions. One portion includes works covered by several treaties in U.S. copy prevention laws and gave the title its name. For further analysis of this portion of the Act and of cases under it, see [[WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act]].\n\nThe second portion (17 U.S.C. 1201) is often known as the DMCA [[anti-circumvention]] provisions. These provisions changed the remedies for the circumvention of copy-prevention systems (also called \"technical protection measures\") and required that all analog video recorders have support for a specific form of copy prevention created by Macrovision (now [[Rovi Corporation]]) built in, giving Macrovision an effective monopoly on the analog video-recording copy-prevention market. The section contains a number of specific limitations and exemptions, for such things as government research and [[reverse engineering]] in specified situations. Although, section 1201(c) of the title stated that the section does not change the underlying substantive copyright infringement rights, remedies, or defenses, it did not make those defenses available in circumvention actions. The section does not include a [[fair use]] exemption from criminality nor a [[scienter]] requirement, so criminal liability could attach to even unintended circumvention for legitimate purposes.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Band, Jonathan |author2=Katoh, Masanobu|year=2011|title=Interfaces on Trial 2.0|location=|publisher=MIT Press|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFMUBhojiA0C&pg=PA92 92]|isbn=978-0-262-01500-4}}</ref>\n\n===Title II: Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act===\nDMCA Title II, the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]] (\"OCILLA\"), creates a [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] for [[online service provider]]s (OSPs, including [[Internet service provider|ISPs]]) against copyright infringement liability, provided they meet specific requirements.<ref>Cullins, Ashley [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/music-industry-a-listers-call-879718 Music Industry A-Listers Call on Congress to Reform Copyright Act] ''Hollywood Reporter''. April 5, 2016</ref> OSPs must adhere to and qualify for certain prescribed safe harbor guidelines and promptly block access to alleged infringing material (or remove such material from their systems) when they receive [[DMCA takedown notice|notification of an infringement claim]] from a copyright holder or the copyright holder's agent. OCILLA also includes a counternotification provision that offers OSPs a safe harbor from liability to their users when users claim that the material in question is not, in fact, infringing. OCILLA also facilitates issuing of [[subpoena]]s against OSPs to provide their users' identity.\n\n===Title III: Computer Maintenance Competition Assurance Act===\nDMCA Title III modified [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/117.html section 117] of the copyright title so that those repairing computers could make certain temporary, limited copies while working on a computer. It reversed the precedent set in ''[[MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.]]'', 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993).\n\n===Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions===\nDMCA Title IV contains an assortment of provisions:\n* Clarified and added to the duties of the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]].\n* Added ephemeral copy for broadcasters provisions, including certain [[statutory license]]s.\n* Added provisions to facilitate [[distance education]].\n* Added provisions to assist libraries with keeping phonorecords of sound recordings.\n* Added provisions relating to collective bargaining and the transfer of movie rights.\n\n===Title V: Vessel Hull Design Protection Act===\n'''DMCA''' Title V added sections [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1301.html 1301] through [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/1332.html 1332] to add a ''[[sui generis]]'' protection for boat hull designs. Boat hull designs were not considered covered under copyright law because boats are useful articles whose form cannot be separated from their function.<ref>17 U.S.C. 101 (defining \"Pictorial, graphic and sculptural works\" as \"Such works shall include works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned; the design of a useful article, as defined in this section, shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\")</ref><ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/docs/hr2696.html \"Vessel Hull Design Protection Act of 1997 (H.R. 2696)\"], Statement of MaryBeth Peters, The Register of Copyrights, before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, Oct. 23, 1997 (\"It is a long-held view of the Office that a gap exists in legal protection for the designs of useful articles. Existing bodies of federal intellectual property law do not provide appropriate and practical coverage for such designs, while state law is largely preempted in this area. Consequently, while considerable investment and creativity may go into the creation of innovative designs, they often can be copied with impunity.\").</ref>\n\n==Anti-circumvention exemptions==\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=May 2013}}\nIn addition to the safe harbors and exemptions the statute explicitly provides, [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html#1201 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)] requires that the [[Librarian of Congress]] issue exemptions from the prohibition against circumvention of access-control technology. Exemptions are granted when it is shown that access-control technology has had a substantial adverse effect on the ability of people to make non-infringing uses of copyrighted works.\n\nThe exemption rules are revised every three years. Exemption proposals are submitted by the public to the Registrar of Copyrights, and after a process of hearings and public comments, the final rule is recommended by the Registrar and issued by the Librarian. Exemptions expire after three years and must be resubmitted for the next rulemaking cycle. Consequently, only the most recent rulemaking is valid, and prior exemptions issued (in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2010 and 2013) are no longer valid. As of 2017 (for the 2018 rulemaking), the Copyright Office is considering re-authorizing such exemptions if no new evidence is submitted to the contrary.\n\n=== Section 1201 Study ===\nAfter much criticism (see [[#Criticisms|below]]), on December 29, 2015, the Copyright Office initiated a study to assess the operation of section 1201 and the triennial rulemaking process. This is different from usual public comments on exemption proposals. It includes the role of the anti-trafficking provisions and permanent exemptions, and the requirements of the rulemaking itself. The Office has issued a Notice of Inquiry requesting public comment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/policy/1201/ |title=Section 1201 Study |work=U.S. Copyright Office |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral comments were posted by individuals and organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=84&so=ASC&sb=docId&po=0&dct=PS&D=COLC-2015-0012&refD=COLC-2015-0012-0088 |title=Docket Browser: Request for Public Comments: Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Access to Copyrighted Works}}</ref>\nAn individual recalls that the [[Copyright Clause]] has limitations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=COLC-2015-0012-0014 |title=Initial Comments - David Oster |author=David Oster |date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n[[Association of American Publishers]] ''et al.'' hold there is no need to amend the statute or to significantly alter the rulemaking. They are happy with the protection they are being granted, including anti-trafficking provisions, and talk of placing the cart before the horse, when they argue about requiring a proof of the mindset that consumers would have when utilizing circumvention tools\nbefore actual acts of circumvention occur. In their opinion, the meaning of Section 1201 is to ''extend'', not merely duplicate, copyright holder's rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=COLC-2015-0012-0077&amp;attachmentNumber=1&amp;contentType=pdf |title=Reply Comments of: Association of American Publishers, Motion Picture Association of America, Recording Industry Association of America |date=April 1, 2016 |author1=Allan R.

First, fair use has been a legal gray area, and subject to opposing interpretations. This has caused inequity in the treatment of individual cases. Second, the DMCA has often been invoked overbearingly, favoring larger copyright holders over smaller ones. This has caused accidental takedowns of legitimate content, such as a record company accidentally removing a music video from their own artist. Third, the lack of consequences for perjury in claims encourages censorship. This has caused temporary takedowns of legitimate content that can be financially damaging to the legitimate copyright holder, who has no recourse for reimbursement. This has been used by businesses to censor competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cobia|first=Jeffrey|year=2008|title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act Takedown Notice Procedure: Misuses, Abuses, and Shortcomings of the Process|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mipr10&g_sent=1&collection=journals&id=391|journal=Minnesota Journal of Law Science & Technology|volume=1|pages=391\u2013393|via=Hein Online}}</ref>\n\n===Abuse of the anti-circumvention provision===\n\nIn 2015 [[Volkswagen]] abused the DMCA to hide their vehicles [[Volkswagen emissions scandal|emissions cheat]].<ref>[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/researchers-could-have-uncovered-volkswagens-emissions-cheat-if-not-hindered-dmca Researchers Could Have Uncovered Volkswagen's Emissions Cheat If Not Hindered by the DMCA | Electronic Frontier Foundation]</ref> It has been suggested that had the DMCA not prevented access to the software \"..a researcher with legal access to Volkswagen's software could have discovered the code that changed how the cars behave in testing..\"<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2015/09/epa-opposes-rules-couldve-exposed-vws-cheating/ Wired]</ref>\n\n=== Effect on analog video equipment ===\n\n[[Analog Copy Protection]] (ACP), the encryption technology created by [[Rovi Corporation]] (formerly Macrovision, now TiVo), is designed to thwart users' attempts to reproduce content via analog cables. When a DVD is played through an analog video cable and recorded using a [[VCR]], Rovi's ACP technology will distort the copy partially or completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rovicorp.com/products/content_producers/protect/acp.htm|title=ACP|access-date=2010-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327214055/http://www.rovicorp.com/products/content_producers/protect/acp.htm|archive-date=2010-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe technology works by adding additional lines to the video signal. In the [[NTSC]] video standard, blank lines ([[vertical blanking interval]]s) that the user cannot see are used for functions like closed captioning. Rovi Corporation uses these blank lines to implement its ACP technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci213677,00.html|title=Vertical blanking interval}}</ref>\n\nThe implementation of ACP has been ill-regarded by some video enthusiasts. Many claim that the technology has led to signal issues with VCRs and analog video equipment. Some VCRs misread the encryption used to prevent copying, distorting the video image regardless of whether the recording is original or a copy.\n\nThe DMCA has been criticized for forcing all producers of analog video equipment to support the proprietary copy protection technology of Rovi Corporation, a commercial firm. The producers of video equipment are forced by law to support and implement the corporation's proprietary technology. This benefits Rovi Corporation financially, whereas those forced to implement it receive neither profit nor compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/19|title=Analog Off|website=Publicknowledge.org|access-date=2010-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627184546/http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/19|archive-date=2010-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Another DMCA Misuse: Macrovision v. Sima|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2006/08/another-dmca-misuse-macrovision-v-sima|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, some criticize the implementation of ACP as a violation of their [[fair use]] rights. A recently developed TV-streaming product called the [[Slingbox]] uses analog signals to convey video from television to a mobile device. However, the encryption used by ACP blocks analog transmission, rendering the Slingbox unusable. Additionally ACP blocks the use of recording for educational purposes. On one or more accounts, students have not been able to cite and record cable sources properly due to ACP restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/analog-hole|title=Analog Hole|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=2013-01-13}}</ref>\n\n===Effect on research===\n{{Main|Digital rights management}}\n\nThe DMCA has affected the worldwide [[cryptography]] research community, since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violates, or might violate, the DMCA. The arrest of Russian programmer [[Dmitry Sklyarov]] in 2001, for alleged infringement of the DMCA, was a highly publicized example of the law's use to prevent or penalize development of anti-DRM measures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cybercrime.gov/Sklyarovindictment.htm |title=First Indictment Under Digital Millennium Copyright Act Returned Against Russian National |publisher=Cybercrime.gov |accessdate=2011-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017035005/http://www.cybercrime.gov/Sklyarovindictment.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2011 }}</ref> While working for [[ElcomSoft]] in Russia, he developed ''The Advanced eBook Processor'', a software application allowing users to strip usage restriction information from restricted [[e-book]]s, an activity legal in both Russia and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200108/elcomsoftqa.html|title=Adobe FAQ: ElcomSoft legal background|publisher=Adobe.com|accessdate=2011-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104031758/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200108/elcomsoftqa.html|archive-date=2011-11-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> Paradoxically, under the DMCA, it is not legal in the United States to provide such a tool.

[[The Unlocking Technology Act of 2013]] was introduced to attempt to exempt non-infringing uses from the anti-circumvention clause.<ref name=\"Couts\">{{Cite news|author=Couts, Andrew|date=9 May 2013|title=Awesome new bill legalizes cell phone unlocking, 'fixes' the DMCA|newspaper=Digital Trends Newsletter|publisher=Designtechnica Corporation|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/new-bill-legalizes-cell-phone-unlocking-fixes-the-dmca/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703073505/http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/new-bill-legalizes-cell-phone-unlocking-fixes-the-dmca/|archivedate=3 July 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the bill was not passed by Congress. In 2014, the [[Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act]] was passed, granting a specific exemption for unlocking cell phones, without affecting the other provisions of the DMCA.\n\nBills in 2015 included the Unlocking Technology Act of 2015,<ref>[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr1587/text Govtrack.us]</ref> and the Breaking Down Barriers to Innovation Act of 2015.<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/990 Congress.gov]</ref> Republicans are considering legislation as well, as it becomes clear that Section 1201 is impeding the country's security. Facing escalating numbers of cyberthreats, cybersecurity researchers petitioned to conduct research to keep pace with evolving cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, stating: \"Without such an exemption, security risks will lie unaddressed and the public will be substantially less safe.\"<ref>[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=lawfac_reports Engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu]</ref> The bills are intended to address the fact that section 1201 prevents circumvention even when doing so is not copyright infringement. In addition, the section requires exemption proponents to bear the burden of proof every time their exemption comes up for triennial review, instead of there being a presumption of renewal for an exemption whose importance was previously proven.\n\n[[Rick Boucher]], a congressman from Virginia, led previous efforts by introducing the [[Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act]] (DMCRA).\n\nA prominent bill related to the DMCA is the [[Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act]] (CBDTPA), known in early drafts as the Security Systems and Standards Certification Act (SSSCA). This bill, if it had passed, would have dealt with the devices used to access digital content and would have been even more restrictive than the DMCA.{{vague|date=February 2015}}\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the DMCA, and several times afterwards, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] documented harmful consequences of the anti-circumvention provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-under-dmca |title=Unintended Consequences: Twelve Years under the DMCA &#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2010-03-03 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> They document that the DMCA:\n\n# Stifles free expression, such as in its use against Russian programmer [[Dmitry Sklyarov]], Princeton Professor [[Edward Felten]], and journalists;\n# Jeopardizes [[fair use]];\n# Impedes competition, such as blocking aftermarket competition in toner cartridges, garage door openers, and enforcing [[walled garden (technology)|walled gardens]] around the [[iPod]];<ref>[[OdioWorks v.

The winning entry was published in the weekend edition of the newspaper that coincided with what had effectively become, at that time, a local annual science fiction convention known as Albacon.\n\nIn 1986, Ann Karkalas of the [[University of Glasgow]] Adult & Continuing Education Department contacted the competition's judge, the writer (and the ''Herald'''s then-Science Fiction reviewer) [[Duncan Lunan]], about the possibility of starting a science fiction writing evening class. Both knew each other previously from the Glasgow Science Fiction Circle, a group of readers and writers which had met during the 1960s and 1970s. Duncan was willing to teach the course, and indeed the classes would go on to run for the best part of a decade.\n\nMany of those who attend the first year's class were so enthusiastic about writing that \u2013 once the class finished \u2013 they wanted to continue meeting. So they did; at the suggestion of Lunan, this new group began to refer to itself as the Glasgow Science Fiction Writers Circle, although the group remains remarkably anarchic and non-hierarchical in form.\n\nAlthough the Circle's early membership largely overlapped with that of the evening classes, the two entities gradually became more distinct. After the evening classes were ended, the Circle has continued to attract new members through word of mouth, brochure entries, and its own website.\n\nHaving survived several changes of venue, frequency of meetings and an almost complete turnover of members, the Circle currently meets every second Tuesday. Venues have included [[St Aloysius Church, Glasgow|St Aloysius Church]], the [[Glasgow Film Theatre]], the city's branch of Border's bookshop, and a smaller function room of a Glasgow church.<ref>{{Cite web|title = GSFWC FAQ|url = https://gsfwc.wordpress.com/gsfwc-faq/|website = Glasgow SF Writers' Circle|accessdate = 27 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}} \nThe Circle's workshops are neither instructor-led nor formally arranged. Although the group does follow a set routine (modeled on the [[Milford Writer's Workshop|Milford]] Method, wherein each person who has read the story gives their comments before the author's final \"right of reply\" at the end of the session), the meetings are democratic in nature. The Circle does not engage in creative writing exercises: each meeting focuses specifically on the constructive criticism of an individual work, be it a short story, novella, or novel that has previously been distributed by email or via the Circle's newsgroup. This said, many members of the Circle do also regularly socialise with each other outside of these official meetings.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":0\"/>{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn late 2009, some members of the Circle established a spoken word performance group called Word Dogs. This ran irregular events in and around Glasgow, such as a special horror-themed evening around Halloween 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title = http://ttapress.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1819|website = TTA}}</ref>\n\n== Other groups ==\nDuring its history the Circle has seldom interacted with other writers groups in and around Glasgow, thanks to its focused working practices and \u2013 arguably \u2013 its championing of genre fiction. As a result, probably its closest links have been with members of the East Coast SF Writers Group (ECSFWG). This group shared a common origin, having originally been formed as a gathering of some east coast-based entrants to the same ''Glasgow Herald'' Science Fiction Short Story Competition.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nA more recent offshoot from ECSFWG is the Writers' Bloc spoken word group, with whom members of the Circle have performed in special joint events.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Published works==\nSince its inception, the circle has sponsored, or otherwise caused to be written, a number of anthologies. These are comprised of original works, most often short stories, by its members. The books typically commemorate an occasion, but the most recent was published to raise money for a charitable cause. \n\n*  '''''Shipbuilding: New SF from Scotland''''' Published for the 53rd World Science Fiction Convention in Glasgow.\n*  '''''Thirty Years of Rain''''' (ISBN: 9781326753429) To celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Glasgow Sf Writers' Circle.\n*  '''''Flotation Device: A Charity Anthology''''' To support charities fighting COVID-19/coronavirus.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gsfwc.co.uk Group website]\n\n[[Category:Scottish literature]]\n[[Category:Science fiction organizations]]\n[[Category:British writers' organisations]]\n[[Category:Writing circles]]\n[[Category:Speculative fiction writing circles]]\n[[Category:Arts organizations established in 1987]]\n[[Category:Members of the Glasgow Science Fiction Writers' Circle| ]]\n[[Category:Scottish science fiction]]\n[[Category:1987 establishments in Scotland]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=June 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{one source|date=November 2009}}\n[[File:GSFWC.jpg|thumb]]\nThe '''Glasgow Science Fiction Writers\u2019 Circle''' (GSFWC, aka \"The Circle\") is a group of amateur, semi-professional, and professional fiction authors that has met regularly in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] since 1987.<ref name=\"Taverna Press\">{{cite book | last = Anon (ed.) | authorlink = | title = Shipbuilding | publisher = Taverna Press | year = 1995 | location = Glasgow | pages = 156 | url = | doi = | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nThe purpose of the Circle is to provide a supportive, non-confrontational setting in which an individual's work can be reviewed, critiqued, and discussed.

Venues have included [[St Aloysius Church, Glasgow|St Aloysius Church]], the [[Glasgow Film Theatre]], the city's branch of Border's bookshop, and a smaller function room of a Glasgow church.<ref>{{Cite web|title = GSFWC FAQ|url = https://gsfwc.wordpress.com/gsfwc-faq/|website = Glasgow SF Writers' Circle|accessdate = 27 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}} \nThe Circle's workshops are neither instructor-led nor formally arranged. Although the group does follow a set routine (modeled on the [[Milford Writer's Workshop|Milford]] Method, wherein each person who has read the story gives their comments before the author's final \"right of reply\" at the end of the session), the meetings are democratic in nature. The Circle does not engage in creative writing exercises: each meeting focuses specifically on the constructive criticism of an individual work, be it a short story, novella, or novel that has previously been distributed by email or via the Circle's newsgroup. This said, many members of the Circle do also regularly socialise with each other outside of these official meetings.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":0\"/>{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn late 2009, some members of the Circle established a spoken word performance group called Word Dogs. This ran irregular events in and around Glasgow, such as a special horror-themed evening around Halloween 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title = http://ttapress.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1819|website = TTA}}</ref>\n\n== Other groups ==\nDuring its history the Circle has seldom interacted with other writers groups in and around Glasgow, thanks to its focused working practices and \u2013 arguably \u2013 its championing of genre fiction. As a result, probably its closest links have been with members of the East Coast SF Writers Group (ECSFWG). This group shared a common origin, having originally been formed as a gathering of some east coast-based entrants to the same ''Glasgow Herald'' Science Fiction Short Story Competition.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nA more recent offshoot from ECSFWG is the Writers' Bloc spoken word group, with whom members of the Circle have performed in special joint events.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Published works==\nSince its inception, the circle has sponsored, or otherwise caused to be written, a number of anthologies. These are comprised of original works, most often short stories, by its members. The books typically commemorate an occasion, but the most recent was published to raise money for a charitable cause. \n\n*  ''Shipbuilding: New SF from Scotland'' <i>Published for the 53rd World Science Fiction Convention in Glasgow.</i>\n*  ''Thirty Years of Rain'' (ISBN: 9781326753429) <i>To celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Glasgow Sf Writers' Circle.</i>\n*  ''Flotation Device: A Charity Anthology'' <i>To support charities fighting COVID-19/coronavirus.</i>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gsfwc.co.uk Group website]\n\n[[Category:Scottish literature]]\n[[Category:Science fiction organizations]]\n[[Category:British writers' organisations]]\n[[Category:Writing circles]]\n[[Category:Speculative fiction writing circles]]\n[[Category:Arts organizations established in 1987]]\n[[Category:Members of the Glasgow Science Fiction Writers' Circle| ]]\n[[Category:Scottish science fiction]]\n[[Category:1987 establishments in Scotland]]\n", "name_user": "DanQuigley", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePublished works:Removed italics around purposes and bolded titles instead; for differentiation.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Science_Fiction_Writers%27_Circle"}

The [[river dolphin|other five species]], including the [[boto]] and the [[La Plata dolphin]], have survived in the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] and [[Amazon river|Amazon]] rivers in South America and the [[Ganges]] and [[Indus]] rivers on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIt is estimated that there were 5,000 baiji when they were described in the ancient dictionary ''[[Erya]]'' circa 3rd century BC.\n\nIt is well known the river dolphins are not a natural group. Their mitochondrial genome reveals a split of two separate lineages, ''Platanista'' and ''Lipotes'' + (''Inia'' + ''Pontoporia''), having no sister relationship with each other, and the ''Platanista'' lineage is always within the odontocete clade instead of having a closer affinity to Mysticeti. The position of the ''Platanista'' is more basal, suggesting separate divergence of this lineage well before the other one. The ''Lipotes'' has a sister relationship with ''Inia + pontoporia'', and they together formed the sister group to the Delphinoidea. This result strongly supports paraphyly of the classical river dolphins, and the nonplatanistoid river dolphins do represent a monophyletic grouping, with the Lipotidae as the sister taxa to (Iniidae + Pontoporiidae), and is well congruent with the studies based\non short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yan | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = K. | last3 = Gaung | first3 = Y. | year = 2005 | title = Molecular phylogenetics of 'river dolphins' and the baiji mitochondrial genome | url = | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 743\u2013750 | doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.06.009| pmid = 16046150}}</ref>\n\nLow values of haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were found for the baiji of the Yangtze River. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) supported a high level of overall genetic structure.

Comparative genopic analyses have uncovered that the baiji have a slow molecular clock and molecular adaptations to their aquatic environment. This information leads scientists to conclude that a bottleneck must have occurred near the end of the last deglaciation, a time that coincided with rapid temperature decrease and a rise in eustatic sea level. Scientists have also looked into PSGs in the baiji genome which are used for DNA repair and response to DNA stimulus. These PSGs have not been found previously in any other mammal species. Pathways being used for DNA repair have been known to have a major impact on brain development and have been implicated in diseases including [[microcephaly]]. The slow down of the substitution rate among cetaceans may have been affected by the evolution of DNA damage pathways. Over time, river dolphins, including the baiji, have had a reduction in the size of their eyes and the acuity of their vision. This probably stems from poor visibility in fluvial and estuarine environments. When analyzing the baiji genome, scientists have found that there are four genes that have lost their function due to a frameshift mutation or premature stop codons. The baiji has the lowest single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency reported thus far among mammals. This low frequency could be related to the relatively low rate of molecular evolution in cetaceans; however, considering that the decrease in the rate of molecular evolution in the baiji was not as great as the decrease in heterozygosity rate, it is likely that much of the low genetic diversity observed was caused by the precipitous decline in the total baiji population in recent decades and the associated breedings.<ref name=\"Zhou\">{{Cite journal|title = Baiji genomes reveal low genetic variability and new insights into secondary aquatic adaptations|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2013-10-29|pmc = 3826649|pmid = 24169659|volume = 4|pages = 2708|doi = 10.1038/ncomms3708|first = Xuming|last = Zhou|first2 = Fengming|last2 = Sun|first3 = Shixia|last3 = Xu|first4 = Guangyi|last4 = Fan|first5 = Kangli|last5 = Zhu|first6 = Xin|last6 = Liu|first7 = Yuan|last7 = Chen|first8 = Chengcheng|last8 = Shi|first9 = Yunxia|last9 = Yang|bibcode = 2013NatCo...4.2708Z}}</ref>\n\nThe reconstructed demographic history over the last 100,000 years featured a continual population contraction through the last glacial maximum, a serious bottleneck during the last deglaciation, and sustained population growth after the eustatic sea level approached the current levels. The close correlation between population trends, regional temperatures, and eustatic sea levels suggest a dominant role for global and local climate changes in shaping the baiji's ancient population demography.<ref name=\"Zhou\"/>\n\n== Folklore ==\nPer Chinese folklore, a beautiful young girl is said to have lived with her stepfather on the banks of the river Yangtze. He was evil, and a greedy man out for his own self-interest. One day, he took the girl on a boat, intending to sell her on the market. Out on the river, though, he became infatuated with her beauty and tried to take advantage of her. But she freed herself by plunging into the river whereupon a big storm came and sank the boat.

However, the primary factor was probably unsustainable by-catch in local fisheries, which use rolling hooks, nets ([[gill nets]] and [[fyke]] nets) and [[electrofishing]]; similarly by-catch constitutes the principal cause of mortality in many populations of small cetaceans worldwide. Although there are relatively few data available on baiji mortality, at least half of all known baiji deaths in the 1970s and 1980s were caused by rolling hooks and other fishing gear, and electrofishing accounted for 40% of baiji deaths recorded during the 1990s. Unlike most historical-era extinctions of large-bodied animals, the baiji was\nthe victim not of active persecution but of incidental mortality resulting from massive-scale human environmental impacts, primarily uncontrolled fishing.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Turvey, S.T. |author2=Rovbert, P.L. |author3=Taylor, B.L. |author4=Barlow, J. |author5=Akamatsu, T. |author6=Barrett, L.A. |author7=Zhao, X. |author8=Reeves, R.

In the 1970s and 1980s, an estimated half of baiji deaths were attributed to [[bycatch|entanglement]] in fishing gear and nets. By the early 2000s, electric fishing was considered \"the most important and immediate direct threat to the baiji's survival\".<ref name=\"iucn\" /> Though outlawed, this fishing technique is widely and illegally practiced throughout China. The building of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] further reduced the dolphin's habitat and facilitated an increase in ship traffic; these were thought to make it extinct in the wild.\n\nThere are some scientists who have found that pollution has resulted in emerging diseases caused by parasitic infection in the Baiji population. The Baiji's reliance on aquatic environments could have resulted in interaction with both terrestrial and marine pathogen risks. Since the Baiji has a limited distribution endemic to the Yangtze River, the freshwater environment may have a higher pathogen level than marine waters (although systematic environmental studies have yet to be conducted). The pathogens in these waters could lead to viral infections that can result in [[epizootic]]s, which has caused the deaths of thousands of marine mammals over the last twenty years. There have also been captured/killed individuals that have had [[Helminthiasis|helminth]] infestations in the stomach which leads scientists to believe that parasitic infections could be another cause of decline amongst the Baiji.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = S | last2 = Ju | first2 = J | last3 = Zhou | first3 = X | last4 = Wang | first4 = L | last5 = Zhou | first5 = K | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Considerable MHC Diversity Suggests That the Functional Extinction of Baiji Is Not Related to Population Genetic Collapse | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 1| page = e30423 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0030423 | pmid=22272349 | pmc=3260281| bibcode = 2012PLoSO...730423X }}</ref>\n\nIt has been noted, however, that the declining geographical range that baiji have been spotted in is not connected to the population loss of baiji.

The government outlawed deliberate killing, restricted fishing, and established nature reserves.\n\nIn 1978, the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] established the Freshwater Dolphin Research Centre (\u6de1\u6c34\u6d77\u8c5a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3) as a branch of the [[Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, several attempts were made to capture dolphins and relocate them to a reserve. A breeding program would then allow the species to recover and be reintroduced to the Yangtze after conditions improve. However, capturing the rare, quick dolphins proved to be difficult, and few captives survived more than a few months.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nThe first Chinese aquatic species protection organisation, the Baiji Dolphin Conservation Foundation of [[Wuhan]] (\u6b66\u6c49\u767d\u9c40\u8c5a\u4fdd\u62a4\u57fa\u91d1), was founded in December 1996. It has raised 1,383,924.35 [[Renminbi|CNY]] (about {{US$|link=yes}}100,000) and used the funds for [[in vitro]] cell preservation and to maintain the baiji facilities, including the Shishou Sanctuary that was flooded in 1998.\n\n[[Image:Baiji conservation efforts map.png|thumb|right|350px|Conservation efforts of the baiji along the Yangtze River]]\nSince 1992, five protected areas of the Yangtze have been designated as baiji reserves. Four were built in the main Yangtze channel where baiji are actively protected and fishing is banned: two national reserves ([[Shishou|Shishou City]] and Xin-Luo) and two provincial ([[Tongling]] and [[Zhenjiang]]). In the past 20 years, five nature reserves have been\nestablished along the river. Imposing maximum prohibition of harmful and\nillegal fishing methods in the reserves might prolong the process of extinction\nof these cetaceans in the wild, but so far, the administrative measures taken\nin the reserves have not yet kept the baiji population from sharply declining. As humans continue to occupy the river and use the natural resources it provided, the question as to whether the river itself can reach a point later in the future to become a habitat for these species to live in once again remained, for the most part, unanswered by conservationists. In Shishou, Hubei Province, and Tongling, Anhui Province, the two semi-natural reserves established in these regions aimed to build in an environment for the baiji, as well as another mammalian species, the [[finless porpoise]], to breed. Through careful management, both these species not only survived, but did in fact reproduce successfully enough to\nprovide some hope that the Baiji may be able to make a comeback.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = K. | last2 = Wang | first2 = D. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = X. | last4 = Pfluger | first4 = A. | last5 = Barrett | first5 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Range-wide Yangtze freshwater dolphin expedition: The last chance to see Baiji''?'' | url = http://ir.ihb.ac.cn/handle/152342/8782| journal = Environmental Science and Pollution Research | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 418\u2013424 | doi=10.1065/espr2006.10.350| pmid = 17120833 }}</ref>\n\nThe fifth protected area is an isolated [[oxbow lake]] located off of the north bank of the river near to Shishou City: the [[Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve|Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Semi-natural Reserve]].

This plan re-emphasised the three measures identified at the 1986 workshop and was adopted as the national policy for the conservation of the Baiji. Despite all of these workshops and conventions little money was available in China to aid the conservation efforts.

The deterioration of the Yangtze River had to be reversed to preserve the habitat. The ex-situ projects aimed to raise a large enough population over time so that some, if not all, of the dolphins could be returned to the Yangtze, so the habitat within the river had to be maintained anyway.\n\n====Ex-situ conservation====\nThe Shishou Tian-e-Zhou is a {{convert|21|km|mi|adj=on}} long, {{convert|2|km|mi|adj=on}} wide [[oxbow lake]] located near Shishou City in Hubei Province. Shishou has been described as being \"like a miniature Yangtze&nbsp;... possessing all of the requirements for a semi-natural reserve\". From the designation as a national reserve in 1992 it has been intended to be used for not only the baiji but also the Yangtze [[finless porpoise]]. In 1990 the first finless porpoises were relocated to the reserve and since then have been surviving and reproducing well. As of April 2005 26 finless porpoises were known to live in the reserve. A baiji was introduced in December 1995, but died during the summer flood of 1996. To deal with these annual floods a dyke was constructed between the Yangtze and Shishou. Now water is controlled from a sluice gate located at the downstream mouth of the oxbow lake. It has been reported that since the installation of this sluice gate, water quality has declined since no annual transfer of nutrients can occur. Roughly 6,700 people live on the island within the oxbow lake and so some limited fishing is permitted.<ref name=workshop/>\n\nThe success of Shishou with the porpoises and with migratory birds and other wetland fauna encouraged the local Wetlands Management Team to put forward an application to award the site [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baiji.org/initiatives/ecotourism-tian-e-zhou.html |title=Responsible Ecotourism at Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve |publisher=baiji.org |accessdate=December 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617043837/http://www.baiji.org/initiatives/ecotourism-tian-e-zhou.html |archivedate=June 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> It has also been noted that the site has incredible potential for ecotourism, which could be used to generate much needed revenue to improve the quality of the reserve. The necessary infrastructure does not currently exist to realize these opportunities.\n\n====Captive specimens====\nA baiji conservation [[dolphinarium]] was established at the Institute of Hydrobiology (IHB) in Wuhan in 1992. This was planned as a backup to any other conservation efforts by producing an area completely protected from any threats, and where the baiji could be easily observed. The site includes an indoor and outdoor holding pool, a water filtration system, food storage and preparation facilities, research labs and a small museum. The aim is to also generate income from tourism which can be put towards the baiji plight. The pools are not very large ({{convert|25|m}} arc [kidney shaped] &times; {{convert|7|m}} wide &times; {{convert|3.5|m}} deep, {{convert|10|m}} diameter, {{convert|2|m}} deep and {{convert|12|m}} diameter, {{convert|3.5|m}} deep) and so are not capable of holding many baijis at one time.\n\n[[Douglas Adams]] and [[Mark Carwardine]] documented their encounters with the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme ''[[Last Chance to See]]''. Through firsthand experience, they went to China, drinking Baiji beer and Baiji cola, staying in the Baiji Hotel and using Lipotes vexillifer toilet paper. They came across Baiji weighing scales and Baiji fertilizer. They met Qi Qi, the beautiful bluish-grey dolphin with a long, narrow, slightly upturned beak, a low triangular dorsal fin, broad flippers with tiny eyes. Qi-Qi was just a year old then, injured by fishing hooks in 1980 and taken into captivity to be nursed back to health. Out of the seven times Mark and Douglas had visited China, never did they encounter a wild and free Yangtze river dolphin. It is even more impossible now with the likelihood that Lipotes vexillfer may be the first cetacean to have been driven to extinction by human activity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carwardine | first1 = M | year = 2007 | title = The baiji: So long and thanks for all the fish | url = | journal = New Scientist | volume = 195 | issue = 2621| pages = 50\u201353 | doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(07)62350-1}}</ref> The book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (\u6dc7\u6dc7) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology [[dolphinarium]] from 1980 to July 14, 2002.

The [[river dolphin|other five species]], including the [[boto]] and the [[La Plata dolphin]], have survived in the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] and [[Amazon river|Amazon]] rivers in South America and the [[Ganges]] and [[Indus]] rivers on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIt is estimated that there were 5,000 baiji when they were described in the ancient dictionary ''[[Erya]]'' circa 3rd century BC.\n\nIt is well known the river dolphins are not a natural group. Their mitochondrial genome reveals a split of two separate lineages, ''Platanista'' and ''Lipotes'' + (''Inia'' + ''Pontoporia''), having no sister relationship with each other, and the ''Platanista'' lineage is always within the odontocete clade instead of having a closer affinity to Mysticeti. The position of the ''Platanista'' is more basal, suggesting separate divergence of this lineage well before the other one. The ''Lipotes'' has a sister relationship with ''Inia + pontoporia'', and they together formed the sister group to the Delphinoidea. This result strongly supports paraphyly of the classical river dolphins, and the nonplatanistoid river dolphins do represent a monophyletic grouping, with the Lipotidae as the sister taxa to (Iniidae + Pontoporiidae), and is well congruent with the studies based\non short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yan | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = K. | last3 = Gaung | first3 = Y. | year = 2005 | title = Molecular phylogenetics of 'river dolphins' and the baiji mitochondrial genome | url = | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 743\u2013750 | doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.06.009| pmid = 16046150}}</ref>\n\nLow values of haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were found for the baiji of the Yangtze River.

Comparative genopic analyses have uncovered that the baiji have a slow molecular clock and molecular adaptations to their aquatic environment. This information leads scientists to conclude that a bottleneck must have occurred near the end of the last deglaciation, a time that coincided with rapid temperature decrease and a rise in eustatic sea level. Scientists have also looked into PSGs in the baiji genome which are used for DNA repair and response to DNA stimulus. These PSGs have not been found previously in any other mammal species. Pathways being used for DNA repair have been known to have a major impact on brain development and have been implicated in diseases including [[microcephaly]]. The slow down of the substitution rate among cetaceans may have been affected by the evolution of DNA damage pathways. Over time, river dolphins, including the baiji, have had a reduction in the size of their eyes and the acuity of their vision. This probably stems from poor visibility in fluvial and estuarine environments. When analyzing the baiji genome, scientists have found that there are four genes that have lost their function due to a frameshift mutation or premature stop codons. The baiji has the lowest single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency reported thus far among mammals. This low frequency could be related to the relatively low rate of molecular evolution in cetaceans; however, considering that the decrease in the rate of molecular evolution in the baiji was not as great as the decrease in heterozygosity rate, it is likely that much of the low genetic diversity observed was caused by the precipitous decline in the total baiji population in recent decades and the associated breedings.<ref name=\"Zhou\">{{Cite journal|title = Baiji genomes reveal low genetic variability and new insights into secondary aquatic adaptations|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2013-10-29|pmc = 3826649|pmid = 24169659|volume = 4|pages = 2708|doi = 10.1038/ncomms3708|first = Xuming|last = Zhou|first2 = Fengming|last2 = Sun|first3 = Shixia|last3 = Xu|first4 = Guangyi|last4 = Fan|first5 = Kangli|last5 = Zhu|first6 = Xin|last6 = Liu|first7 = Yuan|last7 = Chen|first8 = Chengcheng|last8 = Shi|first9 = Yunxia|last9 = Yang|bibcode = 2013NatCo...4.2708Z}}</ref>\n\nThe reconstructed demographic history over the last 100,000 years featured a continual population contraction through the last glacial maximum, a serious bottleneck during the last deglaciation, and sustained population growth after the eustatic sea level approached the current levels. The close correlation between population trends, regional temperatures, and eustatic sea levels suggest a dominant role for global and local climate changes in shaping the baiji's ancient population demography.<ref name=\"Zhou\"/>\n\n== Folklore ==\nPer Chinese folklore, a beautiful young girl is said to have lived with her stepfather on the banks of the river Yangtze.

However, the primary factor was probably unsustainable by-catch in local fisheries, which use rolling hooks, nets ([[gill nets]] and [[fyke]] nets) and [[electrofishing]]; similarly by-catch constitutes the principal cause of mortality in many populations of small cetaceans worldwide. Although there are relatively few data available on baiji mortality, at least half of all known baiji deaths in the 1970s and 1980s were caused by rolling hooks and other fishing gear, and electrofishing accounted for 40% of baiji deaths recorded during the 1990s. Unlike most historical-era extinctions of large-bodied animals, the baiji was\nthe victim not of active persecution but of incidental mortality resulting from massive-scale human environmental impacts, primarily uncontrolled fishing.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Turvey, S.T. |author2=Rovbert, P.L. |author3=Taylor, B.L. |author4=Barlow, J. |author5=Akamatsu, T. |author6=Barrett, L.A. |author7=Zhao, X. |author8=Reeves, R.

In the 1970s and 1980s, an estimated half of baiji deaths were attributed to [[bycatch|entanglement]] in fishing gear and nets. By the early 2000s, electric fishing was considered \"the most important and immediate direct threat to the baiji's survival\".<ref name=\"iucn\" /> Though outlawed, this fishing technique is widely and illegally practiced throughout China. The building of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] further reduced the dolphin's habitat and facilitated an increase in ship traffic; these were thought to make it extinct in the wild.\n\nThere are some scientists who have found that pollution has resulted in emerging diseases caused by parasitic infection in the Baiji population. The Baiji's reliance on aquatic environments could have resulted in interaction with both terrestrial and marine pathogen risks. Since the Baiji has a limited distribution endemic to the Yangtze River, the freshwater environment may have a higher pathogen level than marine waters (although systematic environmental studies have yet to be conducted). The pathogens in these waters could lead to viral infections that can result in [[epizootic]]s, which has caused the deaths of thousands of marine mammals over the last twenty years. There have also been captured/killed individuals that have had [[Helminthiasis|helminth]] infestations in the stomach which leads scientists to believe that parasitic infections could be another cause of decline amongst the Baiji.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = S | last2 = Ju | first2 = J | last3 = Zhou | first3 = X | last4 = Wang | first4 = L | last5 = Zhou | first5 = K | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Considerable MHC Diversity Suggests That the Functional Extinction of Baiji Is Not Related to Population Genetic Collapse | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 1| page = e30423 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0030423 | pmid=22272349 | pmc=3260281| bibcode = 2012PLoSO...730423X }}</ref>\n\nIt has been noted, however, that the declining geographical range that baiji have been spotted in is not connected to the population loss of baiji.

The government outlawed deliberate killing, restricted fishing, and established nature reserves.\n\nIn 1978, the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] established the Freshwater Dolphin Research Centre (\u6de1\u6c34\u6d77\u8c5a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3) as a branch of the [[Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, several attempts were made to capture dolphins and relocate them to a reserve. A breeding program would then allow the species to recover and be reintroduced to the Yangtze after conditions improve. However, capturing the rare, quick dolphins proved to be difficult, and few captives survived more than a few months.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nThe first Chinese aquatic species protection organisation, the Baiji Dolphin Conservation Foundation of [[Wuhan]] (\u6b66\u6c49\u767d\u9c40\u8c5a\u4fdd\u62a4\u57fa\u91d1), was founded in December 1996. It has raised 1,383,924.35 [[Renminbi|CNY]] (about {{US$|link=yes}}100,000) and used the funds for [[in vitro]] cell preservation and to maintain the baiji facilities, including the Shishou Sanctuary that was flooded in 1998.\n\n[[Image:Baiji conservation efforts map.png|thumb|right|350px|Conservation efforts of the baiji along the Yangtze River]]\nSince 1992, five protected areas of the Yangtze have been designated as baiji reserves. Four were built in the main Yangtze channel where baiji are actively protected and fishing is banned: two national reserves ([[Shishou|Shishou City]] and Xin-Luo) and two provincial ([[Tongling]] and [[Zhenjiang]]). In the past 20 years, five nature reserves have been\nestablished along the river. Imposing maximum prohibition of harmful and\nillegal fishing methods in the reserves might prolong the process of extinction\nof these cetaceans in the wild, but so far, the administrative measures taken\nin the reserves have not yet kept the baiji population from sharply declining. As humans continue to occupy the river and use the natural resources it provided, the question as to whether the river itself can reach a point later in the future to become a habitat for these species to live in once again remained, for the most part, unanswered by conservationists. In Shishou, Hubei Province, and Tongling, Anhui Province, the two semi-natural reserves established in these regions aimed to build in an environment for the baiji, as well as another mammalian species, the [[finless porpoise]], to breed. Through careful management, both these species not only survived, but did in fact reproduce successfully enough to\nprovide some hope that the Baiji may be able to make a comeback.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = K. | last2 = Wang | first2 = D. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = X. | last4 = Pfluger | first4 = A. | last5 = Barrett | first5 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Range-wide Yangtze freshwater dolphin expedition: The last chance to see Baiji''?'' | url = http://ir.ihb.ac.cn/handle/152342/8782| journal = Environmental Science and Pollution Research | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 418\u2013424 | doi=10.1065/espr2006.10.350| pmid = 17120833 }}</ref>\n\nThe fifth protected area is an isolated [[oxbow lake]] located off of the north bank of the river near to Shishou City: the [[Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve|Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Semi-natural Reserve]]. Combined, these five reserves cover just over {{convert|350|km|mi}}, about {{frac|1|3}} of the baijis range, leaving two-thirds of the species' habitat unprotected.<ref name=\"workshop\" />\n\nAs well as these five protected areas there are also five \"Protection Stations\" in Jianli, Chenglingji, Hukou, Wuhu and Zhengjiang. These stations consist of two observers and a motorized fishing boat with the aim of conducting daily patrols, making observations and investigating reports of illegal fishing.<ref name=workshop/>\n\nIn 2001, the Chinese government approved a Conservation Action Plan for Cetaceans of the Yangtze River. This plan re-emphasised the three measures identified at the 1986 workshop and was adopted as the national policy for the conservation of the Baiji. Despite all of these workshops and conventions little money was available in China to aid the conservation efforts. It has been estimated that US$1 million was needed to begin the project and maintain it for a further 3 years.<ref name=ZSL>{{cite web|url=http://baiji.org/fileadmin/pdf/EmergencyBaijiImplementationMeetingreport.pdf |title=Conservation of the Yangtze River Dolphin: Emergency Implementation Meeting |accessdate=December 30, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619235441/http://baiji.org/fileadmin/pdf/EmergencyBaijiImplementationMeetingreport.pdf |archivedate=June 19, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nEfforts to save the mammals proved to be too little and too late.

The deterioration of the Yangtze River had to be reversed to preserve the habitat. The ex-situ projects aimed to raise a large enough population over time so that some, if not all, of the dolphins could be returned to the Yangtze, so the habitat within the river had to be maintained anyway.\n\n====Ex-situ conservation====\nThe Shishou Tian-e-Zhou is a {{convert|21|km|mi|adj=on}} long, {{convert|2|km|mi|adj=on}} wide [[oxbow lake]] located near Shishou City in Hubei Province. Shishou has been described as being \"like a miniature Yangtze&nbsp;... possessing all of the requirements for a semi-natural reserve\". From the designation as a national reserve in 1992 it has been intended to be used for not only the baiji but also the Yangtze [[finless porpoise]]. In 1990 the first finless porpoises were relocated to the reserve and since then have been surviving and reproducing well. As of April 2005 26 finless porpoises were known to live in the reserve. A baiji was introduced in December 1995, but died during the summer flood of 1996. To deal with these annual floods a dyke was constructed between the Yangtze and Shishou. Now water is controlled from a sluice gate located at the downstream mouth of the oxbow lake. It has been reported that since the installation of this sluice gate, water quality has declined since no annual transfer of nutrients can occur. Roughly 6,700 people live on the island within the oxbow lake and so some limited fishing is permitted.<ref name=workshop/>\n\nThe success of Shishou with the porpoises and with migratory birds and other wetland fauna encouraged the local Wetlands Management Team to put forward an application to award the site [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baiji.org/initiatives/ecotourism-tian-e-zhou.html |title=Responsible Ecotourism at Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve |publisher=baiji.org |accessdate=December 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617043837/http://www.baiji.org/initiatives/ecotourism-tian-e-zhou.html |archivedate=June 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> It has also been noted that the site has incredible potential for ecotourism, which could be used to generate much needed revenue to improve the quality of the reserve. The necessary infrastructure does not currently exist to realize these opportunities.\n\n====Captive specimens====\nA baiji conservation [[dolphinarium]] was established at the Institute of Hydrobiology (IHB) in Wuhan in 1992. This was planned as a backup to any other conservation efforts by producing an area completely protected from any threats, and where the baiji could be easily observed. The site includes an indoor and outdoor holding pool, a water filtration system, food storage and preparation facilities, research labs and a small museum. The aim is to also generate income from tourism which can be put towards the baiji plight. The pools are not very large ({{convert|25|m}} arc [kidney shaped] &times; {{convert|7|m}} wide &times; {{convert|3.5|m}} deep, {{convert|10|m}} diameter, {{convert|2|m}} deep and {{convert|12|m}} diameter, {{convert|3.5|m}} deep) and so are not capable of holding many baijis at one time.\n\n[[Douglas Adams]] and [[Mark Carwardine]] documented their encounters with the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme ''[[Last Chance to See]]''. Through firsthand experience, they went to China, drinking Baiji beer and Baiji cola, staying in the Baiji Hotel and using Lipotes vexillifer toilet paper. They came across Baiji weighing scales and Baiji fertilizer. They met Qi Qi, the beautiful bluish-grey dolphin with a long, narrow, slightly upturned beak, a low triangular dorsal fin, broad flippers with tiny eyes. Qi-Qi was just a year old then, injured by fishing hooks in 1980 and taken into captivity to be nursed back to health. Out of the seven times Mark and Douglas had visited China, never did they encounter a wild and free Yangtze river dolphin. It is even more impossible now with the likelihood that Lipotes vexillfer may be the first cetacean to have been driven to extinction by human activity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carwardine | first1 = M | year = 2007 | title = The baiji: So long and thanks for all the fish | url = | journal = New Scientist | volume = 195 | issue = 2621| pages = 50\u201353 | doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(07)62350-1}}</ref> The book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (\u6dc7\u6dc7) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology [[dolphinarium]] from 1980 to July 14, 2002.

His father had served in the 1st Battalion, [[East Lancashire Regiment]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and was often away from home. Bremner travelled to [['s-Hertogenbosch]], the Dutch city liberated by the East Lancs, amongst other places to retrace his father's footsteps. Together with his brother, they traced their father's ancestry and discovered that their great-grandfather John Ogilvy had served as a \"[[Surgeon-General (United Kingdom)|surgeon general]]\" (equivalent of the present-day senior [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] medical officer) during the [[Crimean War]] and was later posted to various British colonies.<ref name=\"who\" />\n\n==Career==\nWhile studying at [[King's College London]], he worked on the [[cabaret]] circuit in the evenings and was also active in a student drama club.<ref>{{cite news|title=News & views \u2013 KCL Alumni Online: Rory Bremner|url=https://alumni.kcl.ac.uk/sslpage.aspx?pid=544|publisher=23 March 2010}}</ref> He first came into the limelight in 1985, when his single, \"N-N-Nineteen Not Out\" (released under the name of the Commentators) became a hit in the British charts.

Occasional one-off specials were also shown, with Bremner impersonating [[Tony Blair]], [[Gordon Brown]] and various other government figures.
