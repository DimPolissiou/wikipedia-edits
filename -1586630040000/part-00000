Lokomotiv's home ground is the homonymous [[Stadion Lokomotiv (Plovdiv)|Stadion Lokomotiv]] situated in the Lauta park of the city, with a capacity of 10,000 spectators.\n\nEstablished in 1926, in the [[2003\u201304 A Group|2003\u201304]] season of the A Group, Lokomotiv became champions of Bulgaria, finishing the season with three points more than the second-ranked, [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]]. Lokomotiv Plovdiv have also won [[2004 Bulgarian Supercup|one Bulgarian Supercup]], one Cup of the Soviet Army in [[1983 Cup of the Soviet Army Final|1983]] and most recently - one [[Bulgarian Cup]] in 2019. The club's biggest success in Europe is reaching the third round of the [[1964\u201365 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in 1965, after losing to the Italian [[Juventus F.C.]] in a play-off match.\n\n== History ==\nDescription of the club's history requires attention to the reorganisations that the team has undergone since its creation and how the members and fans of the team have reacted to these changes. The political environment in [[Bulgaria]] during the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|communist period]] between 1944-1989 has led to some forced changes in the nature of sporting clubs throughout the country as to follow \"the Soviet model\". In the case of PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv, these changes have led to the merger of two teams, that are different in nature, leading to misinterpretations of the history of the teams. This said, a special approach is needed towards the history of the early years of the contemporary football club of Lokomotiv Plovdiv. In order to understand the origin of the contemporary team with its official full name, colours, and supporters, the examination of Lokomotiv's history has to be undertaken in two major \"branches\" - one defined by its followers and recognisable features, and the other by its functional characteristic and funding as a labour union team. These branches can be defined as that of ''Sportclub Plovdiv'' (being the fan-based team), and of club of the railway workers (being the team funded by the union).\n\n===Roots of the Club (until 1944)===\n\n====Sportclub Plovdiv====\nIn the spring of 1922 the sport club ''Karadzha'' is founded administratively by the consolidation of some casual football teams in one of the districts of the city of [[Plovdiv]] so that the players can compete in the Championship of Plovdiv. Two years later, in 1924, the sport club ''Atletik'' is formed in the same district of Plovdiv as Karadzha.\n\nOn 26 July 1926 the two sport clubs from the same district, Karadzha and Atletik, unite to form the team of ''Sportclub''. The football club chooses white, black and red as the colours of their kits and their crest, and also the year of establishment 1926 is added several years later the crest. Nowadays, Lokomotiv Plovdiv still uses the same colours for their kits and crest, while the full name of the team (''Professional Football Club Lokomotiv 1926 Plovdiv'') shows that the year the club assumes itself to be established is the year Sportclub was founded.\n\nSportclub had its home grounds in the city centre. However, after the disastrous earthquake in South Bulgaria in 1928, the team donates their field to people who lost their homes so that they can build new ones where the club's grounds were. Because of that, from 1928 Sportclub did not have their own football field for more than two decades.\n\n[[File:Sportclub Plovdiv Kits.png|150px|thumb|left|Home and away kits of Sportclub Plovdiv (1939-40)]]\nAs a football team, in the years after Sportclub was created it competed in the Championship of Plovdiv. In the early years of Bulgarian football there is no national football league and championships held on a regional level throughout a calendar year are the most prestigious tournaments across the country. Sportclub participates in the second division of the Championship of Plovdiv until 1933 when the team finishes first in the second division and is promoted to Plovdiv's top tier as of 1934. In 1936 Sportclub becomes the Champion of Plovdiv for the first time.\n\nIn 1938 the team joined the [[Bulgarian A Football Group#History|National Football Division]] - the countrywide football league formed a year earlier that included Bulgaria's top ten teams. However, after only three seasons in 1940 the tournament is disbanded because of the Bulgaria's participation in [[World War II]] (WW2). By that time the club had changed its name to ''Plovdivski Sportclub'' (meaning Sportclub of Plovdiv) since several other teams in the country also had Sportclub in their name.\n\nDuring the years of WW2, the team participates in several other tournaments including the [[Bulgarian Cup#History|Tsar's Cup]] considered Bulgaria's most prestigious knock-out tournament at the time and a predecessor of the current domestic cup tournament. In the Tsar's Cup the team reaches the finals twice - in 1940 and in 1942.\n\nSince its establishment in 1926 up to the beginning of the communist rule in Bulgaria in 1944 Sportclub has become one of the best performing teams in the country with a constant participation in the final phases of the most prestigious tournaments. By 1944 the team is the biggest in the region of Plovdiv in terms of members, and has a dedicated following with its fans setting records for the period in attendance of football matches.\n\n====The Club of the Railway Workers in Plovdiv====\nIn the mid-1930s the labour union of the railway workers and sailors establishes several cultural and sporting organisations across the country. The railway workers established their sports club in Plovdiv as well, since the city is one of the major travel centres in the country. On 13 June 1935 the club ''ZSK Plovdiv'' was founded, abbreviated from ''Zheleznicharski Sporten Klub Plovdiv'' meaning ''the sporting club of the railway workers in Plovdiv''.\n\nThe first years of the team are difficult as its performance does not bring about such glory as some of the other teams of the city like Sportclub or [[Botev Plovdiv]]. The club is accepted as a member of the national sport federation a whole three years after its creation. Nevertheless, in the early 1940s the team betters their performance and in 1944 wins the Championship of Plovdiv.\n\nIn an economical aspect the railway club contributes heavily to the development of sports in the region of Plovdiv, making large inputs for the improvement of sporting conditions in the city. Most notably, the powerful national railway company through ZSK Plovdiv is the main benefactor for the creation of a state-of-the-art multi-purpose stadium in the city that opens in 1943. The stadium is constructed on the football pitches of the team of ''Levski Plovdiv'' and as such is the home grounds for both ZSK Plovdiv and Levski Plovdiv. As a result, the stadium is named \"ZSK-Levski\".\n\n===Creation of Lokomotiv (1944-1955)===\n\n====Changes in Sportclub====\n[[File:Slavia Plovdiv Crest.png|180px|thumb|right|The crest of Slavia Plovdiv]]In the years after 1944, the newly established communist rule embarks in several campaigns for \"reorganisation of the sporting clubs in Bulgaria\" so that they are aligned with the political agenda and follow the \"Soviet model\". This means that every area should have a sports club, but in order to make investments more efficient for a greater member-base only a few clubs are allowed per area. The result is a forceful merger of clubs and teams.\n\nThus, starting from 1944 Sportclub is merged with numerous sports teams in the same district of Plovdiv due to the \"reorganization\". Being from an area with a population comprised by a variety of ethnic and religious backgrounds, the club is first merged with several lower-division so-called \"Aremenian\", teams such as ''Shant'' and ''Erevan''. Another merger follows in 1945 with the \"Catholic\" club ''Parchevich''. After this wave of mergers, like many others in the country, the club is renamed to an abbreviation of the biggest clubs merged - the new name is \"S.P.-45\", meaning ''Sportclub Parchevich - 1945''. However, because of the \"Western\" phrasing (\"sport\" and \"club\" are non-Slavic words) the team is renamed again before the start of the season - the name of the club becomes ''\"Slavia\" Plovdiv''.\n\nIn 1947 a new wave of consolidations of the sport organisations in the country sees Slavia Plovdiv merge with the team of the cooperative workers  - ''Petar Chengelov''. The merger creates the club ''Slavia-Chengelov''.\n\nThrough all these mergers, the club originally named Sportclub keeps its colours and the core of its team, with only several players from the incorporated squads finding a place in the first team of the \"new\" club. As for the fans, the supporters of Sportclub remain loyal to the colours and the players, and the followers of the assimilated clubs join them, increasing even further the number of fans and members of the largest club in Plovdiv at that time. Though technically the clubs merge, because of the size of Sportclub in terms of members, the smaller clubs are assimilated into the black-white-and-red club.\n\nDuring the period 1944-1955, the club reaches the final of the domestic cup (at that time being the [[Bulgarian Cup#Cup of the Soviet Army (1945\u20131982)|Cup of the Soviet Army]]) for the third time in its history - in 1948 as Slavia-Chengelov. In [[1948\u201349 A PFG|season 1948]] the club was one of the ten founder teams of the new national top league - [[Bulgarian A Football Group#A Republican Football Group|\"A\" Republican Football Group (A RFG)]] - the predecessor of the current Bulgarian top division league .\n\n====Changes in ZSK====\nFor ZSK Plovdiv the \"reorganisation of sport clubs\" in line with the Soviet model begins in the autumn of 1944. The club is merged with the team with which it shares a stadium - Levski Plovdiv, forming ''ZSK-Levski'' in accordance with the trend. Still, unlike most other forced mergers at that time, the ZSK-Levski merger is dissolved in only a year.\n\nAfter the separation in 1945 ZSK is renamed to ''Lokomotiv (Plovdiv)'' similar to all other teams in the countries of the Eastern bloc connected in some way with the railways (such as [[Lokomotiv Sofia]], [[Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moskva]], [[Lokomotive Leipzig|Lokomotiv Leipzig]], etc.) and Lokomotiv and Levski continue to co-exist as separate entities sharing the same stadium.\n\nAlthough the club of the railway workers is financially backed by the solid national railway company, in the first years of the communist rule the football team competes merely on the third level of the recently formed national league. Furthermore, the club is the smallest in Plovdiv in terms of members and attracts a modest number of attendants for its games despite its state-of-the-art stadium.\n\n====Merger of Slaviya-Chengelov and Lokomotiv Plovdiv====\nIn the summer of 1949 the Bulgarian Communist Party adopts a new principal governing the construction of sports clubs. According to the new political agenda, clubs must serve as the fitness departments of the politically important enterprises (such as the oil refineries, the police, the army, the national railway company, and others). Thus, the location of a club is no longer important and clubs must be assigned to the major institutions in the country.\n\nThe reorganisations of 1949 assigns Lokomotiv to assimilate Slavia-Chengelov, since Lokomotiv is already a team associated with a significant enterprise. Yet, at that time Slavia-Chengelov is the largest club in Bulgaria in terms of members, with an even larger fan-base. Hence, the smallest club in Plovdiv (namely Lokomotiv) has to assimilate one of the most popular teams in the country.\n\nIn October 1949, the formal \"assimilation\" of Slavia into Lokomotiv takes place to form ''DSO Energiya'' before [[1950 A PFG|season 1950]]. The club uses the colours of Slaviya-Chengelov (white, red, and black) for both the kits and the crest of the football team, and the team itself retains only four players from Lokomotiv - the core remains the players of Slaviya-Chengelov. Nevertheless, after more than two decades after the earthquake in 1928 the fans of what-was-once Sportclub have home grounds - the stadium of Lokomotiv.\n\n''DSO'' is an abbreviation meaning ''national sports organisation''. However, just months after DSO Energiya is created changes in the names of clubs in the Soviet Union take place, inspiring the renaming of several clubs in Bulgaria. The popular at the time name for Eastern bloc sports clubs ''Torpedo'' is adapted for DSO Energiya - renamed ''Torpedo Plovdiv''.\n\nFor [[1950 A PFG|season 1950]] Torpedo Plovdiv takes the place of Slavia-Chengelov in the top level of the Bulgarian football league system (A RFG). Yet, during the season it becomes clear that the club will undergo some more changes because of the policy that as part of the railway union club members have to be entirely members of the union. This includes all the players of the football team as well as the members of the sport club in general - the large number of members of Slavia-Chengelov which have nothing to do with the railways. Thus, in 1951 before the [[1951 A PFG|new season]] begins, the railway union establishes a new club by the name of ''DSO Lokomotiv (Plovdiv)'' which will use the same colours for its football team as Torpedo and will play on the same stadium. The union also transfers all the players of Torpedo in DSO Lokomotiv and in order to make them official union members each player is ''de jure'' employed in the national railways. Meanwhile, Torpedo Plovdiv is taken out of the labour union and is no longer funded by it or the railway company. DSO Lokomotiv also acquires the license of Torpedo to play in the top tier of the Bulgarian football league, while Torpedo itself is relegated to the third division of the league due to the lack of license. By creating the new club and employing the team in the railways, the labour union effectively legitimises the club without the need to limit the access of members of Torpedo to the sports facilities. Members of Torpedo can still use the facilities which are shared between the two clubs and it is not necessary for them to be members of the railway union.\n\nFrom the start of [[1951 A PFG|season 1951]] the fans of the team of Torpedo Plovdiv in 1950 are supporting the same team with the same colours on the same grounds but named DSO Lokomotiv Plovdiv. As official membership in the club requires a job in the railways, the official number of members of the club are drastically smaller than the members of Torpedo in 1950. Nevertheless, the supporters of the team remain the same. Hence, in 1951 DSO Lokomotiv is the effective successor of Torpedo even though the club Torpedo continues to exist.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1954 the team is one of the best performers in the football elite, annually reaching at least the quarter-final phase of both the domestic cup competition (at that time recognised to be [[Bulgarian Cup#History|the Cup of the Soviet Army]]) and the top division league.\n\n===First Relegation from the Elite (1955-1960)===\nIn 1955 the team of DSO Lokomotiv is entirely changed - many key players are sold and the team seems to be unable to collaborate. In result, in [[1955 A PFG|season 1955]] DSO Lokomotiv is relegated to the second division of Bulgarian football. For the fans the next season would be the first time their team plays outside the most prestigious echelon of Bulgarian football.\n\nDSO Lokomotiv plays in second division for five seasons until it earns its promotion back to the elite for [[1961\u201362 A PFG|season 1961-62]]. In the same year, 1960, the team reaches [[Bulgarian Cup#Cup of the Soviet Army (1946-1982)|the final of the domestic cup]] for the fourth time in its history (after 1940 and 1942 as Sportclub, and 1948 as Slaviya-Chengelov) but for the fourth time - it lost.\n\nDuring its stay in the second division, the club experiences again the reorganisation of sports politics in the People's Republic of Bulgaria that took place in 1957. According to the changes, clubs no longer needed to be affiliated to enterprises and instead the emphasis turned back to the territorial principle. Thus, sport clubs no longer needed to be \"DSO\" (abbreviation meaning ''\"voluntary sports organisation\"'') inside the principal. Rather, as a club with many supporters in its area, DSO Lokomotiv assimilated the clubs Torpedo Plovdiv (with which it still shared a stadium) and ''Septemvri (Plovdiv)''. As the club no longer needed to be \"DSO\" it changed its name to ''\"Lokomotiv\" Plovdiv'''.\n\n===Success Home and Abroad (1960-1985)===\nAfter re-entering the elite (A RFG) in 1961, it takes Lokomotiv seven years to reach top 3 and get a medal in [[1968\u201369 A PFG|season 1968-69]].\n\nOn an international level however, the team achieves success much quicker. In season [[1964\u201365 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1964-65]], Lokomotiv Plovdiv reaches the Third Round of the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], where after two draws with the legendary team of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] with [[Omar S\u00edvori]], [[Luis del Sol]] and [[Sandro Salvadore]] in their squad (each ending with a score 1:1), a third play-off match is chosen by [[UEFA]] to be played in [[Torino]]. The game is lost by \"Loko\" with a score of 2:1. \n[[File:Hristo Bonev 1974.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The \u21168 shirt is retired in honour of [[Hristo Bonev]]]]\nBefore reaching the Third Round of the international football competition, the \"Smurfs\" have eliminated the Serbian [[FK Vojvodina]] and the Romanian [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u015fti]]. Key players during this period include forward [[Georgi Parvanov Vasilev|Gocho Vasilev]], midfielder [[Hristo Bonev]], defender [[Ivan Boyadzhiev]] and goalkeeper [[Stancho Bonchev]].\n\nIn 1971, the team reaches the final of the [[Bulgarian Cup#Cup of the Soviet Army (1946-1982)|domestic cup]] again and again lost it, this time to [[Levski Sofia]] with a score of 3:0.\n\nIn [[A PFG 1972\u201373|1973]], Lokomotiv wins the silver medals of A RFG, finishing the season with 43 points, 7 less than the first, [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]]. The following year, another celebration is in order - in [[1973\u201374 A Group|1974]] Lokomotiv finished the season in the third place getting the league bronze. In the following few years period the team is quite stable and it was very rarely standing under the 6th position in the league table. Among the team's players is [[Hristo Bonev]] - considered by most Loko fans as being the greatest player of the club ever, and one of the greatest Bulgarian players.\n\nWhen after [[1979\u201380 A PFG|season 1979-80]] Lokomotiv Plovdiv is again relegated to Bulgaria's second football division, it takes the team three seasons to earn its place back in the football elite.\n\nDespite being in second division between 1981 and 1983, ''Loko'' reaches the final of the Cup of the Soviet Army twice. In 1982 for the sixth time the team cannot win [[Bulgarian Cup#Cup of the Soviet Army (1946-1982)|the domestic cup]]. In 1983 however, led by [[Hristo Bonev]], Lokomotiv won their first national cup beating FC Chirpan 3:1 at [[Vasil Levski National Stadium]] in Sofia on 1 June. (Be that as it may, it is important to note that the tournament of the Cup of the Soviet Army, held annually between 1946-1990, is recognised by the [[Bulgarian Football Union]](BFU) as the domestic cup tournament up to 1982. In 1981, the tournament for the Bulgarian Cup begins to take place every year and rises in prestige, overtaking the significance of the Cup of the Soviet Army in sequent years. At present, the BFU's official statement is that it considers the [[Bulgarian Cup#Bulgarian Cup (1983-present)|Bulgarian Cup]] to represent the domestic cup from 1983 onwards. Thus, nowadays the Cup of the Soviet Army won in 1983 by Lokomotiv Plovdiv is the first officially non-recognised as the domestic cup Soviet Army trophy; i.e. ''Lokomotiv Plovdiv is not officially recognised as the bearer of the domestic cup for 1983 - it is a non-official bearer.'' Yet, at that time, the Soviet Army Cup was for all intents and purposes, is the domestic football cup trophy.)\n\nIn 1982 the team acquired a new stadium situated in park \"Lauta\" near the city's newest district. [[Lokomotiv Stadium (Plovdiv)|\"Lokomotiv\" Stadium]] is part of a sports complex used by the other teams of the sports club (such as the volleyball and the boxing teams of \"Lokomotiv\" Plovdiv.\nIn [[1983\u201384 A PFG|season 1983-84]], even though the club has just been promoted to the top division, and in defiance of being the Soviet Army Cup holder, Loko Plovdiv relegates itself again and plays season 1984-85 in the lower level of the Bulgarian league system. In 1985 the team earns it promotion back to A RFG.\n\n===1985-2000===\nAfter its return to the top division in 1985 the team makes a steady performance for over a decade, placing itself in the middle of the league table until the late 1990s. During that time the team finishes in top 3 only once - in [[1991\u201392 A PFG|season 1991-92]].\n\nIn the late 1990s the form of the team worsens which takes them out of the elite again, and in seasons 1998-99 and 1999-00 Lokomotiv Plovdiv plays in [[B PFG]].\n\n===Georgi Iliev Years (2000-2004)===\nIn 2001 the club is bought by Georgi Iliev. At that time, Iliev owns another football club  - [[PFC Velbazhd Kyustendil|Velbazhd Kyustendil]]. The team from Kyustendil has a very good performance in the Bulgarian top division (A PFG) finishing in third place three consecutive seasons until 2000-01 and is a national cup runner-up in 2001.\n\nIn season 2001-02 Iliev decides to merge the two teams creating the contemporary Lokomotiv Plovdiv (full name: Professional Football Club Lokomotiv 1926 Plovdiv). The new club is based in the grounds of the Lokomotiv that merged with Velbazhd, uses the same colours and is the official successor of that club. Yet, the team was formed almost entirely of the players performing excellently in the last years in the club from Kyustendil. As a result, that team finished third again at the end of the season.\n\nThe most successful season in the club's history was the 2003-04 campaign. Lokomotiv won the [[A PFG 2003\u201304|title]], the first and so far the only in the club's history. The coach, Bulgarian [[Eduard Eranosyan]], formerly football player of the team started the 2003\u201304 well, with Lokomotiv leading the league by six points halfway through the season and remaining unbeaten. In the penultimate, 29th round, '''The Smurfs''' defeated [[Slavia Sofia]] in [[Plovdiv]] by 3:2 in front of more than 17,000 spectators, and Lokomotiv won the Bulgarian championship. Lokomotiv finished the season with 75 points, 3 more than the second, [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]]. In the team lines was recent acquisition [[Martin Kamburov]] who became the goalscorer in Bulgaria with 26 goals. Key players during the fantastic season included [[Vasil Kamburov]], [[Georgi Iliev (footballer, born 1981)|Georgi Iliev]], [[Aleksandar Tunchev]], [[Kiril Kotev]], [[Vladimir Ivanov (footballer)|Vladimir Ivanov]], Metodi Stoynev and the Macedonians [[Boban Jan\u010devski]], [[Van\u010do Trajanov]] and [[Robert Petrov]].\n\nA few months later, the team played for the first time in the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds]] where they faced [[Club Brugge]] from [[Belgium]] in the second qualifying round.\n\nThe same year, Lokomotiv won the [[2004 Bulgarian Supercup|Bulgarian Supercup]], after beating [[PFC Litex Lovech|Litex Lovech]]. In the final, [[Ivan Paskov]] scored a brilliant header in the last seconds of the game for the 1:0 win.\n\n=== Recent history (2004-present) ===\nThe next [[A PFG 2004\u201305|2004-05]] season in the domestic league was also very successful for the team, which finished 3rd in [[A PFG]], and qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]]. In the European club competition, Lokomotiv defeated Serbian [[OFK Beograd]] in the second qualifying round (1:0 home win and 1:2 away loss) and were drawn to play against the English [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the first round. However, the team from [[Plovdiv]] was eliminated after a 1-2 loss at the [[Reebok Stadium]] in [[Bolton]] and another 1-2 loss in a match, played at the [[Lazur Stadium]] in [[Burgas]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4240960.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Bolton 2-1 Lokomotiv Plovdiv|accessdate=2005-09-15 | date=15 September 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn the next few months the club had big financial problems. Because of these problems, many of the players of the champions team, as [[Aleksandar Tunchev]], [[Martin Kamburov]], [[Ivan Paskov]], [[Georgi Iliev (footballer, born 1981)|Georgi Iliev]], [[Darko Spalevi\u0107]], [[Kiril Kotev]] and [[Boban Jan\u010devski]] left the club.\n\nIn the [[A PFG 2005\u201306|2005-06]] season Lokomotiv finished 5th in [[A PFG]] and qualified for the [[Intertoto Cup]]. Loko were eliminated with a 2-3 (1-2 away loss and a 1-1 home draw) on aggregate by Romanian [[FC Farul Constan\u0163a|Farul Constan\u0163a]].\n\nIn the next three seasons, the team finished in the middle of the table. In December 2009, the businessman and ex-[[FC Vihren Sandanski|Vihren Sandanski]] owner Konstantin Dinev acquired the club from Galina Topalova in a 2 million euro bid, with the clear intention to bring Loko back to European club competition.\n\nOn the 15th of May 2019, Lokomotiv Plovdiv won the [[Bulgarian Cup]] for the first time in the club's history, with a 1-0 win over local rivals [[Botev Plovdiv]], in Sofia.\n\n==Crest and colors==\nThe configuration of the crest consists of a shield colored in red and black and a golden letter 'L' ({{lang-bg|\u041b}}) placed in the center. A white stripe with inscription '[[Plovdiv]]' is positioned on the upper part of the shield. The wings in the bottom of the shield represent the historical bond between the football club and the national railway company.\n\nLokomotiv Plovdiv's traditional home colors are white, black and red. In the past the club has also adopted a sky blue as a kit color. \n<gallery mode=packed>\n|<center>1926</center>\n|<center>1945</center>\nFile:Torpedo.png|<center>1949</center>\nFile:Loko50.png|<center>1951</center>\nFile:Loko70.png|<center>1970</center>\nFile:Loko85.png|<center>1985</center>\nFile:Lokomotivplovdiv.jpg|<center>2011</center>\n</gallery>\n\n== Honours ==\n'''[[Bulgarian A Football Group|First League]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (1):''' [[2003\u201304 A Group|2003\u201304]]\n* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (1): [[1972\u201373 A Group|1972\u201373]]\n* [[Image:Bronze medal icon.svg|15px]] Third place (4): [[1968\u201369 A Group|1968\u201369]], [[1973\u201374 A Group|1973\u201374]], [[1991\u201392 A Group|1991\u201392]], [[2004\u201305 A Group|2004\u201305]]\n\n'''[[Bulgarian Cup]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (1):''' [[2019 Bulgarian Cup Final|2018\u201319]]\n* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (4): [[1960 Bulgarian Cup Final|1959\u201360]], [[1971 Bulgarian Cup Final|1970\u201371]], [[1982 Bulgarian Cup Final|1981\u201382]], [[2012 Bulgarian Cup Final|2011\u201312]]\n\n'''[[Bulgarian Supercup]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (1):''' [[2004 Bulgarian Supercup|2004]]\n* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (2): [[2012 Bulgarian Supercup|2012]], [[2019 Bulgarian Supercup|2019]]\n\n'''[[Cup of the Soviet Army (1983\u20131990)|Cup of the Soviet Army]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (1):''' [[1983 Cup of the Soviet Army Final|1983]]\n\n== Players ==\n=== First-team squad ===\n''{{As of|2020|3|1}}''\n\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player | no=1  | nat=BUL | pos=GK | name= [[Ilko Pirgov]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=3  | nat=NGA | pos=DF | name= Abdullahi Mustapha}}\n{{Fs player | no=4  | nat=NOR | pos=DF | name= [[Akinshola Akinyemi]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=5  | nat=MOZ | pos=DF | name= [[David Malembana]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=7  | nat=BUL | pos=MF | name= [[Momchil Tsvetanov]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=9  | nat=BUL | pos=MF | name= [[Bircent Karagaren]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=10 | nat=TJK | pos=MF | name= [[Parvizdzhon Umarbayev]]}} \n{{Fs player | no=11 | nat=AUT | pos=FW | name= [[Kenan Muslimovi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=13 | nat=CRO | pos=MF | name= [[Mihovil Klapan]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=14 | nat=BUL | pos=MF | name= [[Dimitar Iliev (footballer, born 1988)|Dimitar Iliev]]|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=15 | nat=SWI | pos=MF | name= [[Valentino Pugliese]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=16 | nat=BRA | pos=MF | name= [[Lucas Salinas|Lucas]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player | no=19 | nat=BRA | pos=MF | name= [[Wiris]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=20 | nat=SRB | pos=DF | name= [[Milo\u0161 Petrovi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=22 | nat=BUL | pos=GK | name= Georgi Milev}}\n{{Fs player | no=25 | nat=ARG | pos=DF | name= [[Lucas Masoero]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=34 | nat=BUL | pos=MF | name= [[Petar Vitanov]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=44 | nat=BUL | pos=DF | name= [[Nikolay Nikolaev (footballer, born 1997)|Nikolay Nikolaev]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=50 | nat=CRO | pos=DF | name= [[Josip Toma\u0161evi\u0107 (footballer, born 1994)|Josip Toma\u0161evi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=61 | nat=POR | pos=DF | name= [[Dinis Almeida]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=71 | nat=BUL | pos=GK | name= [[Martin Lukov]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=77 | nat=CRO | pos=FW | name= [[Ante Aralica]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=91 | nat=BIH | pos=FW | name= Mirza Hasanbegovi\u0107}}\n{{Fs player | no=  - | nat=CGO | pos=FW | name= [[Dominique Malonga]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n''For recent transfers, see [[List of Bulgarian football transfers summer 2019#Lokomotiv Plovdiv|Transfers summer 2019]] and [[List of Bulgarian football transfers winter 2019\u201320#Lokomotiv Plovdiv|Transfers winter 2019\u201320]].''\n\n===Out on loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=BUL|name=Pavlin Evtimov|pos=GK|other=at [[FC Strumska Slava Radomir|Strumska Slava]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=BUL|name=[[Arhan Isuf]]|pos=DF|other=at [[FC Spartak Varna|Spartak Varna]] until 31 December 2019}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=BUL|name=[[Filip Kolev]]|pos=MF|other=at [[FC Spartak Varna|Spartak Varna]] until 31 December 2019}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=BUL|name=[[Oktay Yusein]]|pos=FW|other=at [[FC Strumska Slava Radomir|Strumska Slava]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Foreign players===\nUp to three non-EU nationals can be registered and given a squad number for the first team in the [[First Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|First League]].

The two teams are the most supported ones in the second largest city in Bulgaria. Botev is one the country's oldest teams, whereas Lokomotiv grew popular in the 70s. Traditionally, Lokomotiv drew support from the lower working classes of society whereas Botev drew support form the middle and upper classes, although that no longer applies.<ref>http://www.footballderbies.com/honours/index.php?id=81</ref>\n\nAnother rivalry Lokomotiv Plovdiv has is with one of Bulgaria's most successful football clubs - [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]]. The rivalry has a geopolitical nuance, first because of the historical competition between the cities of Plovdiv and Sofia as cultural, political and economical centres, and second because of the association of CSKA with the [[Bulgarian Land Forces|Bulgarian Army]] same as rival [[PFC Botev Plovdiv|Botev Plovdiv]].\n\n===Friendships===\nA rather friendly rivalry the team from Plovdiv has is with \"brother\" team of [[PFC Lokomotiv Sofia|Lokomotiv Sofia]]. The teams are historically connected because of their historical positions as the teams of the railway workers of Plovdiv and Sofia. They are the most successful and supported clubs the railway workers in Bulgaria were connected to, so matches between the teams are often called ''The Railroaders' Derby''. However, the teams were never direct competitors for the title and supporters never had massive confrontations, hence the derby is rather friendly.\n\nThe Lokomotiv fans have a long-standing friendship with fans of Italian team [[SSC Napoli]]. Napoli gave birth to the name ''Napoletani Ultras Plovdiv'' and that is how the friendship arose.\n\n==Support==\n[[File:Loko fans.jpg|thumb|right|Lokomotiv Plovdiv supporters during derby match]]\nSince its foundation, Lokomotiv has been one of the best supported football clubs in Bulgaria.

The home of the factions was chosen to be called Bessica Tribune (after the name of the ancient Thracian tribe whose artefacts were discovered in the surroundings of the stadium), but since the project has been put on hold the name Bessica Tribune has been used as a collective name for the most dedicated followers. Lokomotiv Plovdiv also has a well-recognised [[Ultras|football hooligan]] fan base. Some of the most prominent factions are ''Lauta Hools'', ''Got Mitt Uns'', ''Napoletani 1995'', and ''Lauta Youths''.\n\n''Lauta Hools'', also called ''Usual suspects'', founded in 1994, adhere to the

is a [[Bulgaria]]n professional [[association football]] club based in [[Kalekovec]], that competes in the country's primary football competition, the [[Bulgarian First League|First League]]. Lokomotiv's home ground is the homonymous [[Stadion Lokomotiv (Plovdiv)|Stadion Lokomotiv]] situated in the Lauta park of the city, with a capacity of 10,000 spectators.\n\nEstablished in 1926, in the [[2003\u201304 A Group|2003\u201304]] season of the A Group, Lokomotiv became champions of Bulgaria, finishing the season with three points more than the second-ranked, [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]]. Lokomotiv Plovdiv have also won [[2004 Bulgarian Supercup|one Bulgarian Supercup]], one Cup of the Soviet Army in [[1983 Cup of the Soviet Army Final|1983]] and most recently - one [[Bulgarian Cup]] in 2019. The club's biggest success in Europe is reaching the third round of the [[1964\u201365 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in 1965, after losing to the Italian [[Juventus F.C.]] in a play-off match.\n\n== History ==\nDescription of the club's history requires attention to the reorganisations that the team has undergone since its creation and how the members and fans of the team have reacted to these changes. The political environment in [[Bulgaria]] during the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|communist period]] between 1944-1989 has led to some forced changes in the nature of sporting clubs throughout the country as to follow \"the Soviet model\". In the case of PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv, these changes have led to the merger of two teams, that are different in nature, leading to misinterpretations of the history of the teams. This said, a special approach is needed towards the history of the early years of the contemporary football club of Lokomotiv Plovdiv. In order to understand the origin of the contemporary team with its official full name, colours, and supporters, the examination of Lokomotiv's history has to be undertaken in two major \"branches\" - one defined by its followers and recognisable features, and the other by its functional characteristic and funding as a labour union team. These branches can be defined as that of ''Sportclub Plovdiv'' (being the fan-based team), and of club of the railway workers (being the team funded by the union).\n\n===Roots of the Club (until 1944)===\n\n====Sportclub Plovdiv====\nIn the spring of 1922 the sport club ''Karadzha'' is founded administratively by the consolidation of some casual football teams in one of the districts of the city of [[Plovdiv]] so that the players can compete in the Championship of Plovdiv. Two years later, in 1924, the sport club ''Atletik'' is formed in the same district of Plovdiv as Karadzha.\n\nOn 26 July 1926 the two sport clubs from the same district, Karadzha and Atletik, unite to form the team of ''Sportclub''. The football club chooses white, black and red as the colours of their kits and their crest, and also the year of establishment 1926 is added several years later the crest. Nowadays, Lokomotiv Plovdiv still uses the same colours for their kits and crest, while the full name of the team (''Professional Football Club Lokomotiv 1926 Plovdiv'') shows that the year the club assumes itself to be established is the year Sportclub was founded.\n\nSportclub had its home grounds in the city centre. However, after the disastrous earthquake in South Bulgaria in 1928, the team donates their field to people who lost their homes so that they can build new ones where the club's grounds were. Because of that, from 1928 Sportclub did not have their own football field for more than two decades.\n\n[[File:Sportclub Plovdiv Kits.png|150px|thumb|left|Home and away kits of Sportclub Plovdiv (1939-40)]]\nAs a football team, in the years after Sportclub was created it competed in the Championship of Plovdiv. In the early years of Bulgarian football there is no national football league and championships held on a regional level throughout a calendar year are the most prestigious tournaments across the country. Sportclub participates in the second division of the Championship of Plovdiv until 1933 when the team finishes first in the second division and is promoted to Plovdiv's top tier as of 1934. In 1936 Sportclub becomes the Champion of Plovdiv for the first time.\n\nIn 1938 the team joined the [[Bulgarian A Football Group#History|National Football Division]] - the countrywide football league formed a year earlier that included Bulgaria's top ten teams. However, after only three seasons in 1940 the tournament is disbanded because of the Bulgaria's participation in [[World War II]] (WW2). By that time the club had changed its name to ''Plovdivski Sportclub'' (meaning Sportclub of Plovdiv) since several other teams in the country also had Sportclub in their name.\n\nDuring the years of WW2, the team participates in several other tournaments including the [[Bulgarian Cup#History|Tsar's Cup]] considered Bulgaria's most prestigious knock-out tournament at the time and a predecessor of the current domestic cup tournament. In the Tsar's Cup the team reaches the finals twice - in 1940 and in 1942.\n\nSince its establishment in 1926 up to the beginning of the communist rule in Bulgaria in 1944 Sportclub has become one of the best performing teams in the country with a constant participation in the final phases of the most prestigious tournaments. By 1944 the team is the biggest in the region of Plovdiv in terms of members, and has a dedicated following with its fans setting records for the period in attendance of football matches.\n\n====The Club of the Railway Workers in Plovdiv====\nIn the mid-1930s the labour union of the railway workers and sailors establishes several cultural and sporting organisations across the country. The railway workers established their sports club in Plovdiv as well, since the city is one of the major travel centres in the country. On 13 June 1935 the club ''ZSK Plovdiv'' was founded, abbreviated from ''Zheleznicharski Sporten Klub Plovdiv'' meaning ''the sporting club of the railway workers in Plovdiv''.\n\nThe first years of the team are difficult as its performance does not bring about such glory as some of the other teams of the city like Sportclub or [[Botev Plovdiv]]. The club is accepted as a member of the national sport federation a whole three years after its creation. Nevertheless, in the early 1940s the team betters their performance and in 1944 wins the Championship of Plovdiv.\n\nIn an economical aspect the railway club contributes heavily to the development of sports in the region of Plovdiv, making large inputs for the improvement of sporting conditions in the city. Most notably, the powerful national railway company through ZSK Plovdiv is the main benefactor for the creation of a state-of-the-art multi-purpose stadium in the city that opens in 1943. The stadium is constructed on the football pitches of the team of ''Levski Plovdiv'' and as such is the home grounds for both ZSK Plovdiv and Levski Plovdiv. As a result, the stadium is named \"ZSK-Levski\".\n\n===Creation of Lokomotiv (1944-1955)===\n\n====Changes in Sportclub====\n[[File:Slavia Plovdiv Crest.png|180px|thumb|right|The crest of Slavia Plovdiv]]In the years after 1944, the newly established communist rule embarks in several campaigns for \"reorganisation of the sporting clubs in Bulgaria\" so that they are aligned with the political agenda and follow the \"Soviet model\". This means that every area should have a sports club, but in order to make investments more efficient for a greater member-base only a few clubs are allowed per area. The result is a forceful merger of clubs and teams.\n\nThus, starting from 1944 Sportclub is merged with numerous sports teams in the same district of Plovdiv due to the \"reorganization\". Being from an area with a population comprised by a variety of ethnic and religious backgrounds, the club is first merged with several lower-division so-called \"Aremenian\", teams such as ''Shant'' and ''Erevan''. Another merger follows in 1945 with the \"Catholic\" club ''Parchevich''. After this wave of mergers, like many others in the country, the club is renamed to an abbreviation of the biggest clubs merged - the new name is \"S.P.-45\", meaning ''Sportclub Parchevich - 1945''. However, because of the \"Western\" phrasing (\"sport\" and \"club\" are non-Slavic words) the team is renamed again before the start of the season - the name of the club becomes ''\"Slavia\" Plovdiv''.\n\nIn 1947 a new wave of consolidations of the sport organisations in the country sees Slavia Plovdiv merge with the team of the cooperative workers  - ''Petar Chengelov''. The merger creates the club ''Slavia-Chengelov''.\n\nThrough all these mergers, the club originally named Sportclub keeps its colours and the core of its team, with only several players from the incorporated squads finding a place in the first team of the \"new\" club. As for the fans, the supporters of Sportclub remain loyal to the colours and the players, and the followers of the assimilated clubs join them, increasing even further the number of fans and members of the largest club in Plovdiv at that time. Though technically the clubs merge, because of the size of Sportclub in terms of members, the smaller clubs are assimilated into the black-white-and-red club.\n\nDuring the period 1944-1955, the club reaches the final of the domestic cup (at that time being the [[Bulgarian Cup#Cup of the Soviet Army (1945\u20131982)|Cup of the Soviet Army]]) for the third time in its history - in 1948 as Slavia-Chengelov. In [[1948\u201349 A PFG|season 1948]] the club was one of the ten founder teams of the new national top league - [[Bulgarian A Football Group#A Republican Football Group|\"A\" Republican Football Group (A RFG)]] - the predecessor of the current Bulgarian top division league .\n\n====Changes in ZSK====\nFor ZSK Plovdiv the \"reorganisation of sport clubs\" in line with the Soviet model begins in the autumn of 1944. The club is merged with the team with which it shares a stadium - Levski Plovdiv, forming ''ZSK-Levski'' in accordance with the trend. Still, unlike most other forced mergers at that time, the ZSK-Levski merger is dissolved in only a year.\n\nAfter the separation in 1945 ZSK is renamed to ''Lokomotiv (Plovdiv)'' similar to all other teams in the countries of the Eastern bloc connected in some way with the railways (such as [[Lokomotiv Sofia]], [[Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moskva]], [[Lokomotive Leipzig|Lokomotiv Leipzig]], etc.) and Lokomotiv and Levski continue to co-exist as separate entities sharing the same stadium.\n\nAlthough the club of the railway workers is financially backed by the solid national railway company, in the first years of the communist rule the football team competes merely on the third level of the recently formed national league. Furthermore, the club is the smallest in Plovdiv in terms of members and attracts a modest number of attendants for its games despite its state-of-the-art stadium.\n\n====Merger of Slaviya-Chengelov and Lokomotiv Plovdiv====\nIn the summer of 1949 the Bulgarian Communist Party adopts a new principal governing the construction of sports clubs. According to the new political agenda, clubs must serve as the fitness departments of the politically important enterprises (such as the oil refineries, the police, the army, the national railway company, and others). Thus, the location of a club is no longer important and clubs must be assigned to the major institutions in the country.\n\nThe reorganisations of 1949 assigns Lokomotiv to assimilate Slavia-Chengelov, since Lokomotiv is already a team associated with a significant enterprise. Yet, at that time Slavia-Chengelov is the largest club in Bulgaria in terms of members, with an even larger fan-base. Hence, the smallest club in Plovdiv (namely Lokomotiv) has to assimilate one of the most popular teams in the country.\n\nIn October 1949, the formal \"assimilation\" of Slavia into Lokomotiv takes place to form ''DSO Energiya'' before [[1950 A PFG|season 1950]]. The club uses the colours of Slaviya-Chengelov (white, red, and black) for both the kits and the crest of the football team, and the team itself retains only four players from Lokomotiv - the core remains the players of Slaviya-Chengelov. Nevertheless, after more than two decades after the earthquake in 1928 the fans of what-was-once Sportclub have home grounds - the stadium of Lokomotiv.\n\n''DSO'' is an abbreviation meaning ''national sports organisation''. However, just months after DSO Energiya is created changes in the names of clubs in the Soviet Union take place, inspiring the renaming of several clubs in Bulgaria. The popular at the time name for Eastern bloc sports clubs ''Torpedo'' is adapted for DSO Energiya - renamed ''Torpedo Plovdiv''.\n\nFor [[1950 A PFG|season 1950]] Torpedo Plovdiv takes the place of Slavia-Chengelov in the top level of the Bulgarian football league system (A RFG). Yet, during the season it becomes clear that the club will undergo some more changes because of the policy that as part of the railway union club members have to be entirely members of the union. This includes all the players of the football team as well as the members of the sport club in general - the large number of members of Slavia-Chengelov which have nothing to do with the railways. Thus, in 1951 before the [[1951 A PFG|new season]] begins, the railway union establishes a new club by the name of ''DSO Lokomotiv (Plovdiv)'' which will use the same colours for its football team as Torpedo and will play on the same stadium. The union also transfers all the players of Torpedo in DSO Lokomotiv and in order to make them official union members each player is ''de jure'' employed in the national railways. Meanwhile, Torpedo Plovdiv is taken out of the labour union and is no longer funded by it or the railway company. DSO Lokomotiv also acquires the license of Torpedo to play in the top tier of the Bulgarian football league, while Torpedo itself is relegated to the third division of the league due to the lack of license. By creating the new club and employing the team in the railways, the labour union effectively legitimises the club without the need to limit the access of members of Torpedo to the sports facilities. Members of Torpedo can still use the facilities which are shared between the two clubs and it is not necessary for them to be members of the railway union.\n\nFrom the start of [[1951 A PFG|season 1951]] the fans of the team of Torpedo Plovdiv in 1950 are supporting the same team with the same colours on the same grounds but named DSO Lokomotiv Plovdiv. As official membership in the club requires a job in the railways, the official number of members of the club are drastically smaller than the members of Torpedo in 1950. Nevertheless, the supporters of the team remain the same. Hence, in 1951 DSO Lokomotiv is the effective successor of Torpedo even though the club Torpedo continues to exist.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1954 the team is one of the best performers in the football elite, annually reaching at least the quarter-final phase of both the domestic cup competition (at that time recognised to be [[Bulgarian Cup#History|the Cup of the Soviet Army]]) and the top division league.\n\n===First Relegation from the Elite (1955-1960)===\nIn 1955 the team of DSO Lokomotiv is entirely changed - many key players are sold and the team seems to be unable to collaborate. In result, in [[1955 A PFG|season 1955]] DSO Lokomotiv is relegated to the second division of Bulgarian football. For the fans the next season would be the first time their team plays outside the most prestigious echelon of Bulgarian football.\n\nDSO Lokomotiv plays in second division for five seasons until it earns its promotion back to the elite for [[1961\u201362 A PFG|season 1961-62]]. In the same year, 1960, the team reaches [[Bulgarian Cup#Cup of the Soviet Army (1946-1982)|the final of the domestic cup]] for the fourth time in its history (after 1940 and 1942 as Sportclub, and 1948 as Slaviya-Chengelov) but for the fourth time - it lost.\n\nDuring its stay in the second division, the club experiences again the reorganisation of sports politics in the People's Republic of Bulgaria that took place in 1957. According to the changes, clubs no longer needed to be affiliated to enterprises and instead the emphasis turned back to the territorial principle. Thus, sport clubs no longer needed to be \"DSO\" (abbreviation meaning ''\"voluntary sports organisation\"'') inside the principal. Rather, as a club with many supporters in its area, DSO Lokomotiv assimilated the clubs Torpedo Plovdiv (with which it still shared a stadium) and ''Septemvri (Plovdiv)''. As the club no longer needed to be \"DSO\" it changed its name to ''\"Lokomotiv\" Plovdiv'''.\n\n===Success Home and Abroad (1960-1985)===\nAfter re-entering the elite (A RFG) in 1961, it takes Lokomotiv seven years to reach top 3 and get a medal in [[1968\u201369 A PFG|season 1968-69]].\n\nOn an international level however, the team achieves success much quicker. In season [[1964\u201365 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1964-65]], Lokomotiv Plovdiv reaches the Third Round of the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], where after two draws with the legendary team of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] with [[Omar S\u00edvori]], [[Luis del Sol]] and [[Sandro Salvadore]] in their squad (each ending with a score 1:1), a third play-off match is chosen by [[UEFA]] to be played in [[Torino]]. The game is lost by \"Loko\" with a score of 2:1. \n[[File:Hristo Bonev 1974.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The \u21168 shirt is retired in honour of [[Hristo Bonev]]]]\nBefore reaching the Third Round of the international football competition, the \"Smurfs\" have eliminated the Serbian [[FK Vojvodina]] and the Romanian [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u015fti]]. Key players during this period include forward [[Georgi Parvanov Vasilev|Gocho Vasilev]], midfielder [[Hristo Bonev]], defender [[Ivan Boyadzhiev]] and goalkeeper [[Stancho Bonchev]].\n\nIn 1971, the team reaches the final of the [[Bulgarian Cup#Cup of the Soviet Army (1946-1982)|domestic cup]] again and again lost it, this time to [[Levski Sofia]] with a score of 3:0.\n\nIn [[A PFG 1972\u201373|1973]], Lokomotiv wins the silver medals of A RFG, finishing the season with 43 points, 7 less than the first, [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]]. The following year, another celebration is in order - in [[1973\u201374 A Group|1974]] Lokomotiv finished the season in the third place getting the league bronze. In the following few years period the team is quite stable and it was very rarely standing under the 6th position in the league table. Among the team's players is [[Hristo Bonev]] - considered by most Loko fans as being the greatest player of the club ever, and one of the greatest Bulgarian players.\n\nWhen after [[1979\u201380 A PFG|season 1979-80]] Lokomotiv Plovdiv is again relegated to Bulgaria's second football division, it takes the team three seasons to earn its place back in the football elite.\n\nDespite being in second division between 1981 and 1983, ''Loko'' reaches the final of the Cup of the Soviet Army twice. In 1982 for the sixth time the team cannot win [[Bulgarian Cup#Cup of the Soviet Army (1946-1982)|the domestic cup]]. In 1983 however, led by [[Hristo Bonev]], Lokomotiv won their first national cup beating FC Chirpan 3:1 at [[Vasil Levski National Stadium]] in Sofia on 1 June. (Be that as it may, it is important to note that the tournament of the Cup of the Soviet Army, held annually between 1946-1990, is recognised by the [[Bulgarian Football Union]](BFU) as the domestic cup tournament up to 1982. In 1981, the tournament for the Bulgarian Cup begins to take place every year and rises in prestige, overtaking the significance of the Cup of the Soviet Army in sequent years. At present, the BFU's official statement is that it considers the [[Bulgarian Cup#Bulgarian Cup (1983-present)|Bulgarian Cup]] to represent the domestic cup from 1983 onwards. Thus, nowadays the Cup of the Soviet Army won in 1983 by Lokomotiv Plovdiv is the first officially non-recognised as the domestic cup Soviet Army trophy; i.e. ''Lokomotiv Plovdiv is not officially recognised as the bearer of the domestic cup for 1983 - it is a non-official bearer.'' Yet, at that time, the Soviet Army Cup was for all intents and purposes, is the domestic football cup trophy.)\n\nIn 1982 the team acquired a new stadium situated in park \"Lauta\" near the city's newest district. [[Lokomotiv Stadium (Plovdiv)|\"Lokomotiv\" Stadium]] is part of a sports complex used by the other teams of the sports club (such as the volleyball and the boxing teams of \"Lokomotiv\" Plovdiv.\nIn [[1983\u201384 A PFG|season 1983-84]], even though the club has just been promoted to the top division, and in defiance of being the Soviet Army Cup holder, Loko Plovdiv relegates itself again and plays season 1984-85 in the lower level of the Bulgarian league system. In 1985 the team earns it promotion back to A RFG.\n\n===1985-2000===\nAfter its return to the top division in 1985 the team makes a steady performance for over a decade, placing itself in the middle of the league table until the late 1990s. During that time the team finishes in top 3 only once - in [[1991\u201392 A PFG|season 1991-92]].\n\nIn the late 1990s the form of the team worsens which takes them out of the elite again, and in seasons 1998-99 and 1999-00 Lokomotiv Plovdiv plays in [[B PFG]].\n\n===Georgi Iliev Years (2000-2004)===\nIn 2001 the club is bought by Georgi Iliev. At that time, Iliev owns another football club  - [[PFC Velbazhd Kyustendil|Velbazhd Kyustendil]]. The team from Kyustendil has a very good performance in the Bulgarian top division (A PFG) finishing in third place three consecutive seasons until 2000-01 and is a national cup runner-up in 2001.\n\nIn season 2001-02 Iliev decides to merge the two teams creating the contemporary Lokomotiv Plovdiv (full name: Professional Football Club Lokomotiv 1926 Plovdiv). The new club is based in the grounds of the Lokomotiv that merged with Velbazhd, uses the same colours and is the official successor of that club. Yet, the team was formed almost entirely of the players performing excellently in the last years in the club from Kyustendil. As a result, that team finished third again at the end of the season.\n\nThe most successful season in the club's history was the 2003-04 campaign. Lokomotiv won the [[A PFG 2003\u201304|title]], the first and so far the only in the club's history. The coach, Bulgarian [[Eduard Eranosyan]], formerly football player of the team started the 2003\u201304 well, with Lokomotiv leading the league by six points halfway through the season and remaining unbeaten. In the penultimate, 29th round, '''The Smurfs''' defeated [[Slavia Sofia]] in [[Plovdiv]] by 3:2 in front of more than 17,000 spectators, and Lokomotiv won the Bulgarian championship. Lokomotiv finished the season with 75 points, 3 more than the second, [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]]. In the team lines was recent acquisition [[Martin Kamburov]] who became the goalscorer in Bulgaria with 26 goals. Key players during the fantastic season included [[Vasil Kamburov]], [[Georgi Iliev (footballer, born 1981)|Georgi Iliev]], [[Aleksandar Tunchev]], [[Kiril Kotev]], [[Vladimir Ivanov (footballer)|Vladimir Ivanov]], Metodi Stoynev and the Macedonians [[Boban Jan\u010devski]], [[Van\u010do Trajanov]] and [[Robert Petrov]].\n\nA few months later, the team played for the first time in the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds]] where they faced [[Club Brugge]] from [[Belgium]] in the second qualifying round.\n\nThe same year, Lokomotiv won the [[2004 Bulgarian Supercup|Bulgarian Supercup]], after beating [[PFC Litex Lovech|Litex Lovech]]. In the final, [[Ivan Paskov]] scored a brilliant header in the last seconds of the game for the 1:0 win.\n\n=== Recent history (2004-present) ===\nThe next [[A PFG 2004\u201305|2004-05]] season in the domestic league was also very successful for the team, which finished 3rd in [[A PFG]], and qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]]. In the European club competition, Lokomotiv defeated Serbian [[OFK Beograd]] in the second qualifying round (1:0 home win and 1:2 away loss) and were drawn to play against the English [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the first round. However, the team from [[Plovdiv]] was eliminated after a 1-2 loss at the [[Reebok Stadium]] in [[Bolton]] and another 1-2 loss in a match, played at the [[Lazur Stadium]] in [[Burgas]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4240960.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Bolton 2-1 Lokomotiv Plovdiv|accessdate=2005-09-15 | date=15 September 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn the next few months the club had big financial problems. Because of these problems, many of the players of the champions team, as [[Aleksandar Tunchev]], [[Martin Kamburov]], [[Ivan Paskov]], [[Georgi Iliev (footballer, born 1981)|Georgi Iliev]], [[Darko Spalevi\u0107]], [[Kiril Kotev]] and [[Boban Jan\u010devski]] left the club.\n\nIn the [[A PFG 2005\u201306|2005-06]] season Lokomotiv finished 5th in [[A PFG]] and qualified for the [[Intertoto Cup]]. Loko were eliminated with a 2-3 (1-2 away loss and a 1-1 home draw) on aggregate by Romanian [[FC Farul Constan\u0163a|Farul Constan\u0163a]].\n\nIn the next three seasons, the team finished in the middle of the table. In December 2009, the businessman and ex-[[FC Vihren Sandanski|Vihren Sandanski]] owner Konstantin Dinev acquired the club from Galina Topalova in a 2 million euro bid, with the clear intention to bring Loko back to European club competition.\n\nOn the 15th of May 2019, Lokomotiv Plovdiv won the [[Bulgarian Cup]] for the first time in the club's history, with a 1-0 win over local rivals [[Botev Plovdiv]], in Sofia.\n\n==Crest and colors==\nThe configuration of the crest consists of a shield colored in red and black and a golden letter 'L' ({{lang-bg|\u041b}}) placed in the center. A white stripe with inscription '[[Plovdiv]]' is positioned on the upper part of the shield. The wings in the bottom of the shield represent the historical bond between the football club and the national railway company.\n\nLokomotiv Plovdiv's traditional home colors are white, black and red. In the past the club has also adopted a sky blue as a kit color. \n<gallery mode=packed>\n|<center>1926</center>\n|<center>1945</center>\nFile:Torpedo.png|<center>1949</center>\nFile:Loko50.png|<center>1951</center>\nFile:Loko70.png|<center>1970</center>\nFile:Loko85.png|<center>1985</center>\nFile:Lokomotivplovdiv.jpg|<center>2011</center>\n</gallery>\n\n== Honours ==\n'''[[Bulgarian A Football Group|First League]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (1):''' [[2003\u201304 A Group|2003\u201304]]\n* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (1): [[1972\u201373 A Group|1972\u201373]]\n* [[Image:Bronze medal icon.svg|15px]] Third place (4): [[1968\u201369 A Group|1968\u201369]], [[1973\u201374 A Group|1973\u201374]], [[1991\u201392 A Group|1991\u201392]], [[2004\u201305 A Group|2004\u201305]]\n\n'''[[Bulgarian Cup]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (1):''' [[2019 Bulgarian Cup Final|2018\u201319]]\n* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (4): [[1960 Bulgarian Cup Final|1959\u201360]], [[1971 Bulgarian Cup Final|1970\u201371]], [[1982 Bulgarian Cup Final|1981\u201382]], [[2012 Bulgarian Cup Final|2011\u201312]]\n\n'''[[Bulgarian Supercup]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (1):''' [[2004 Bulgarian Supercup|2004]]\n* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (2): [[2012 Bulgarian Supercup|2012]], [[2019 Bulgarian Supercup|2019]]\n\n'''[[Cup of the Soviet Army (1983\u20131990)|Cup of the Soviet Army]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (1):''' [[1983 Cup of the Soviet Army Final|1983]]\n\n== Players ==\n=== First-team squad ===\n''{{As of|2020|3|1}}''\n\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player | no=1  | nat=BUL | pos=GK | name= [[Ilko Pirgov]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=3  | nat=NGA | pos=DF | name= Abdullahi Mustapha}}\n{{Fs player | no=4  | nat=NOR | pos=DF | name= [[Akinshola Akinyemi]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=5  | nat=MOZ | pos=DF | name= [[David Malembana]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=7  | nat=BUL | pos=MF | name= [[Momchil Tsvetanov]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=9  | nat=BUL | pos=MF | name= [[Bircent Karagaren]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=10 | nat=TJK | pos=MF | name= [[Parvizdzhon Umarbayev]]}} \n{{Fs player | no=11 | nat=AUT | pos=FW | name= [[Kenan Muslimovi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=13 | nat=CRO | pos=MF | name= [[Mihovil Klapan]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=14 | nat=BUL | pos=MF | name= [[Dimitar Iliev (footballer, born 1988)|Dimitar Iliev]]|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=15 | nat=SWI | pos=MF | name= [[Valentino Pugliese]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=16 | nat=BRA | pos=MF | name= [[Lucas Salinas|Lucas]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player | no=19 | nat=BRA | pos=MF | name= [[Wiris]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=20 | nat=SRB | pos=DF | name= [[Milo\u0161 Petrovi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=22 | nat=BUL | pos=GK | name= Georgi Milev}}\n{{Fs player | no=25 | nat=ARG | pos=DF | name= [[Lucas Masoero]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=34 | nat=BUL | pos=MF | name= [[Petar Vitanov]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=44 | nat=BUL | pos=DF | name= [[Nikolay Nikolaev (footballer, born 1997)|Nikolay Nikolaev]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=50 | nat=CRO | pos=DF | name= [[Josip Toma\u0161evi\u0107 (footballer, born 1994)|Josip Toma\u0161evi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=61 | nat=POR | pos=DF | name= [[Dinis Almeida]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=71 | nat=BUL | pos=GK | name= [[Martin Lukov]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=77 | nat=CRO | pos=FW | name= [[Ante Aralica]]}}\n{{Fs player | no=91 | nat=BIH | pos=FW | name= Mirza Hasanbegovi\u0107}}\n{{Fs player | no=  - | nat=CGO | pos=FW | name= [[Dominique Malonga]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n''For recent transfers, see [[List of Bulgarian football transfers summer 2019#Lokomotiv Plovdiv|Transfers summer 2019]] and [[List of Bulgarian football transfers winter 2019\u201320#Lokomotiv Plovdiv|Transfers winter 2019\u201320]].''\n\n===Out on loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=BUL|name=Pavlin Evtimov|pos=GK|other=at [[FC Strumska Slava Radomir|Strumska Slava]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=BUL|name=[[Arhan Isuf]]|pos=DF|other=at [[FC Spartak Varna|Spartak Varna]] until 31 December 2019}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=BUL|name=[[Filip Kolev]]|pos=MF|other=at [[FC Spartak Varna|Spartak Varna]] until 31 December 2019}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=BUL|name=[[Oktay Yusein]]|pos=FW|other=at [[FC Strumska Slava Radomir|Strumska Slava]] until 30 June 2020}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Foreign players===\nUp to three non-EU nationals can be registered and given a squad number for the first team in the [[First Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|First League]].

The two teams are the most supported ones in the second largest city in Bulgaria. Botev is one the country's oldest teams, whereas Lokomotiv grew popular in the 70s. Traditionally, Lokomotiv drew support from the lower working classes of society whereas Botev drew support form the middle and upper classes, although that no longer applies.<ref>http://www.footballderbies.com/honours/index.php?id=81</ref>\n\nAnother rivalry Lokomotiv Plovdiv has is with one of Bulgaria's most successful football clubs - [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]]. The rivalry has a geopolitical nuance, first because of the historical competition between the cities of Plovdiv and Sofia as cultural, political and economical centres, and second because of the association of CSKA with the [[Bulgarian Land Forces|Bulgarian Army]] same as rival [[PFC Botev Plovdiv|Botev Plovdiv]].\n\n===Friendships===\nA rather friendly rivalry the team from Plovdiv has is with \"brother\" team of [[PFC Lokomotiv Sofia|Lokomotiv Sofia]]. The teams are historically connected because of their historical positions as the teams of the railway workers of Plovdiv and Sofia. They are the most successful and supported clubs the railway workers in Bulgaria were connected to, so matches between the teams are often called ''The Railroaders' Derby''. However, the teams were never direct competitors for the title and supporters never had massive confrontations, hence the derby is rather friendly.\n\nThe Lokomotiv fans have a long-standing friendship with fans of Italian team [[SSC Napoli]]. Napoli gave birth to the name ''Napoletani Ultras Plovdiv'' and that is how the friendship arose.\n\n==Support==\n[[File:Loko fans.jpg|thumb|right|Lokomotiv Plovdiv supporters during derby match]]\nSince its foundation, Lokomotiv has been one of the best supported football clubs in Bulgaria.

The home of the factions was chosen to be called Bessica Tribune (after the name of the ancient Thracian tribe whose artefacts were discovered in the surroundings of the stadium), but since the project has been put on hold the name Bessica Tribune has been used as a collective name for the most dedicated followers. Lokomotiv Plovdiv also has a well-recognised [[Ultras|football hooligan]] fan base. Some of the most prominent factions are ''Lauta Hools'', ''Got Mitt Uns'', ''Napoletani 1995'', and ''Lauta Youths''.\n\n''Lauta Hools'', also called ''Usual suspects'', founded in 1994, adhere to the British way of support and are [[casual (subculture)|casuals]], and it is not uncommon to see the [[Union Jack]] in the stands as a result.<ref>http://lautahools.org/?lang=en</ref>\n\n== Recent

The [[Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant]] was inaugurated on May 24, 2011, and currently builds the US-spec [[Volkswagen Passat NMS|Volkswagen Passat]] and in 2017 started production of the Volkswagen Atlas.<ref name=\"Chattanooga Times Free Press\">[http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2011/may/24/vw-ushers-new-era-us-its-chattanooga-plant/] Chattanooga Times Free Press</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\nFormed in October 1955 in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]], to standardize dealership service in the United States, it grew to 909 Volkswagen [[Car dealership|dealer]]s in the US by 1965 under the leadership of Dr. [[Carl Hahn]]. Under him and his successor as president of Volkswagen of America, [[J. Stuart Perkins]], VW's U.S. sales grew to 569,696 cars in 1970, an all-time peak, when Volkswagen captured 7 percent of the U.S. car market and had over a thousand American dealerships.  The [[Volkswagen Beetle]] was the company's best seller in the United States by a wide margin.\n\nFrom then on, however, intense competition from American and Japanese automakers caused VW sales in America to fall as much as 87 percent between 1970 and 1992, despite the introduction of new front-drive models in 1975 to replace the Beetle and its rear-engined, air-cooled stablemates.  As a result, the number of dealerships in the U.S. was also reduced to 630 by the mid-1990s.  As of 2007, there were 596 operating Volkswagen dealerships in the country.\n\n===Westmoreland and Auburn Hills===\nVWoA inaugurated the [[Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant]] near [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]], in 1978. This was the first modern venture by a foreign automaker at making cars in the United States. In 1988, the plant was closed. In the early 1980s, the manufacturing division and the sales division were merged, and Volkswagen of America moved to [[Troy, Michigan]], as a result, settling in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]], in 1991 ({{Coord|42|38|43.2|N|83|12|55.4|W|region:US-MI_type:landmark|name=VWoA former HQ at Auburn Hills}}).\n\n===1990s uncertainties===\nVolkswagen of America's sales hit rock bottom in 1993, with fewer than 50,000 cars sold that year. Sales began to recover the following year with the introduction of the third generation of the Golf and Jetta.  By the end of the decade, thanks to effective advertising and the launch of more competitive new products, including the [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]] in 1998, the VW brand was back on firmer ground.  Volkswagen of America went on to sell 355,648 cars in 2001, its best year since 1973.\n\n===2000s===\nIn the 2000s sales tapered off somewhat due to competition, quality issues and delays in product introductions, and VW's U.S. sales for 2005 totaled 224,195 \u2013 a reduction of about 37 percent from four years earlier.  New models for the 2006 and 2007 model years, such as the [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]], [[Volkswagen Rabbit|Rabbit]], and [[Volkswagen GTI|GTI]] resulted in a sales growth of 4.9% for 2006 with sales of 235,140 vehicles.  [[Profit (accounting)|Profitability]] still remained an issue, though; Volkswagen of America had not turned a profit for its parent company since 2002.  In January 2007, Volkswagen of America president Adrian Hallmark publicly stated{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} that he planned to get the subsidiary back to profitability in two to three years.  He hoped to introduce new models for North America, and develop new marketing to encompass the whole brand as well as individual cars.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Stefan Jacoby soon replaced him, and Volkswagen of America continued to look at new products to add to its lineup.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn the meantime, a new advertising agency, [[Crispin Porter + Bogusky]], helped rejuvenate VW's presence in the U.S. as well.  Its ads for the fifth-generation GTI have sparked interest in the brand, not seen since the launch of the New Beetle, and ads for the fifth-generation Golf/Rabbit hatchback translated into initial strong sales for that model.  Due to new air pollution rules promulgated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA), the [[Diesel engine|diesel]] powered VWs with [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]]-[[Unit Injector|PD]] technology could no longer be produced after December 31, 2006.  For the 2009 model year, VW introduced a new generation of diesels, based on [[common rail]] technology.  These would meet air pollution standards in all 50 states. The first of these units was made available for sale in August 2008. VW sold 2050 Jetta Sedan TDIs and 361 Jetta Sportwagen TDIs that first month.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Volkswagen was later charged with three felonies and fined $25 billion for defrauding the American government when it was discovered that their vehicles were only passing laboratory emissions testing due to company tampering of their system\u2019s internal software.\n\nIn October 2009, Interpublic Group's Deutsch, Los Angeles, the ad agency of renowned ad man Donny Deutsch, won Volkswagen's American advertising account - fourteen years after Deutsch had tried for VW's advertising business against Arnold Advertising.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130822020117/http://www.forbes.com/2009/10/23/volkswagen-deutsch-cmo-network-deutsch.html] www.forbes.com</ref>\n\n===New headquarters in Virginia===\nOn September 6, 2007, Volkswagen of America announced it would relocate its North American headquarters to [[Herndon, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Volkswagen of America, Inc.

The company indicated that it is important for them to locate in a region where their customer base is strongest.  Presently, the [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big Three]] domestic brands dominate the Midwest US, especially Metro Detroit where the company was formerly located.\n\nVolkswagen of America began its move from Auburn Hills to Herndon in April 2008.  The company anticipated that 600 of the 1,400 staff would remain at Auburn Hills in the call center and technical services positions, while 400 jobs would transferred to Virginia.  About 150 employees in Michigan were expected to move to Herndon, Volkswagen of America President and CEO Stefan Jacoby said.  The four hundred remaining jobs were to be cut.\n\nThe state of Virginia, among 14 locations that Volkswagen of America considered for the move, offered Volkswagen $6 million in incentives that will be awarded pending Volkswagen's fulfillment of employment and other various quotas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n===New manufacturing plant===\nOn July 15, 2008, after an intense, months-long battle between [[Huntsville, Alabama]], a site in [[Michigan]] and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], the company's supervisory board chose Chattanooga as the location for the new [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|plant]].<ref>[http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jul/16/chattanooga-best-fit-vw-ceo-says/?volkswagen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716161818/http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jul/16/chattanooga-best-fit-vw-ceo-says/?volkswagen |date=July 16, 2011 }} Chattanooga Times and Free Press.com</ref>  This $1 billion investment was expected to result in production of about 150,000 cars a year by its slated opening in 2011, playing a major role in the company's strategy to gain more than 6% of the car market, or about 800,000 cars on top of the 230,000 it produced in America in 2007, by 2018.<ref name=\"ausmotive.com\"/><ref name=\"timesfreepress.com\">[http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jul/22/chattanooga-vw-connection-here-more-just-cars/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803190649/http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jul/22/chattanooga-vw-connection-here-more-just-cars/ |date=August 3, 2008 }} Chattanooga Times and Free Press.com</ref> This plant also became Volkswagen Group of America's manufacturing headquarters in the U.S..<ref name=\"timesfreepress.com\"/> The plant was inaugurated on May 24, 2011.<ref name=\"inaug\">{{cite press release|title=Volkswagen Inaugurates New Plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee|url=http://media.vw.com/press_releases/inaugurate-chattanooga-plant|publisher=Volkswagen|date=May 24, 2011|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729035357/http://media.vw.com/press_releases/inaugurate-chattanooga-plant|archivedate=July 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  |url= http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2011/05/darth-vader-star-wars-the-force-volkswagen-chattanooga-passat/1 |title= Pint-sized Darth Vader blesses Volkswagen's U.S. factory |last= Woodyard |first= Chris |work=USA Today |date= May 24, 2011 |accessdate= 2011-05-24}}</ref>\n\n==Current US facilities==\nAs of March 2018, Volkswagen Group of America has the following 20 \"Operational Facilities\" across the US:<ref name=\"Group Overview\"/>\n*[[Auburn Hills, Michigan]] \u2013 Customer Relations and After Sales Support Center, Information Technology & Services\n*[[Herndon, Virginia]] \u2013 Corporate Headquarters\n*[[Hillsboro, Oregon]] \u2013 VW Credit, Inc.

The [[Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant]] was inaugurated on May 24, 2011, and currently builds the US-spec [[Volkswagen Passat NMS|Volkswagen Passat]] and in 2017 started production of the Volkswagen Atlas.<ref name=\"Chattanooga Times Free Press\">[http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2011/may/24/vw-ushers-new-era-us-its-chattanooga-plant/] Chattanooga Times Free Press</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\nFormed in October 1955 in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]], to standardize dealership service in the United States, it grew to 909 Volkswagen [[Car dealership|dealer]]s in the US by 1965 under the leadership of Dr. [[Carl Hahn]]. Under him and his successor as president of Volkswagen of America, [[J. Stuart Perkins]], VW's U.S. sales grew to 569,696 cars in 1970, an all-time peak, when Volkswagen captured 7 percent of the U.S. car market and had over a thousand American dealerships.  The [[Volkswagen Beetle]] was the company's best seller in the United States by a wide margin.\n\nFrom then on, however, intense competition from American and Japanese automakers caused VW sales in America to fall as much as 87 percent between 1970 and 1992, despite the introduction of new front-drive models in 1975 to replace the Beetle and its rear-engined, air-cooled stablemates.  As a result, the number of dealerships in the U.S. was also reduced to 630 by the mid-1990s.  As of 2007, there were 596 operating Volkswagen dealerships in the country.\n\n===Westmoreland and Auburn Hills===\nVWoA inaugurated the [[Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant]] near [[New Stanton, Pennsylvania]], in 1978. This was the first modern venture by a foreign automaker at making cars in the United States. In 1988, the plant was closed. In the early 1980s, the manufacturing division and the sales division were merged, and Volkswagen of America moved to [[Troy, Michigan]], as a result, settling in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]], in 1991 ({{Coord|42|38|43.2|N|83|12|55.4|W|region:US-MI_type:landmark|name=VWoA former HQ at Auburn Hills}}).\n\n===1990s uncertainties===\nVolkswagen of America's sales hit rock bottom in 1993, with fewer than 50,000 cars sold that year. Sales began to recover the following year with the introduction of the third generation of the Golf and Jetta.  By the end of the decade, thanks to effective advertising and the launch of more competitive new products, including the [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]] in 1998, the VW brand was back on firmer ground.  Volkswagen of America went on to sell 355,648 cars in 2001, its best year since 1973.\n\n===2000s===\nIn the 2000s sales tapered off somewhat due to competition, quality issues and delays in product introductions, and VW's U.S. sales for 2005 totaled 224,195 \u2013 a reduction of about 37 percent from four years earlier.  New models for the 2006 and 2007 model years, such as the [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]], [[Volkswagen Rabbit|Rabbit]], and [[Volkswagen GTI|GTI]] resulted in a sales growth of 4.9% for 2006 with sales of 235,140 vehicles.  [[Profit (accounting)|Profitability]] still remained an issue, though; Volkswagen of America had not turned a profit for its parent company since 2002.  In January 2007, Volkswagen of America president Adrian Hallmark publicly stated{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} that he planned to get the subsidiary back to profitability in two to three years.  He hoped to introduce new models for North America, and develop new marketing to encompass the whole brand as well as individual cars.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Stefan Jacoby soon replaced him, and Volkswagen of America continued to look at new products to add to its lineup.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn the meantime, a new advertising agency, [[Crispin Porter + Bogusky]], helped rejuvenate VW's presence in the U.S. as well.  Its ads for the fifth-generation GTI have sparked interest in the brand, not seen since the launch of the New Beetle, and ads for the fifth-generation Golf/Rabbit hatchback translated into initial strong sales for that model.  Due to new air pollution rules promulgated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA), the [[Diesel engine|diesel]] powered VWs with [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]]-[[Unit Injector|PD]] technology could no longer be produced after December 31, 2006.  For the 2009 model year, VW introduced a new generation of diesels, based on [[common rail]] technology.  These would meet air pollution standards in all 50 states. The first of these units was made available for sale in August 2008. VW sold 2050 Jetta Sedan TDIs and 361 Jetta Sportwagen TDIs that first month.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Volkswagen was later charged with three felonies and fined $25 billion for defrauding the American government when it was discovered that their vehicles were only passing laboratory emissions testing due to company tampering of their system\u2019s internal software.\n\nIn October 2009, Interpublic Group's Deutsch, Los Angeles, the ad agency of renowned ad man Donny Deutsch, won Volkswagen's American advertising account - fourteen years after Deutsch had tried for VW's advertising business against Arnold Advertising.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130822020117/http://www.forbes.com/2009/10/23/volkswagen-deutsch-cmo-network-deutsch.html] www.forbes.com</ref>\n\n===New headquarters in Virginia===\nOn September 6, 2007, Volkswagen of America announced it would relocate its North American headquarters to [[Herndon, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Volkswagen of America, Inc.

The company anticipated that 600 of the 1,400 staff would remain at Auburn Hills in the call center and technical services positions, while 400 jobs would transferred to Virginia.  About 150 employees in Michigan were expected to move to Herndon, Volkswagen of America President and CEO Stefan Jacoby said.  The four hundred remaining jobs were to be cut.\n\nThe state of Virginia, among 14 locations that Volkswagen of America considered for the move, offered Volkswagen $6 million in incentives that will be awarded pending Volkswagen's fulfillment of employment and other various quotas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n===New manufacturing plant===\nOn July 15, 2008, after an intense, months-long battle between [[Huntsville, Alabama]], a site in [[Michigan]] and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], the company's supervisory board chose Chattanooga as the location for the new [[list of Volkswagen Group factories|plant]].<ref>[http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jul/16/chattanooga-best-fit-vw-ceo-says/?volkswagen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716161818/http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jul/16/chattanooga-best-fit-vw-ceo-says/?volkswagen |date=July 16, 2011 }} Chattanooga Times and Free Press.com</ref>  This $1 billion investment was expected to result in production of about 150,000 cars a year by its slated opening in 2011, playing a major role in the company's strategy to gain more than 6% of the car market, or about 800,000 cars on top of the 230,000 it produced in America in 2007, by 2018.<ref name=\"ausmotive.com\"/><ref name=\"timesfreepress.com\">[http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jul/22/chattanooga-vw-connection-here-more-just-cars/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803190649/http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jul/22/chattanooga-vw-connection-here-more-just-cars/ |date=August 3, 2008 }} Chattanooga Times and Free Press.com</ref> This plant also became Volkswagen Group of America's manufacturing headquarters in the U.S..<ref name=\"timesfreepress.com\"/> The plant was inaugurated on May 24, 2011.<ref name=\"inaug\">{{cite press release|title=Volkswagen Inaugurates New Plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee|url=http://media.vw.com/press_releases/inaugurate-chattanooga-plant|publisher=Volkswagen|date=May 24, 2011|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729035357/http://media.vw.com/press_releases/inaugurate-chattanooga-plant|archivedate=July 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  |url= http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2011/05/darth-vader-star-wars-the-force-volkswagen-chattanooga-passat/1 |title= Pint-sized Darth Vader blesses Volkswagen's U.S. factory |last= Woodyard |first= Chris |work=USA Today |date= May 24, 2011 |accessdate= 2011-05-24}}</ref>\n\n==Current US facilities==\nAs of March 2018, Volkswagen Group of America has the following 20 \"Operational Facilities\" across the US:<ref name=\"Group Overview\"/>\n*[[Auburn Hills, Michigan]] \u2013 Customer Relations and After Sales Support Center, Information Technology & Services\n*[[Herndon, Virginia]] \u2013 Corporate Headquarters\n*[[Hillsboro, Oregon]] \u2013 VW Credit, Inc.

She won an Academy Award for her starring role in [[Kitty Foyle (film)|''Kitty Foyle'']] (1940), but is best remembered for performing during the 1930s in [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]'s musical films (partnered with [[Fred Astaire]]). Her career continued on stage, radio, and television throughout much of the 20th century.\n\nBorn in [[Independence, Missouri]], and raised in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], Rogers and her family moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas]], when she was nine years old. After winning a 1925 Charleston dance contest<ref name=\":0\" /> that launched a successful [[vaudeville]] career, she gained recognition as a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actress for her debut stage role in ''[[Girl Crazy]]''. This led to a contract with [[Paramount Pictures]], which ended after five films. Rogers had her first successful film role as a supporting actress in ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933). Rogers made nine films in the 1930s with Astaire, which were some of her biggest successes such as ''[[Swing Time (film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936) and ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935). After two commercial failures with Astaire, Rogers began to branch out into dramatic and comedy films. Her acting was well received by critics and audiences as she became one of the biggest box-office draws and highest paid actresses of the 1940s. Her performance in ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'' (1940) won her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-ginger-rogers-19950426-story.html| title=From the Archives: Movie Great Ginger Rogers Dies at 83| last=Oliver| first=Myrna| date=April 26, 1995| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| access-date=2018-01-15| language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nRogers\u2019 popularity had peaked by the end of the decade. She reunited with Astaire in 1949 in the commercially successful ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]''. After an unsuccessful period in the 1950s, Rogers returned to Broadway in 1965, playing the lead role in ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' More lead roles on Broadway followed, along with her stage directorial debut in 1985 on an off-Broadway production of ''[[Babes in Arms]]''. Rogers also made television acting appearances until 1987. In 1992, Rogers was recognized at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]. She died of a [[heart attack]] in 1995, at the age of 83.\n\nRogers is associated with the phrase \"backwards and in high heels\", which is attributed to [[Bob Thaves]]' ''[[Frank and Ernest (comic strip)|Frank and Ernest]]'' 1982 cartoon with the caption \"Sure he [Astaire] was great, but don't forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did...backwards and in high heels\".

During her long career, Rogers made 73 films, and her musical films with Fred Astaire are credited with revolutionizing the genre. Rogers was a major [[movie star]] during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]], and is often considered an American icon. She ranks number 14 on the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars]] list of female stars of classic American cinema.

Ginger took the surname Rogers, although she was never legally adopted. They lived in [[Fort Worth]]. Her mother became a theater critic for a local newspaper, the ''Fort Worth Record''. She attended, but did not graduate from, Fort Worth's Central High School (later renamed [[R.L. Paschal High School]]).\n\nAs a teenager, Rogers thought of becoming a school teacher, but with her mother's interest in Hollywood and the theater, her early exposure to the theater increased. Waiting for her mother in the wings of the Majestic Theatre, she began to sing and dance along with the performers on stage.<ref>{{cite news| title=Ginger Rogers \u2013 Actress and Singer| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-london/plain/A42130333| work=BBC News| accessdate=3 August 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128025947/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-london/plain/A42130333| archive-date=28 January 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Vaudeville and Broadway ===\nRogers' entertainment career began when the traveling [[vaudeville]] act of [[Eddie Foy, Sr.|Eddie Foy]] came to Fort Worth and needed a quick stand-in.

They formed a short-lived vaudeville double act known as \"Ginger and Pepper\". The marriage was over within months, and she went back to touring with her mother. When the tour got to New York City, she stayed, getting radio singing jobs and then her Broadway debut in the musical ''[[Top Speed (film)|Top Speed]]'', which opened on [[Christmas]] Day, 1929.\n\nWithin two weeks of opening in ''Top Speed'', Rogers was chosen to star on Broadway in ''[[Girl Crazy]]'' by [[George Gershwin]] and [[Ira Gershwin]]. Fred Astaire was hired to help the dancers with their choreography. Her appearance in ''Girl Crazy'' made her an overnight star at the age of 19.\n\n=== Early film roles ===\n[[File:42nd-Street-Merkel-Keeler-Rogers.jpg|thumb|[[Una Merkel]], [[Ruby Keeler]], and Ginger Rogers in ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933)]]\nRogers' first movie roles were in a trio of short films made in 1929\u2014''Night in the Dormitory'', ''A Day of a Man of Affairs'', and ''Campus Sweethearts''. In 1930, [[Paramount Pictures]] signed her to a seven-year contract.\n\nRogers soon got herself out of the Paramount contract\u2014under which she had made five feature films at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios|Astoria Studios]] in [[Astoria, Queens]]\u2014and moved with her mother to Hollywood. When she got to California, she signed a three-picture deal with [[Path\u00e9 Exchange]]. Two of her pictures at Path\u00e9 were ''[[Suicide Fleet]]'' (1931) and ''[[Carnival Boat]]'' (1932) in which she played opposite future Hopalong Cassidy star, [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]]. Rogers also made feature films for Warner Bros., Monogram, and Fox in 1932, and was named one of 15 [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]]. She then made a significant breakthrough as Anytime Annie in the [[Warner Bros.]] film ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933). She went on to make a series of films at Warner Bros. most notably in ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]''   where her solo, \"We're In The Money\", included a verse in [[Pig Latin]]. She then moved to [[RKO Studios]], was put under contract and started work on [[Flying Down to Rio|\"''Flying Down To Rio\"'']]'','' a picture starring [[Dolores del R\u00edo|Dolores Del Rio]] and [[Gene Raymond]] but it was soon stolen by Rogers and Broadway star [[Fred Astaire]].\n\n=== 1933\u20131939: Astaire and Rogers ===\nRogers was known for her partnership with Fred Astaire. Together, from 1933 to 1939, they made nine musical films at RKO: ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933), ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' (1934), ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936), ''[[Swing Time (film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936), ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'' (1937), ''[[Carefree (film)|Carefree]]'' (1938), and ''[[The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle]]'' (1939). ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'' (1949) was produced later at MGM. They revolutionized the Hollywood musical by introducing dance routines of unprecedented elegance and virtuosity with sweeping long shots set to songs specially composed for them by the greatest popular song composers of the day. One such composer was [[Cole Porter]] with [[Night and Day (song)|\"Night and Day\"]], a song Astaire sang to Rogers with the line \"...you are the one\" in two of their movies, being particularly poignant in their last pairing of ''The Barkleys of Broadway.''\n\n[[File:fredginger.jpg|thumb|left|Rogers, with her frequent co-star [[Fred Astaire]], in the film ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935)]]\n\n[[Arlene Croce]], [[Hermes Pan]], Hannah Hyam, and [[John Mueller]] all consider Rogers to have been Astaire's finest dance partner, principally because of her ability to combine dancing skills, natural beauty, and exceptional abilities as a dramatic actress and comedian, thus truly complementing Astaire, a peerless dancer. The resulting song and dance partnership enjoyed a unique credibility in the eyes of audiences.\n\nOf the [[Fred Astaire's solo and partnered dances|33 partnered dances]] Rogers performed with Astaire, Croce and Mueller have highlighted the infectious spontaneity of her performances in the comic numbers \"[[I'll Be Hard to Handle]]\" from ''Roberta'', \"[[I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket]]\" from ''Follow the Fleet'', and \"[[Pick Yourself Up]]\" from ''Swing Time''. They also point to the use Astaire made of her remarkably flexible back in classic romantic dances such as \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\" from ''Roberta'', \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\" from ''Top Hat'', and \"[[Let's Face the Music and Dance]]\" from ''Follow the Fleet''.\n\nAlthough the dance routines were choreographed by Astaire and his collaborator [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]], both have testified to her consummate professionalism, even during periods of intense strain, as she tried to juggle her many other contractual film commitments with the punishing rehearsal schedules of Astaire, who made at most two films in any one year. In 1986, shortly before his death, Astaire remarked, \"All the girls I ever danced with thought they couldn't do it, but of course they could. So they always cried. All except Ginger. No, no, Ginger never cried\".<ref>{{cite web| last=Crowther| first=Linnea| title=Ginger Never Cried| url=http://www.legacy.com/news/celebrity-deaths/article/ginger-never-cried| accessdate=August 26, 2019| year=2013}}</ref>\n\nJohn Mueller summed up Rogers' abilities as: \"Rogers was outstanding among Astaire's partners, not because she was superior to others as a dancer, but, because, as a skilled, intuitive actress, she was cagey enough to realize that acting did not stop when dancing began...the reason so many women have fantasized about dancing with Fred Astaire is that Ginger Rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable\".<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_wjtqH6YvsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=epstein+fred+astaire&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjSx5XAjaHkAhUIKKwKHT-6COUQ6AEwAHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=rogers%20conveyed%20impression&f=false|title=Fred Astaire| last=Epstein| first=Joseph| date=May 29, 2012| publisher=Yale University Press| isbn=978-0-300-17352-9| page=133}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Dick Richards, in his book ''Ginger: Salute to a Star'', quoted Astaire saying to Raymond Rohauer, curator at the New York Gallery of Modern Art, \"Ginger was brilliantly effective. She made everything work for her. Actually she made things very fine for both of us and she deserves most of the credit for our success.\"\n\nIn a 1976 episode of the popular British talk-show [[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]] (Season 5-Episode 24), host [[Sir Michael Parkinson]] asked Astaire who his favorite dancing partner was. Astaire answered, \"...Ginger. She was the one. You know, the most effective partner I ever had. Everyone knows.\"\n\nIn her classic 1930s musicals with Astaire, Ginger Rogers, co-billed with him, was paid less than Fred, the creative force behind the dances, who also received 10% of the profits. She was also paid less than many of the supporting \"farceurs\" billed beneath her, in spite of her much more central role in the films' great financial successes. This was personally grating to her and had effects upon her relationships at RKO, especially with director [[Mark Sandrich]], whose purported disrespect of Rogers prompted a sharp letter of reprimand from producer [[Pandro Berman]], which she deemed important enough to publish in her autobiography. Rogers fought hard for her contract and salary rights and for better films and scripts.\n\nAfter 15 months apart and with RKO facing bankruptcy, the studio paired Fred and Ginger for another movie titled ''Carefree'', but it lost money. Next came ''The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle,'' based on a true story, but the serious plot and tragic ending resulted in the worst box-office receipts of any of their films. This was driven not by diminished popularity, but by the hard 1930s economic reality. The production costs of musicals, always significantly more costly than regular features, continued to increase at a much faster rate than admissions.\n\n=== 1933\u20131939: Rogers without Astaire ===\n\nBoth before and immediately after her dancing and acting partnership with Fred Astaire ended, Rogers starred in a number of successful nonmusical films. ''[[Stage Door]]'' (1937) demonstrated her dramatic capacity, as the loquacious yet vulnerable girl next door, a tough-minded theatrical hopeful, opposite [[Katharine Hepburn]]. Successful comedies included ''[[Vivacious Lady]]'' (1938) with [[James Stewart]], ''[[Fifth Avenue Girl]]'' (1939), where she played an out-of-work girl sucked into the lives of a wealthy family, and ''[[Bachelor Mother]]'' (1939), with [[David Niven]], in which she played a shop girl who is falsely thought to have abandoned her baby.\n\nIn 1934, Rogers sued [[Sylvia of Hollywood]] for $100K for defamation.

She enjoyed considerable success during the early 1940s, and was RKO's hottest property during this period. In ''[[Roxie Hart]]'' (1942), based on the same play which later served as the template for the musical ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', Rogers played a wisecracking flapper in a love triangle on trial for the murder of her lover; set in the era of prohibition. Most of the film takes place in a women's jail.\n\nIn the neorealist ''[[Primrose Path (film)|Primrose Path]]'' (1940), directed by [[Gregory La Cava]], she played a prostitute's daughter trying to avoid family pressure into following the fate of her mother. Further highlights of this period included ''[[Tom, Dick and Harry (1941 film)|Tom, Dick, and Harry]]'', a 1941 comedy in which she dreams of marrying three different men; ''[[I'll Be Seeing You (1944 film)|I'll Be Seeing You]]'' (1944), with [[Joseph Cotten]]; and [[Billy Wilder]]'s first Hollywood feature film: ''[[The Major and the Minor]]'' (1942), in which she played a woman who masquerades as a 12-year-old to get a cheap train ticket and finds herself obliged to continue the ruse for an extended period. This film featured a performance by Rogers' real mother, Lela, playing her film mother.\n\nAfter becoming a free agent, Rogers made hugely successful films with other studios in the mid-'40s, including ''[[Tender Comrade]]'' (1943), ''[[Lady in the Dark (film)|Lady in the Dark]]'' (1944), and ''[[Week-End at the Waldorf]]'' (1945), and became the highest-paid performer in Hollywood. However, by the end of the decade, her film career had peaked. [[Arthur Freed]] reunited her with Fred Astaire in ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'' in 1949, when Judy Garland was unable to appear in the role that was to have reunited her with her ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' co-star.\n\n=== Later career ===\nRogers' film career entered a period of gradual decline in the 1950s, as parts for older actresses became more difficult to obtain, but she still scored with some solid movies. She starred in ''[[Storm Warning (1951 film)|Storm Warning]]'' (1950) with [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Doris Day]], a noir, anti-[[Ku Klux Klan]] film by Warner Bros. In 1952 Rogers starred in two comedies featuring [[Marilyn Monroe]], ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'' with [[Cary Grant]], directed by [[Howard Hawks]], and ''[[We're Not Married!]].'' She followed those with a role in ''[[Dreamboat (film)|Dreamboat]]'' alongside [[Clifton Webb]], as his wife. She played the female lead in ''[[Tight Spot]]'' (1955), a mystery thriller, with [[Edward G. Robinson]]. After a series of unremarkable films, she scored a great popular success on Broadway in 1965, playing Dolly Levi in the long-running ''Hello, Dolly!''.<ref>{{cite news| last=Chapin| first=Louis| title=Ginger Rogers' shining Dolly| newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]| date=August 25, 1965}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Monkey Business trailer.JPG|thumb|<center> Ginger Rogers with Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe in ''Monkey Business'' (1952)</center>]]\nIn later life, Rogers remained on good terms with Astaire; she presented him with a special [[Academy Award]] in 1950, and they were copresenters of individual Academy Awards in 1967, during which they elicited a standing ovation when they came on stage in an impromptu dance. In 1969, she had the lead role in another long-running popular production, ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'', from the book by [[Jerome Lawrence]] and [[Robert Edwin Lee]], with music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], at the [[Theatre Royal Drury Lane]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] of [[London]], arriving for the role on the liner ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' from New York City. Her docking there occasioned the maximum of pomp and ceremony at [[Southampton]]. She became the highest-paid performer in the history of the West End up to that time. The production ran for 14 months and featured a royal command performance for [[Queen Elizabeth II]].\n\nFrom the 1950s onward, Rogers made occasional appearances on television, even substituting for a vacationing [[Hal March]] on ''[[The $64,000 Question]]''. In the later years of her career, she made guest appearances in three different series by [[Aaron Spelling]]: ''[[The Love Boat]]'' (1979), ''[[Glitter (TV series)|Glitter]]'' (1984), and ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'' (1987), which was her final screen appearance as an actress. In 1985, Rogers fulfilled a long-standing wish to direct when she directed the musical ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' off-Broadway in [[Tarrytown, New York]], at 74 years old. It was produced by Michael Lipton and Robert Kennedy of Kennedy Lipton Productions. The production starred Broadway talents Donna Theodore, Carleton Carpenter, James Brennan, [[Randy Skinner]], [[Karen Ziemba]], Dwight Edwards, and Kim Morgan. It is also noted in her autobiography ''Ginger, My Story''.\n\nThe [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center]] honored Ginger Rogers in December 1992. This event, which was shown on television, was somewhat marred when Astaire's widow, Robyn Smith, who permitted clips of Astaire dancing with Rogers to be shown for free at the function itself, was unable to come to terms with [[CBS Television]] for broadcast rights to the clips (all previous rights-holders having donated broadcast rights'' gratis'').<ref>{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/1992/film/news/astaire-footage-withheld-from-honors-102225/| title=Astaire footage withheld from Honors| last=Wharton| first=Dennis| work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date=1992-12-18| accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref>\n\nFor her contributions to the motion picture industry, Rogers has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6772 Hollywood Boulevard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkoffame.com/ginger-rogers |title=Ginger Rogers Inducted to the Walk of Fame |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |date=February 8, 1960 |accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n[[File:Film star Ginger Rogers and her husband 1950s.jpg|thumb|Rogers with [[Jacques Bergerac]] in the 1950s]]\nRogers, an only child, maintained a close relationship with her mother, Lela Rogers, throughout her life.

They divorced in 1931, having separated soon after the wedding. Ginger dated [[Mervyn LeRoy]] in 1932, but they ended the relationship and remained friends until his death in 1987. In 1934, she married actor [[Lew Ayres]] (1908\u201396). They divorced seven years later.\n\nIn 1943, Rogers married her third husband, [[Jack Briggs (actor)|Jack Briggs]], who was a U.S. Marine. Upon his return from World War II, Briggs showed no interest in continuing his incipient Hollywood career. They divorced in 1949. In 1953, she married [[Jacques Bergerac]], a French actor 16 years her junior, whom she met on a trip to Paris. A lawyer in France, he came to Hollywood with her and became an actor. They divorced in 1957. Her fifth and final husband was director and producer [[William Marshall (bandleader)|William Marshall]]. They married in 1961 and divorced in 1969, after his bouts with alcohol and the financial collapse of their joint film production company in [[Jamaica]].\n[[File:Ginger_Rogers_1993.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rogers in 1993]]\nRogers was lifelong friends with actresses [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Bette Davis]]. She appeared with Ball in an episode of ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' on November 22, 1971, in which Rogers danced the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] for the first time in many years. Rogers starred in one of the earliest films co-directed and co-scripted by a woman, [[Wanda Tuchock]]'s ''Finishing School'' (1934). Rogers maintained a close friendship with her cousin, writer/socialite [[Phyllis Fraser]], wife of [[Random House]] publisher [[Bennett Cerf]], but was not [[Rita Hayworth]]'s natural cousin, as has been reported. Hayworth's maternal uncle, [[Vinton Hayworth]], was married to Rogers' maternal aunt, Jean Owens.\n\nShe was raised a [[Christian Scientist]] and remained a lifelong adherent. She devoted a great deal of time in her autobiography to the importance of her faith throughout her career.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.reelclassics.com/Actresses/Ginger/ginger-article4.htm| title=From the Archives: Final step: Ginger Rogers, 1911-1995| first=Matt| last=Zoller| website=Reel Classics}}</ref>  Rogers' mother died in 1977.

On July 16, 1994, Ginger and her secretary, Roberta Olden, visited Independence, Missouri to appear at the Ginger Rogers' Day celebration presented by the city.

'''Virginia Katherine McMath'''; July 16, 1911 \u2013 April 25, 1995) was an American actress, dancer, and singer. She won an Academy Award for her starring role in [[Kitty Foyle (film)|''Kitty Foyle'']] (1940), but is best remembered for performing during the 1930s in [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]'s musical films (partnered with [[Fred Astaire]]). Her career continued on stage, radio, and television throughout much of the 20th century.\n\nBorn in [[Independence, Missouri]], and raised in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], Rogers and her family moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas]], when she was nine years old. After winning a 1925 Charleston dance contest<ref name=\":0\" /> that launched a successful [[vaudeville]] career, she gained recognition as a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actress for her debut stage role in ''[[Girl Crazy]]''. This led to a contract with [[Paramount Pictures]], which ended after five films. Rogers had her first successful film role as a supporting actress in ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933). Rogers made nine films in the 1930s with Astaire, which were some of her biggest successes such as ''[[Swing Time (film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936) and ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935). After two commercial failures with Astaire, Rogers began to branch out into dramatic and comedy films. Her acting was well received by critics and audiences as she became one of the biggest box-office draws and highest paid actresses of the 1940s. Her performance in ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'' (1940) won her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-ginger-rogers-19950426-story.html| title=From the Archives: Movie Great Ginger Rogers Dies at 83| last=Oliver| first=Myrna| date=April 26, 1995| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| access-date=2018-01-15| language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nRogers\u2019 popularity had peaked by the end of the decade.

(musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' More lead roles on Broadway followed, along with her stage directorial debut in 1985 on an off-Broadway production of ''[[Babes in Arms]]''. Rogers also made television acting appearances until 1987. In 1992, Rogers was recognized at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]. She died of a [[heart attack]] in 1995, at the age of 83.\n\nRogers is associated with the phrase \"backwards and in high heels\", which is attributed to [[Bob Thaves]]' ''[[Frank and Ernest (comic strip)|Frank and Ernest]]'' 1982 cartoon with the caption \"Sure he [Astaire] was great, but don't forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did...backwards and in high heels\".

She attended, but did not graduate from, Fort Worth's Central High School (later renamed [[R.L.

They formed a short-lived vaudeville double act known as \"Ginger and Pepper\". The marriage was over within months, and she went back to touring with her mother. When the tour got to New York City, she stayed, getting radio singing jobs and then her Broadway debut in the musical ''[[Top Speed (film)|Top Speed]]'', which opened on [[Christmas]] Day, 1929.\n\nWithin two weeks of opening in ''Top Speed'', Rogers was chosen to star on Broadway in ''[[Girl Crazy]]'' by [[George Gershwin]] and [[Ira Gershwin]]. Fred Astaire was hired to help the dancers with their choreography. Her appearance in ''Girl Crazy'' made her an overnight star at the age of 19.\n\n=== Early film roles ===\n[[File:42nd-Street-Merkel-Keeler-Rogers.jpg|thumb|[[Una Merkel]], [[Ruby Keeler]], and Ginger Rogers in ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933)]]\nRogers' first movie roles were in a trio of short films made in 1929\u2014''Night in the Dormitory'', ''A Day of a Man of Affairs'', and ''Campus Sweethearts''. In 1930, [[Paramount Pictures]] signed her to a seven-year contract.\n\nRogers soon got herself out of the Paramount contract\u2014under which she had made five feature films at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios|Astoria Studios]] in [[Astoria, Queens]]\u2014and moved with her mother to Hollywood. When she got to California, she signed a three-picture deal with [[Path\u00e9 Exchange]]. Two of her pictures at Path\u00e9 were ''[[Suicide Fleet]]'' (1931) and ''[[Carnival Boat]]'' (1932) in which she played opposite future Hopalong Cassidy star, [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]]. Rogers also made feature films for Warner Bros., Monogram, and Fox in 1932, and was named one of 15 [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]]. She then made a significant breakthrough as Anytime Annie in the [[Warner Bros.]] film ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'' (1933). She went on to make a series of films at Warner Bros. most notably in ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]''   where her solo, \"We're In The Money\", included a verse in [[Pig Latin]]. She then moved to [[RKO Studios]], was put under contract and started work on [[Flying Down to Rio|\"''Flying Down To Rio\"'']]'','' a picture starring [[Dolores del R\u00edo|Dolores Del Rio]] and [[Gene Raymond]] but it was soon stolen by Rogers and Broadway star [[Fred Astaire]].\n\n=== 1933\u20131939: Astaire and Rogers ===\nRogers was known for her partnership with Fred Astaire. Together, from 1933 to 1939, they made nine musical films at RKO: ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933), ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' (1934), ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936), ''[[Swing Time (film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936), ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'' (1937), ''[[Carefree (film)|Carefree]]'' (1938), and ''[[The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle]]'' (1939). ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'' (1949) was produced later at MGM. They revolutionized the Hollywood musical by introducing dance routines of unprecedented elegance and virtuosity with sweeping long shots set to songs specially composed for them by the greatest popular song composers of the day. One such composer was [[Cole Porter]] with [[Night and Day (song)|\"Night and Day\"]], a song Astaire sang to Rogers with the line \"...you are the one\" in two of their movies, being particularly poignant in their last pairing of ''The Barkleys of Broadway.''\n\n[[File:fredginger.jpg|thumb|left|Rogers, with her frequent co-star [[Fred Astaire]], in the film ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935)]]\n\n[[Arlene Croce]], [[Hermes Pan]], Hannah Hyam, and [[John Mueller]] all consider Rogers to have been Astaire's finest dance partner, principally because of her ability to combine dancing skills, natural beauty, and exceptional abilities as a dramatic actress and comedian, thus truly complementing Astaire, a peerless dancer. The resulting song and dance partnership enjoyed a unique credibility in the eyes of audiences.\n\nOf the [[Fred Astaire's solo and partnered dances|33 partnered dances]] Rogers performed with Astaire, Croce and Mueller have highlighted the infectious spontaneity of her performances in the comic numbers \"[[I'll Be Hard to Handle]]\" from ''Roberta'', \"[[I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket]]\" from ''Follow the Fleet'', and \"[[Pick Yourself Up]]\" from ''Swing Time''. They also point to the use Astaire made of her remarkably flexible back in classic romantic dances such as \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\" from ''Roberta'', \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\" from ''Top Hat'', and \"[[Let's Face the Music and Dance]]\" from ''Follow the Fleet''.\n\nAlthough the dance routines were choreographed by Astaire and his collaborator [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]], both have testified to her consummate professionalism, even during periods of intense strain, as she tried to juggle her many other contractual film commitments with the punishing rehearsal schedules of Astaire, who made at most two films in any one year. In 1986, shortly before his death, Astaire remarked, \"All the girls I ever danced with thought they couldn't do it, but of course they could. So they always cried. All except Ginger. No, no, Ginger never cried\".<ref>{{cite web| last=Crowther| first=Linnea| title=Ginger Never Cried| url=http://www.legacy.com/news/celebrity-deaths/article/ginger-never-cried| accessdate=August 26, 2019| year=2013}}</ref>\n\nJohn Mueller summed up Rogers' abilities as: \"Rogers was outstanding among Astaire's partners, not because she was superior to others as a dancer, but, because, as a skilled, intuitive actress, she was cagey enough to realize that acting did not stop when dancing began...the reason so many women have fantasized about dancing with Fred Astaire is that Ginger Rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable\".<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_wjtqH6YvsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=epstein+fred+astaire&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjSx5XAjaHkAhUIKKwKHT-6COUQ6AEwAHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=rogers%20conveyed%20impression&f=false|title=Fred Astaire| last=Epstein| first=Joseph| date=May 29, 2012| publisher=Yale University Press| isbn=978-0-300-17352-9| page=133}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Dick Richards, in his book ''Ginger: Salute to a Star'', quoted Astaire saying to Raymond Rohauer, curator at the New York Gallery of Modern Art, \"Ginger was brilliantly effective. She made everything work for her. Actually she made things very fine for both of us and she deserves most of the credit for our success.\"\n\nIn a 1976 episode of the popular British talk-show [[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]] (Season 5-Episode 24), host [[Sir Michael Parkinson]] asked Astaire who his favorite dancing partner was. Astaire answered, \"...Ginger. She was the one. You know, the most effective partner I ever had. Everyone knows.\"\n\nIn her classic 1930s musicals with Astaire, Ginger Rogers, co-billed with him, was paid less than Fred, the creative force behind the dances, who also received 10% of the profits. She was also paid less than many of the supporting \"farceurs\" billed beneath her, in spite of her much more central role in the films' great financial successes. This was personally grating to her and had effects upon her relationships at RKO, especially with director [[Mark Sandrich]], whose purported disrespect of Rogers prompted a sharp letter of reprimand from producer [[Pandro Berman]], which she deemed important enough to publish in her autobiography. Rogers fought hard for her contract and salary rights and for better films and scripts.\n\nAfter 15 months apart and with RKO facing bankruptcy, the studio paired Fred and Ginger for another movie titled ''Carefree'', but it lost money. Next came ''The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle,'' based on a true story, but the serious plot and tragic ending resulted in the worst box-office receipts of any of their films. This was driven not by diminished popularity, but by the hard 1930s economic reality. The production costs of musicals, always significantly more costly than regular features, continued to increase at a much faster rate than admissions.\n\n=== 1933\u20131939: Rogers without Astaire ===\n\nBoth before and immediately after her dancing and acting partnership with Fred Astaire ended, Rogers starred in a number of successful nonmusical films. ''[[Stage Door]]'' (1937) demonstrated her dramatic capacity, as the loquacious yet vulnerable girl next door, a tough-minded theatrical hopeful, opposite [[Katharine Hepburn]]. Successful comedies included ''[[Vivacious Lady]]'' (1938) with [[James Stewart]], ''[[Fifth Avenue Girl]]'' (1939), where she played an out-of-work girl sucked into the lives of a wealthy family, and ''[[Bachelor Mother]]'' (1939), with [[David Niven]], in which she played a shop girl who is falsely thought to have abandoned her baby.\n\nIn 1934, Rogers sued [[Sylvia of Hollywood]] for $100K for defamation. Sylvia, Hollywood's fitness guru and radio personality, had claimed that Rogers was on Sylvia's radio show when, in fact, she was not.<ref>Interview Suit Begun By Actress: Screen Player Asks Damages, ''Los Angeles Times'', March 24, 1934.</ref>\n\nOn March 5, 1939, Rogers starred in \"Single Party Going East\", an episode of ''[[Silver Theater (radio program)|Silver Theater]]'' on [[CBS]] radio.<ref>{{cite news| title=Virovai Is Guest| url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2108716/st_ginger_rogers/| newspaper=The Nebraska State Journal| date=March 5, 1939| page=36| via=Newspapers.com| accessdate=March 31, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\n=== 1940s ===\n[[Image:Kitty_foyle_-_life_magazine.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Rogers as her character Kitty Foyle on the cover of ''Life''|''Life'' cover featuring Kitty Foyle, her Oscar-winning role]]\n\nIn 1941 Rogers won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her role in 1940's ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]''. She enjoyed considerable success during the early 1940s, and was RKO's hottest property during this period. In ''[[Roxie Hart]]'' (1942), based on the same play which later served as the template for the musical ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', Rogers played a wisecracking flapper in a love triangle on trial for the murder of her lover; set in the era of prohibition. Most of the film takes place in a women's jail.\n\nIn the neorealist ''[[Primrose Path (film)|Primrose Path]]'' (1940), directed by [[Gregory La Cava]], she played a prostitute's daughter trying to avoid family pressure into following the fate of her mother. Further highlights of this period included ''[[Tom, Dick and Harry (1941 film)|Tom, Dick, and Harry]]'', a 1941 comedy in which she dreams of marrying three different men; ''[[I'll Be Seeing You (1944 film)|I'll Be Seeing You]]'' (1944), with [[Joseph Cotten]]; and [[Billy Wilder]]'s first Hollywood feature film: ''[[The Major and the Minor]]'' (1942), in which she played a woman who masquerades as a 12-year-old to get a cheap train ticket and finds herself obliged to continue the ruse for an extended period. This film featured a performance by Rogers' real mother, Lela, playing her film mother.\n\nAfter becoming a free agent, Rogers made hugely successful films with other studios in the mid-'40s, including ''[[Tender Comrade]]'' (1943), ''[[Lady in the Dark (film)|Lady in the Dark]]'' (1944), and ''[[Week-End at the Waldorf]]'' (1945), and became the highest-paid performer in Hollywood. However, by the end of the decade, her film career had peaked. [[Arthur Freed]] reunited her with Fred Astaire in ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'' in 1949, when Judy Garland was unable to appear in the role that was to have reunited her with her ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' co-star.\n\n=== Later career ===\nRogers' film career entered a period of gradual decline in the 1950s, as parts for older actresses became more difficult to obtain, but she still scored with some solid movies. She starred in ''[[Storm Warning (1951 film)|Storm Warning]]'' (1950) with [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Doris Day]], a noir, anti-[[Ku Klux Klan]] film by Warner Bros. In 1952 Rogers starred in two comedies featuring [[Marilyn Monroe]], ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'' with [[Cary Grant]], directed by [[Howard Hawks]], and ''[[We're Not Married!]].'' She followed those with a role in ''[[Dreamboat (film)|Dreamboat]]'' alongside [[Clifton Webb]], as his wife. She played the female lead in ''[[Tight Spot]]'' (1955), a mystery thriller, with [[Edward G. Robinson]]. After a series of unremarkable films, she scored a great popular success on Broadway in 1965, playing Dolly Levi in the long-running ''Hello, Dolly!''.<ref>{{cite news| last=Chapin| first=Louis| title=Ginger Rogers' shining Dolly| newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]| date=August 25, 1965}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Monkey Business trailer.JPG|thumb|<center> Ginger Rogers with Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe in ''Monkey Business'' (1952)</center>]]\nIn later life, Rogers remained on good terms with Astaire; she presented him with a special [[Academy Award]] in 1950, and they were copresenters of individual Academy Awards in 1967, during which they elicited a standing ovation when they came on stage in an impromptu dance. In 1969, she had the lead role in another long-running popular production, ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'', from the book by [[Jerome Lawrence]] and [[Robert Edwin Lee]], with music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], at the [[Theatre Royal Drury Lane]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] of [[London]], arriving for the role on the liner ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' from New York City. Her docking there occasioned the maximum of pomp and ceremony at [[Southampton]]. She became the highest-paid performer in the history of the West End up to that time. The production ran for 14 months and featured a royal command performance for [[Queen Elizabeth II]].\n\nFrom the 1950s onward, Rogers made occasional appearances on television, even substituting for a vacationing [[Hal March]] on ''[[The $64,000 Question]]''. In the later years of her career, she made guest appearances in three different series by [[Aaron Spelling]]: ''[[The Love Boat]]'' (1979), ''[[Glitter (TV series)|Glitter]]'' (1984), and ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'' (1987), which was her final screen appearance as an actress. In 1985, Rogers fulfilled a long-standing wish to direct when she directed the musical ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' off-Broadway in [[Tarrytown, New York]], at 74 years old. It was produced by Michael Lipton and Robert Kennedy of Kennedy Lipton Productions. The production starred Broadway talents Donna Theodore, Carleton Carpenter, James Brennan, [[Randy Skinner]], [[Karen Ziemba]], Dwight Edwards, and Kim Morgan. It is also noted in her autobiography ''Ginger, My Story''.\n\nThe [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center]] honored Ginger Rogers in December 1992. This event, which was shown on television, was somewhat marred when Astaire's widow, Robyn Smith, who permitted clips of Astaire dancing with Rogers to be shown for free at the function itself, was unable to come to terms with [[CBS Television]] for broadcast rights to the clips (all previous rights-holders having donated broadcast rights'' gratis'').<ref>{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/1992/film/news/astaire-footage-withheld-from-honors-102225/| title=Astaire footage withheld from Honors| last=Wharton| first=Dennis| work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date=1992-12-18| accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref>\n\nFor her contributions to the motion picture industry, Rogers has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6772 Hollywood Boulevard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkoffame.com/ginger-rogers |title=Ginger Rogers Inducted to the Walk of Fame |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |date=February 8, 1960 |accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n[[File:Film star Ginger Rogers and her husband 1950s.jpg|thumb|Rogers with [[Jacques Bergerac]] in the 1950s]]\nRogers, an only child, maintained a close relationship with her mother, Lela Rogers, throughout her life.

They divorced in 1931, having separated soon after the wedding. Ginger dated [[Mervyn LeRoy]] in 1932, but they ended the relationship and remained friends until his death in 1987. In 1934, she married actor [[Lew Ayres]] (1908\u201396). They divorced seven years later.\n\nIn 1943, Rogers married her third husband, [[Jack Briggs (actor)|Jack Briggs]], who was a U.S. Marine. Upon his return from World War II, Briggs showed no interest in continuing his incipient Hollywood career. They divorced in 1949. In 1953, she married [[Jacques Bergerac]], a French actor 16 years her junior, whom she met on a trip to Paris. A lawyer in France, he came to Hollywood with her and became an actor. They divorced in 1957. Her fifth and final husband was director and producer [[William Marshall (bandleader)|William Marshall]]. They married in 1961 and divorced in 1969, after his bouts with alcohol and the financial collapse of their joint film production company in [[Jamaica]].\n[[File:Ginger_Rogers_1993.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rogers in 1993]]\nRogers was lifelong friends with actresses [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Bette Davis]]. She appeared with Ball in an episode of ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' on November 22, 1971, in which Rogers danced the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] for the first time in many years. Rogers starred in one of the earliest films co-directed and co-scripted by a woman, [[Wanda Tuchock]]'s ''Finishing School'' (1934). Rogers maintained a close friendship with her cousin, writer/socialite [[Phyllis Fraser]], wife of [[Random House]] publisher [[Bennett Cerf]], but was not [[Rita Hayworth]]'s natural cousin, as has been reported. Hayworth's maternal uncle, [[Vinton Hayworth]], was married to Rogers' maternal aunt, Jean Owens.\n\nShe was raised a [[Christian Scientist]] and remained a lifelong adherent.

She signed over 2,000 autographs at this event. This was one of her last public appearances.\n\nThe home was purchased in 2016 by Three Trails Cottages and restored, then transformed into a museum dedicated to Lela Owens-Rogers and Ginger Rogers. It contains memorabilia, magazines, movie posters, and many items from Ginger's ranch that Lela and Ginger owned. Several gowns that Ginger Rogers wore are on display. The museum was open seasonally from April - September, and several special events are held on the site each year. It closed in August 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.examiner.net/news/20190810/ginger-rogers-home-in-independence-set-to-close|title=Ginger Rogers home in Independence set to close|last=Genet|first=Mike|website=The Examiner of East Jackson County|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>\n\nGinger Rogers made her last public appearance on 18 March 1995, when she received the Women's International Center (WIC) Living Legacy Award.
