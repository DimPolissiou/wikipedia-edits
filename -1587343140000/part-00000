As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy, but they have been known to be susceptible to various genetic conditions and can be sensitive to certain drugs.\n\nIn all countries except the United States, the Japanese and American strains of Akita are considered two separate breeds. In the United States, however, the two strains are considered a single breed with differences in type. For a while, the American strain of Akita was known in some countries as the Great Japanese Dog. Both forms of Akita are probably best known worldwide from the true story of [[Hachik\u014d]], a loyal Akita who lived in Japan before [[World War II]].\n\n==Breed name==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | image1 =\n | alt1 = A large, orange dog on a beach, with small dark eyes and a fine appearance\n | width1 = 125\n | caption1 = A Japanese Akita\n | image2 = American-akita.jpg\n | alt2 = A large, dark gray dog with white legs and tail, with powerful features and a bulky appearance\n | width2 = 150\n | caption2 = An American Akita\n }}\nThere is debate among fanciers whether there are two separate breeds of Akita.

As a result, a lot of specimens started to lose their spitz characteristics and instead took on drop ears, straight tails, non-Japanese color (black masks, and any color other than red, white or brindle), and loose skin. A native Japanese breed known as Matagi (hunting dog) was used along with the Hokkaido Inu breed to mix back into the remaining Akita Inu to bring back the spitz phenotype and restore the Akita breed. The modern day Japanese Akita have relatively few genes from western dogs and are spitz in phenotype after the reconstruction of the breed took place, however the larger American breed of Akita largely descends from the mixed Akita before the restoration of the breed, and thus American Akita are typically mixed and not considered true Akita by the Japanese standard.<ref name=\"Aki9\">{{cite web|title=Akita Inu|url=http://japanesedogs.bulldoginformation.com/japanese-akita-inu.html|publisher=Japanesedogs|accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Akita were used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] to track prisoners of war and lost sailors.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Allsopp|first=Nigel|title=K9 Cops: Police Dogs of the World|publisher=Big Sky Publishing|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> During [[World War II]] the Akita was also crossed with [[German Shepherd]]s in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled.<ref name=JAICUK>{{cite web|title=Akita Inu Breed History|url=http://www.japaneseakita-inu.co.uk/Files/History.htm|publisher=Japanese Akita Inu Club Great Britain|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> Some were used as scouts and guards during the war.<ref name=\":1\" /> The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita, a form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show competition.<ref name=\"DVM\"/>[[File:Fels.jpg|thumb|Brindle Japanese Akitas]]\nThe story of [[Hachik\u014d]], the most revered Akita of all time, helped push the Akita into the international dog world.

As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy, but they have been known to be susceptible to various genetic conditions and can be sensitive to certain drugs.\n\nIn all countries except the United States, the Japanese and American strains of Akita are considered two separate breeds. In the United States, however, the two strains are considered a single breed with differences in type. For a while, the American strain of Akita was known in some countries as the Great Japanese Dog. Both forms of Akita are probably best known worldwide from the true story of [[Hachik\u014d]], a loyal Akita who lived in Japan before [[World War II]].\n\n==Breed name==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | image1 =\n | alt1 = A large, orange dog on a beach, with small dark eyes and a fine appearance\n | width1 = 125\n | caption1 = A Japanese Akita\n | image2 = American-akita.jpg\n | alt2 = A large, dark gray dog with white legs and tail, with powerful features and a bulky appearance\n | width2 = 150\n | caption2 = An American Akita\n }}\nThere is debate among fanciers whether there are two separate breeds of Akita.

As a result, a lot of specimens started to lose their spitz characteristics and instead took on drop ears, straight tails, non-Japanese color (black masks, and any color other than red, white or brindle), and loose skin. A native Japanese breed known as Matagi (hunting dog) was used along with the Hokkaido Inu breed to mix back into the remaining Akita Inu to bring back the spitz phenotype and restore the Akita breed. The modern day Japanese Akita have relatively few genes from western dogs and are spitz in phenotype after the reconstruction of the breed took place, however the larger American breed of Akita largely descends from the mixed Akita before the restoration of the breed, and thus American Akita are typically mixed and not considered true Akita by the Japanese standard.<ref name=\"Aki9\">{{cite web|title=Akita Inu|url=http://japanesedogs.bulldoginformation.com/japanese-akita-inu.html|publisher=Japanesedogs|accessdate=5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Akita were used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] to track prisoners of war and lost sailors.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Allsopp|first=Nigel|title=K9 Cops: Police Dogs of the World|publisher=Big Sky Publishing|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> During [[World War II]] the Akita was also crossed with [[German Shepherd]]s in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled.<ref name=JAICUK>{{cite web|title=Akita Inu Breed History|url=http://www.japaneseakita-inu.co.uk/Files/History.htm|publisher=Japanese Akita Inu Club Great Britain|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> Some were used as scouts and guards during the war.<ref name=\":1\" /> The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita, a form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show competition.<ref name=\"DVM\"/>[[File:Fels.jpg|thumb|Brindle Japanese Akitas]]\nThe story of [[Hachik\u014d]], the most revered Akita of all time, helped push the Akita into the international dog world.

It was the first ever Koodiyattam performance outside Kerala.|thumb|right|300px]] \n'''Koodiyattam''', also transliterated as '''kutiyattam''', is a traditional performing art form in the state of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is a combination of ancient [[Sanskrit theatre]] with elements of [[koothu]], an ancient Tamil performing art from the [[Sangam era]]. It is officially recognised by [[UNESCO]] as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].\n\n==Origin==\n[[Image:Koodiyattam Framed 001.jpg|thumb|alt=Koodiyattam Performance.|Koodiyattam]]\nKoodiyattam, meaning \"combined acting\" in [[Malayalam]], combines Sanskrit theatre performance with elements of traditional koothu. It is traditionally performed in temple theatres known as ''koothambalams''. It is the only surviving art form that uses drama from ancient Sanskrit theatre. It has a documented history of a thousand years in Kerala, but its origins are unknown. Koodiyattam and [[Chakyar koothu]] were among the dramatized dance worship services in the temples of ancient India, particularly Kerala. Both koodiyattam and Chakyar koothu originated from the ancient Tamil art form [[koothu]], which is mentioned several times in Sangam literature, and the epigraphs of the subsequent Pallava, [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandiyan]], Chera, and [[Chola]] periods. Inscriptions related to koothu can be seen in temples at [[Tanjore]], Tiruvidaimaruthur, Vedaranyam, [[Tiruvarur]], and Omampuliyur. They were treated as an integral part of worship services, alongside the singing of Tevaram and Prabandam hymns.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAncient kings are among those listed as authors of works for these services. There is evidence of these across the ancient subcontinent during the Chola and Pallava periods. A Pallava king called Rajasimha has been credited with authoring the play ''Kailasodharanam'' in Tamil, which has the topic of Ravana becoming subject to Siva's anger and being subdued mercilessly for this.\n\nIt is believed that Kulasekhara Varman Cheraman Perumal, an ancient king of the Chera dynasty who ruled from Mahodayapuram (modern [[Kodungallur]]), reformed koodiyattam, introducing the local language for Vidusaka and structuring the presentation of the play into well-defined units. He himself wrote two plays, ''Subhadradhananjayam'' and ''Tapatisamvarana'' and made arrangements for their presentation on stage with the help of a [[Brahmin]] friend called Tolan. These plays are still performed. Apart from these, the plays traditionally presented include ''Ascaryacudamani'' of Saktibhadra, ''Kalyanasaugandhika'' of Nilakantha, ''Bhagavadajjuka'' of [[Bodhayana]], ''Nagananda'' of Harsa, and many plays ascribed to [[Bhasa]], including ''Abhiseka'' and ''Pratima''.\n[[File:Bharat-s-tiwari-photography-IMG 6635 June 11, 2017.jpg|thumb|Koodiyattam performer Kapila Venu]]\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[Image:Mizhavu.jpg|Mizhavu kept in a ''mizhavana'' (a wooden box made especially to keep mizhavu)|thumb|left|200px]]\nTraditionally, the main musical instruments used in koodiyattam are the [[mizhavu]], [[kuzhitalam]], [[edakka]], [[kurumkuzhal]], and [[Conch (instrument)|sankhu]]. The mizhavu, the most prominent of these, is a percussion instrument that is played by a person of the Ambalavas [[Nambiar (Ambalavasi)|Nambiar caste]], accompanied by Nangyaramma playing the kuzhithalam (a type of cymbal).\n\n== Performance style ==\n[[Image:Mani Madhava Chakyar as Ravana.jpg|Koodiyattam Guru [[Mani Madhava Chakyar]] as \"Ravana\"|thumb|right|150px]]\nTraditionally, koodiyattam has been performed by [[Chakyar]]s (a [[Indian caste system|subcaste]] of Kerala [[Hindu]]s) and by [[Nangyaramma]] (women of the [[Ambalavasi]] [[Nambiar (Ambalavasi/Mizhavu)|Nambiar caste]]). The name \"koodiyattam\", meaning playing or performing together, is thought to refer to the presence of multiple actors on stage who act in rhythm with the beats of the mizhavu drummers. Alternatively, it may also be a reference to a common practice in Sanskrit drama where a single actor who has performed solo for several nights is joined by another.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shulman|first=David|title=Creating and Destroying the Universe in Twenty-Nine Nights|url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/nov/24/creating-and-destroying-universe-twenty-nine-night/|accessdate=9 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Review of Books}}</ref>\n\nThe main actor is a Chakyar who performs the ritualistic koothu and koodiyattam inside the temple or in the koothambalam. Chakyar women, [[Illotammas]], are not allowed to participate. Instead, the female roles are played by Nangyaramma. Koodiyattam performances are often lengthy and elaborate, ranging from 12 to 150 hours spread across several nights. A complete Koodiyattam performance consists of three parts. The first of these is the ''purappadu'' where an actor performs a verse along with the nritta aspect of dance. Following this is the ''nirvahanam'' where the actor, using [[abhinaya]], presents the mood of the main character of the play. Then there is the ''nirvahanam'', a retrospective, which takes the audience up to the point where the actual play begins. The final part of the performance is the ''koodiyattam'', which is the play itself. While the first two parts are solo acts, koodiyattam can have as many characters as are required to perform on the stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/theatre/article3631143.ece|title= All at home |publisher=The Hindu, 13 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe elders of the Chakyar community traditionally taught the artform to their youngsters. It was performed only by Chakyars until the 1950s. In 1955, Guru [[Mani Madhava Chakyar]] performed Kutiyattam outside the temple for the first time,<ref>* {{Citation\n |last=Bhargavinilayam \n |first=Das \n |title=Mani Madhaveeyam \n |url=http://www.kerala.gov.in/dept_culture/books.htm \n |publisher=Department of Cultural Affairs, [[Government of Kerala]] \n |year=1999 \n |isbn=81-86365-78-8 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215085741/http://www.kerala.gov.in/dept_culture/books.htm \n |archivedate=15 February 2008 \n}}\n</ref> for which he faced many problems from the hardline Chakyar community.

Also, performances can take up to forty days to complete.

Following a revival in the early twentieth century, Koodiyattam is once again facing a lack of funding, leading to a crisis in the profession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00010 |title= Kutiyattam, Sanskrit theatre}}</ref> [[UNESCO]] has called for the creation of a network of koodiyattam institutions and gurukalams to promote the transmission of the art form to future generations and for the development of new audiences besides fostering greater academic research in it.

It was the first ever Koodiyattam performance outside Kerala.|thumb|right|300px]] \n'''Koodiyattam''', also transliterated as '''kutiyattam''', is a traditional performing art form in the state of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is a combination of ancient [[Sanskrit theatre]] with elements of [[koothu]], an ancient Tamil performing art from the [[Sangam era]]. It is officially recognised by [[UNESCO]] as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].\n\n==Origin==\n[[Image:Koodiyattam Framed 001.jpg|thumb|alt=Koodiyattam Performance.|Koodiyattam]]\nKoodiyattam, meaning \"combined acting\" in [[Malayalam]], combines Sanskrit theatre performance with elements of traditional koothu. It is traditionally performed in temple theatres known as ''koothambalams''. It is the only surviving art form that uses drama from ancient Sanskrit theatre. It has a documented history of a thousand years in Kerala, but its origins are unknown. Koodiyattam and [[Chakyar koothu]] were among the dramatized dance worship services in the temples of ancient India, particularly Kerala. Both koodiyattam and Chakyar koothu originated from the ancient Tamil art form [[koothu]], which is mentioned several times in Sangam literature, and the epigraphs of the subsequent Pallava, [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandiyan]], Chera, and [[Chola]] periods. Inscriptions related to koothu can be seen in temples at [[Tanjore]], Tiruvidaimaruthur, Vedaranyam, [[Tiruvarur]], and Omampuliyur. They were treated as an integral part of worship services, alongside the singing of Tevaram and Prabandam hymns.{{Cn|date=March 2020}} \n\nAncient kings are among those listed as authors of works for these services. There is evidence of these across the ancient subcontinent during the Chola and Pallava periods. A Pallava king called Rajasimha has been credited with authoring the play ''Kailasodharanam'' in Tamil, which has the topic of Ravana becoming subject to Siva's anger and being subdued mercilessly for this. \n\nIt is believed that Kulasekhara Varman Cheraman Perumal, an ancient king of the Chera dynasty who ruled from Mahodayapuram (modern [[Kodungallur]]), reformed koodiyattam, introducing the local language for Vidusaka and structuring the presentation of the play into well-defined units. He himself wrote two plays, ''Subhadradhananjayam'' and ''Tapatisamvarana'' and made arrangements for their presentation on stage with the help of a [[Brahmin]] friend called Tolan. These plays are still performed. Apart from these, the plays traditionally presented include ''Ascaryacudamani'' of Saktibhadra, ''Kalyanasaugandhika'' of Nilakantha, ''Bhagavadajjuka'' of [[Bodhayana]], ''Nagananda'' of Harsa, and many plays ascribed to [[Bhasa]], including ''Abhiseka'' and ''Pratima''.\n[[File:Bharat-s-tiwari-photography-IMG 6635 June 11, 2017.jpg|thumb|Koodiyattam performer Kapila Venu]]\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[Image:Mizhavu.jpg|Mizhavu kept in a ''mizhavana'' (a wooden box made especially to keep mizhavu)|thumb|left|200px]]\nTraditionally, the main musical instruments used in koodiyattam are the [[mizhavu]], [[kuzhitalam]], [[edakka]], [[kurumkuzhal]], and [[Conch (instrument)|sankhu]]. The mizhavu, the most prominent of these, is a percussion instrument that is played by a person of the Ambalavas [[Nambiar (Ambalavasi)|Nambiar caste]], accompanied by Nangyaramma playing the kuzhithalam (a type of cymbal).\n\n== Performance style ==\n[[Image:Mani Madhava Chakyar as Ravana.jpg|Koodiyattam Guru [[Mani Madhava Chakyar]] as \"Ravana\"|thumb|right|150px]]\nTraditionally, koodiyattam has been performed by [[Chakyar]]s (a [[Indian caste system|subcaste]] of Kerala [[Hindu]]s) and by [[Nangyaramma]] (women of the [[Ambalavasi]] [[Nambiar (Ambalavasi/Mizhavu)|Nambiar caste]]). The name \"koodiyattam\", meaning playing or performing together, is thought to refer to the presence of multiple actors on stage who act in rhythm with the beats of the mizhavu drummers. Alternatively, it may also be a reference to a common practice in Sanskrit drama where a single actor who has performed solo for several nights is joined by another.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shulman|first=David|title=Creating and Destroying the Universe in Twenty-Nine Nights|url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/nov/24/creating-and-destroying-universe-twenty-nine-night/|accessdate=9 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Review of Books}}</ref>\n\nThe main actor is a Chakyar who performs the ritualistic koothu and koodiyattam inside the temple or in the koothambalam. Chakyar women, [[Illotammas]], are not allowed to participate. Instead, the female roles are played by Nangyaramma. Koodiyattam performances are often lengthy and elaborate, ranging from 12 to 150 hours spread across several nights. A complete Koodiyattam performance consists of three parts. The first of these is the ''purappadu'' where an actor performs a verse along with the nritta aspect of dance. Following this is the ''nirvahanam'' where the actor, using [[abhinaya]], presents the mood of the main character of the play. Then there is the ''nirvahanam'', a retrospective, which takes the audience up to the point where the actual play begins. The final part of the performance is the ''koodiyattam'', which is the play itself. While the first two parts are solo acts, koodiyattam can have as many characters as are required to perform on the stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/theatre/article3631143.ece|title= All at home |publisher=The Hindu, 13 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe elders of the Chakyar community traditionally taught the artform to their youngsters. It was performed only by Chakyars until the 1950s. In 1955, Guru [[Mani Madhava Chakyar]] performed Kutiyattam outside the temple for the first time,<ref>* {{Citation\n |last=Bhargavinilayam \n |first=Das \n |title=Mani Madhaveeyam \n |url=http://www.kerala.gov.in/dept_culture/books.htm \n |publisher=Department of Cultural Affairs, [[Government of Kerala]] \n |year=1999 \n |isbn=81-86365-78-8 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215085741/http://www.kerala.gov.in/dept_culture/books.htm \n |archivedate=15 February 2008 \n}}\n</ref> for which he faced many problems from the hardline Chakyar community.

Also, performances can take up to forty days to complete. The collapse of the feudal order in the nineteenth century in Kerala curtailed the patronage of koodiyattam artists, and they faced serious financial difficulties. Following a revival in the early twentieth century, Koodiyattam is once again facing a lack of funding, leading to a crisis in the profession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00010 |title= Kutiyattam, Sanskrit theatre}}</ref> [[UNESCO]] has called for the creation of a network of koodiyattam institutions and gurukalams to promote the transmission of the art form to future generations and for the development of new audiences besides fostering greater academic research in it.

The other main road in the borough, Braddock Road, was the main link between Braddock Hills and [[Braddock, Pennsylvania|Braddock]] used by farmers and coal miners. The first area of the borough to be settled was along Brinton Road, first settled as Hannatown.\n\nFirst settled in 1753,<ref name=\"phmc\">{{cite web| url =http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Allegheny.pdf | title = Allegheny County - 2nd Class | accessdate = 2007-09-03}}</ref> the area was part of [[Wilkins Township, Pennsylvania|Wilkins Township]] until 1885, when Braddock Township was incorporated. On May 2, 1946, after Braddock Township had already been broken up into the boroughs of [[Swissvale, Pennsylvania|Swissvale]], [[North Braddock, Pennsylvania|North Braddock]], and [[Rankin, Pennsylvania|Rankin]], the remaining area incorporated itself as Braddock Hills.<ref name=\"official site\">{{cite web| url =http://www.svcog.org/bradh.html | title = Braddock Hills Borough | accessdate = 2007-09-03}}</ref>\n\nBraddock Hills experienced a housing boom following World War II.  Many GIs used their VA loans to acquire newly built homes.  Most of the new homes were built on Illinois Ave, Park Ave, Columbia Ave, Circle, McKelvey Ave, and Kings Ave.  These homes were generally small brick Cape Cods, colonials, or brick ranches.  While much of the borough has new housing, there are many older structures.  Miners built [[Shotgun house|shotgun-style homes]].  Many of these homes were located on Indiana Avenue.  Some are still in use.\n\nMany older residents can recall when the Braddock Hills Shopping Center on Yost Boulevard was the location of a drive-in movie theater.  The Ardmore Drive-In operated from 1959 to 1976; it was then torn down and was replaced with a shopping center that included a Dollar Bank, Gold Circle Department Store, Giant Eagle, Rite Aid, and several small shops and restaurants.  Gold Circle would later close and was replaced with a Builder's Square that also closed.  Since 2010 the space has been occupied by the Propel Braddock Hills Elementary and High Schools.\n\nDuring the 1980s the shopping center's parking lot hosted a Sunday flea market and the Braddock Hills Days Festival.  Other long gone businesses include Azinger's (corner store with lunch meat, milk, bread, and candy), Gigante's (Italian grocery store), Stop and Go's, the gas station on the corner of Brinton and Wilkins Avenue, and the infamous Hank's ConCan (bar located on Wilkins Avenue).\n\nLike many [[Western Pennsylvania]] communities, Braddock Hills was a coal town.  There are many abandoned [[coal mine]]s located throughout the town.  This has resulted in [[sinkhole]]s in an area that has been called the \"coal fields\".  The coal fields are located in the center of the community.  It is a wooded area that is home to deer, raccoons, opossums, squirrels, and many types of wild birds.  At one time, there were several \"paths\" or foot trails that criss-crossed the borough.  During the 1970s, the center of the coal fields had a sports field that was accessible by a dirt road.  Local softball and baseball teams would play among the trees.\n\nAnother prominent historical feature of the borough is the Braddock Catholic Cemetery.  It served as the burying ground for many mill workers in the surrounding communities.\n\nBraddock Hills was the home of Leonard A. Funk, a [[Medal of Honor]] recipient.  A monument dedicated to his exemplary service is located on Brinton Road in front of the senior citizens' building. It was also home to prominent residents, Kingsley and Velma Carey. Kingsley Carey was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. In 2012, he was honored by the Veterans Leadership Program of Western Pennsylvania at Carnegie Hall. Velma Carey, wife of Kingsley Carey, was a popular jazz singer in Pittsburgh in the 1940s and 1950s. Velma Carey is believed to have been the first African American woman to appear on Pittsburgh television. She made an appearance on ''Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts'' television program.\n\nBrinton Road is the longest street in this community.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Hannastown School.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Former school]]\nThe area along Brinton Road, Hannatown, had its own one-room schoolhouse, which eventually became a small brick elementary school known as Braddock Hills Elementary, on land donated by the Hanna family, that grew until 1966, when a court mandate combined the educational system of Braddock Hills with that of the neighboring borough of [[Swissvale, Pennsylvania|Swissvale]]. Braddock Hills Elementary closed its doors in 1978.  It would soon be converted into a community center that would house the police department and a daycare center.  In 1981, the Swissvale Area School District combined, after court ordered desegregation, even further to form the [[Woodland Hills School District]] that serves Braddock Hills today.<ref name=\"official site\"/>\n\nThe public high school for the borough is [[Woodland Hills High School]]. The [[Community College of Allegheny County]]'s Braddock Hills Center is also located in the borough.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1940= 1847\n|1950= 1965\n|1960= 2414\n|1970= 2459\n|1980= 2556\n|1990= 2026\n|2000= 1998\n|2010= 1880\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1820\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 29, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Pennsylvania|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/17216604v1p40ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-40.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019235623/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html|archive-date=19 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 1,998 people, 1,020 households, and 513 families residing in the borough.

They are members of the [[Island Junior Hockey League]] and are 2011 and 2013 [[Don Johnson Memorial Cup]] Atlantic Junior B champions.\n\n==Team history==\nThe Kensington Vipers joined the Island Junior Hockey League in 1998 after the Kensington Granites Senior hockey team had folded and the Community Gardens arena was looking for a junior hockey client.\n\nAfter sponsorship stints as \"Don Clark Insurance\" and \"Valley Truss and Metal\", a full-time sponsor was found in 2003, as Moase Plumbing and Heating assumed sponsorship.\n\nAfter many underachieving years, the Vipers reached the Island Championship in 2002 but lost in the seventh game to the now defunct O'Leary Eagles.  The following season, the team also lost in seven games at the finals but this time to the Sherwood Falcons.\n\nThrough the 2003\u20132004 season the Vipers were amongst the top of the league and remained on top through the end of the regular season and were favoured to win the [[Prince Edward Island|PEI]] title.  After a quick dismissal of the now relocated Evangeline Loggers of Wellington, the Vipers met their longtime rivals in the Sherwood Falcons. The Vipers won their first championship in five games on home ice before a sellout crowd, with arguably the best team they had put forth in franchise history, which included key defence Joey Wood, Matt Ramsay and Travis Gallant, forward Mitchell Jollimore, Robbie Doiron and Tim MacDougall as well as all-star goaltender Dan Corriveau.\n\nThe following season, the Vipers continued on their domination atop the Island Junior Hockey League. Kirk MacPhee had proven himself as the league's top playmaker, and former Summerside Capital Brad Doiron was added to the lineup. After gaining home ice advantage through their play in the regular season, the Vipers dismissed their opening round opponent, the Summerside Red Wings, and once again met the Falcons in the Final. After being down 3\u20132 in games of the best of seven, the Vipers won two in a row to defend their title in which will go down as perhaps the best IJHL final to date.\n\nThe following year the Vipers tried to go for a [[three peat]], though they did not finish first overall in the regular season.  This would prove to be a difference in the island final, as the Vipers lost the finals to Sherwood in six games and on home ice.\n\n===2011 Don Johnson Cup===\nAfter multiple previous missed chances at the Maritime Junior B championship, the Vipers were not to be denied in 2011.  Hosted by their rivals, the [[Montague Maniacs]], the Vipers dropped their first game to them 3\u20132 in an overtime shootout.  The IJHL champions then took on the [[St. John's Junior Hockey League]]'s [[St. John's Jr. Celtics]] and beat them 9\u20134.  The next day, the Vipers took on the [[New Brunswick Junior B Hockey League]]'s [[Tri-County River Cats]] and beat them 4\u20131.  On the final day of the round robin, the Vipers defeated the [[Nova Scotia Junior Hockey League]]'s [[Bay Ducks]] to clinch second place with a 3-0-1 record and a spot in the semi-final.  On April 30, the Vipers played the Ducks for the second time in two days, this time the Vipers won 4\u20133 in double overtime.  On May 1, the Vipers got their rematch against the Maniacs in an All-PEI final.  The Vipers won 3\u20130 to win their first Maritime Championship and the first PEI title since 2002.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"  bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n|'''Season'''\t||'''GP''' || '''W''' || '''L''' || '''T''' || '''OTL''' || '''GF''' ||\t'''GA''' || '''P''' || '''Results''' || '''Playoffs'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2001-02  ||30    ||14   ||16   ||0   ||0    ||148   ||156    ||28   ||3rd IJHL  ||Lost Semi-final\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2002-03  ||32    ||12   ||13   ||4   ||3    ||136   ||137    ||31   ||3rd IJHL  ||Lost Final\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2003-04  ||32    ||22   ||7    ||3   ||0    ||148   ||96     ||47   ||'''1st IJHL'''  ||'''Won League'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2004-05  ||32    ||25   ||6    ||1   ||0    ||171   ||107    ||51   ||'''1st IJHL'''  ||'''Won League'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2005-06  ||32    ||24   ||8    ||-   ||0    ||167   ||108    ||48   ||'''1st IJHL'''  ||Lost Final\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2006-07  ||32    ||20   ||7    ||-   ||5    ||192   ||135    ||45   ||2nd IJHL  ||'''Won League'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2007-08  ||40    ||28   ||12   ||-   ||0    ||209   ||145    ||56   ||2nd IJHL  ||'''Won League'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2008-09  ||40    ||27   ||10   ||-   ||3    ||193   ||125    ||57   ||2nd IJHL  ||Lost Final\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2009-10  ||40    ||31   ||7    ||-   ||2    ||216   ||126    ||64   ||'''1st IJHL'''  ||'''Won League'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2010-11  ||40    ||29   ||10   ||-   ||1    ||201   ||136    ||59   ||'''1st IJHL'''  ||'''Won League'''<br>'''Won Don Johnson Cup'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2011-12  ||30    ||19   ||7    ||-   ||4    ||147   ||106    ||42   ||'''1st IJHL'''  ||'''Won League'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2012-13  ||26    ||19   ||6    ||-   ||1    ||149   ||74     ||39   ||'''1st IJHL'''  ||'''Won League'''<br>'''Won Don Johnson Cup'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2013-14  ||32    ||25  ||5    ||-   ||2    ||204   ||130    ||52   ||'''1st IJHL'''  ||'''Won League'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2014-15  ||32    ||23  ||7    ||-   ||2    ||170   ||102    ||48   ||'''1st IJHL'''  ||Won Semi-Final, 4-0 ([[Sherwood Falcons|Falcons]])<br>Won League Final, 4-0 ([[Western Red Wings|Red Wings]])<br>'''League Champions'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2015-16  ||32    ||21  ||9    ||-   ||2    ||148   ||117    ||44   ||'''1st IJHL'''  ||Won Semi-Final, 4-1 ([[Montague Maniacs|Maniacs]])<br>Won League Final 4-3 <br>'''League Champions'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2016-17  ||32    ||20  ||7    ||-   ||5    ||136   ||110    ||45   ||'''1st IJHL'''  ||Won Semi-Final, 4-3 ([[Montague Maniacs|Maniacs]])<br>Lost League Finals 3-4 ([[Western Red Wings|Red Wings]])\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2017-18  ||36    ||14  ||16    ||-   ||6    ||138   ||145    ||34   ||3rd IJHL  ||Lost Semi-Final, 3-4 ([[Sherwood Metros Jr. B|Metros]])\n|}\n\n==Don Johnson Memorial Cup==\n'''Eastern Canada Jr B Championships'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; color:#FFFFFF\" bgcolor=\"#960018\" |\n|Year || Round Robin || Record || Standing || SemiFinal || Br.
