By 1917, the Ottoman garrison had grown from 100 in 1914, to 300 \u2013 mainly Ottoman-Arab [[gendarmerie]].  According to Neil Faulkner, \"The British high command had long been anxious about Aqaba.\"  The British feared that an Ottoman Aqaba would threaten [[Archibald Murray]]'s flank, or Ottoman raids could develop into the Sinai, or that it could be used as a base for [[U-boat|German submarines]] in the Red Sea.<ref name=\"Neil\">{{cite book |last1=Faulkner |first1=Neil |title=Lawrence of Arabia's War: The Arabs, the British and the Remaking of the Middle East in WWI |date=2016 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0300226393 |page=264\u201365}}</ref>\n\nAccording to T.E.

Newcombe|Newcombe]] and Lawrence contrived to deceive the Turkish army that their objective was an attack on [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]], drawing attention away from their real goal of Aqaba.  The expedition started moving towards Aqaba in May.  They lost three men to attacks by snakes in the [[Wadi Sirhan]] region, while Nuri Shaalan was paid 6,000 [[Pound sterling|pounds sterling]] in gold for the use of Wadi Sirhan as a base.  While in Bair, Lawrence and Auda decided to attack the rail line in the area of [[Daraa]], to convince the Turks the main Arab force was at [[Azraq, Jordan|Azrak in Sirhan]].  Finding no suitable targets that far north, Lawrence and Zaal ended up attacking the Atwi station south of [[Amman]], before returning to Bair.<ref name=\"TE\"/>{{rp|228, 263, 269\u201370, 285\u201387, 293\u201394}}\n\n===Aba al Lasan and Aqaba===\nThree Howeitat clans on Nagb el Shtar, the Dhumaniyeh, the Darausha, and the Dhiabat, aided the effort to secure the pass of Aba el Lissan, along the [[Ma'an|Maan]]\u2013Aqaba road.  The Dhumaniyeh attacked the Fuweilah [[blockhouse]] at the pass while the Arab force under Auda and Lawrence attacked the Ghadir el Haj garrison along the rail line south of Maan, destroying 10 bridges.  However, the Dhumaniyeh were unable to keep control of the pass when a Turkish relief battalion under Niaz Bey arrived, occupying Aba el Lissan.<ref name=TE/>{{rp|295\u201399, 309}}\n\nAuda personally led a charge of 50 horsemen against the Turkish troops on 2 July, while 400 camelmen under Nasir and Lawrence charged into their flank. The result was 300 Turkish casualties and only 160 prisoners, while the Arabs lost 2 dead. Lawrence was nearly killed in the action after he accidentally shot his camel in the head with his pistol. Auda was hit by 6 bullets, which destroyed his field glasses, holster, and scabbard; but left him unharmed.<ref name=TE/>{{rp|300\u201305, 664}}\n[[File:T E Lawrence and the Arab Revolt 1916 - 1918 Q59207.jpg|left|thumb|Discussing surrender terms, 5 July]]\n\nThree more Turkish posts lay ahead on the way to Aqaba: Guweira, Kethera, and Khadra.  Guweira was captured by Sheikh ibn Jad by the time Auda and Lawrence arrived, and the 120 soldiers in that Turkish garrison had become prisoners.  Kethira was taken on the night of 4 July, aided by a [[lunar eclipse]].  Khadra, at the mouth of the Itm, and its 300-man garrison surrendered on the 6th.  Four miles onward, Aqaba and the sea now lay open.<ref name=TE/>{{rp|308\u201312, 664}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Arab fighters akaba.png|thumb|Arab fighters in Aqaba on 28 February 1918. [[Autochrome]] colour photograph.]]\nThe Arab force had swelled to 2000 Howeitat by the end of the engagement, and they had taken 700 prisoners, including 42 officers.  Auda established an advance post at Guweira with 600 of his clan, which they held for the next month and a half, enough time for the gain of Aqaba to be consolidated, even though the Ottomans were able to retake Abu al-Lissan and Fuweilah.  Arab outposts were also established at Nabathean Petra, Delagha, and Batra, along the Maan highlands.<ref name=Neil/>{{rp|277, 313\u201314}}<ref name=TE/>{{rp|314\u201315}}\n\nLawrence, accompanied by 8 others, traveled 160 miles across the [[Sinai Peninsula]] via the [[Mitla Pass]] to [[Suez]], in 49 hours.  At [[Ismailia|Ismailia Station]], Lawrence convinced Burmester and [[Rosslyn Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss|Admiral Wemyss]] to send [[HMIS Dufferin|HMIS ''Dufferin'']] to Aqaba with food, bringing back the prisoners on the return trip.  Lawrence then took a train to Cairo.  In Cairo, Lawrence reported to Clayton and then [[Edmund Allenby|Allenby]], to whom Lawrence requested arms, supplies, an immediate 16,000 pounds in gold to pay debts incurred, and a further 200,000 [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]] to support his plans to threaten communications with Jerusalem. Allenby promised Lawrence to do what he could, and subsequently told [[Sir William Robertson, 1st Baronet|Robertson]], \"...even the partial success of Captain Lawrence's scheme would seriously disorganize Turkish railway communications south of Aleppo, while its complete success would destroy effectively his only main artery of communication...\"<ref name=Neil/>{{rp|280}}<ref name=TE/>{{rp|315\u201321}}\n\nAqaba became a major Royal Navy depot, supplying and transporting Feisal's forces upon his arrival on 23 August, as HMS ''[[HMS Euryalus (1901)|Euryalus]]'' and then HMS ''[[HMS Humber (1913)|Humber]]'', guarded the port.  A landing strip was built at Kuntilla, and by August 4 the [[Royal Flying Corps]] was bombing Maan, Abu al-Lissan and Fuweilah, supplementing continued attacks by Auda on the [[Hejaz railway]].  According to Lawrence, \"In the next four months our experts from Akaba destroyed seventeen locomotives. Traveling became an uncertain terror for the enemy.\"<ref name=Neil/>{{rp|312\u201313}}<ref name=TE/>{{rp|341\u201343, 380}}\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe campaign and battle was inaccurately depicted in the film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n'''References'''\n* {{cite book |ref=harv|last=Lawrence|first=T.E. | authorlink = T.

According to Neil Faulkner, \"The British high command had long been anxious about Aqaba.\"  The British feared that an Ottoman Aqaba would threaten [[Archibald Murray]]'s flank, or Ottoman raids could develop into the Sinai, or that it could be used as a base for [[U-boat|German submarines]] in the Red Sea.<ref name=\"Neil\">{{cite book |last1=Faulkner |first1=Neil |title=Lawrence of Arabia's War: The Arabs, the British and the Remaking of the Middle East in WWI |date=2016 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0300226393 |page=264\u201365}}</ref>\n\nAccording to T.E. Lawrence, \"The Arabs needed Akaba: firstly, to extend their front, which was their tactical principle; and, secondly, to link up with the British.\"  Lawrence also says, \"I was working out with Auda abu Tayi a march to the Howeitat in their spring pastures of the Syrian desert. From them we might raise a mobile camel force, and rush Akaba from the eastward without guns or machine-guns.  The eastern was the unguarded side, the line of least resistance, the easiest for us.\"<ref name=\"TE\">{{cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=T.E. |title=Seven Pillars of Wisdom |url=https://archive.org/details/sevenpillarsofwi00lawr |url-access=registration |date=1935 |publisher=Doubleday, Doran & Company, Inc. |location=Garden City |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sevenpillarsofwi00lawr/page/225 225\u201374]}}</ref>\n\n==Battle and campaign==\n\n=== Prelude ===\n[[S.F. Newcombe|Newcombe]] and Lawrence contrived to deceive the Turkish army that their objective was an attack on [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]], drawing attention away from their real goal of Aqaba.  The expedition started moving towards Aqaba in May.  They lost three men to attacks by snakes in the [[Wadi Sirhan]] region, while Nuri Shaalan was paid 6,000 [[Pound sterling|pounds sterling]] in gold for the use of Wadi Sirhan as a base.  While in Bair, Lawrence and Auda decided to attack the rail line in the area of [[Daraa]], to convince the Turks the main Arab force was at [[Azraq, Jordan|Azrak in Sirhan]].  Finding no suitable targets that far north, Lawrence and Zaal ended up attacking the Atwi station south of [[Amman]], before returning to Bair.<ref name=\"TE\"/>{{rp|228, 263, 269\u201370, 285\u201387, 293\u201394}}\n\n===Aba al Lasan and Aqaba===\nThree Howeitat clans on Nagb el Shtar, the Dhumaniyeh, the Darausha, and the Dhiabat, aided the effort to secure the pass of Aba el Lissan, along the [[Ma'an|Maan]]\u2013Aqaba road.  The Dhumaniyeh attacked the Fuweilah [[blockhouse]] at the pass while the Arab force under Auda and Lawrence attacked the Ghadir el Haj garrison along the rail line south of Maan, destroying 10 bridges.  However, the Dhumaniyeh were unable to keep control of the pass when a Turkish relief battalion under Niaz Bey arrived, occupying Aba el Lissan.<ref name=TE/>{{rp|295\u201399, 309}}\n\nAuda personally led a charge of 50 horsemen against the Turkish troops on 2 July, while 400 camelmen under Nasir and Lawrence charged into their flank. The result was 300 Turkish casualties and only 160 prisoners, while the Arabs lost 2 dead. Lawrence was nearly killed in the action after he accidentally shot his camel in the head with his pistol. Auda was hit by 6 bullets, which destroyed his field glasses, holster, and [scabbard]; but left him unharmed.<ref name=TE/>{{rp|300\u201305, 664}}\n[[File:T E Lawrence and the Arab Revolt 1916 - 1918 Q59207.jpg|left|thumb|Discussing surrender terms, 5 July]]\n\nThree more Turkish posts lay ahead on the way to Aqaba, Guweira, Kethera, and Khadra.  Guweira was captured by Sheikh ibn Jad by the time Auda and Lawrence arrived, and its 120 soldiers in that Turkish garrison had become prisoners.  Kethira was taken on the night of 4 July, aided by a [[lunar eclipse]].  Khadra, at the mouth of the Itm, and its 300 man garrison surrendered on the 6th.  Four miles onward, Aqaba and the sea now lay open.<ref name=TE/>{{rp|308\u201312, 664}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Arab fighters akaba.png|thumb|Arab fighters in Aqaba on 28 February 1918. [[Autochrome]] colour photograph.]]\nThe Arab force had swelled to 2000 Howeitat by the end of the engagement, and they had taken 700 prisoners, including 42 officers.  Auda established an advance post at Guweira with 600 of his clan, which they held for the next month and a half, enough time for the gain of Aqaba to be consolidated, even though the Ottomans were able to retake Abu al-Lissan and Fuweilah.  Arab outposts were also established at Nabathean Petra, Delagha, and Batra, along the Maan highlands.<ref name=Neil/>{{rp|277, 313\u201314}}<ref name=TE/>{{rp|314\u201315}}\n\nLawrence, accompanied by 8 others, traveled 160 miles across the [[Sinai Peninsula]] via the [[Mitla Pass]] to [[Suez]], in 49 hours.  At [[Ismailia|Ismailia Station]], Lawrence convinced Burmester and [[Rosslyn Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss|Admiral Wemyss]] to send [[HMIS Dufferin|HMIS ''Dufferin'']] to Aqaba with food, bringing back the prisoners on the return trip.  Lawrence then took a train to Cairo.  In Cairo, Lawrence reported to Clayton and then [[Edmund Allenby|Allenby]], to whom Lawrence requested arms, supplies, an immediate 16,000 pounds in gold to pay debts incurred, and a further 200,000 [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]] to support his plans to threaten communications with Jerusalem. Allenby promised Lawrence to do what he could, and subsequently told [[Sir William Robertson, 1st Baronet|Robertson]], \"...even the partial success of Captain Lawrence's scheme would seriously disorganize Turkish railway communications south of Aleppo, while its complete success would destroy effectively his only main artery of communication...\"<ref name=Neil/>{{rp|280}}<ref name=TE/>{{rp|315\u201321}}\n\nAqaba became a major Royal Navy depot, supplying and transporting Feisal's forces upon his arrival on 23 August, as HMS ''[[HMS Euryalus (1901)|Euryalus]]'' and then HMS ''[[HMS Humber (1913)|Humber]]'', guarded the port.  A landing strip was built at Kuntilla, and by August 4 the [[Royal Flying Corps]] was bombing Maan, Abu al-Lissan and Fuweilah, supplementing continued attacks by Auda on the [[Hejaz railway]].  According to Lawrence, \"In the next four months our experts from Akaba destroyed seventeen locomotives. Traveling became an uncertain terror for the enemy.\"<ref name=Neil/>{{rp|312\u201313}}<ref name=TE/>{{rp|341\u201343, 380}}\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe campaign and battle was inaccurately depicted in the film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n'''References'''\n* {{cite book |ref=harv|last=Lawrence|first=T.E. | authorlink = T.

These regions correspond to a unique geographical passageway between the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains through which most of the interaction between India and Central Asia took place, generating intense cultural exchange and trade.\n\nFollowing Alexander's death on June 10, 323 BC, the [[Diadochi]] or \"Successors\" founded their own kingdoms in [[Anatolia]] and [[Central Asia]]. General [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] set up the [[Seleucid Empire]], which extended as far as India. Later, the eastern part of the Seleucid Kingdom broke away to form the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] (250 BC-125 BC), followed by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180 BC - AD 10), and later the [[Kushan Empire]] (1st\u20133rd century AD).\n\nThe interaction of Greek and Buddhist cultures operated over several centuries until it ended in the 5th century AD with the invasions of the [[Hephthalite Empire]] and the expansion of [[Islam]].\n\n==Cultural interaction==\n{{see also|Hellenistic influence on Indian art}}\nThe length of the Greek presence in Central Asia and northern India provided opportunities for interaction, not only on the artistic, but also on the religious plane.\n\n===Alexander the Great in Bactria and India (331\u2013325 BC)===\n[[File:Alexander victory coin Babylon silver c 322 BCE.jpg|thumb|\"Victory coin\" of [[Alexander the Great]], minted in [[Babylon]] c.322 BC, following his campaigns in [[India]].<br/>'''Obv''': Alexander being crowned by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].<br/>'''Rev''': Alexander attacking [[King Porus]] on his elephant.<br/>Silver.

The legend states that they then returned home and spread the Buddha's teaching.<ref>Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 43</ref>\n\nIn 326 BC, Alexander conquered the Northern region of India. King Ambhi of Taxila, known as [[Taxiles]], surrendered his city, a notable Buddhist center, to Alexander.

The Greeks sent ambassadors to the court of the [[Maurya Empire]], such as the historian [[Megasthenes]] under [[Chandragupta Maurya]], and later [[Deimachus]] under his son [[Bindusara]], who reported extensively on the civilization of the Indians. Megasthenes sent detailed reports on Indian religions, which were circulated and quoted throughout the Classical world for centuries:<ref>Surviving fragments of Megasthenes:[https://web.archive.org/web/20081210080315/http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Foreign_Views/GreekRoman/Megasthenes-Indika.htm Full text]</ref>\n{{quote|Megasthenes makes a different division of the philosophers, saying that they are of two kinds, one of which he calls the [[Brahman|Brachmanes]], and the other the [[Sramana|Sarmanes]]...\" [[Strabo]] XV. 1. 58-60<ref name=\"Strabo XV.1\"/>}}\nThe Greco-Bactrians maintained a strong Hellenistic culture at the door of India during the rule of the Maurya Empire in India, as exemplified by the archaeological site of [[Ai-Khanoum]]. When the Maurya Empire was toppled by the [[Shunga Empire]] around 180 BC, the Greco-Bactrians expanded into India, where they established the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], under which Buddhism was able to flourish.\n\n===Indo-Greek Kingdom and Buddhism (180 BC \u2013 AD 10)===\n[[File:Greek Gods and Dharmachakra.jpg|thumb|350px|Greek Gods and the \"Wheel of the Law\" or [[Dharmachakra]]: '''Left:''' [[Zeus]] holding [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], who hands a victory [[wreath]] over a Dharmachakra (coin of [[Menander II]]).

[[Zarmanochegas]] was a \u015bramana (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as [[Strabo]], [[Cassius Dio]] and [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] traveled to [[Antioch]] and [[Athens]] while [[Augustus]] (died AD 14) was ruling the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"perseus.tufts.edu\">Strabo, xv, 1, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&layout=&loc=15.1.73 on the immolation of the Sramana in Athens (Paragraph 73)].</ref><ref name=\"liv, 9\">[[Dio Cassius]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#9 liv, 9].</ref>\n\n====Coinage====\nThe coins of the Indo-Greek king [[Menander I]] (reigned 160-135 BC), found from [[Afghanistan]] to central India, bear the inscription \"Saviour King Menander\" in Greek on the front. Several Indo-Greek kings after Menander, such as [[Zoilos I]], [[Strato I]], [[Heliokles II]], [[Theophilos (king)|Theophilos]], [[Peukolaos]], [[Menander II]] and [[Archebius]] display on their coins the title \"Maharajasa Dharmika\" (lit. \"King of the Dharma\") in [[Prakrit]] written in [[Kharoshthi]].\n\nSome of the coins of Menander I and [[Menander II]] incorporate the Buddhist symbol of the eight-spoked wheel, associated with the Greek symbols of victory, either the palm of victory, or the victory wreath handed over by the goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]. According to the [[Milinda Panha|Milinda Pa\u00f1ha]], at the end of his reign Menander I became a Buddhist [[arhat]],<ref>Extract of the [[Milinda Panha]]: \"And afterwards, taking delight in the wisdom of the Elder, he handed over his kingdom to his son, and abandoning the household life for the houseless state, grew great in insight, and himself attained to [[Arhat|Arahatship]]!\" ([[Milinda Panha|The Questions of King Milinda]], Translation by [[Thomas William Rhys Davids|T. W.

When the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] invaded North India in the 1st century AD, they adopted a large part of the symbolism of Indo-Greek coinage, but refrained from ever using the elephant, suggesting that its meaning was not merely geographical.\n\n[[File:IGMudras.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[Mudra#Vitarka Mudr.C4.81|Vitarka Mudra]]'' [[gesture]]s on Indo-Greek coinage.

Before this innovation, Buddhist art was \"[[aniconism|aniconic]]\": the Buddha was only represented through his symbols (an empty throne, the [[Bodhi Tree]], [[Buddha footprint]]s, the [[Dharmachakra]]).\n\nThis reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha\u2019s sayings reported in the ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.<ref>\"Due to the statement of the Master in the ''Dighanikaya'' disfavouring his representation in human form after the extinction of body, reluctance prevailed for some time\".

In India as well, it was only natural for the Greeks to create a single common divinity by combining the image of a Greek [[god-king]] ([[Apollo]], or possibly the deified founder of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], [[Demetrius I of Bactria]]), with the traditional [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].\n\n[[File:StandingBuddha.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Standing Buddha, Gandhara, 1st century AD.]]\nMany of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: [[himation]], the [[contrapposto]] stance of the upright figures (see: 1st\u20132nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas, the stylized curly hair and [[ushnisha]] apparently derived from the style of the [[Apollo Belvedere]] (330 BC) and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. A large quantity of [[sculpture]]s combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and [[iconography]] were excavated at the modern site of [[Hadda, Afghanistan]].

Alexander crossed the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Jhelum River]] when defeating Porus and appointing him as a satrap following the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. Alexander's army would mutiny and retreat along the [[Beas River]] when confronted by the [[Nanda Empire]], thus wouldn't conquer Punjab entirely.\n\nAlexander founded several cities in his new territories in the areas of the [[Amu Darya]] and [[Bactria]], and Greek settlements further extended to the [[Khyber Pass]], [[Gandhara]] (see [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]), and the [[Punjab]].

During the rule (165\u2013135&nbsp;BC) of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] King [[Menander I]] ([[P\u0101li|Pali]]: \"Milinda\"),  [[Mahadharmaraksita]] (literally translated as 'Great Teacher/Preserver of the Dharma') was \"a Greek ([[P\u0101li|Pali]]: [[Yona]], lit.

XXIX), who led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \"the Greek city of Alasandra\" ([[Alexandria of the Caucasus]], around 150&nbsp;km north of today's [[Kabul]] in [[Afghanistan]]), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the [[Ruwanwelisaya|Great Stupa]] in [[Anuradhapura]]. [[Dharmaraksita]] ([[Sanskrit]]), or Dhammarakkhita ([[P\u0101li|Pali]]) ([[translation]]: ''Protected by the [[Dharma]]''), was one of the [[missionary|missionaries]] sent by the [[Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]] to proselytize the [[Buddhist]] faith. He is described as being a Greek ([[P\u0101li|Pali]]: \"[[Yona]]\", lit. \"[[Ionia]]n\") in the [[Mahavamsa]], and his activities are indicative of the strength of the Hellenistic [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] involvement during the formative centuries of Buddhism. Indeed, [[Menander I]] was famously converted to Buddhism by [[Nagasena]], who was a student of the Greek Buddhist monk [[Dharmaraksita]]. Menander is said to have reached enlightenment as an [[arhat]] under Nagasena's guidance and is recorded as a great patron of Buddhism.
