He was appointed Controller General of Finances of France under the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orleans]], who served as regent for the youthful king, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].\n\nIn 1716 Law established the [[Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]], a private bank, in France and which, one year later, was nationalised at his request to become the [[Bank of France|Banque Royale]], the first Central [[Bank of France]]. The original private bank was substantially funded by John Law and Louis XV and three-quarters of its [[capital (economics)|capital]] consisted of government bills and government-accepted notes, effectively making it the first [[central bank]] of the nation and was only partially backed by silver making it a [[Fractional-reserve banking|fractional reserve bank]]. He set up and was director of the [[Mississippi Scheme|Mississippi Company]], which was funded by the ''Banque royale.'' Its eventual chaotic collapse in France has been compared to the early-17th century [[tulip mania]] in Holland.<ref name=nyfed/> The Mississippi Bubble was contemporaneous with the [[South Sea Company]] bubble of England which allegedly borrowed ideas from the [[Mississippi Scheme|Mississippi Company]] design.\n\nLaw was a [[gambler]] and a brilliant mental calculator.

Upon leaving the High School of Edinburgh, Law joined the family business at age fourteen and studied the banking business until his father died in 1688.

The first manifestation of [[Law's system]] came when he had returned to Scotland and contributed to the debates leading to the [[Treaty of Union 1707]]. He published a text entitled ''[[Money and Trade Considered|Money and Trade Considered: with a Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money]]'' (1705).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Law |first=John |author-link=|year=1750 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=Money and Trade Consider'd with a Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money, First Published in Edinburgh in 1705 |volume= |edition= |publisher= A.

P.F. Collier Inc, 1978.</ref>\n\nHe spent ten years moving between France and the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]], dealing in financial [[speculation]]s. Problems with the French economy presented the opportunity to put his system into practice.\n\nHe had the idea of abolishing minor [[monopoly|monopolies]] and private [[tax farming (France)|farming of taxes]]. He would create a bank for national finance and a state company for commerce, ultimately to exclude all private revenue. This would create a huge monopoly of finance and trade run by the state, and its profits would pay off the [[national debt]]. The council called to consider Law's proposal, including financiers such as [[Samuel Bernard]], rejected the proposition on 24 October 1715.<ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|141}}\n\nLaw made his home in Place Louis-le-Grand, a royal square where he hosted and entertained various Parisian nobles. Gaining the attention of such notable people as the Duke of Orleans, Law quickly found himself a regular in high-stakes gambling parties attended by only the most affluent of Paris. His tall stature and elegant dress allowed Law to charm his way across Europe's financial hubs, from Amsterdam to Venice. These travels heavily influenced Law's theories on monetary policy and the importance of paper money as credit. Law's idea of a centralised bank which would deal in a new form of paper money was years ahead of its time. Despite this forward concept, Law still championed mercantilist beliefs with the promotion of monopolistic companies through government charters.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Diligent: A Voyage through the Worlds of the Slave Trade |last=Robert |first=Harms |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=43\u201354}}</ref>\n\nThe wars waged by [[Louis XIV]] left the country completely wasted, both economically and financially. The resultant shortage of [[precious metal]]s led to a shortage of coins in circulation, which in turn limited the production of new coins. With the death of Louis XIV seventeen months after Law's arrival, the Duke of Orleans finally presented Law with the opportunity to display his ingenuity. Since, following the devastating [[War of the Spanish Succession]], France's economy was stagnant and her [[national debt]] was crippling, Law proposed to stimulate industry by replacing gold with paper credit and then increasing the supply of credit, and to reduce the national debt by replacing it with shares in economic ventures.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kduEtlToecC&pg=PA105 |title=John Law |author=Antoin E Murphy |publisher=Oxford U.

The second key feature of the proposal centred on the premise that this private bank was able to issue its own currency backed by [[Louis d'or|Louis of gold]].

The rapid ascension of this new global monopoly led to massive speculation and stock prices ballooned to over sixty times their original value.\n\nAs Controller General, Law instituted many beneficial reforms (some of which had lasting effect, while others were soon abolished). He tried to break up large land-holdings to benefit the peasants; he abolished internal road and canal tolls; he encouraged the building of new roads, the starting of new industries (even importing artisans but mostly by offering low-interest loans), and the revival of overseas commerce\u2014and indeed industry increased 60% in two years, and the number of French ships engaged in export went from sixteen to three hundred.<ref>Will and Ariel Durant, ''The Age of Voltaire'', Simon & Schuster (1965), p. 13</ref>\n\n===Company of the West===\nLaw became the architect of what would later be known as the [[Mississippi Bubble]], an event that would begin with consolidating the trading companies of [[Louisiana]] into a single monopoly (The Mississippi Company), and ended with the collapse of the [[Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] and subsequent devaluing of the Mississippi Company's shares.\n<blockquote>\nIn 1719, the French government allowed Law to issue 50,000 new shares in the Mississippi Company at 500 livres with just 75 livres down and the rest due in nineteen additional monthly payments of 25 livres each. The share price rose to 1,000 livres before the second instalment was even due, and ordinary citizens flocked to Paris to participate.<ref name=nyfed/>\n</blockquote>\nIn October 1719 Law's Company lent the French state 1.5 billion livres at 3% to pay off the national debt, a transaction funded by issuing a further 300,000 shares in the company.<ref name=\"RSA91\">{{Cite journal |last1=Lande |first1=Lawrence |last2=Congdon |first2=Tim |date=January 1991 |title=John Law and the invention of paper money |journal=RSA Journal |volume=139 |issue=5414 |jstor=41375433}}</ref>{{rp|919}}<ref name=nyfed/>\n\nBetween May and December 1719 the market price of a share rose from 500 to 10,000 livres<ref name=\"Velde07\"/>{{rp|277}} and continued rising into early 1720, supported by Law's 4% dividend promise.<ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|143\u20134}} Under rapidly emerging price inflation,<ref name=nyfed/> Law sought to hold the share price at 9,000 livres in March 1720, and then on 21 May 1720 to engineer a controlled reduction in the value of both notes and the shares, a measure that was itself reversed 6 days later.<ref name=\"RSA91\"/>{{rp|920}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hayek |first=F A |title=The Trend of Economic Thinking |year=1991 |publisher=Liberty Fund |isbn=9780865977426 |page=162}}</ref><ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|147}} \n<blockquote>\nAs the public rushed to convert banknotes to coin, Law was forced to close the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale for ten days, then limit the transaction size once the bank reopened.

By May 1720, prices fell to 4,000 livres per share, a 73% decrease within a year. The rush to convert paper money to coins led to sporadic bank hours and riots. Squatters now occupied the square of Palace Louis-le-Grand and openly attacked the financiers that inhabited the area. It was under these circumstances and the cover of night that John Law left Paris some seven months later, leaving all of his substantial property assets in France, including the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]] and at least twenty-one Chateaux which he had purchased over his years in Paris, for the repayment of creditors.\n\nThe descent of a relatively unknown man came as fast as his rise, leaving an economic power vacuum.

He was appointed Controller General of Finances of France under the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orleans]], who served as regent for the youthful king, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].\n\nIn 1716 Law established the [[Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]], a private bank, in France and which, one year later, was nationalised at his request to become the [[Bank of France|Banque Royale]], the first Central [[Bank of France]]. The original private bank was substantially funded by John Law and Louis XV and three-quarters of its [[capital (economics)|capital]] consisted of government bills and government-accepted notes, effectively making it the first [[central bank]] of the nation and was only partially backed by silver making it a [[Fractional-reserve banking|fractional reserve bank]].

The first manifestation of [[Law's system]] came when he had returned to Scotland and contributed to the debates leading to the [[Treaty of Union 1707]].

P.F. Collier Inc, 1978.</ref>\n\nHe spent ten years moving between France and the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]], dealing in financial [[speculation]]s. Problems with the French economy presented the opportunity to put his system into practice.\n\nHe had the idea of abolishing minor [[monopoly|monopolies]] and private [[tax farming (France)|farming of taxes]]. He would create a bank for national finance and a state company for commerce, ultimately to exclude all private revenue. This would create a huge monopoly of finance and trade run by the state, and its profits would pay off the [[national debt]]. The council called to consider Law's proposal, including financiers such as [[Samuel Bernard]], rejected the proposition on 24 October 1715.<ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|141}}\n\nLaw made his home in Place Louis-le-Grand, a royal square where he hosted and entertained various Parisian nobles. Gaining the attention of such notable people as the Duke of Orleans, Law quickly found himself a regular in high-stakes gambling parties attended by only the most affluent of Paris. His tall stature and elegant dress allowed Law to charm his way across Europe's financial hubs, from Amsterdam to Venice. These travels heavily influenced Law's theories on monetary policy and the importance of paper money as credit. Law's idea of a centralised bank which would deal in a new form of paper money was years ahead of its time. Despite this forward concept, Law still championed mercantilist beliefs with the promotion of monopolistic companies through government charters.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Diligent: A Voyage through the Worlds of the Slave Trade |last=Robert |first=Harms |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=43\u201354}}</ref>\n\nThe wars waged by [[Louis XIV]] left the country completely wasted, both economically and financially. The resultant shortage of [[precious metal]]s led to a shortage of coins in circulation, which in turn limited the production of new coins. With the death of Louis XIV seventeen months after Law's arrival, the Duke of Orleans finally presented Law with the opportunity to display his ingenuity. Since, following the devastating [[War of the Spanish Succession]], France's economy was stagnant and her [[national debt]] was crippling, Law proposed to stimulate industry by replacing gold with paper credit and then increasing the supply of credit, and to reduce the national debt by replacing it with shares in economic ventures.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kduEtlToecC&pg=PA105 |title=John Law |author=Antoin E Murphy |publisher=Oxford U. Press |year=1997 |page=105}}</ref> On 1 May 1716, Law presented a modified version of his centralised bank plan to the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale which approved a private bank that allowed investors to supply one-fourth of an investment in currency and the other parts in defunct government bonds. The second key feature of the proposal centred on the premise that this private bank was able to issue its own currency backed by [[Louis d'or|Louis of gold]]. This enabled the currency to be redeemed by the weight of silver from the original deposit instead of the fluctuating value of the [[French livre|livres]] which had been devaluing rapidly.<ref name=\"Velde07\">{{Cite journal |last=Velde |first=Fran\u00e7ois R. |date=May 2007 |title=John Law's System |journal=American Economic Review |volume=97 |issue=2 |jstor=30034460}}</ref>{{rp|277}}\n\nIn May 1716 Law set up the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Priv\u00e9e (\"General Private Bank\"), which developed the use of paper money.<ref>BACKHOUSE, Roger, ''Economists and the economy: the evolution of economic ideas'', Transaction Publishers, 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-56000-715-9}}, p. 118</ref>\nIt was one of only six such banks to have issued paper money, joining Sweden, England, Holland, Venice, and Genoa.<ref name=nyfed>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2014/01/crisis-chronicles-the-mississippi-bubble-of-1720-and-the-european-debt-crisis.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York: \"Crisis Chronicles: The Mississippi Bubble of 1720 and the European Debt Crisis\" (Narron and Skeie)]</ref> The bank was nationalised in December 1718 at Law's request.<ref name=\"Velde07\"/>{{rp|277}}\n\nFrom this new banking platform, Law was able to pursue the [[monopoly]] companies he envisioned by having France bankroll the endeavour with 100&nbsp;million ''livres'' in the form of company stock. The founding of the Mississippi Company, later renamed the Occident Company and eventually part of the Company of the Indies, was financed in the same way as the bank.\n\nIn this context the regent, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans]], appointed Law as Controller General of Finances in 1720, effectively giving him control over external and internal commerce. The rapid ascension of this new global monopoly led to massive speculation and stock prices ballooned to over sixty times their original value.\n\nAs Controller General, Law instituted many beneficial reforms (some of which had lasting effect, while others were soon abolished). He tried to break up large land-holdings to benefit the peasants; he abolished internal road and canal tolls; he encouraged the building of new roads, the starting of new industries (even importing artisans but mostly by offering low-interest loans), and the revival of overseas commerce\u2014and indeed industry increased 60% in two years, and the number of French ships engaged in export went from sixteen to three hundred.<ref>Will and Ariel Durant, ''The Age of Voltaire'', Simon & Schuster (1965), p. 13</ref>\n\n===Company of the West===\nLaw became the architect of what would later be known as the [[Mississippi Bubble]], an event that would begin with consolidating the trading companies of [[Louisiana]] into a single monopoly (The Mississippi Company), and ended with the collapse of the [[Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] and subsequent devaluing of the Mississippi Company's shares.\n<blockquote>\nIn 1719, the French government allowed Law to issue 50,000 new shares in the Mississippi Company at 500 livres with just 75 livres down and the rest due in nineteen additional monthly payments of 25 livres each. The share price rose to 1,000 livres before the second instalment was even due, and ordinary citizens flocked to Paris to participate.<ref name=nyfed/>\n</blockquote>\nIn October 1719 Law's Company lent the French state 1.5 billion livres at 3% to pay off the national debt, a transaction funded by issuing a further 300,000 shares in the company.<ref name=\"RSA91\">{{Cite journal |last1=Lande |first1=Lawrence |last2=Congdon |first2=Tim |date=January 1991 |title=John Law and the invention of paper money |journal=RSA Journal |volume=139 |issue=5414 |jstor=41375433}}</ref>{{rp|919}}<ref name=nyfed/>\n\nBetween May and December 1719 the market price of a share rose from 500 to 10,000 livres<ref name=\"Velde07\"/>{{rp|277}} and continued rising into early 1720, supported by Law's 4% dividend promise.<ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|143\u20134}} Under rapidly emerging price inflation,<ref name=nyfed/> Law sought to hold the share price at 9,000 livres in March 1720, and then on 21 May 1720 to engineer a controlled reduction in the value of both notes and the shares, a measure that was itself reversed 6 days later.<ref name=\"RSA91\"/>{{rp|920}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hayek |first=F A |title=The Trend of Economic Thinking |year=1991 |publisher=Liberty Fund |isbn=9780865977426 |page=162}}</ref><ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|147}} \n<blockquote>\nAs the public rushed to convert banknotes to coin, Law was forced to close the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale for ten days, then limit the transaction size once the bank reopened. But the queues grew longer, the Mississippi Company stock price continued to fall, and food prices soared by as much as 60 percent.<ref name=nyfed/>\n</blockquote>\nThe fractional reserve ratio was one fifth,<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (5:55 of 9:44)</ref> and a Royal edict to criminalise the sale of gold was decreed.<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (6:45 of 9:44)</ref> A later Royal edict decreed that gold coin was illegal,<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (7:35 of 9:44)</ref> which was soon reversed,<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (7:55 of 9:44)</ref> leading 50 people to be stampeded to death.<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (8:00 of 9:44)</ref> The company's shares were ultimately rendered worthless, and initially inflated speculation about their worth led to widespread financial stress, which saw Law dismissed at the end of 1720 from his sinecure as Controller General<ref name=nyfed/> and his post as Chief Director of the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\n===Downfall===\nSpeculation gave way to panic as people flooded the market with future shares trading as high as fifteen thousand livres per share, while the shares themselves maintained at ten thousand livres each. By May 1720, prices fell to 4,000 livres per share, a 73% decrease within a year. The rush to convert paper money to coins led to sporadic bank hours and riots. Squatters now occupied the square of Palace Louis-le-Grand and openly attacked the financiers that inhabited the area. It was under these circumstances and the cover of night that John Law left Paris some seven months later, leaving all of his substantial property assets in France, including the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]] and at least twenty-one Chateaux which he had purchased over his years in Paris, for the repayment of creditors.\n\nThe descent of a relatively unknown man came as fast as his rise, leaving an economic power vacuum. Law's theories live on 300 years later and \"captured many key conceptual points which are very much a part of modern monetary theorizing\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kduEtlToecC&pg=PA1&lpg=PP1&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |title=John Law |author=Antoin E Murphy|publisher=Oxford U.

Law realised he would never return to France when Orl\u00e9ans died suddenly in 1723 and Law was granted permission to return to London, having received a pardon in 1719. He lived in London for four years and then moved to Venice, where he contracted [[pneumonia]] and died as a poor man in 1729.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[Sharon Condie]] and [[Richard Condie]]'s 1978 [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) [[animated short]] ''John Law and the Mississippi Bubble'' is a humorous interpretation.

However, in 2010, Omegle introduced a video mode to complement the text chat mode, which pairs together strangers who are using webcams and microphones. The [[video chat]] also has a built in text window.\n\nIn 2011, the beta version of a new feature, \"Spy Mode\", was introduced. In Spy (Question) Mode, users have two options: to be the \"spy\" and ask a question of two strangers, or to discuss a question with another stranger. As the spy, the user inputs any question for the two strangers to answer or discuss and is able to view the discussion as a third party, albeit without being able to contribute further to the conversation. The spy can quit at any time without ending the chat for the two other strangers. If a user chooses to discuss a question instead, as in normal text mode, the user is paired with another stranger and can discuss the question the spy has asked up until the point the other stranger decides to disconnect and/or move on to another question.\n\nIn 2012, Omegle added a special new feature to the text and video modes, the option to input \"interest\" tags. Adding interests lets users be paired with a stranger who has something in common with the user. A user can input as many interests as he or she would like, and if no available match is found, the user is paired with a completely random stranger instead.\n\nIn 2013, an unmonitored version of the video chat mode was opened, leaving the original content moderator-regulated video section open to anyone aged thirteen and up as long as the content of his or her video stream is clean. Initially, questionable adult content in the video section of Omegle was filtered using [[image recognition]] algorithms only. The newer unmonitored video section allows consenting adults over the age of eighteen the freedom to view, and share with one another, uncensored explicit video streams.\n\nIn 2014, Omegle began experimenting with a \"[[Dormitory|Dorm]] Chat\" mode, which requires users to provide an [[email address]] ending in \"[[.edu]]\" to verify that they are associated with a [[college]] or [[university]]. Dorm Chat allows users to chat with their classmates and colleagues on Omegle.\n\nIn 2015, Omegle began implementing [[ReCAPTCHA|ReCaptcha]] security measures to help reduce the amount of [[Internet bot|bots]] on the site. This has, however, been met with complaints that bots remain and legitimate use is excessively interrupted.\n\nDuring late 2019 and early 2020, Omegle began throwing jabs at the [[Communist Party of China]], and expressing support for the [[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests|Liberation of Hong Kong]] during the 2019/20 protests, with an image on the front page saying \"[[Xi Jinping]] ([[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]) sure looks like [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://z6mag.com/2019/10/10/omegle-throws-jabs-at-china-xi-pooh/|title=Omegle throws jabs at China: 'Xi = Pooh!'|last=Restar|first=Al|date=2019-10-10|website=Z6 Mag|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://funnyjunk.com/Omegle+is+supporting+hong+kong/giadMtv/|title=Omegle Is Supporting Hong Kong|website=funnyjunk.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nPrior to early 2013, the site did not [[Censorship|censor]] contributions through a [[profanity filter]], and users have reported encountering [[nudity]] or [[sexual content]] on camera.<ref name=\"bbctech\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8539701.stm|title=Chatroulette and Omegle: chat rooms with a twist| publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> After January 2013, Omegle implemented a \"monitored\" video chat, to monitor misbehavior and protect people under the age of 18 from potentially harmful content, including nudity or sexual content.

However, in 2010, Omegle introduced a video mode to complement the text chat mode, which pairs together strangers who are using webcams and microphones. The [[video chat]] also has a built in text window.\n\nIn 2011, the beta version of a new feature, \"Spy Mode\", was introduced. In Spy (Question) Mode, users have two options: to be the \"spy\" and ask a question of two strangers, or to discuss a question with another stranger. As the spy, the user inputs any question for the two strangers to answer or discuss and is able to view the discussion as a third party, albeit without being able to contribute further to the conversation. The spy can quit at any time without ending the chat for the two other strangers. If a user chooses to discuss a question instead, as in normal text mode, the user is paired with another stranger and can discuss the question the spy has asked up until the point the other stranger decides to disconnect and/or move on to another question.\n\nIn 2012, Omegle added a special new feature to the text and video modes, the option to input \"interest\" tags. Adding interests lets users be paired with a stranger who has something in common with the user. A user can input as many interests as he or she would like, and if no available match is found, the user is paired with a completely random stranger instead.\n\nIn 2013, an unmonitored version of the video chat mode was opened, leaving the original content moderator-regulated video section open to anyone aged thirteen and up as long as the content of his or her video stream is clean. Initially, questionable adult content in the video section of Omegle was filtered using [[image recognition]] algorithms only. The newer unmonitored video section allows consenting adults over the age of eighteen the freedom to view, and share with one another, uncensored explicit video streams.\n\nIn 2014, Omegle began experimenting with a \"[[Dormitory|Dorm]] Chat\" mode, which requires users to provide an [[email address]] ending in \"[[.edu]]\" to verify that they are associated with a [[college]] or [[university]]. Dorm Chat allows users to chat with their classmates and colleagues on Omegle.\n\nIn 2015, Omegle began implementing [[ReCAPTCHA|ReCaptcha]] security measures to help reduce the amount of [[Internet bot|bots]] on the site. This has, however, been met with complaints that bots remain and legitimate use is excessively interrupted.\n\nDuring late 2019 and early 2020, Omegle began throwing jabs at the [[Communist Party of China]], and expressing support for the [[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests|Liberation of Hong Kong]] during the 2019/20 protests, with an image on the front page saying \"[[Xi Jinping]] ([[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]) sure looks like [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://z6mag.com/2019/10/10/omegle-throws-jabs-at-china-xi-pooh/|title=Omegle throws jabs at China: 'Xi = Pooh!'|last=Restar|first=Al|date=2019-10-10|website=Z6 Mag|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://funnyjunk.com/Omegle+is+supporting+hong+kong/giadMtv/|title=Omegle Is Supporting Hong Kong|website=funnyjunk.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nPrior to early 2013, the site did not [[Censorship|censor]] contributions through a [[profanity filter]], and users have reported encountering [[nudity]] or [[sexual content]] on camera.<ref name=\"bbctech\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8539701.stm|title=Chatroulette and Omegle: chat rooms with a twist| publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> After January 2013, Omegle implemented a \"monitored\" video chat, to monitor misbehavior and protect people under the age of 18 from potentially harmful content, including nudity or sexual content.

Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n==Prime Minister==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire.

At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by [[Bill Cash]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier.

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]]. In 1999, a BBC Radio 4 poll [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom|ranked him 17th of 19]] among 20th-century British prime ministers;<ref>{{cite news|title=Churchill 'greatest PM of 20th Century'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/579061.stm|publisher=BBC|date=26 December 1999|accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref> in 2016, a [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom#2016 University of Leeds survey|University of Leeds survey]] ranked him 6th of 13 among post-war prime ministers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Britain's post-war prime ministers ranked by politics experts |url=https://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/3930/britains_post-war_prime_ministers_ranked_by_politics_experts |publisher=University of Leeds |accessdate=6 December 2019 |date=13 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nMajor was born on 29 March 1943 at [[St Helier Hospital|St Helier Hospital and Queen Mary's Hospital for Children]] in [[St Helier, London|St Helier]], Surrey, the son of Gwen Major (n\u00e9e Coates, 1905\u20131970) and former [[music hall]] performer [[Tom Major-Ball]] (1879\u20131962), who was sixty-three years old when Major was born.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sole.org.uk/johnmajor.htm |title=Ex Prime Minister Sir John Major and his Sewell Ancestors |publisher=Sole.org.uk |accessdate=22 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030417/http://www.sole.org.uk/johnmajor.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was christened \"John Roy Major\" but only \"John Major\" was recorded on his [[birth certificate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=V%2FaNpVve33l1lx1XfR4O5g&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=2 January 2018|website=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref> He used his middle name until the early 1980s.<ref name=\"number2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/john-major |title=John Major |website=History and Tour |publisher=[[10 Downing Street]] |accessdate=31 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011051246/http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/john-major |archivedate=11 October 2008 }}</ref> Major grew up in Longfellow Road, [[Worcester Park]], Surrey, where he attended primary school at Cheam Common and from 1954, he attended [[Rutlish School]], a grammar school in the [[London Borough of Merton]].\n\nIn 1955, with his father's garden ornaments business in decline, the family moved to [[Brixton]]. The following year, Major watched his first debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], where [[Harold Macmillan]] presented his only Budget as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], and has attributed his political ambitions to that event.<ref name=\"number2\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Harold MacMillan's only budget|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/budget97/background/bud1945_79.shtml|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nMajor left school just before his 16th birthday in 1959 with three [[General Certificate of Education|O-levels]] in History, English Language and English Literature.

He later decided to undertake a correspondence course in banking. Major took up a post as an executive at the [[Standard Chartered |Standard Chartered Bank]] in May 1965 and he rose quickly through the ranks.

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n==Prime Minister==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]]. His [[1997 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]] were announced in August 1997.\n\nMajor remained active in Parliament after his resignation, regularly attending and contributing in debates.

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by [[Bill Cash]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours.

Other regional agencies, mostly owned by public entities such as [[Regions of Italy|regional governments]], operate on the Italian network. The Italian railways are subsidised by the government, receiving \u20ac8.1 billion in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxera.com/Oxera/media/Oxera/downloads/Agenda/The-age-of-the-train.pdf?ext=.pdf |title=The age of the train}}</ref>\n\nTravellers who often make use of the railway during their stay in Italy might use Rail Passes, such as the European Inter-Rail or Italy's national and regional passes. These rail passes allow travellers the freedom to use regional trains during the validity period, but all high-speed and intercity trains require a 10-euro reservation fee. Regional passes, such as \"Io viaggio ovunque Lombardia\", offer one-day, multiple-day and monthly period of validity. There are also saver passes for adults, who travel as a group, with savings up to 20%. Foreign travellers should purchase these passes in advance, so that the passes could be delivered by post prior to the trip. When using the rail passes, the date of travel needs to be filled in before boarding the trains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiarail.com/rail-passes|title=Rail Passes - ItaliaRail - Italy Train Ticket and Rail Pass Experts|author=|date=|website=www.italiarail.com}}</ref>\n\n===High speed trains===\n[[File:Pieve Fissiraga ferrovia autostrada 1.JPG|thumb|The [[Milan\u2013Bologna high-speed railway]]]]\n{{Main article|High-speed rail in Italy}}\nMajor works to increase the commercial speed of the trains already started in 1967: the [[Florence\u2013Rome high-speed railway|Rome-Florence \"super-direct\" line]] was built for trains up to 230&nbsp;km/h, and reduced the journey time to less than two hours. This is the first high-speed train line in Europe, as its operations started in 1977.\n\nIn 2009 a new high-speed line linking Milan and Turin, operating at 300&nbsp;km/h, opened to passenger traffic, reducing the journey time from two hours to one hour. In the same year, the Milan-Bologna line was open, reducing the journey time to 55 minutes. Also the Bologna-Florence high-speed line was upgraded to 300&nbsp;km/h for a journey time of 35 minutes.\n\nSince then, it is possible to travel from Turin to Salerno (ca. 950&nbsp;km) in less than 5 hours. More than 100 trains per day are operated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trenitalia.com/tcom/Le-Frecce/Collegamenti-e-servizi-Frecciarossa|title=Viaggia con i treni Frecciarossa e acquista il biglietti a prezzi scontati - Le Frecce - Trenitalia|website=www.trenitalia.com|language=it|access-date=2017-05-14}}</ref>\n\nThe main public operator of high-speed trains (''alta velocit\u00e0 AV'', formerly Eurostar Italia) is [[Trenitalia]], part of [[Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane|FSI]]. Trains are divided into three categories: Frecciarossa (\"Red arrow\") trains operate at a maximum of 300&nbsp;km/h on dedicated high-speed tracks; Frecciargento (Silver arrow) trains operate at a maximum of 250&nbsp;km/h on both high-speed and mainline tracks; Frecciabianca (White arrow) trains operate at a maximum of 200&nbsp;km/h on mainline tracks only.\n\nSince 2012, a new and Italy's first private train operator, [[Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori|NTV]] (branded as Italo), run high-speed services in competition with [[Trenitalia]]. Even nowadays, Italy is the only county in Europe with a private high-speed train operator.\n\nConstruction of the Milan-Venice high-speed line has begun in 2013 and in 2016 the [[Milan\u2013Verona high-speed railway|Milan-Treviglio]] section has been opened to passenger traffic;  the Milan-Genoa high-speed line (Terzo Valico dei Giovi) is also under construction.\n\nToday it is possible to travel from Rome to Milan in less than 3 hours (2h 55') with the [[Frecciarossa 1000]], the new high-speed train. To cover this route, there's a train every 30 minutes.\n\n===Intercity trains===\nWith the introduction of high-speed trains, intercity trains are limited to few services per day on mainline and regional tracks.\n\nThe '''daytime services''' (''Intercity'' IC), while not freuquent and limited to one or two trains per route, are essential in providing access to cities and towns off the railway's mainline network. The main routes are Trieste to Rome (stopping at Venice, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Milan to Rome (stopping at Genoa, La Spezia, Pisa and Livorno / stopping at Parma, Modena, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Bologna to Lecce (stopping at Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi) and Rome to Reggio di Calabria (stopping at Latina and Naples). In addition, the Intercity trains provide a more economical means of long-distance rail travel within Italy.\n\nThe '''night trains''' (''Intercity Notte'' ICN) have sleeper compartments and washrooms, but no showers on board. Main routes are Rome to Bolzano/Bozen (calling at Florence, Bologna, Verona, Rovereto and Trento), Milan to Lecce (calling at Bologna, Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi), Turin to Lecce (calling at Alessandria, Voghera, Piacenza, Parma, Bologna, Rimini, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi) and Reggio di Calabria to Turin (calling Naples, Rome, Livorno, La Spezia and Genova). Most portions of these ICN services run during the night; since most services take 10 to 15 hours to complete a one-way journey, their day-time portion provide extra train connections to complement with the Intercity services.\n\nThere are a total of 86 intercity trains running within Italy per day.\n\n===Regional trains===\nTrenitalia operates regional services (both fast ''veloce RGV'' and stopping ''REG'') throughout Italy.\n\nRegional train agencies exist: their train schedules are largely connected to and shown on Trenitalia, and tickets for such train services can be purchased through Trenitalia's national network. Other regional agencies have separate ticket systems which are not mutually exchangeable with that of Trenitalia. These \"regional\" tickets could be purchased at local newsagents or tobacco stores instead.\n\n* [[Trentino-Alto Adige]] / Trentino-S\u00fcdtirol: S\u00fcdtirol Bahn (South Tyrol Railway) runs regional services on Ala/Ahl-am-Etsch to Bolzano/Bozen (calling at Rovereto/Rofreit, Trento/Trient and Mezzocorona/Kronmetz), Bolzano/Bozen to Merano/Meran, Bressanone/Brixen to San Candido/Innichen, and a direct \"Tirol regional express REX\" service between Bolzano/Bozen in Italy and Innsbruck in Austria.\n* [[Veneto]]: [[Sistemi Territoriali]] runs regional trains in Veneto region.\n* [[Lombardy]]: [[Trenord]] runs the [[Malpensa Express]] airport train, many Milan's suburban lines and most regional train services in Lombardy. Trenord also co-operates with [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]] and [[Austrian Federal Railways|\u00d6BB]] on the EuroCity Verona-Munich service, and with [[Swiss Federal Railways|SBB CFF FFS]] (joint-venture [[Treni Regionali Ticino Lombardia|TiLo]]) on the regional Milan-Bellinzona service.\n* [[Emilia-Romagna]]: [[Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna]] provides vital connections across cities on different mainline networks, including Modena, Parma, Suzzara, Ferrara, Reggio Emilia and Bologna.\n* [[Tuscany]]: La Ferroviaria Italiana operates in Arezzo province.\n* [[Abruzzo]]: [[Sangritana]] runs daily services between Pescara and Lanciano.\n\nIn addition to these agencies, there's a great deal of other little operators, such as [[AMT Genova]] for the Genova-Casella railway.\n\n===Rapid transit===\n[[File:MB 115 Poliambulanza uscita 20130309.JPG|thumb|right|AnsaldoBreda train for the Brescia Metro.]]\n[[File:Linea 5 lilla - metropolitana di Milano - Stazione Garibaldi.JPG|thumb|right|A station of the new [[Milan Metro Line 5|M5]] line of Milan.]]\nCities with [[Metro (rapid transit)|metro]] systems:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

These rail passes allow travellers the freedom to use regional trains during the validity period, but all high-speed and intercity trains require a 10-euro reservation fee. Regional passes, such as \"Io viaggio ovunque Lombardia\", offer one-day, multiple-day and monthly period of validity. There are also saver passes for adults, who travel as a group, with savings up to 20%. Foreign travellers should purchase these passes in advance, so that the passes could be delivered by post prior to the trip. When using the rail passes, the date of travel needs to be filled in before boarding the trains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiarail.com/rail-passes|title=Rail Passes - ItaliaRail - Italy Train Ticket and Rail Pass Experts|author=|date=|website=www.italiarail.com}}</ref>\n\n===High speed trains===\n[[File:Pieve Fissiraga ferrovia autostrada 1.JPG|thumb|The [[Milan\u2013Bologna high-speed railway]]]]\n{{Main article|High-speed rail in Italy}}\nMajor works to increase the commercial speed of the trains already started in 1967: the [[Florence\u2013Rome high-speed railway|Rome-Florence \"super-direct\" line]] was built for trains up to 230&nbsp;km/h, and reduced the journey time to less than two hours. This is the first high-speed train line in Europe, as its operations started in 1977.\n\nIn 2009 a new high-speed line linking Milan and Turin, operating at 300&nbsp;km/h, opened to passenger traffic, reducing the journey time from two hours to one hour. In the same year, the Milan-Bologna line was open, reducing the journey time to 55 minutes. Also the Bologna-Florence high-speed line was upgraded to 300&nbsp;km/h for a journey time of 35 minutes.\n\nSince then, it is possible to travel from Turin to Salerno (ca. 950&nbsp;km) in less than 5 hours. More than 100 trains per day are operated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trenitalia.com/tcom/Le-Frecce/Collegamenti-e-servizi-Frecciarossa|title=Viaggia con i treni Frecciarossa e acquista il biglietti a prezzi scontati - Le Frecce - Trenitalia|website=www.trenitalia.com|language=it|access-date=2017-05-14}}</ref>\n\nThe main public operator of high-speed trains (''alta velocit\u00e0 AV'', formerly Eurostar Italia) is [[Trenitalia]], part of [[Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane|FSI]]. Trains are divided into three categories: Frecciarossa (\"Red arrow\") trains operate at a maximum of 300&nbsp;km/h on dedicated high-speed tracks; Frecciargento (Silver arrow) trains operate at a maximum of 250&nbsp;km/h on both high-speed and mainline tracks; Frecciabianca (White arrow) trains operate at a maximum of 200&nbsp;km/h on mainline tracks only.\n\nSince 2012, a new and Italy's first private train operator, [[Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori|NTV]] (branded as Italo), run high-speed services in competition with [[Trenitalia]]. Even nowadays, Italy is the only county in Europe with a private high-speed train operator.\n\nConstruction of the Milan-Venice high-speed line has begun in 2013 and in 2016 the [[Milan\u2013Verona high-speed railway|Milan-Treviglio]] section has been opened to passenger traffic;  the Milan-Genoa high-speed line (Terzo Valico dei Giovi) is also under construction.\n\nToday it is possible to travel from Rome to Milan in less than 3 hours (2h 55') with the [[Frecciarossa 1000]], the new high-speed train. To cover this route, there's a train every 30 minutes.\n\n===Intercity trains===\nWith the introduction of high-speed trains, intercity trains are limited to few services per day on mainline and regional tracks.\n\nThe '''daytime services''' (''Intercity'' IC), while not freuquent and limited to one or two trains per route, are essential in providing access to cities and towns off the railway's mainline network. The main routes are Trieste to Rome (stopping at Venice, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Milan to Rome (stopping at Genoa, La Spezia, Pisa and Livorno / stopping at Parma, Modena, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Bologna to Lecce (stopping at Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi) and Rome to Reggio di Calabria (stopping at Latina and Naples). In addition, the Intercity trains provide a more economical means of long-distance rail travel within Italy.\n\nThe '''night trains''' (''Intercity Notte'' ICN) have sleeper compartments and washrooms, but no showers on board. Main routes are Rome to Bolzano/Bozen (calling at Florence, Bologna, Verona, Rovereto and Trento), Milan to Lecce (calling at Bologna, Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi), Turin to Lecce (calling at Alessandria, Voghera, Piacenza, Parma, Bologna, Rimini, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi) and Reggio di Calabria to Turin (calling Naples, Rome, Livorno, La Spezia and Genova). Most portions of these ICN services run during the night; since most services take 10 to 15 hours to complete a one-way journey, their day-time portion provide extra train connections to complement with the Intercity services.\n\nThere are a total of 86 intercity trains running within Italy per day.\n\n===Regional trains===\nTrenitalia operates regional services (both fast ''veloce RGV'' and stopping ''REG'') throughout Italy.\n\nRegional train agencies exist: their train schedules are largely connected to and shown on Trenitalia, and tickets for such train services can be purchased through Trenitalia's national network. Other regional agencies have separate ticket systems which are not mutually exchangeable with that of Trenitalia. These \"regional\" tickets could be purchased at local newsagents or tobacco stores instead.\n\n* [[Trentino-Alto Adige]] / Trentino-S\u00fcdtirol: S\u00fcdtirol Bahn (South Tyrol Railway) runs regional services on Ala/Ahl-am-Etsch to Bolzano/Bozen (calling at Rovereto/Rofreit, Trento/Trient and Mezzocorona/Kronmetz), Bolzano/Bozen to Merano/Meran, Bressanone/Brixen to San Candido/Innichen, and a direct \"Tirol regional express REX\" service between Bolzano/Bozen in Italy and Innsbruck in Austria.\n* [[Veneto]]: [[Sistemi Territoriali]] runs regional trains in Veneto region.\n* [[Lombardy]]: [[Trenord]] runs the [[Malpensa Express]] airport train, many Milan's suburban lines and most regional train services in Lombardy. Trenord also co-operates with [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]] and [[Austrian Federal Railways|\u00d6BB]] on the EuroCity Verona-Munich service, and with [[Swiss Federal Railways|SBB CFF FFS]] (joint-venture [[Treni Regionali Ticino Lombardia|TiLo]]) on the regional Milan-Bellinzona service.\n* [[Emilia-Romagna]]: [[Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna]] provides vital connections across cities on different mainline networks, including Modena, Parma, Suzzara, Ferrara, Reggio Emilia and Bologna.\n* [[Tuscany]]: La Ferroviaria Italiana operates in Arezzo province.\n* [[Abruzzo]]: [[Sangritana]] runs daily services between Pescara and Lanciano.\n\nIn addition to these agencies, there's a great deal of other little operators, such as [[AMT Genova]] for the Genova-Casella railway.\n\n===Rapid transit===\n[[File:MB 115 Poliambulanza uscita 20130309.JPG|thumb|right|AnsaldoBreda train for the Brescia Metro.]]\n[[File:Linea 5 lilla - metropolitana di Milano - Stazione Garibaldi.JPG|thumb|right|A station of the new [[Milan Metro Line 5|M5]] line of Milan.]]\nCities with [[Metro (rapid transit)|metro]] systems:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
