It is also an important radical formed in radiation chemistry, since it leads to the formation of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]], which can enhance [[corrosion]] and [[stress corrosion cracking|SCC]] in coolant systems subjected to radioactive environments. Hydroxyl radicals are also produced during UV-light dissociation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (suggested in 1879) and likely in [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton chemistry]], where trace amounts of reduced transition metals catalyze peroxide-mediated oxidations of organic compounds.\n\nIn [[organic synthesis]], hydroxyl radicals are most commonly generated by [[photolysis]] of [[1-Hydroxy-2(1H)-pyridinethione|1-hydroxy-2(1''H'')-pyridinethione]].\n\nThe hydroxyl radical is often referred to as the \"detergent\" of the [[troposphere]] because it reacts with many pollutants, decomposing them through \"[[cracking (chemistry)#Chemistry|cracking]]\", often acting as the first step to their removal.

This small variability is consistent with measurements of [[methane]] and other trace gases primarily oxidized by <sup>\u2022</sup>OH, as well as global photochemical model calculations.\n\nIn 2014, researchers reported their discovery of a \"hole\" or absence of hydroxyl throughout the entire depth of the [[troposphere]] across a large region of the tropical West Pacific. They suggested that this hole is permitting large quantities of [[ozone]]-degrading chemicals to reach the [[stratosphere]], and that this may be significantly reinforcing ozone depletion in the polar regions with potential consequences for the climate of the Earth.<ref>[\"Like a giant elevator to the stratosphere\", ''News Release'', Alfred Wegener Institute, April 3, 2014]</ref>\n\n==Astronomical importance==\n\n===First detection of interstellar <sup>\u2022</sup>OH===\nThe first experimental evidence for the presence of 18&nbsp;cm absorption lines of the hydroxyl (<sup>\u2022</sup>OH) radical in the radio absorption spectrum of Cassiopeia A was obtained by Weinreb et al.

Even at H<sub>2</sub> densities of 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22123</sup>, dust must be optically thick at infrared wavelengths. But the passage of a shock wave through a molecular cloud is precisely the process which can bring the molecular gas out of equilibrium with the dust, making observations of far-infrared emission lines possible. A moderately fast shock may produce a transient raise in the <sup>\u2022</sup>OH abundance relative to hydrogen. So, it is possible that far-infrared emission lines of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH can be a good diagnostic of shock conditions.\n\n====In diffuse clouds====\nDiffuse clouds are of astronomical interest because they play a primary role in the evolution and thermodynamics of ISM. Observation of the abundant atomic hydrogen in 21&nbsp;cm has shown good signal-to-noise ratio in both emission and absorption. Nevertheless, HI observations have a fundamental difficulty when they are directed at low mass regions of the hydrogen nucleus, as the center part of a diffuse cloud: the thermal width of the hydrogen lines are of the same order as the internal velocities of structures of interest, so cloud components of various temperatures and central velocities are indistinguishable in the spectrum. Molecular line observations in principle do not suffer from this problem. Unlike HI, molecules generally have [[excitation temperature]] ''T''<sub>ex</sub> \u226a ''T''<sub>kin</sub>, so that emission is very weak even from abundant species. CO and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH are the most easily studied candidate molecules.

Even at H<sub>2</sub> densities of 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22123</sup>, dust must be optically thick at infrared wavelengths. But the passage of a shock wave through a molecular cloud is precisely the process which can bring the molecular gas out of equilibrium with the dust, making observations of far-infrared emission lines possible. A moderately fast shock may produce a transient raise in the <sup>\u2022</sup>OH abundance relative to hydrogen. So, it is possible that far-infrared emission lines of <sup>\u2022</sup>OH can be a good diagnostic of shock conditions.\n\n====In diffuse clouds====\nDiffuse clouds are of astronomical interest because they play a primary role in the evolution and thermodynamics of ISM. Observation of the abundant atomic hydrogen in 21&nbsp;cm has shown good signal-to-noise ratio in both emission and absorption. Nevertheless, HI observations have a fundamental difficulty when they are directed at low mass regions of the hydrogen nucleus, as the center part of a diffuse cloud: the thermal width of the hydrogen lines are of the same order as the internal velocities of structures of interest, so cloud components of various temperatures and central velocities are indistinguishable in the spectrum. Molecular line observations in principle do not suffer from this problem. Unlike HI, molecules generally have [[excitation temperature]] ''T''<sub>ex</sub> \u226a ''T''<sub>kin</sub>, so that emission is very weak even from abundant species. CO and <sup>\u2022</sup>OH are the most easily studied candidate molecules. CO has transitions in a region of the spectrum (wavelength <&nbsp;3&nbsp;mm) where there are not strong background continuum sources, but <sup>\u2022</sup>OH has the 18&nbsp;cm emission, line convenient for absorption observations.<ref name=\"DickeyCrovisier1981\">{{cite journal\n|author1=Dickey, J.
