Those who had a basic concept of global warming didn\u2019t necessarily connect it to human activities, revealing that knowledge of global warming and the knowledge that it\u2019s human-induced are two separate things. Over a third of the world's population were unaware of global warming. [[Developing country|Developing countrie]]<nowiki/>s have less awareness than [[Developed country|developed]], and Africa the least aware. Of those aware, residents of [[Latin America]] and developed countries in Asia led the belief that climate change is a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] led in the opposite.

The top five emitters ([[PRC|China]], the United States, India, Russia, and Japan), who together emit half the world's greenhouse gases, vary in both awareness and concern. The United States, Russia, and Japan are the most aware at over 85% of the population. Conversely, only two-thirds of people in China and one-third in India are aware. Japan expresses the greatest concern, which translates into support for environmental policies.

The song was co-written by Cyrus, [[Antonina Armato]] and [[Tim James (music producer)|Tim James]], and produced by [[John Fields (producer)|John Fields]]. It was released on June 17, 2008 by [[Hollywood Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the first [[Breakout (Miley Cyrus album)|studio album]] released by Cyrus with no ties to her character [[List of Hannah Montana main characters|Hannah Montana]] from the [[Disney Channel]] comedy series [[Hannah Montana|of the same name]]. Also registered as \"Seven Things I Hate About You\", Cyrus developed the song during the [[Best of Both Worlds Tour]] while feeling numerous emotions for an ex-boyfriend, mainly anger. The song's release brought allegations that it was about [[Nick Jonas]] of the [[Jonas Brothers]], which Cyrus neither confirmed nor denied. Musically, \"7 Things\" bears aspects of both [[country music|country]] and [[pop punk]], while the lyrics in the song's refrain list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex-boyfriend.\n\n\"7 Things\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics and enjoyed worldwide commercial success, becoming a top ten hit on charts in Australia, Japan, Norway, and the United States. The single was [[Music recording sales certifications|certified gold]] by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), while its appearance on the [[Japan Hot 100]] made \"7 Things\" Cyrus' first song to chart in an Asian country. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Brett Ratner]] and features Cyrus performing the song with a back-up band as many teenage girls lipsync along. The girls clutch a variety of props, such as [[love letter]]s and [[snow globe]]s, inspired by personal items Cyrus' ex had given her. The video was nominated for an [[MTV Video Music Award]] at both the 2008 and 2009 award shows. Cyrus promoted the song through several venues including her world tours, the [[Wonder World Tour (Miley Cyrus)|Wonder World Tour]] and the [[Gypsy Heart Tour]].\n\n==Background==\n\"7 Things\" is also under the [[Title (property)|legal title]] of \"Seven Things I Hate About You\", as registered by [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=9688182&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524134930/http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=9688182&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 24, 2012 |publisher=[[BMI Foundation]] |work=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |title=7 Things }}</ref> Like most of the songs on ''Breakout'', Cyrus conceived \"7 Things\" while traveling on the [[Best of Both Worlds Tour]] from October 2007 to January 2008.<ref name=\"onair\">{{cite interview|url=http://ryan.kiisfm.com/cc-common/mediaplayer/player.html?redir=yes&mps=kiisfm.php&mid=http://a1135.g.akamai.net/f/1135/18227/1h/cchannel.download.akamai.com/18227/podcast/LOSANGELES-CA/KIIS-FM/MILEYCYRUS062508.mp3?CPROG=PCAST&CPROG=RICHMEDIA&MARKET=LOSANGELES-CA&NG_FORMAT=personality&NG_ID=RYAN1027IP&OR_NEWSFORMAT=&OWNER=&SERVER_NAME=ryan.kiisfm.com&SITE_ID=3108&STATION_ID=RYAN-IP&TRACK= |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525212706/http://ryan.kiisfm.com/cc-common/mediaplayer/player.html?redir=yes&mps=kiisfm.php&mid=http://a1135.g.akamai.net/f/1135/18227/1h/cchannel.download.akamai.com/18227/podcast/LOSANGELES-CA/KIIS-FM/MILEYCYRUS062508.mp3%3FCPROG=PCAST&CPROG=RICHMEDIA&MARKET=LOSANGELES-CA&NG_FORMAT=personality&NG_ID=RYAN1027IP&OR_NEWSFORMAT=&OWNER=&SERVER_NAME=ryan.kiisfm.com&SITE_ID=3108&STATION_ID=RYAN-IP&TRACK= |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 25, 2012 |title=On Air with Ryan Seacrest |work=[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]] |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |first=Miley |last=Cyrus |subjectlink=Miley Cyrus |others=[[Ryan Seacrest]] }}</ref>\n{{quote|\"I was locked up in the bus the entire time.

The song was co-written by Cyrus, [[Antonina Armato]] and [[Tim James (music producer)|Tim James]], and produced by [[John Fields (producer)|John Fields]]. It was released on June 17, 2008 by [[Hollywood Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the first [[Breakout (Miley Cyrus album)|studio album]] released by Cyrus with no ties to her character [[List of Hannah Montana main characters|Hannah Montana]] from the [[Disney Channel]] comedy series [[Hannah Montana|of the same name]]. Also registered as \"Seven Things I Hate About You\", Cyrus developed the song during the [[Best of Both Worlds Tour]] while feeling numerous emotions for an ex-boyfriend, mainly anger. The song's release brought allegations that it was about [[Nick Jonas]] of the [[Jonas Brothers]], which Cyrus neither confirmed nor denied. Musically, \"7 Things\" bears aspects of both [[country music|country]] and [[pop punk]], while the lyrics in the song's refrain list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex-boyfriend.\n\n\"7 Things\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics and enjoyed worldwide commercial success, becoming a top ten hit on charts in Australia, Japan, Norway, and the United States. The single was [[Music recording sales certifications|certified gold]] by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), while its appearance on the [[Japan Hot 100]] made \"7 Things\" Cyrus' first song to chart in an Asian country. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Brett Ratner]] and features Cyrus performing the song with a back-up band as many teenage girls lipsync along.

He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]].<ref>J. H. Conway, \"Four-dimensional Archimedean polytopes\", Proc. Colloquium on Convexity, Copenhagen 1965, Kobenhavns Univ. Mat. Institut (1967) 38\u201339.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practiced his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29688355 Martin Gardner, puzzle master extraordinaire]'' by [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[BBC News Magazine]], 21 October 2014: \"The Game of Life appeared in Scientific American in 1970, and was by far the most successful of Gardner's columns, in terms of reader response.\"</ref><ref name=topten>Mulcahy (2014).</ref> Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.<ref>[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/2010/06/ha-conway-on-gardner/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] John H. Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W.

He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], 28 August 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]].<ref>J. H. Conway, \"Four-dimensional Archimedean polytopes\", Proc. Colloquium on Convexity, Copenhagen 1965, Kobenhavns Univ. Mat. Institut (1967) 38\u201339.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practiced his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.\n\nThe design of the vehicle combined with the lack of US [[Department of Transportation|D.O.T.]] approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use and two for high beam use for all the cars imported to USA. However, the European \"TS\" version, for which maximum power was listed as {{Convert|85|PS|hp kW|abbr=on}}, was easily distinguishable from the less powerful \"L\" and \"S\" (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |title=Blech der Woche (23): VW Scirocco Turbo \u2013 Das Auto, das es nie gab \u2013 Auto & Mobil |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211140308/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco GTi.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Scirocco GTi]]\nThe '''Scirocco GTi''' entered production in the summer of 1976, while the later cult Golf GTI wasn't unveiled until the autumn of the same year.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/the-coupe-icon-2276  www.volkswagen-newsroom] The coup\u00e9 icon- Retrieved 21 Feb 2020.</ref> \nIts high-revving, 81 kW / 110 horsepower 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with 9.4 in (239 mm) ventilated discs.

In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.\n \nThe car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage f\u00fcr VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  \n\nThere were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.\n\n===North America===\nThe 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years.

One feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined \"<small>SCIROCCO</small>\" script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line proportioning valves and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.\n[[File:VW Scirocco II rear 20070518.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view, late Scirocco GTX (Germany)]]\n\nHalfway through the 1984 model year, a new space-saver spare wheel was added, that provided room for a larger fuel tank (with a second \"transfer\" fuel pump). Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986.

Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.\n\nScirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.\n\nThe Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.\n\n===North America===\nSpecifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produce {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the engine code was JH. In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models. Sales continued until 1988 in the United States, 1989 in Canada, being effectively replaced in both markets by the more expensive Corrado.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|Mk3|13}}Third generation (2008\u20132017)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation\n| image = VW Scirocco III 2.0 TSI DSG Collectors Edition 54 von 100 Oryxwei\u00df.JPG\n| production = 2008\u20132017\n| assembly = Portugal: [[Palmela]] ([[AutoEuropa]])\n| body_style = 3-door [[hatchback]]\n| platform = [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|Volkswagen Group A5 platform]]\n| engine = 1.4 L [[Inline-four engine|I4]] ([[Petrol engine|petrol]])<br />2.0 L I4 (petrol)<br />2.0 L I4 ([[Diesel engine|diesel]])\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] ([[Direct-Shift Gearbox|DSG]])<br />7-speed automatic (DSG)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2578|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4256|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1810|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1404|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|2862|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}-{{convert|1450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5]]<br />[[Volkswagen Eos]]<br />[[SEAT Le\u00f3n]] Mk2\n| predecessor = [[Volkswagen Corrado]]\n| designer = [[Walter de Silva]]<br />Marc Lichte\n}}\n\n[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco 2008 67 (8451971989).jpg|thumbnail|left|Pre-facelift Scirocco (Europe)]]\nVolkswagen officially announced in June 2006 production of a new Scirocco model at the [[AutoEuropa]] assembly plant in [[Palmela]], Portugal.<ref name=\"announcement\">{{\ncite news\n|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/Unternehmen/Industrie/pshb/fn/relhbi/sfn/buildhbi/cn/GoArt!200012,200038,1095675/SH/0/depot/0/neuer-vw-scirocco-kommt-aus-portugal.html\n|publisher=Handelsblatt\n|title=Neuer VW Scirocco kommt aus Portugal\n|trans-title=New VW Scirocco to come from Portugal\n|date=June 20, 2006\n|language=german\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n{{anchor|Iroc}}\n\nThe new model, identified by the internal type numbers 137 or 1K8, is based on the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|PQ35 platform]] of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf V]] and was unveiled at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2008|2008 Geneva Motor Show]].

In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.\n \nThe car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage f\u00fcr VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  \n\nThere were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.\n\n===North America===\nThe 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years.

Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986.

Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.\n\nScirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.\n\nThe Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.\n\n===North America===\nSpecifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there.

In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models.
