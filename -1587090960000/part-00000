Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].\n\n[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]\n\nCincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20\u201321</ref>   Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>\n\nGermans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

It is also served by [[Interstate 71 (Ohio)|Interstate 71]], [[Interstate 74 (Ohio)|Interstate 74]], [[Interstate 75 (Ohio)|Interstate 75]] and numerous U.S. highways: [[U.S. Highway 22 (Ohio)|US 22]], [[U.S. Highway 25 (Ohio)|US 25]], [[U.S. Highway 27 (Ohio)|US 27]], [[U.S. Highway 42 (Ohio)|US 42]], [[U.S. Route 50 in Ohio|US 50]], [[U.S. Highway 52 (Ohio)|US 52]], and [[U.S. Highway 127 (Ohio)|US 127]].  The [[Riverfront Transit Center]], built underneath 2nd Street, is about the size of eight football fields. It is only used for sporting events and school field trips.  At its construction, it was designed for public transit buses, charter buses, school buses, city coach buses, light rail, and possibly commuter rail.  When not in use for sporting events, it is closed off and rented to a private parking vendor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.go-metro.com/about-metro/about2/doingbusiness/doingbusinesswithmetro/riverfront-transit-center |title=Riverfront Transit Center|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/i-team-48-million-transit-station-sits-empty|title=I-Team: $48 million transit station sits empty|first=Brendan|last=Keefe|date=October 31, 2011|publisher=|access-date=February 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216100317/http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/i-team-48-million-transit-station-sits-empty|archive-date=February 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/07/07/cincinnatis-riverfront-transit-center-attracts-criticism/|title=Cincinnati's Riverfront Transit Center Attracts Criticism|date=July 7, 2009|publisher=|access-date=February 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112215226/http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/07/07/cincinnatis-riverfront-transit-center-attracts-criticism/|archive-date=November 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{clr}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main|List of people from Cincinnati}}\n\n==Sister cities==\nCincinnati has ten [[town twinning|sister cities]].<ref name=\"sisters\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cincinnatisistercity.org/ | publisher=Cincinnati Sister City Association | title=Cincinnati Sister Cities | accessdate=February 5, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218203503/http://www.cincinnatisistercity.org/ | archive-date=December 18, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n\n* {{flagdeco|JOR}} \u2013 [[Amman]], Jordan\n* {{flagdeco|JPN}} \u2013 [[Gifu, Gifu|Gifu City]], Japan\n* {{flagdeco|ZWE}} \u2013 [[Harare]], Zimbabwe\n* {{flagdeco|UKR}} \u2013 [[Kharkiv]], Ukraine\n* {{flagdeco|PRC}} \u2013 [[Liuzhou]], [[Guangxi]], People's Republic of China <!--PRC must be spelled in full-->\n* {{flagdeco|DEU}} \u2013 [[Munich]], Germany\n* {{flagdeco|IND}} \u2013 [[Mysore]], [[Karnataka]], India\n* {{flagdeco|FRA}} \u2013 [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]], France\n* {{flagdeco|ROC}} \u2013 [[New Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], Republic of China\n* {{flagdeco|HUN}} \u2013 [[Szeged]], Hungary\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ohio|North America|United States}}\n* [[City Plan for Cincinnati]]\n* [[Cincinnati metropolitan area|Greater Cincinnati]]\n* [[List of Cincinnati neighborhoods]]\n* [[List of mayors of Cincinnati]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Cincinnati]]\n* [[Streetcars in Cincinnati]] (historical)\n* [[Vine Street, Cincinnati]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* George W.
