There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles.  An ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, [[1 Esdras]], suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:<ref>{{bible|1 Esdras|1:54}}</ref>\n{{quote|And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon}}\n\nIn [[Rabbinic literature]], the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.<ref>Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Kereithot'' 5b)</ref> This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, state that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.\n\n==Archaeology==\nArchaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at [[Kiriath-Jearim]] in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, well after the ark was supposedly removed from there to Jerusalem. In particular, archaeologists found a large elevated podium, associated with the Northern Kingdom and not the Southern Kingdom, which may have been a shrine. [[Thomas R\u00f6mer]] suggests that this may indicate that the ark was not moved to Jerusalem until much later, possibly during the reign of [[King Josiah]].  He notes that this might explain why the ark featured prominently in the history before Solomon, but not after. Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3<ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|35:3}}</ref> indicates that it was moved during King Josiah's reign.<ref name=David>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/MAGAZINE-the-real-ark-of-the-covenant-may-have-housed-pagan-gods-1.5446116|title=The Real Ark of the Covenant may have Housed Pagan Gods|newspaper=Haaretz|author=Ariel David|date=30 Aug 2017}}</ref> Some scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently around the 8th century in a text referred to as the \"Ark Narrative\" and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the exile into Babylon.<ref>K. L. Sparks, \"Ark of the Covenant\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books'' (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 91.</ref>\n\nThomas R\u00f6mer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones \"of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins\", and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah.<ref>Thomas R\u00f6mer, ''The Invention of God'' (Harvard University Press, 2015), 93.</ref> In contrast, Scott Noegel has argued that the parallels between the ark and these practices \"remain unconvincing\" in part because the Bedouin objects lack the ark's distinctive structure, function, and mode of transportation. Specifically, unlike the ark, the Bedouin chests \"contained no box, no lid, and no poles,\" they did not serve as the throne or footstool of a god, they were not overlaid with gold, did not have [[kerubim]] figures upon them, there were no restrictions on who could touch them, and they were transported on horses or camels. Noegel suggests that the ancient Egyptian [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|bark]] is a more plausible model for the Israelite ark, since Egyptian barks had all the features just mentioned. Noegel adds that the Egyptians also were known to place written covenants beneath the feet of statues, proving a further parallel to the placement of the covenental tablets inside the ark.<ref>Scott Noegel, \"The Egyptian Origin of the Ark of the Covenant\" in Thomas E.

Almost immediately after publication of the photographs<ref>[http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/carter/gallery/HomePage.html Photographs by Harry Burton], The Griffith Institute, ''Tutankhamun: Anatomy of an Excavation: The Howard Carter Archives''.</ref> of this sensational archaeological find, some claimed that the Anubis Shrine could be the Ark of the Covenant. John M. Lundquist, author of ''The Temple of Jerusalem: Past, Present, and Future'' (2008), discounts this idea. The Anubis Shrine measures {{convert|95|cm|in}} long, {{convert|37|cm|in}} wide, and {{convert|54.3|cm|in}} high in the shape of a [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]]. The Biblical Ark of the Covenant is approximately {{convert|133|cm|in}} long, {{convert|80|cm|in}} wide, and {{convert|80|cm|in}} high in the shape of a rectangular [[chest (furniture)|chest]].\n\nLundquist observes that the Anubis Shrine is not strictly analogous to the Ark of the Covenant; it can only be said that it is \"ark-like\", constructed of wood,  [[gesso]]ed and gilded, stored within a sacred tomb, \"guarding\" the treasury of the tomb (and not the primary focus of that environment), that it contains compartments within it that store and hold sacred objects, that it has a figure of Anubis on its lid, and that it was carried by two staves permanently inserted into rings at its base and borne by eight priests in the funerary procession to Tutankhamun's tomb. Its value is the insight it provides to the ancient culture of Egypt.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R9VeCEwbNvsC&pg=PA67&dq=%22+ark+of+the+covenant%22+Tutankhamun#v=onepage&q=%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20Tutankhamun Lundquist, John M.

Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.<ref>Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Kereithot'' 5b)</ref> This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, state that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.\n\n==Archaeology==\nArchaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at [[Kiriath-Jearim]] in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, well after the ark was supposedly removed from there to Jerusalem. In particular, archaeologists found a large elevated podium, associated with the Northern Kingdom and not the Southern Kingdom, which may have been a shrine. [[Thomas R\u00f6mer]] suggests that this may indicate that the ark was not moved to Jerusalem until much later, possibly during the reign of [[King Josiah]].  He notes that this might explain why the ark featured prominently in the history before Solomon, but not after. Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3<ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|35:3}}</ref> indicates that it was moved during King Josiah's reign.<ref name=David>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/MAGAZINE-the-real-ark-of-the-covenant-may-have-housed-pagan-gods-1.5446116|title=The Real Ark of the Covenant may have Housed Pagan Gods|newspaper=Haaretz|author=Ariel David|date=30 Aug 2017}}</ref> Some scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently around the 8th century in a text referred to as the \"Ark Narrative\" and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the exile into Babylon.<ref>K. L. Sparks, \"Ark of the Covenant\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books'' (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 91.</ref>\n\nThomas R\u00f6mer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones \"of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins\", and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah.<ref>Thomas R\u00f6mer, ''The Invention of God'' (Harvard University Press, 2015), 93.</ref> In contrast, Scott Noegel has argued that the parallels between the ark and these practices \"remain unconvincing\" in part because the Bedouin objects lack the ark's distinctive structure, function, and mode of transportation. Specifically, unlike the ark, the Bedouin chests \"contained no box, no lid, and no poles,\" they did not serve as the throne or footstool of a god, they were not overlaid with gold, did not have [[kerubim]] figures upon them, there were no restrictions on who could touch them, and they were transported on horses or camels. Noegel suggests that the ancient Egyptian [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|bark]] is a more plausible model for the Israelite ark, since Egyptian barks had all the features just mentioned. Noegel adds that the Egyptians also were known to place written covenants beneath the feet of statues, proving a further parallel to the placement of the covenental tablets inside the ark.<ref>Scott Noegel, \"The Egyptian Origin of the Ark of the Covenant\" in Thomas E.

Originally a \"small but ancient fishing village\" surrounded by open farmland, it grew rapidly in the 19th century in response to the development of its eastern neighbour Brighton, and by the [[Victorian era]] it was a fully developed town with borough status.  Neighbouring parishes such as [[Aldrington]] and [[Hangleton]] were annexed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In 1997, as part of [[1990s United Kingdom local government reform|local government reform]], the borough merged with [[Brighton]] to form the Borough of Brighton and Hove, and this unitary authority was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000.\n\n==Name and etymology==\nOld spellings of Hove include Hou ([[Domesday Book]], 1086), la Houue (1288), Huua (13th century), Houve (13th and 14th centuries), Huve (14th and 15th centuries), Hova (16th century) and Hoova (1675).<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol7/pp265-268|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7, the Rape of Lewes.

Suggestions included an [[Old Norse]] word meaning \"hall\", \"sanctuary\" or \"[[Tumulus|barrow]]\", in reference to the [[Bronze Age]] barrow near the present [[Palmeira Square]]; an [[Old English]] phrase ''aet thaem hofe'' meaning \"at the hall\";{{#tag:ref|This suggestion was given in ''[https://archive.org/stream/placenamesofsuss00robeiala/placenamesofsuss00robeiala_djvu.txt The Place-Names of Sussex]'' (1914) by R.G.

No other places in Britain are called Hove, and single-syllable names as a whole are rare in Sussex.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p89\"/>  The modern name was originally pronounced \"Hoove\" ({{IPAc-en|'|h|u\u02d0|v}}).

After Hove became a borough and expanded to incorporate land from neighbouring parishes, the highest point was approximately {{convert|590|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p90\"/>  There are no rivers in Hove, but Westbourne Gardens at the western boundary of the old parish is named after the \"West [[Bourne (stream)|Bourne]]\", which was still visible in the 19th century but which now runs underground, and a map of 1588 shows another stream called East Brook.<ref name=\"ASON1\">{{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|p=1.}}</ref>\n\nUntil the 19th century the {{convert|778|acre|ha|adj=on}} parish was mostly agricultural.  Three farms\u2014Wick, Goldstone and Long Barn\u2014dominated the area and owned most of the land, which was of good quality: agricultural writer [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] described it as \"uncommonly rich\".  Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown.  Only in the 1870s were the last of the [[market garden]]s near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|county cricket ground]] was built.  Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the [[Great Storm of 1703]]).  The [[chalybeate]] spring on the Wick Farm estate{{#tag:ref|Now the site of [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]].|group=note}} was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the [[South Downs]] and nearby villages along ancient [[Drovers' road|drove roads]].<ref name=\"Middleton1\u20132\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=1\u20132.}}</ref>  Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching [[lark]]s and [[wheatear]]s and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton. The birds were common on the hills and valleys around Hove, such as Goldstone Bottom. The practice died out when wheatears became a protected species in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Middleton10\u201311\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=10\u201311.}}</ref>  The urban growth of Hove has shifted sheep-farming to more isolated parts of the South Downs, but several drove roads survive today as roads or footpaths. Hove Street and its northward continuation Sackville Road were originally known as ''Hove Drove'' and led on to the Downs.  A long west\u2013east route which crossed [[West Blatchington]], Hove and Preston parishes on its way to [[Lewes]] now bears the names The Droveway, The Drove and Preston Drove.  The section called The Droveway, on which the [[British Engineerium|Goldstone Waterworks]] was built in the 1860s, had to be maintained as a right of way when [[Hove Park]] was built.  A long diagonal footpath once known as Dyer's Drove runs for several miles from Portslade-by-Sea on to the Downs, and Drove Road in Portslade village may have been used since Roman times.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv4p34\u201336\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 4, pp. 34\u201336.}}</ref>\n\nA large [[Sarsen]] stone called the Goldstone stood on farmland northwest of the village, now part of [[Hove Park]].  Links with druids were claimed; and some 19th-century sources stated it was part of a ring of stones similar to [[Stonehenge]], and that the others were buried in a pond at Goldstone Bottom, one of the [[Combe|coombes]] (small dry valleys) between the Downs and the sea.<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\"/><ref name=\"Middleton28\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=28.}}</ref>  The Goldstone was dug up and buried by a farmer, but was unearthed and re-erected in a new position in the park{{#tag:ref|At {{coord|50.839433|-0.173735}}|group=note}} in 1906.<ref name=\"Middleton29\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=29.}}</ref>\n\nHove has little ancient woodland.

The latter covers {{convert|11|acre|ha}} and belonged to the [[Marquess of Abergavenny]] until Hove Borough Council bought it in January 1935.

The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century [[Hangleton]] housing estate.\n\n===18th century===\nIn 1723 a traveller, the antiquary [[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]], wrote, 'I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |title=THE SUSSEX COAST |accessdate=2015-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210200159/http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.\n\nIn 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote in reference to the south coast, 'I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]].\"<ref>Defoe, Daniel (1724). ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Letter III''. London.</ref>\n\n=== Regency and Victorian developments ===\nThe census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned [[George IV]], the population had risen to 312 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, introduction</ref> with the dwellings still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This isolated location was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew's Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.\n\nAlso at the bottom of Hove Street was the bull-ring. At a bull-bait in 1810 the bull escaped, scattering spectators before being recaptured and dragged back to the ring. This was the last bull-bait to take place in Hove.\n\nThe fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of [[brickearth]] and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.\n\nIn the years following the Coronation of 1821 the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]] of large [[Regency architecture|Regency]] houses boasting a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses studiously avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.\n\nDating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.\n\nThe Brighton General Gas Light Company was formed in 1825. Production of [[coal gas]] was notorious for the foul smell it produced, and was only sited in the poorest areas. The company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and the ruins of St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia by the same means. With a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard, this industrial site was a considerable intrusion on the impoverished populace of Hove, although not for rapidly growing but still-distant Brighton, which was the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove avoided the duty of \u00a31 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly exempt, was supplied by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the coal down chutes into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, risky for the vessel and also inherently dirty and disruptive, may have been used at Hove until eventually superseded. The railway arrived in 1840 whilst several miles along the coast Shoreham Harbour was increasing its coal trade. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand, in 1871 a large new works was built at Portslade-by-Sea in Shoreham Harbour, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.\n\nBy 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\"/> but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as 'a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts'.\n\n[[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect [[George Basevi]] (1794\u20131845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.\n\nThe flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England's oldest county club, [[Sussex County Cricket Club]], used the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]].\n\nTwo further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under [[Frederick Banister]] from the late 1840s;<ref name=\"Federick Dale Banister\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|title=Federick Dale Banister|publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk|accessdate=10 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154258/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.\n\nWest of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by [[William Willett]].\n\nHove's wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], aunt of [[Winston Churchill]]. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] used to visit his lover, the already married [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O\u2019Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder.<ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983 p.37\">Middleton J.

The committee commissioned [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], the architect responsible for [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] on London's Whitehall which became the focus of [[national memory|national remembrance]] services. Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design. The eventual result was a statue of Saint George atop a column, situated in the centre of Grand Avenue. The memorial does not contain the names of the fallen, which are instead recorded on a bronze plaque in Hove Library.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1187556 |desc=Hove War Memorial|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Skelton|first1=Tim|last2=Gliddon|first2=Gerald|title=Lutyens and the Great War|year=2008|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=9780711228788|pages=75, 169}}</ref>\n\n==Governance and politics==\n\n===Coat of arms===\nWhile it was still a separate entity, Hove had its own [[coat of arms]].

The design incorporates several features relevant to Hove's history.  The ships of the French raiders who repeatedly attacked the coast in the Brighton and Hove area in the 16th century are represented by the crest.  The [[saltire]] of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the leg-shackles of [[Leonard of Noblac]] refer to the ancient [[parish church]]es of Hove and [[Aldrington]], [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's]] and [[St Leonard's Church, Aldrington|St Leonard's]] respectively.

Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper [[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]], and small locally owned shops. However these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre's first large supermarket (a [[Tesco]]), built on the site of a former [[gasometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6728127.the-great-tesco-takeover/|title=The great Tesco takeover|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uk FloralClockHove.jpg|thumb|right|Floral Clock, [[Palmeira Square]]]]\n[[Image:Hovebeach.jpg|thumb|right|Hove [[Esplanade|promenade]] facing towards [[Brighton]]]]\n\n== Transport ==\n{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}\n\nHove has a comprehensive public transport system including buses to all districts, a bus monitoring system accessible via the internet and with displays at some bus stops (a system integrated with Brighton), and taxis which are able to pick up across the city of Brighton and Hove.\n\nHove has three railway stations. [[Hove railway station]] has direct access to the [[Brighton main line]] to London via a loop eliminating the need to go through [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]]. Hove is on the [[West Coastway Line]], as are [[Aldrington railway station|Aldrington]] and [[Portslade railway station|Portslade and West Hove]] stations. A 'halt' stop at Holland Road, between Hove and Brighton, was in operation from 1905 to 1956. Direct train journeys to London take just over an hour, and to Brighton, a few minutes.\n\nBranching off close to Aldrington was formerly a branch line to [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]] which closed in 1938. The route of the line may be followed along a path alongside West Hove golf club; the path leads all the way to Devil's Dyke, and railway sleepers once used under the tracks may be seen to either side of the path, plus the remains of two of the stations still exist in places but are on private land.\n\n== Hove Museum and Art Gallery ==\n[[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]] houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.[http://www.hove.virtualmuseum.info/]\n\n== Education ==\nHove is home to around Eight [[primary school]]s: West Blatchington Primary and Nursery School, St. Andrew's CE School, West Hove Junior School, Benfield Junior School, Goldstone Primary School, Hangleton Junior School, Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School, Mile Oak Primary School, [https://www.bilingualprimaryschool.org.uk Bilingual Primary School], Brunswick Primary School and well as Aldrington CE School.

Originally a \"small but ancient fishing village\" surrounded by open farmland, it grew rapidly in the 19th century in response to the development of its eastern neighbour Brighton, and by the [[Victorian era]] it was a fully developed town with borough status.  Neighbouring parishes such as [[Aldrington]] and [[Hangleton]] were annexed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In 1997, as part of [[1990s United Kingdom local government reform|local government reform]], the borough merged with [[Brighton]] to form the Borough of Brighton and Hove, and this unitary authority was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000.\n\n==Name and etymology==\nOld spellings of Hove include Hou ([[Domesday Book]], 1086), la Houue (1288), Huua (13th century), Houve (13th and 14th centuries), Huve (14th and 15th centuries), Hova (16th century) and Hoova (1675).<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol7/pp265-268|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7, the Rape of Lewes.

Three farms\u2014Wick, Goldstone and Long Barn\u2014dominated the area and owned most of the land, which was of good quality: agricultural writer [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] described it as \"uncommonly rich\".  Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown.  Only in the 1870s were the last of the [[market garden]]s near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|county cricket ground]] was built.  Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the [[Great Storm of 1703]]).  The [[chalybeate]] spring on the Wick Farm estate{{#tag:ref|Now the site of [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]].|group=note}} was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the [[South Downs]] and nearby villages along ancient [[Drovers' road|drove roads]].<ref name=\"Middleton1\u20132\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=1\u20132.}}</ref>  Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching [[lark]]s and [[wheatear]]s and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton. The birds were common on the hills and valleys around Hove, such as Goldstone Bottom. The practice died out when wheatears became a protected species in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Middleton10\u201311\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=10\u201311.}}</ref>  The urban growth of Hove has shifted sheep-farming to more isolated parts of the South Downs, but several drove roads survive today as roads or footpaths. Hove Street and its northward continuation Sackville Road were originally known as ''Hove Drove'' and led on to the Downs.  A long west\u2013east route which crossed [[West Blatchington]], Hove and Preston parishes on its way to [[Lewes]] now bears the names The Droveway, The Drove and Preston Drove.  The section called The Droveway, on which the [[British Engineerium|Goldstone Waterworks]] was built in the 1860s, had to be maintained as a right of way when [[Hove Park]] was built.  A long diagonal footpath once known as Dyer's Drove runs for several miles from Portslade-by-Sea on to the Downs, and Drove Road in Portslade village may have been used since Roman times.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv4p34\u201336\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 4, pp. 34\u201336.}}</ref>\n\nA large [[Sarsen]] stone called the Goldstone stood on farmland northwest of the village, now part of [[Hove Park]].

Also buried in the coffin in which the amber cup was found were a stone battle-axe, a [[Sharpening stone|whetstone]] and a bronze dagger whose appearance is characteristic of the [[Wessex culture]].<ref name=\"Middleton51\"/>\n\n=== Domesday Book ===\nThere are entries for Brighton and Portslade (Bristelmestune and Porteslage) and small downland settlements like Hangleton (Hangetone), but nothing for the location of Hove itself.\n\n=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\nThe first known settlement in Hove was around the 12th century when [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was established. Hove remained insignificant for centuries, consisting of just a single street running north\u2013south some 250&nbsp;m from the church, which by the 16th century was recorded as being in ruins.\n[[Hangleton Manor Inn|Hangleton Manor]] is a well-preserved 16th-century [[flint]] manor building. It is believed to have been built c. 1540 for Richard Bel(l)ingham, twice [[High Sheriff of Sussex]], whose initials are carved into a fireplace, and whose [[coat of arms]] adorns a period plaster ceiling. The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century [[Hangleton]] housing estate.\n\n===18th century===\nIn 1723 a traveller, the antiquary [[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]], wrote, 'I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |title=THE SUSSEX COAST |accessdate=2015-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210200159/http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.\n\nIn 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote in reference to the south coast, 'I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]].\"<ref>Defoe, Daniel (1724). ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Letter III''. London.</ref>\n\n=== Regency and Victorian developments ===\nThe census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned [[George IV]], the population had risen to 312 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, introduction</ref> with the dwellings still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This isolated location was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew's Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.\n\nAlso at the bottom of Hove Street was the bull-ring. At a bull-bait in 1810 the bull escaped, scattering spectators before being recaptured and dragged back to the ring. This was the last bull-bait to take place in Hove.\n\nThe fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of [[brickearth]] and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.\n\nIn the years following the Coronation of 1821 the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]] of large [[Regency architecture|Regency]] houses boasting a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses studiously avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.\n\nDating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.\n\nThe Brighton General Gas Light Company was formed in 1825. Production of [[coal gas]] was notorious for the foul smell it produced, and was only sited in the poorest areas. The company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and the ruins of St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia by the same means. With a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard, this industrial site was a considerable intrusion on the impoverished populace of Hove, although not for rapidly growing but still-distant Brighton, which was the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove avoided the duty of \u00a31 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly exempt, was supplied by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the coal down chutes into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, risky for the vessel and also inherently dirty and disruptive, may have been used at Hove until eventually superseded. The railway arrived in 1840 whilst several miles along the coast Shoreham Harbour was increasing its coal trade. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand, in 1871 a large new works was built at Portslade-by-Sea in Shoreham Harbour, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.\n\nBy 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\"/> but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as 'a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts'.\n\n[[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect [[George Basevi]] (1794\u20131845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.\n\nThe flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England's oldest county club, [[Sussex County Cricket Club]], used the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]].\n\nTwo further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under [[Frederick Banister]] from the late 1840s;<ref name=\"Federick Dale Banister\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|title=Federick Dale Banister|publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk|accessdate=10 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154258/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.\n\nWest of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by [[William Willett]].\n\nHove's wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], aunt of [[Winston Churchill]]. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] used to visit his lover, the already married [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O\u2019Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder.<ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983 p.37\">Middleton J.

The committee commissioned [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], the architect responsible for [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] on London's Whitehall which became the focus of [[national memory|national remembrance]] services. Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design. The eventual result was a statue of Saint George atop a column, situated in the centre of Grand Avenue. The memorial does not contain the names of the fallen, which are instead recorded on a bronze plaque in Hove Library.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1187556 |desc=Hove War Memorial|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Skelton|first1=Tim|last2=Gliddon|first2=Gerald|title=Lutyens and the Great War|year=2008|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=9780711228788|pages=75, 169}}</ref>\n\n==Governance and politics==\n\n===Coat of arms===\nWhile it was still a separate entity, Hove had its own [[coat of arms]].

The design incorporates several features relevant to Hove's history.  The ships of the French raiders who repeatedly attacked the coast in the Brighton and Hove area in the 16th century are represented by the crest.  The [[saltire]] of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the leg-shackles of [[Leonard of Noblac]] refer to the ancient [[parish church]]es of Hove and [[Aldrington]], [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's]] and [[St Leonard's Church, Aldrington|St Leonard's]] respectively.

Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper [[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]], and small locally owned shops. However these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre's first large supermarket (a [[Tesco]]), built on the site of a former [[gasometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6728127.the-great-tesco-takeover/|title=The great Tesco takeover|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uk FloralClockHove.jpg|thumb|right|Floral Clock, [[Palmeira Square]]]]\n[[Image:Hovebeach.jpg|thumb|right|Hove [[Esplanade|promenade]] facing towards [[Brighton]]]]\n\n== Transport ==\n{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}\n\nHove has a comprehensive public transport system including buses to all districts, a bus monitoring system accessible via the internet and with displays at some bus stops (a system integrated with Brighton), and taxis which are able to pick up across the city of Brighton and Hove.\n\nHove has three railway stations. [[Hove railway station]] has direct access to the [[Brighton main line]] to London via a loop eliminating the need to go through [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]]. Hove is on the [[West Coastway Line]], as are [[Aldrington railway station|Aldrington]] and [[Portslade railway station|Portslade and West Hove]] stations. A 'halt' stop at Holland Road, between Hove and Brighton, was in operation from 1905 to 1956. Direct train journeys to London take just over an hour, and to Brighton, a few minutes.\n\nBranching off close to Aldrington was formerly a branch line to [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]] which closed in 1938. The route of the line may be followed along a path alongside West Hove golf club; the path leads all the way to Devil's Dyke, and railway sleepers once used under the tracks may be seen to either side of the path, plus the remains of two of the stations still exist in places but are on private land.\n\n== Hove Museum and Art Gallery ==\n[[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]] houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.[http://www.hove.virtualmuseum.info/]\n\n== Education ==\nHove is home to around Eight [[primary school]]s: West Blatchington Primary and Nursery School, St. Andrew's CE School, West Hove Junior School, Benfield Junior School, Goldstone Primary School, Hangleton Junior School, Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School, Mile Oak Primary School, [https://www.bilingualprimaryschool.org.uk Bilingual Primary School], Brunswick Primary School and well as Aldrington CE School.

arms===\n\n====Current use====\nThe traditional symbol of Westphalia is the Westphalian Steed: a white horse on a red field. It is derived from the [[Saxon Steed]] in the coat of arms of the medieval [[Duchy of Saxony]] which most of today's Westphalia was part of. In official contexts the coat of arms of Westphalia is being used by the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association,<ref name=\"Official Arms\">[http://www.lwl.org/lwl-download/datei-download2/Politik/satzungen/1031581787_0/Hauptsatzung_15.11.2007_mit_Anlagen.pdf Hauptsatzung des LWL]</ref> which represents these two historic parts of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nThe [[coat of arms of North Rhine-Westphalia]] uses the Westphalian Steed to represent Westphalia as one of its parts alongside the Lippish Rose representing Lippe and the [[Rhine]] River representing the Northern Rhineland.<ref>[https://www.landtag.nrw.de/portal/WWW/GB_II/II.1/OeA/60JAHRE/2707_Landeswappen.jsp Landtag NRW: Das Wappen des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen]</ref>\n\n====Previous use====\n[[Prussia]] already used the Westphalian Steed in the coat of arms of its [[Province of Westphalia]]. It also is a big part of Kisker Germany, the biggest county in Germany.\n\n====Similar versions====\nThe [[coat of arms of Lower Saxony]] uses a different version of the Saxon Steed since the [[Lower Saxony|state]] also covers large parts of the Old Saxons' duchy.\n\n===Flag===\n\n====Current use====\nThe colors of Westphalia are white and red. The flag of the Westphalia-Lippe Regional Association uses these colors with the Westphalian coat of arms in its center.<ref name=\"Official Arms\" />\n\nThe [[flag of North Rhine-Westphalia]] is a combination of the Northern Rhineland's colors green/white and the Westphalian white/red.<ref>[http://www.mik.nrw.de/themen-aufgaben/verfassung-recht/hoheitszeichen/landesflagge.html MIK NRW: Landesflagge]</ref>\n\n====Previous use====\nThe flag of the Prussian Province of Westphalia already displayed the colors white and red.\n\n====Similar versions====\nThe [[flag of Lower Saxony]] shows the [[Flag of Germany|colors of Germany]] and the Saxon Steed.\n\n===Anthem===\nComposed in [[Iserlohn]] in 1886 by [[Emil Rittershaus]], the ''[[Westfalenlied]]'' is an unofficial anthem of Westphalia.\n\n==Identity==\n[[File:Dialekte in Nordrhein-Westfalen.PNG|thumb|340px|Dialects in North Rhine-Westphalia: [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] in red, [[West Low German|West Low German dialects]] in blue.]]\n[[File:Westphalian (German) ladies peasant costume.jpg|thumb|Westphalian (German) ladies peasant costume \u2013 illustration by Percy Anderson for Costume Fanciful, Historical and Theatrical, 1906.]]\nWhile the Northern Rhineland, Westphalia and Lippe are different historic territories of today's [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], the old border between the former [[Rhine Province]] and the [[Province of Westphalia]] is also a language border. While in Westphalia and Lippe, people tend to speak [[West Low German|West Low German dialects]] and especially the [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] variant of the [[Low German language]], [[Central German]] and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] dialects are being spoken in the Northern Rhineland.<ref name=\"dialects\" /><ref>[http://www.lwl.org/komuna/pdf/mundartregionen_westfalens.pdf LWL: Mundartenregionen Westfalens]</ref>\n\nThese different regional identities are often being emphasized by different majorities of denomination between [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Lutheran Protestants]]. The different majorities date back to the days of the [[Kleinstaaterei|territorial fragmentation]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire (of the German Nation)]] which existed until 1806. The [[M\u00fcnsterland]] and the region around [[Paderborn]] for instance are still mainly Catholic regions because of the former existence of the [[Prince-bishop|prince-bishoprics]] of [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn|Paderborn]]. The mainly Lutheran [[Lippe (district)|Lippe]] was even able to retain its independence as a small state within [[German Reich|Germany]] in the form of a [[Principality of Lippe|principality]] until 1918 and as a [[Free State of Lippe|free state]] until 1946. This continues to influence the identity of its people who often distinguish themselves from neighboring regions such as [[East Westphalia]].<ref name=\"1789 territories\" />\n\nIn addition to these historic, lingual and religious aspects, there are some regional differences in culture and mentality. That is why many of the citizens of North Rhine-Westphalia rather see themselves either as \"Rhinelanders\", \"Westphalians\" or \"Lippers\" rather than as \"North Rhine-Westphalians\".\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of North Rhine-Westphalia|History of Germany}}\nWestphalia is known for the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] which ended the [[Thirty Years' War]], as the two treaties were signed in [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Osnabr\u00fcck]].\n\nIt is one of the regions that were part of all [[Succession of states|incarnations]] of the [[History of Germany|German state]] since the [[Early Middle Ages]]: the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the [[German Confederation]], the [[North German Confederation]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist Germany]]. After [[World War II]] it was a part of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British occupation zone]] which merged with the American zone to become the [[Bizone]] in 1947 and again merged with the French zone to become the Trizone in 1948. The current [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] was founded on these territories making Westphalia a part of [[West Germany]]. It is a part of united Germany since 1990.\n\n===Roman incursion===\nAround 1 A.D. there were numerous incursions through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or Romanized settlements. The [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] took place near Osnabr\u00fcck, which at this time was a place of settlement of the Westphalians, who were a part of the Germanic tribe of the [[Saxons]]. Some of the tribes who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia.<ref>[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=850&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Westfalen zur Zeit der Germanen und R\u00f6mer]</ref><ref>[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=28&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Die Zeit der r\u00f6mischen Feldz\u00fcge in Germanien (12 v.-16 n. Chr.)]</ref>\n\n===Charlemagne===\n[[Charlemagne]] is thought to have spent considerable time in [[Paderborn]] and nearby parts. His [[Saxon Wars]] also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary [[Widukind]] to places near Detmold, Bielefeld, Lemgo, Osnabr\u00fcck and other places in Westphalia. Widukind was buried in [[Enger]], which is also a subject of a legend.<ref name=\"Part of Saxony\" />\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Westfalia_locator_map_(1000).svg|thumb|right|Westphalia within Saxony circa 1000&nbsp;CE{{legend|#d40000|Westphalia}}{{legend|#FEFEE9|Other parts of Saxony}}{{legend|#F6E1B9|Rest of the [[German Kingdom]]}}]]\nAlong with [[Eastphalia]], [[Angria]] and [[Nordalbingia]], Westphalia ''(Westfalahi)'' was originally a district of the [[Duchy of Saxony]]. At the time, large portions of its territory in the north lay in what today is [[Lower Saxony]]. Following the deposition of the Saxon duke [[Henry the Lion]] in 1180 and the subsequent belittlement of the duchy, Westphalia was elevated to a duchy in its own right by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]]. The [[Duchy of Westphalia]] comprised only a small area south of the [[Lippe (river)|Lippe River]].<ref name=\"Part of Saxony\" />\n\nModern Westphalia was a part of the [[Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle]] of the Holy Roman Empire, which comprised territories of [[Lower Lorraine]], [[Frisia]] and parts of the former [[Duchy of Saxony]].\n\n===Early modern era===\n[[File:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|left|Ratification of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 in [[M\u00fcnster]] by Gerard Terborch (1617\u20131681)]]\nAs a result of the [[Protestant Reformation]], there was no dominant religion in Westphalia. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Lutheranism]] were on a relatively equal footing. Lutheranism was strong in the eastern and northern parts with numerous free churches. M\u00fcnster and especially Paderborn were considered to be Catholic. Osnabr\u00fcck was divided almost equally between Catholicism and Protestantism.<ref name=\"Reformation\">[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=32&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Westfalen im konfessionellen Zeitalter]</ref>\n\nParts of Westphalia came under [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]n control during the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it remained divided by duchies and other areas of feudal power. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, signed in M\u00fcnster and Osnabr\u00fcck, ended the [[Thirty Years' War]].

After in 1816, the former [[Duchy of Westphalia]] and the counties of [[Wittgenstein Land|Wittgenstein]] and in 1851 the [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] of [[Lippstadt]] had joined the province, Westphalia had received its modern territorial shape.<ref name=\"1770-1815\" /><ref name=\"Prussian Province\" />\n\nIn 1816, the [[Regierungsbezirk|governmental districts]] of Arnsberg, Minden and M\u00fcnster were created.<ref name=\"1770-1815\" /><ref name=\"Prussian Province\" />\n\n===Modern Westphalia===\nAfter [[World War II]] in 1946, the present state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was created by the [[British occupation zone|British military government]] from the former Prussian Province of Westphalia and the northern half of the former Prussian [[Rhine Province]]. The old governmental districts of 1816 stayed in place. When in 1947 the former [[Free State of Lippe]] with its capital Detmold joined North Rhine-Westphalia, the \"Governmental District of Minden\" was enlarged by this territory and renamed \"Governmental District of Detmold\". In total, North Rhine-Westphalia is subdivided into five governmental districts ''([[Regierungsbezirk]]e)''.

While in Westphalia and Lippe, people tend to speak [[West Low German|West Low German dialects]] and especially the [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] variant of the [[Low German language]], [[Central German]] and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] dialects are being spoken in the Northern Rhineland.<ref name=\"dialects\" /><ref>[http://www.lwl.org/komuna/pdf/mundartregionen_westfalens.pdf LWL: Mundartenregionen Westfalens]</ref>\n\nThese different regional identities are often being emphasized by different majorities of denomination between [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Lutheran Protestants]]. The different majorities date back to the days of the [[Kleinstaaterei|territorial fragmentation]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire (of the German Nation)]] which existed until 1806. The [[M\u00fcnsterland]] and the region around [[Paderborn]] for instance are still mainly Catholic regions because of the former existence of the [[Prince-bishop|prince-bishoprics]] of [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn|Paderborn]]. The mainly Lutheran [[Lippe (district)|Lippe]] was even able to retain its independence as a small state within [[German Reich|Germany]] in the form of a [[Principality of Lippe|principality]] until 1918 and as a [[Free State of Lippe|free state]] until 1946. This continues to influence the identity of its people who often distinguish themselves from neighboring regions such as [[East Westphalia]].<ref name=\"1789 territories\" />\n\nIn addition to these historic, lingual and religious aspects, there are some regional differences in culture and mentality. That is why many of the citizens of North Rhine-Westphalia rather see themselves either as \"Rhinelanders\", \"Westphalians\" or \"Lippers\" rather than as \"North Rhine-Westphalians\".\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of North Rhine-Westphalia|History of Germany}}\nWestphalia is known for the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] which ended the [[Thirty Years' War]], as the two treaties were signed in [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Osnabr\u00fcck]].\n\nIt is one of the regions that were part of all [[Succession of states|incarnations]] of the [[History of Germany|German state]] since the [[Early Middle Ages]]: the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the [[German Confederation]], the [[North German Confederation]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist Germany]]. After [[World War II]] it was a part of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British occupation zone]] which merged with the American zone to become the [[Bizone]] in 1947 and again merged with the French zone to become the Trizone in 1948. The current [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] was founded on these territories making Westphalia a part of [[West Germany]]. It is a part of united Germany since 1990.\n\n===Roman incursion===\nAround 1 A.D. there were numerous incursions through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or Romanized settlements. The [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] took place near Osnabr\u00fcck, which at this time was a place of settlement of the Westphalians, who were a part of the Germanic tribe of the [[Saxons]]. Some of the tribes who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia.<ref>[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=850&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Westfalen zur Zeit der Germanen und R\u00f6mer]</ref><ref>[http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=28&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente LWL: Die Zeit der r\u00f6mischen Feldz\u00fcge in Germanien (12 v.-16 n.

His [[Saxon Wars]] also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary [[Widukind]] to places near Detmold, Bielefeld, Lemgo, Osnabr\u00fcck and other places in Westphalia.

At the time, large portions of its territory in the north lay in what today is [[Lower Saxony]]. Following the deposition of the Saxon duke [[Henry the Lion]] in 1180 and the subsequent belittlement of the duchy, Westphalia was elevated to a duchy in its own right by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]]. The [[Duchy of Westphalia]] comprised only a small area south of the [[Lippe (river)|Lippe River]].<ref name=\"Part of Saxony\" />\n\nModern Westphalia was a part of the [[Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle]] of the Holy Roman Empire, which comprised territories of [[Lower Lorraine]], [[Frisia]] and parts of the former [[Duchy of Saxony]].\n\n===Early modern era===\n[[File:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|left|Ratification of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 in [[M\u00fcnster]] by Gerard Terborch (1617\u20131681)]]\nAs a result of the [[Protestant Reformation]], there was no dominant religion in Westphalia. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Lutheranism]] were on a relatively equal footing. Lutheranism was strong in the eastern and northern parts with numerous free churches.

When in 1947 the former [[Free State of Lippe]] with its capital Detmold joined North Rhine-Westphalia, the \"Governmental District of Minden\" was enlarged by this territory and renamed \"Governmental District of Detmold\".

Since then the two countries have faced each other in four major wars\u2014the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]], the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912 to 1913, the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914 to 1918) and finally the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)]], which were followed by the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]] and a period of friendly relations in the 1930s and 1940s. Both countries entered [[NATO]] in 1952. Relations deteriorated again in the 1950s due to the [[Cyprus issue]], the [[1955 Istanbul pogrom]] and the expulsion of the Istanbul Greeks in the 1960s, the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, and subsequent military confrontations over the [[Aegean dispute]]. A period of relative normalization began after 1999 with the so-called \"[[Greek\u2013Turkish earthquake diplomacy|earthquake diplomacy]]\", which notably led to a change in the previously firmly negative stance of the Greek government on the issue of the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]].\n\n==Diplomatic missions==\n*Turkey has an embassy in [[Athens]] and consulates general in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Komotini]] and [[Rhodes]].\n*Greece has an embassy in [[Ankara]] and consulates general in [[Istanbul]], [[\u0130zmir]] and [[Edirne]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Byzantine against Seljuq and Ottoman===\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Ottoman Wars|Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars}}\n[[File:Byzantium vs Seljuk c 1071 cropped.png|thumb|[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine territory]] (purple), Byzantine campaigns (red) and [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] campaigns (green).]]\nIn 1048 conflicts between [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] (Greeks were dominant nation of the Byzantine Empire and the Empire was Hellenized) started. Many [[Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars|wars and battles]] were fought between the Byzantine and the Seljuq armies. Also, in 1300 conflicts between [[Ottomans]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] started too.\n\nIn 1453, Ottomans [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered Constantinople]], the capital city of the Byzantine Empire. In 1460 they conquered the [[Despotate of the Morea]], in 1461 the [[Empire of Trebizond]], in 1475 the [[Principality of Theodoro]] and by 1500 most of the plains and islands were in Ottoman hands. Holdouts included [[Rhodes]], conquered in 1522, [[Cyprus]] in 1571, [[Crete]], retained by the Venetians until 1669, and the [[Ionian islands]] which remained primarily under the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]].\n\n===Ottoman era until 1820===\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars]] and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u201374)]] Greece provided aid to Ottoman rivals. [[Dionysius the Philosopher]] additionally organised several uprisings. In addition, the [[Lambros Katsonis]] fleet began harassing the Ottoman fleet in the Aegean Sea.\n\nIn 1770, the Ottoman army [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1770)|invaded the Mani]].\n\nIn the [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1803)|1803]], [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1807)|1807]] and [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1815)|1815]] the Ottoman army invaded Mani. Also during this period, in 1803 there was a [[Souliote War (1803)|final fight]] between the [[Souliotes]] and the [[Pashalik of Yanina|local Ottoman]] ruler, [[Ali Pasha of Yanina|Ali Pasha]], which ended the many years of conflicts between them.\n\n===Ottoman era and the Greek state until 1913===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Balkan Wars|}}\n\n[[File:The Ottoman ambassador and his page at a ball at the royal residence in Athens, 1838.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The first Ottoman ambassador to the Greek Kingdom, the [[Phanariote]] [[Konstantinos Mousouros]], at a ball in the royal palace in Athens]]\n\nIn March 1821, the [[Greek War of Independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] began. The Greeks formally declared their independence in January 1822, and after the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827, the establishment of a Greek state was recognized in the [[London Protocol (1828)|London Protocol]] of 1828. The first borders of the Greek state consisted of the Greek mainland south of a line from [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] to [[Volos]] plus [[Euboea]] and the [[Cyclades]] islands in the Aegean Sea. The rest of the Greek-speaking lands, including [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] and the rest of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands, [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]], remained under Ottoman rule. Over one million Greeks also lived in what is now [[Turkey]], mainly in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region of [[Asia Minor]], especially around [[Smyrna]], in the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] region on the [[Black Sea]] coast, in the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], in [[Cappadocia]], in [[Istanbul]], in [[Imbros]] and in [[Tenedos]].\n\nGreek politicians of the 19th century were determined to include all these territories within a greatly enlarged single Greek state, based on the [[Byzantine]] model and with [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) as its capital. This policy was called the Great Idea (''[[Megali Idea]]''). Constantinople had been the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern half of the Roman Empire]] until its fall to the Turks in 1453. The Ottomans naturally opposed these plans for a larger Greek state. The Empire was considered by the European powers as 'the [[sick man of Europe]]', but since these powers were irreconcilably divided over the fate of the Ottoman lands, the conflicts both reduced its territorial hold but also kept delaying its collapse.\n\nDuring the [[Crimean War]] (1854 to 1856), [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] restrained Greece from attacking the Ottomans by occupying [[Piraeus]]. They were again prevented from taking military action during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877, in which the Greeks were keen to join in with the objective of territorial expansion, but Greece was unable to take any effective part in the war. Nevertheless, after the [[Congress of Berlin]], in 1881 Greece was given most of [[Thessaly]] and part of Epirus. Also, in 1854-1896, there were revolts in the Ottoman Empire by the Greek population in Thessaly, Macedonia, [[Epirus Revolt of 1854|Epirus]].\n\nIn 1858-1896 there were many revolts in Crete, Thessaly [[1878 Greek Macedonian rebellion|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus Revolt of 1878|Epirus]] against the Ottoman Empire by the Greek population.\n\n[[File:AsiaMinor1910.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of Asia Minor depicting the [[Ottoman Greeks]] (blue) in 1910]]\nIn 1897, a new revolt in [[Crete]] led to the first [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]]. An unprepared Greek army was unable to dislodge the Ottoman troops from their fortifications along the northern border, and with the resulting Ottoman counter-attack, the war resulted in minor territorial losses for Greece.\n\nThe [[Young Turks]], who seized power in the Ottoman Empire in 1908, were Turkish nationalists whose objective was to create a strong, centrally governed state. The Christian minorities of the Empire, including Greeks, saw their position in the Empire deteriorate.\n\nThe [[First Balkan War]] of 1912\u20131913 was a direct consequence of the mounting tension, as a result of which Greece seized Crete, the islands, the rest of Thessaly and Epirus, and coastal Macedonia from the Ottomans, in alliance with [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Crete was once again the flashpoint for tension between the two nations.\n\n===The First World War and after (1914-1927)===\n{{Main|Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)}}\n\nIn 1913 an organized persecution of the Christian population of the Ottoman Empire, including the [[Greek genocide|Greeks]], was started. Greece entered the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1917 with the intention of seizing [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and [[Smyrna]] ([[\u0130zmir]]) from the Ottomans, with the encouragement of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]], who also promised the Greeks [[Cyprus]] at a certain stage. The ongoing [[Greek genocide|genocide of Pontic Greeks]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} in the Ottoman Empire also played a factor in this decision{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}. Although there was little direct fighting between Greeks and Turks{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}, when the Ottoman Empire collapsed in 1918 the Greeks were quick to claim the lands the Allies had promised them. The 1920 [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] gave Greece eastern [[Thrace]] and an area of about 17,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 in western [[Anatolia]] around Smyrna. This Treaty was signed by the Ottoman government but never went into force, not having been ratified by Parliament.\n\n[[Occupation of Smyrna|Greece occupied Smyrna/\u0130zmir]] on 15 May 1919, while [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] (later [[Atat\u00fcrk]]), who was to become the leader of the Turkish opposition to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], landed in [[Samsun]] on May 19, 1919, an action that is regarded as the beginning of the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. He united the protesting voices in Anatolia and set in motion a nationalist movement to repel the armies that had occupied Turkey (including Italy, France and Britain) and establish new borders for a sovereign Turkish nation. Having created a separate government in [[Ankara]], Kemal's government did not recognise the abortive Treaty of S\u00e8vres and fought to have it revoked. The Greek advances into Anatolia were eventually checked and the Greek army was forced into retreat.\n\n\n[[File:Asia Minor massacres.jpg|thumb|Overcrowded boats with refugees fleeing the [[Great fire of Smyrna]]. The photo was taken from the launch boat of a US warship.]]\nThe Turkish army entered Smyrna/\u0130zmir on 9 September 1922, effectively ending the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] in the field. The Greek army and administration had already left by sea. The war was put to an end by the [[Armistice of Mudanya]], and the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] replaced previous treaties to constitute modern [[Turkey]].\n\nThe [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] also provided for a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] that had begun before the final signature of the treaty in July 1923. About one and a half million Greeks had to leave Turkey for Greece and about half a million Turks had to leave Greece for Turkey (note that the population exchange was on religious grounds, thus the exchange was officially that of [[Christians]] for [[Muslims]]). The exceptions to the population exchange were Istanbul (Constantinople) and the islands of [[G\u00f6k\u00e7eada]] ([[Imbros]]) and [[Bozcaada]] ([[Tenedos]]), where the Greek minority (including the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]) was allowed to stay, and [[Western Thrace]], whose Muslim minority was also allowed to stay.\n\nDue to the defeat of the Greek army and the events following which terminated 3,000 years of Greek presence in Anatolia, Greece refers to it as the Asia Minor Catastrophe/Disaster. The alleged atrocities committed by the Greek army during the Greek occupation of Western Anatolia (1919\u20131922) left a lasting impression on the Turkish mind. Greek accusations, on the other hand, were focused on the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], especially in view of the account provided by [[George Horton]], the U.S. Consul General in the city from 1919 to 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/Horton/HortonBook.htm|title=THE BLIGHT OF ASIA|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> Horton's account remains as controversial as the fire itself.<ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/byz/2006/00000030/00000001/art00005] In an article published in [http://www.maney.co.uk/search?fwaction=show&fwid=466 Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110742/http://www.maney.co.uk/search?fwaction=show&fwid=466 |date=2007-09-29 }} (\"George Horton: The literary diplomat)\", [[Brian Coleman]] describes his subject matter as follows: \"George Horton was a man of letters and United States Consul in Greece and Turkey at a time of social and political change.

Tenedos population was overwhelmingly Greek, and Imbros population was entirely Greek. However, after the legislation of \"Civil Law\" on 26 June 1927, the rights accorded to the Greek population of Imbros and Tenedos were revoked, in violation of the Lausanne Treaty. Thus, the island was demoted from an administrative district to a sub-district which resulted that the island was to be stripped of its local tribunals. Moreover, the members of the local council were obliged to have adequate knowledge of the Turkish language, which meant that the vast majority of the islanders were excluded. Furthermore, according to this law, the Turkish government retained the right to dissolve this council and in certain circumstances, to introduce police force and other officials who were non-islanders. This law also violated the educational rights of the local community and imposed an educational system similar to that followed by ordinary Turkish schools.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alexandris|first=Alexis|title=Imbros and Tenedos:: A Study of Turkish Attitudes Toward Two Ethnic Greek Island Communities Since 1923|year=1980|publisher=Pella Publishing Company|page=21|url=http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/13027/07_1_1980.pdf?sequence=1.}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Corfu incident]] between Italy and Greece, at 1923, elements in Turkey advised [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] to seize the opportunity to invade [[Western Thrace]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article96042274 |title=ANOTHER BALKAN WAR THREATENED. |newspaper=[[The Recorder (Port Pirie)|The Recorder]] |location=Port Pirie, SA |date=8 September 1923 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} \"Reports from Turkey show that a section of opinion is already urging Kemal Pasha to seize the opportunity to invade Western Thrace.\"</ref>\n\n===1928-1954: Normalization of the relations===\n[[File:AtaturkAndVenizelos.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The first president of Turkey [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] (center) hosting Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] (at left) in [[Ankara]] October 27, 1930]]\n\nThe post-war leaders of Turkey and Greece, [[Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] and [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] respectively, were determined to establish normal relations between the two states.

Turkish president [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] signed a decision to help the people whose army he had personally fought during the [[Turkish War of Independence]] 19 years earlier. Foodstuffs were collected by a nationwide campaign of K\u0131z\u0131lay ([[Turkish Red Crescent]])and sent to the port of \u0130stanbul to be shipped to Greece. The aid was shipped on board the vessel ''[[SS Kurtulu\u015f]]'' with big symbols of the [[Red Crescent]] painted on both sides. (''See [[SS Kurtulu\u015f]] for more information.'')\n\nAt the same time, Turkey signed a \"[[German\u2013Turkish Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Friendship and cooperation]]\" with Nazi Germany in June 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/assets1.html|title=New Supplement to the State Department Report on Holocaust Assets - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> The following year, 1942, Turkey imposed the [[Varl\u0131k Vergisi]], a special tax, which taxed the non-Muslim minorities of Turkey, including Greek minority. Also, during the WWII there was the incident of [[the Twenty Classes]], this was the conscription of non-Muslims males who were sent in labour battalions.\n\nThe early [[Cold War]] brought closer the international policies of the two countries, in 1950 both fought at the [[Korean War]] at the side of the [[UN]] forces. In 1952, both countries joined [[NATO]]. In 1953 Greece, Turkey and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] formed [[Balkan Pact (1953)|a new Balkan Pact]] for mutual defence against the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n=== {{anchor|Istanbul_Pogrom}} Istanbul Pogrom, Cyprus crisis, Turkish invasion and the collapse of the Greek military junta (1955-1975)===\n{{Further|Istanbul Pogrom|Cyprus dispute|Cypriot intercommunal violence|1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}\n\nA serious matter of conflict in Turkish-Greek relations since the 1950s has been [[Cyprus]]; at the time, it was a British colony with a Greek-Cypriot population share of 82% of the island's total. Some of the Greek Cypriots wanted unity (''enosis'') with Greece and, as early as 1931, there were nationalist riots in [[Nicosia]]. The Greek government was, due to its financial and diplomatic dependence on Britain, forced to disavow any aims for unification with Cyprus.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Cyprus issue flared up again when the Greek Cypriots, under [[Archbishop Makarios]], claimed union with Greece, and the [[EOKA]] group launched a paramilitary movement on the island - mainly against the British, but also inflicting collateral damage to other parties and civilians. Eventually, Greek Prime Minister [[Alexander Papagos]] took the Cyprus issue to the [[United Nations]].\n\nTurkish nationalist sentiment, angered by the discrimination against the Turkish Cypriots, became inflamed at the idea that Cyprus would be ceded to Greece. This led to the Greek community of Istanbul becoming the target in the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] of 1955. In response, Greece withdrew from all co-operation with Turkey, which caused the Balkan Pact to collapse.\n\nIn 1960, a compromise solution to the Cyprus issue was agreed on: Britain granted independence to Cyprus, and a constitution was hammered out. Greek and Turkish troops were stationed on the island to protect their respective communities. Greek Prime Minister [[Constantine Karamanlis]] was the main architect of this plan, which led to an immediate improvement in relations with Turkey, particularly once [[Adnan Menderes]] was removed from power in Turkey.\n\nDuring the period of [[Cyprus crisis of 1963\u201364|intercommunal strife in 1963 and 1964]], Greek and Turkish Cypriots were displaced and many were massacred on both sides.\n\nOn 30 December 1964, Makarios declared his proposal for a constitutional amendment that included 13 articles. Turkey, however, restated that she was against this and threatened war if Cyprus tried to achieve unity with Greece. In August, Turkish aircraft bombed Greek troops that surrounded a Turkish village (Erenkoy) and war seemed imminent. Once again, the Greek minority in Turkey suffered from the crisis, causing many Greeks to flee the country, and there were even threats to expel the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]. Eventually, intervention by the [[United Nations]] led to another compromise solution.\n\nIn 1964 Turkish prime minister [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] renounced the 1930 Greek-Turkish Treaty of friendship and took actions against the Greek minority.<ref name=The_New_York_Times_Aug_9_1964/><ref>{{cite book|last1= Roudometof |first1=Victor |last2=Agadjanian |first2=Alexander |last3=Pankhurst|first3=Jerry |title=Eastern Orthodoxy in a Global Age: Tradition Faces the 21st Century  |url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=mQRtAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |year=2006 |publisher= AltaMira Press| isbn=978-0759105379|pages=273}}</ref> Turkey enforced strictly a long\u2010overlooked law barring Greek nationals from 30 professions and occupations, for example Greeks could not be doctors, nurses, architects, shoemakers, tailors, plumbers, cabaret singers, ironsmiths, cooks, tourist guides, etc.<ref name=The_New_York_Times_Aug_9_1964>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/09/archives/turks-expelling-istanbul-greeks-communitys-plight-worsens-during.html|title=TURKS EXPELLING ISTANBUL GREEKS; Community's Plight Worsens During Cyprus Crisis|date=August 9, 1964|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Many Greek have been ordered to give up their jobs after this law.<ref name=The_New_York_Times_Apr_24_1964>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/24/archives/greeks-of-istanbul-unhappy-with-both-ankara-and-athens.html|title=Greeks of Istanbul Unhappy With Both Ankara and Athens|date=April 24, 1964|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> 50,000 more Greeks were deported.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2019-05-14|title=Why Turkey and Greece cannot reconcile|url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/12/14/why-turkey-and-greece-cannot-reconcile|newspaper=The Economist|date=14 December 2017|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> They were given a week to leave the country.

Under the diplomacy of the military regime, there were periodic crises with Turkey, which suspected that the Greek regime was planning a pro-unification coup in Cyprus.\n\n[[File:Grenspost.jpg|thumb|[[Northern Cyprus]] in 2009]]\nA 1971 Turkish law nationalized religious high schools and closed the [[Halki seminary]] on Istanbul's [[Heybeli]] Island which had trained [[Greek Orthodox]] clergy since 1844.\n\nOn July 15, 1974, a band of Greek Cypriot nationalists formed [[EOKA B]], advocating [[Enosis]] (Union) with Greece and, backed by the [[Greek military junta]] in Athens, staged a coup against the Cypriot President and [[Archbishop Makarios]]. An ex-[[EOKA]] man, [[Nikos Sampson]] was appointed President.

Once again, war between Greece and Turkey seemed imminent, but actual war was averted when Sampson's coup collapsed a few days later and Makarios returned to power. Also, the [[Greek military junta]] in Athens, which failed to confront the Turkish invasion, fell from power on 24 July. The damage to Turkish-Greek relations was done, and the occupation of [[Northern Cyprus]] by Turkish troops would be a sticking point in Greco-Turkish relations for decades to come.\n\nIn 2018, declassified documents of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Bulgaria]] revealed a plan to foment crisis between [[Turkey]] and Greece in 1971.

The [[Balkan Wars]] of 1913 had given Greece all the Aegean islands except [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]], some of them only a few kilometres (barely more than three nautical miles) off the Turkish coast. Since the end of [[World War II]], Turkish officials insisted that this led to questions regarding the [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of territorial waters, air space and other related zones of control. The conflict was motivated both by considerations of military tactical advantages and by questions of economic exploitation of the Aegean. The latter issue became particularly significant as after 1970 there were expectations of finding oil in the Aegean. This was highlighted during the [[1987 Aegean crisis|crisis]] in 1987, when a Turkish ship was about to enter disputed waters to conduct an oil survey. The Greek Prime Minister of the time, [[Andreas Papandreou]], ordered the ship to be sunk if found within disputed waters claimed by Greece. Consultations about this issue were held in [[Davos]] between the Greek and Turkish Prime Ministers.\n\nIssues unresolved to this day concern the mutual delimitation of several zones of control:\n*The width of the [[territorial waters]]. Both sides currently possess 6 nautical miles (11&nbsp;km) off their shores in the Aegean Sea. Greece claims a right to unilateral expansion to 12 nautical miles, based on the International [[Law of the Sea]]. Turkey, which already has expanded its own territorial waters to 12 miles on its other coasts, denies the applicability of the 12-miles rule in the Aegean and has threatened Greece with war in the case it should try to apply it unilaterally.\n*The width of the national airspace. Greece currently claims 10 miles, while Turkey only acknowledges 6 miles.\n*The future delimitation of the [[continental shelf]] zone in the international parts of the Aegean, which would give the states exclusive rights to economic exploitation.\n*The right of Greece to exercise flight control over Turkish military flight activities within the international parts of the Aegean, based on conflicting interpretations of the rules about [[Flight Information Region]]s (FIR) set by the [[ICAO]].\n*Since 1996, the sovereignty over some small uninhabited islets, most notably [[Imia/Kardak]]\n\nThe conflict over military flight activities has led to a practice of continuous tactical military provocations. Turkish aircraft regularly fly in the zones over which Greece claims control (i.e., the outer four miles of the claimed Greek airspace and the international parts of Athens FIR), while Greek aircraft constantly intercept them. Aircraft from both countries frequently engage in mock dogfights. These operations often cause casualties and losses for both the Greek and Turkish Air Forces.\n\n===Incidents===\n* On 22 July 1974, during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], a pair of Greek [[Northrop F-5|F-5\u0391]]s intercepted a pair of Turkish [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102]] near [[Agios Efstratios]]. The aircraft engaged in a dogfight, during which one of the Turkish pilots fired a [[AIM-4 Falcon|Falcon]] missile against one of the F-5s piloted by Thomas Skampardonis. Skampardonis managed to evade the missile and then the other Greek pilot Ioannis Dinopoulos, who up to that point was undetected by the Turks, fired two [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9B]] missiles. The first AIM-9 missed its target but the second shot down one of the F-102s. The pilot of the remaining F-102 became disoriented and fled westwards. When he realized his mistake, he turned east towards the Turkish coast but ran out of fuel.

The so-called \"earthquake diplomacy\" generated an outpouring of sympathy and generous assistance provided by ordinary Greeks and Turks in both cases. These acts were encouraged from the top and took many foreigners by surprise, preparing the public for a breakthrough in bilateral relations, which had been marred by decades of hostility over anti-Greek [[pogrom]]s, territorial disputes and the situation in the divided island of Cyprus.\n\nTen years later, Greece has become one of the key supporters of Turkey's struggle to enter the [[European Union]]. Yet, despite the confidence Greece and Cyprus have shown, voting YES for Turkey in order to begin its entry negotiations with the European Union in October 2005, many key issues remain unresolved. Furthermore, Turkey still denies access to Cypriot vessels to its territory, an obligation towards the EU with a 2006 deadline. The Turkish government counters that this restriction regarding Cypriot vessels was taken after the trade embargo decision against the portion of Cyprus illegally occupied by Turkey. The issue remains deadlocked, despite UN and EU attempts to mediate. Other unfulfilled obligations include Christian minority rights, acknowledgement of the [[Orthodox Church]] of Constantinople and the role of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]].\n\nIn 2002, Turkey and Greece made an unsuccessful attempt to jointly host the 2008 UEFA European Football Championship. The bid was one of the four candidacies that was recommended to the UEFA Executive Committee, the joint Austria/Switzerland bid winning the right to host the tournament.\n\nA sign of improved relations was visible in the response to a mid-air collision by Greek and Turkish fighter jets in the southern Aegean in May 2006. While the Turkish pilot ejected safely, the Greek pilot lost his life.

For nationals of the two countries the authorities can make use of simplified procedures. But the strict application of the agreement is reported to have retrograded as of 2003. Incidents concerning illegal immigration are frequent on the border of the two countries.

{"title_page": "Serial (radio and television)", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2011}}\nIn [[television program|television]] and [[radio program]]ming, a '''serial''' has a continuing plot that unfolds in a sequential episode-by-episode fashion. Serials typically follow main [[story arc]]s that span entire [[television season]]s or even the full run of the series, which distinguishes them from traditional episodic television that relies on more stand-alone episodes. Worldwide, the [[soap opera]] is the most prominent form of serial [[dramatic programming]].\n\nSerials rely on keeping the full nature of the story hidden and revealing elements episode by episode to keep viewers tuning in to learn more. Often these shows employ [[recapping]] segments at the beginning and [[cliffhanger]]s at the end of each episode. Such shows also place a demand on viewers to tune in to every episode to follow the plot.<ref name=\"nyt070724\">{{cite news | author = Alessandra Stanley | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/arts/television/24stan.html?fta=y | title = Smile and Smile and Still Be a Villain  | date = July 24, 2007 |work=The New York Times | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref> The invention of recording devices such as [[VCR]]s and [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]] has made following this type of show easier, which has resulted in increased success and popularity. Prior to the advent of DVRs, television networks shunned serials in prime time as they made [[broadcast programming]] [[rerun]]s more difficult and television producers shunned them because they were tougher to go into [[broadcast syndication]] years down the road.\n\nSerials contrast with episodic television, with plots relying on a more independent stand-alone format.

In literature, the term is used as a noun to refer to a format (within a [[genre]]) by which a story is told in contiguous (typically [[chronological]]) installments in sequential issues of a single [[periodical]] publication.\n\nMore generally, \"serial\" is applied in [[library and information science]] to materials \"in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion.\"<ref name=\"Reitz\">Reitz, Joan M. (2004). [http://lu.com/odlis/odlis_s.cfm ''Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science'']. Retrieved March 15, 2006</ref>\n\nThe term has been used for a radio or television production with a continuously evolving, unified plot and set of characters, spread over multiple episodes.  In the United States, daytime soap operas have long had a serial structure. Television [[mini-series]] also commonly come in a serial form. Starting in the mid-1970s, series with soap opera-like stories began to be aired in prime time (e.g. ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''). In the 1990s, shows like ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' began to use a more serial structure, and now there are a much wider range of shows in serial form.<ref>Jason Mittell. 2015.

With the emergence of television and subsequent decline of the movie-going audience, production of movie serials ceased due to the decreasing revenues. But the serial lived on, moving instead to the small screen and the world of [[Broadcast syndication]] television [[rerun]]s.\n\n===Soap operas===\nThe television serial format as known today originated in radio, in the form of children's adventure shows and daily 15-minute programs known as ''soap operas'' (so-called because many of these shows were [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] by soap companies, such as [[Colgate-Palmolive]] and [[Procter & Gamble]]). Soap operas were specifically engineered to appeal to women (with the intention of increasing sale of soap). They usually ran from Monday through Friday at exactly the same time every day. A show called The Smith Family which ran only one night a week on WENR in Chicago during the early 1930s was credited as the \"great-granddaddy of the soap operas\" by radio historian Francis Chase, Jr. One of the other shows that helped pioneer the daytime soap opera/serial was ''The [[Guiding Light]]'', which debuted on [[NBC]] radio in 1937, and then switched to [[CBS]] Television in 1952. ''The Guiding Light''{{'s}} final episode aired on September 18, 2009, having a total of 15,762 episodes air on CBS. Some of the characters in soap operas have been portrayed as long-suffering (a common theme even in some of today's serials along with the social and economical issues of the day). Children's adventure serials were more like [[film serial]]s, with continuing characters involved in exploits with episodes that often ended in a cliffhanger situation; [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] were a particularly popular format for children's serials on the radio.\n\n''Guiding Light'' and such other daytime television program serials such as ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', ''[[The Doctors (soap opera)|The Doctors]]'', ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'', ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', ''[[One Life to Live]]'', and ''[[All My Children]]'' were popular in the Golden and Silver Ages of television and still are today.\n\nAside from the social issues, the style and presentation of these shows have changed. Whereas in the 1950s and 1960s the drama was underscored with traditional organ music, and in the 1970s and the 1980s a full orchestra provided the score, the daytime dramas of today use cutting-edged synth-driven music (in a way, music for soaps has come full-circle, from the keyboard to the keyboard).\n\nThe nighttime serials are a different story, though the concept is also nothing new. In the 1960s, ABC aired the first real breakthrough nighttime serial, ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', inspired by the novel and theatrical film of the same name. After its cancellation, the format went somewhat dormant until Norman Lear produced ''[[Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman]]'' in 1976. In 1977, ABC created another comedy soap (aptly called ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]''). Although the show was controversial for its time (with a homosexual character among its cast roster), it was (and still is today) a cult classic.\n\nThe success of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' popularized serial storylines on prime-time television. Its end-of-season [[cliffhanger]]s, such as \"[[Who shot J. R.?]]\" and \"Bobby in the Shower?\",<ref name=\"marshall201810\">{{Cite magazine |last=Marshall |first=Max |date=2018-09-19 |title=\u2018Dallas\u2019 at 40: The Inside Story Behind the Show That Changed Texas Forever |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/dallas-at-40-the-inside-story-behind-the-show-that-changed-texas-forever/ |magazine=Texas Monthly |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> influenced other shows like ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (ABC's answer to ''Dallas''), ''[[Knots Landing]]'', ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[The Colbys]]'', ''[[Flamingo Road (TV series)|Flamingo Road]]'', ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[The Yellow Rose]]'', ''[[Bare Essence]]'', and ''[[Berrenger's]]''. There were some serial shows such as ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' and ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' that did not officially fit into this category, but were nonetheless ratings hits season after season.\n\nWhile the last of the 1980s nighttime soaps ended during the first years of the following decade, then a second wave came with series like ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Models, Inc.]]'', ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'' and ''[[Central Park West (TV series)|Central Park West]]''. But as the 1990s came to a close, the primetime soap as an official format gradually faded away, where it largely seems to remain as of the middle of the first decade of the 21st century in the United States.\n\n===Other dramas===\nSerialized storytelling can also be seen in other dramas. Heavily serialized dramas include  '' [[Star Trek Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Babylon 5]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', ''[[The Wire]]'', and ''[[Downton Abbey]]''. Series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Streets]]'', ''[[The Good Wife]]'', and ''[[The X-Files]]'' fall somewhere in-between, featuring a new case each week that is solved by the end of the episode, but also having an overarching mystery that receives focus in many episodes. The more serialized its storytelling, the less likely a show is to fare well in repeats. The format places a demand on episodes to be run in order, without which story arcs stretching over many episodes may be difficult for new viewers to delve into. ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' also falls into the category while each season involves a new mystery that spans an entire season (and on one occasion, half the season) while planting hints throughout the episodes until the climax in the finale.\n\nTo a lesser extent, series such as ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''<ref name=\"hybrid\">{{cite news | author = Rob Owen | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09032/943438-67.stm | title = Fox's 'House' celebrates its 100th episode | date = February 1, 2009 | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | accessdate = February 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"procedural at its core\">{{cite news | author = Michael Ausiello | url = http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | title = Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on 'Grey's,' 'House,' 'Big Love,' 'Fringe,' 'NCIS,' '24,' 'Gossip Girl,' 'Friday Night Lights,' 'Heroes,' 'Smallville,' and more! | date = February 11, 2009 | work = Entertainment Weekly | accessdate = February 12, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110628171858/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | archivedate = June 28, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> and ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''<ref name=\"fringe\">{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/oct/10/jjabrams-ustelevision | title = JJ Abrams live webchat here | date = October 10, 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London | accessdate = February 2, 2009  | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood}}</ref> may also feature ongoing story arcs, but episodes are more self-encapsulated and so the series fall into a more conventional drama category. ''Fringe'' has experimented with \"myth-alones\", a hybrid that attempts to advance the story arc in a self-contained episode.<ref name=\"comiccon\"/>\n\nIn addition, it has been noted that the use of [[cliffhanger]]s is still prevalent in adventure shows; however, they are now typically used just before a commercial break and the viewer need only wait a few minutes to see its resolution. In addition, many series have also made extensive use of the traditional end-of-episode cliffhanger format. This is most common in [[season finale]]s which often end in a cliffhanger that would only be resolved in the next season's premiere.\n\nOver the course of its run, a show may change its focus. Matt Cherniss, executive vice president of programming at Fox says: \"Sometimes early on, being a little more episodic allows more people into the room. And as the show goes on, by its nature, it might find itself becoming a little more serialized.\"<ref name=\"ct090227\">{{cite news | author = Maureen Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/has-tv-lost-its-nerve-when-it-comes-to-complex-dramas.html | title = Has TV lost its nerve when it comes to complex dramas? | date = February 27, 2009 |work=Chicago Tribune | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref> Early in their runs, shows such as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'',<ref name=\"ct090227\"/> ''Buffy'', ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]''<ref name=\"indep090515\">{{cite news | author = Sarah Hughes | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/buffys-creator-makes-his-valley-of-the-dolls-1684993.html | title = Buffy's creator makes his valley of the dolls  | date = May 15, 2009 |work=The Independent |location=London | accessdate = May 16, 2009 }}</ref> and ''[[Torchwood]]'' put greater emphasis on the \"story-of-the-week\", but over time story arcs begin to dominate.

Worldwide, the [[soap opera]] is the most prominent form of serial [[dramatic programming]].\n\nSerials rely on keeping the full nature of the story hidden and revealing elements episode by episode to keep viewers tuning in to learn more.

In literature, the term is used as a noun to refer to a format (within a [[genre]]) by which a story is told in contiguous (typically [[chronological]]) installments in sequential issues of a single [[periodical]] publication.\n\nMore generally, \"serial\" is applied in [[library and information science]] to materials \"in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion.\"<ref name=\"Reitz\">Reitz, Joan M. (2004). [http://lu.com/odlis/odlis_s.cfm ''Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science'']. Retrieved March 15, 2006</ref>\n\nThe term has been used for a radio or television production with a continuously evolving, unified plot and set of characters, spread over multiple episodes.  In the United States, daytime soap operas have long had a serial structure. Television [[mini-series]] also commonly come in a serial form. Starting in the mid-1970s, series with soap opera-like stories began to be aired in prime time (e.g. ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''). In the 1990s, shows like ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' began to use a more serial structure, and now there are a much wider range of shows in serial form.<ref>Jason Mittell. 2015.

NYU Press. {{ISBN|9780814769607}}</ref>\n{{see also|Radio drama|Television program}}\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2009}}\n\nThe serial beginning with the advent of\n[[Film|movie serials]] of the early 20th century. With the emergence of television and subsequent decline of the movie-going audience, production of movie serials ceased due to the decreasing revenues. But the serial lived on, moving instead to the small screen and the world of [[Broadcast syndication]] television [[rerun]]s.\n\n===Soap operas===\nThe television serial format as known today originated in radio, in the form of children's adventure shows and daily 15-minute programs known as ''soap operas'' (so-called because many of these shows were [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] by soap companies, such as [[Colgate-Palmolive]] and [[Procter & Gamble]]). Soap operas were specifically engineered to appeal to women (with the intention of increasing sale of soap). They usually ran from Monday through Friday at exactly the same time every day. A show called The Smith Family which ran only one night a week on WENR in Chicago during the early 1930s was credited as the \"great-granddaddy of the soap operas\" by radio historian Francis Chase, Jr. One of the other shows that helped pioneer the daytime soap opera/serial was ''The [[Guiding Light]]'', which debuted on [[NBC]] radio in 1937, and then switched to [[CBS]] Television in 1952. ''The Guiding Light''{{'s}} final episode aired on September 18, 2009, having a total of 15,762 episodes air on CBS. Some of the characters in soap operas have been portrayed as long-suffering (a common theme even in some of today's serials along with the social and economical issues of the day). Children's adventure serials were more like [[film serial]]s, with continuing characters involved in exploits with episodes that often ended in a cliffhanger situation; [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] were a particularly popular format for children's serials on the radio.\n\n''Guiding Light'' and such other daytime television program serials such as ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', ''[[The Doctors (soap opera)|The Doctors]]'', ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'', ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', ''[[One Life to Live]]'', and ''[[All My Children]]'' were popular in the Golden and Silver Ages of television and still are today.\n\nAside from the social issues, the style and presentation of these shows have changed. Whereas in the 1950s and 1960s the drama was underscored with traditional organ music, and in the 1970s and the 1980s a full orchestra provided the score, the daytime dramas of today use cutting-edged synth-driven music (in a way, music for soaps has come full-circle, from the keyboard to the keyboard).\n\nThe nighttime serials are a different story, though the concept is also nothing new. In the 1960s, ABC aired the first real breakthrough nighttime serial, ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', inspired by the novel and theatrical film of the same name. After its cancellation, the format went somewhat dormant until Norman Lear produced ''[[Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman]]'' in 1976. In 1977, ABC created another comedy soap (aptly called ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]''). Although the show was controversial for its time (with a homosexual character among its cast roster), it was (and still is today) a cult classic.\n\nThe success of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' popularized serial storylines on prime-time television. Its end-of-season [[cliffhanger]]s, such as \"[[Who shot J. R.?]]\" and \"Bobby in the Shower?\",<ref name=\"marshall201810\">{{Cite magazine |last=Marshall |first=Max |date=2018-09-19 |title=\u2018Dallas\u2019 at 40: The Inside Story Behind the Show That Changed Texas Forever |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/dallas-at-40-the-inside-story-behind-the-show-that-changed-texas-forever/ |magazine=Texas Monthly |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> influenced other shows like ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (ABC's answer to ''Dallas''), ''[[Knots Landing]]'', ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[The Colbys]]'', ''[[Flamingo Road (TV series)|Flamingo Road]]'', ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[The Yellow Rose]]'', ''[[Bare Essence]]'', and ''[[Berrenger's]]''. There were some serial shows such as ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' and ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' that did not officially fit into this category, but were nonetheless ratings hits season after season.\n\nWhile the last of the 1980s nighttime soaps ended during the first years of the following decade, then a second wave came with series like ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Models, Inc.]]'', ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'' and ''[[Central Park West (TV series)|Central Park West]]''. But as the 1990s came to a close, the primetime soap as an official format gradually faded away, where it largely seems to remain as of the middle of the first decade of the 21st century in the United States.\n\n===Other dramas===\nSerialized storytelling can also be seen in other dramas. Heavily serialized dramas include  '' [[Star Trek Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Babylon 5]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', ''[[The Wire]]'', and ''[[Downton Abbey]]''. Series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Streets]]'', ''[[The Good Wife]]'', and ''[[The X-Files]]'' fall somewhere in-between, featuring a new case each week that is solved by the end of the episode, but also having an overarching mystery that receives focus in many episodes. The more serialized its storytelling, the less likely a show is to fare well in repeats. The format places a demand on episodes to be run in order, without which story arcs stretching over many episodes may be difficult for new viewers to delve into. ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' also falls into the category while each season involves a new mystery that spans an entire season (and on one occasion, half the season) while planting hints throughout the episodes until the climax in the finale.\n\nTo a lesser extent, series such as ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''<ref name=\"hybrid\">{{cite news | author = Rob Owen | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09032/943438-67.stm | title = Fox's 'House' celebrates its 100th episode | date = February 1, 2009 | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | accessdate = February 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"procedural at its core\">{{cite news | author = Michael Ausiello | url = http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | title = Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on 'Grey's,' 'House,' 'Big Love,' 'Fringe,' 'NCIS,' '24,' 'Gossip Girl,' 'Friday Night Lights,' 'Heroes,' 'Smallville,' and more! | date = February 11, 2009 | work = Entertainment Weekly | accessdate = February 12, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110628171858/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | archivedate = June 28, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> and ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''<ref name=\"fringe\">{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/oct/10/jjabrams-ustelevision | title = JJ Abrams live webchat here | date = October 10, 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London | accessdate = February 2, 2009  | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood}}</ref> may also feature ongoing story arcs, but episodes are more self-encapsulated and so the series fall into a more conventional drama category. ''Fringe'' has experimented with \"myth-alones\", a hybrid that attempts to advance the story arc in a self-contained episode.<ref name=\"comiccon\"/>\n\nIn addition, it has been noted that the use of [[cliffhanger]]s is still prevalent in adventure shows; however, they are now typically used just before a commercial break and the viewer need only wait a few minutes to see its resolution. In addition, many series have also made extensive use of the traditional end-of-episode cliffhanger format. This is most common in [[season finale]]s which often end in a cliffhanger that would only be resolved in the next season's premiere.\n\nOver the course of its run, a show may change its focus. Matt Cherniss, executive vice president of programming at Fox says: \"Sometimes early on, being a little more episodic allows more people into the room. And as the show goes on, by its nature, it might find itself becoming a little more serialized.\"<ref name=\"ct090227\">{{cite news | author = Maureen Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/has-tv-lost-its-nerve-when-it-comes-to-complex-dramas.html | title = Has TV lost its nerve when it comes to complex dramas? | date = February 27, 2009 |work=Chicago Tribune | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref> Early in their runs, shows such as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'',<ref name=\"ct090227\"/> ''Buffy'', ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]''<ref name=\"indep090515\">{{cite news | author = Sarah Hughes | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/buffys-creator-makes-his-valley-of-the-dolls-1684993.html | title = Buffy's creator makes his valley of the dolls  | date = May 15, 2009 |work=The Independent |location=London | accessdate = May 16, 2009 }}</ref> and ''[[Torchwood]]'' put greater emphasis on the \"story-of-the-week\", but over time story arcs begin to dominate.

Since then the two countries have faced each other in four major wars\u2014the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]], the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912 to 1913, the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914 to 1918) and finally the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)]], which were followed by the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]] and a period of friendly relations in the 1930s and 1940s. Both countries entered [[NATO]] in 1952. Relations deteriorated again in the 1950s due to the [[Cyprus issue]], the [[1955 Istanbul pogrom]] and the expulsion of the Istanbul Greeks in the 1960s, the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, and subsequent military confrontations over the [[Aegean dispute]]. A period of relative normalization began after 1999 with the so-called \"[[Greek\u2013Turkish earthquake diplomacy|earthquake diplomacy]]\", which notably led to a change in the previously firmly negative stance of the Greek government on the issue of the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]].\n\n==Diplomatic missions==\n*Turkey has an embassy in [[Athens]] and consulates general in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Komotini]] and [[Rhodes]].\n*Greece has an embassy in [[Ankara]] and consulates general in [[Istanbul]], [[\u0130zmir]] and [[Edirne]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Byzantine against Seljuq and Ottoman===\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Ottoman Wars|Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars}}\n[[File:Byzantium vs Seljuk c 1071 cropped.png|thumb|[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine territory]] (purple), Byzantine campaigns (red) and [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] campaigns (green).]]\nIn 1048 conflicts between [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] (Greeks were dominant nation of the Byzantine Empire and the Empire was Hellenized) started. Many [[Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars|wars and battles]] were fought between the Byzantine and the Seljuq armies. Also, in 1300 conflicts between [[Ottomans]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] started too.\n\nIn 1453, Ottomans [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered Constantinople]], the capital city of the Byzantine Empire. In 1460 they conquered the [[Despotate of the Morea]], in 1461 the [[Empire of Trebizond]], in 1475 the [[Principality of Theodoro]] and by 1500 most of the plains and islands were in Ottoman hands. Holdouts included [[Rhodes]], conquered in 1522, [[Cyprus]] in 1571, [[Crete]], retained by the Venetians until 1669, and the [[Ionian islands]] which remained primarily under the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]].\n\n===Ottoman era until 1820===\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian Wars]] and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u201374)]] Greece provided aid to Ottoman rivals. [[Dionysius the Philosopher]] additionally organised several uprisings. In addition, the [[Lambros Katsonis]] fleet began harassing the Ottoman fleet in the Aegean Sea.\n\nIn 1770, the Ottoman army [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1770)|invaded the Mani]].\n\nIn the [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1803)|1803]], [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1807)|1807]] and [[Ottoman invasion of Mani (1815)|1815]] the Ottoman army invaded Mani. Also during this period, in 1803 there was a [[Souliote War (1803)|final fight]] between the [[Souliotes]] and the [[Pashalik of Yanina|local Ottoman]] ruler, [[Ali Pasha of Yanina|Ali Pasha]], which ended the many years of conflicts between them.\n\n===Ottoman era and the Greek state until 1913===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Balkan Wars|}}\n\n[[File:The Ottoman ambassador and his page at a ball at the royal residence in Athens, 1838.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The first Ottoman ambassador to the Greek Kingdom, the [[Phanariote]] [[Konstantinos Mousouros]], at a ball in the royal palace in Athens]]\n\nIn March 1821, the [[Greek War of Independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] began. The Greeks formally declared their independence in January 1822, and after the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827, the establishment of a Greek state was recognized in the [[London Protocol (1828)|London Protocol]] of 1828. The first borders of the Greek state consisted of the Greek mainland south of a line from [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] to [[Volos]] plus [[Euboea]] and the [[Cyclades]] islands in the Aegean Sea. The rest of the Greek-speaking lands, including [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] and the rest of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands, [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]], remained under Ottoman rule. Over one million Greeks also lived in what is now [[Turkey]], mainly in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region of [[Asia Minor]], especially around [[Smyrna]], in the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] region on the [[Black Sea]] coast, in the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], in [[Cappadocia]], in [[Istanbul]], in [[Imbros]] and in [[Tenedos]].\n\nGreek politicians of the 19th century were determined to include all these territories within a greatly enlarged single Greek state, based on the [[Byzantine]] model and with [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) as its capital. This policy was called the Great Idea (''[[Megali Idea]]''). Constantinople had been the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern half of the Roman Empire]] until its fall to the Turks in 1453. The Ottomans naturally opposed these plans for a larger Greek state. The Empire was considered by the European powers as 'the [[sick man of Europe]]', but since these powers were irreconcilably divided over the fate of the Ottoman lands, the conflicts both reduced its territorial hold but also kept delaying its collapse.\n\nDuring the [[Crimean War]] (1854 to 1856), [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] restrained Greece from attacking the Ottomans by occupying [[Piraeus]]. They were again prevented from taking military action during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877, in which the Greeks were keen to join in with the objective of territorial expansion, but Greece was unable to take any effective part in the war. Nevertheless, after the [[Congress of Berlin]], in 1881 Greece was given most of [[Thessaly]] and part of Epirus. Also, in 1854-1896, there were revolts in the Ottoman Empire by the Greek population in Thessaly, Macedonia, [[Epirus Revolt of 1854|Epirus]].\n\nIn 1858-1896 there were many revolts in Crete, Thessaly [[1878 Greek Macedonian rebellion|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus Revolt of 1878|Epirus]] against the Ottoman Empire by the Greek population.\n\n[[File:AsiaMinor1910.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of Asia Minor depicting the [[Ottoman Greeks]] (blue) in 1910]]\nIn 1897, a new revolt in [[Crete]] led to the first [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]]. An unprepared Greek army was unable to dislodge the Ottoman troops from their fortifications along the northern border, and with the resulting Ottoman counter-attack, the war resulted in minor territorial losses for Greece.\n\nThe [[Young Turks]], who seized power in the Ottoman Empire in 1908, were Turkish nationalists whose objective was to create a strong, centrally governed state. The Christian minorities of the Empire, including Greeks, saw their position in the Empire deteriorate.\n\nThe [[First Balkan War]] of 1912\u20131913 was a direct consequence of the mounting tension, as a result of which Greece seized Crete, the islands, the rest of Thessaly and Epirus, and coastal Macedonia from the Ottomans, in alliance with [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Crete was once again the flashpoint for tension between the two nations.\n\n===The First World War and after (1914-1927)===\n{{Main|Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)}}\n\nIn 1913 an organized persecution of the Christian population of the Ottoman Empire, including the [[Greek genocide|Greeks]], was started. Greece entered the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1917 with the intention of seizing [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and [[Smyrna]] ([[\u0130zmir]]) from the Ottomans, with the encouragement of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]], who also promised the Greeks [[Cyprus]] at a certain stage. The ongoing [[Greek genocide|genocide of Pontic Greeks]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} in the Ottoman Empire also played a factor in this decision{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}. Although there was little direct fighting between Greeks and Turks{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}, when the Ottoman Empire collapsed in 1918 the Greeks were quick to claim the lands the Allies had promised them. The 1920 [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] gave Greece eastern [[Thrace]] and an area of about 17,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 in western [[Anatolia]] around Smyrna. This Treaty was signed by the Ottoman government but never went into force, not having been ratified by Parliament.\n\n[[Occupation of Smyrna|Greece occupied Smyrna/\u0130zmir]] on 15 May 1919, while [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] (later [[Atat\u00fcrk]]), who was to become the leader of the Turkish opposition to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], landed in [[Samsun]] on May 19, 1919, an action that is regarded as the beginning of the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. He united the protesting voices in Anatolia and set in motion a nationalist movement to repel the armies that had occupied Turkey (including Italy, France and Britain) and establish new borders for a sovereign Turkish nation. Having created a separate government in [[Ankara]], Kemal's government did not recognise the abortive Treaty of S\u00e8vres and fought to have it revoked. The Greek advances into Anatolia were eventually checked and the Greek army was forced into retreat.\n\n\n[[File:Asia Minor massacres.jpg|thumb|Overcrowded boats with refugees fleeing the [[Great fire of Smyrna]]. The photo was taken from the launch boat of a US warship.]]\nThe Turkish army entered Smyrna/\u0130zmir on 9 September 1922, effectively ending the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] in the field. The Greek army and administration had already left by sea. The war was put to an end by the [[Armistice of Mudanya]], and the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] replaced previous treaties to constitute modern [[Turkey]].\n\nThe [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] also provided for a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] that had begun before the final signature of the treaty in July 1923. About one and a half million Greeks had to leave Turkey for Greece and about half a million Turks had to leave Greece for Turkey (note that the population exchange was on religious grounds, thus the exchange was officially that of [[Christians]] for [[Muslims]]). The exceptions to the population exchange were Istanbul (Constantinople) and the islands of [[G\u00f6k\u00e7eada]] ([[Imbros]]) and [[Bozcaada]] ([[Tenedos]]), where the Greek minority (including the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]) was allowed to stay, and [[Western Thrace]], whose Muslim minority was also allowed to stay.\n\nDue to the defeat of the Greek army and the events following which terminated 3,000 years of Greek presence in Anatolia, Greece refers to it as the Asia Minor Catastrophe/Disaster. The alleged atrocities committed by the Greek army during the Greek occupation of Western Anatolia (1919\u20131922) left a lasting impression on the Turkish mind. Greek accusations, on the other hand, were focused on the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], especially in view of the account provided by [[George Horton]], the U.S. Consul General in the city from 1919 to 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/Horton/HortonBook.htm|title=THE BLIGHT OF ASIA|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> Horton's account remains as controversial as the fire itself.<ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/byz/2006/00000030/00000001/art00005] In an article published in [http://www.maney.co.uk/search?fwaction=show&fwid=466 Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110742/http://www.maney.co.uk/search?fwaction=show&fwid=466 |date=2007-09-29 }} (\"George Horton: The literary diplomat)\", [[Brian Coleman]] describes his subject matter as follows: \"George Horton was a man of letters and United States Consul in Greece and Turkey at a time of social and political change.

His account, however, goes beyond the blame and events to a demonization of Muslims, in general, and of Turks, in particular. In several of his novels, written more than two decades before the events of September 1922, he had already identified the Turk as the stock-in-trade [[villain]] of Western civilization. In his account of Smyrna, he writes not as a historian, but as a publicist.\"</ref><ref>[http://www.kapatel.gr/matrix/science/eemet/patakis.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218070032/http://www.kapatel.gr/matrix/science/eemet/patakis.htm |date=2005-12-18 }} Proclamation issued by the [[New York State]] Governor [[George E.

Tenedos population was overwhelmingly Greek, and Imbros population was entirely Greek. However, after the legislation of \"Civil Law\" on 26 June 1927, the rights accorded to the Greek population of Imbros and Tenedos were revoked, in violation of the Lausanne Treaty. Thus, the island was demoted from an administrative district to a sub-district which resulted that the island was to be stripped of its local tribunals. Moreover, the members of the local council were obliged to have adequate knowledge of the Turkish language, which meant that the vast majority of the islanders were excluded. Furthermore, according to this law, the Turkish government retained the right to dissolve this council and in certain circumstances, to introduce police force and other officials who were non-islanders. This law also violated the educational rights of the local community and imposed an educational system similar to that followed by ordinary Turkish schools.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alexandris|first=Alexis|title=Imbros and Tenedos:: A Study of Turkish Attitudes Toward Two Ethnic Greek Island Communities Since 1923|year=1980|publisher=Pella Publishing Company|page=21|url=http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/13027/07_1_1980.pdf?sequence=1.}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Corfu incident]] between Italy and Greece, at 1923, elements in Turkey advised [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] to seize the opportunity to invade [[Western Thrace]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article96042274 |title=ANOTHER BALKAN WAR THREATENED. |newspaper=[[The Recorder (Port Pirie)|The Recorder]] |location=Port Pirie, SA |date=8 September 1923 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} \"Reports from Turkey show that a section of opinion is already urging Kemal Pasha to seize the opportunity to invade Western Thrace.\"</ref>\n\n===1928-1954: Normalization of the relations===\n[[File:AtaturkAndVenizelos.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The first president of Turkey [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] (center) hosting Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] (at left) in [[Ankara]] October 27, 1930]]\n\nThe post-war leaders of Turkey and Greece, [[Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] and [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] respectively, were determined to establish normal relations between the two states.

(''See [[SS Kurtulu\u015f]] for more information.'')\n\nAt the same time, Turkey signed a \"[[German\u2013Turkish Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Friendship and cooperation]]\" with Nazi Germany in June 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/assets1.html|title=New Supplement to the State Department Report on Holocaust Assets - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> The following year, 1942, Turkey imposed the [[Varl\u0131k Vergisi]], a special tax, which taxed the non-Muslim minorities of Turkey, including Greek minority. Also, during the WWII there was the incident of [[the Twenty Classes]], this was the conscription of non-Muslims males who were sent in labour battalions.\n\nThe early [[Cold War]] brought closer the international policies of the two countries, in 1950 both fought at the [[Korean War]] at the side of the [[UN]] forces. In 1952, both countries joined [[NATO]]. In 1953 Greece, Turkey and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] formed [[Balkan Pact (1953)|a new Balkan Pact]] for mutual defence against the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n=== {{anchor|Istanbul_Pogrom}} Istanbul Pogrom, Cyprus crisis, Turkish invasion and the collapse of the Greek military junta (1955-1975)===\n{{Further|Istanbul Pogrom|Cyprus dispute|Cypriot intercommunal violence|1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}\n\nA serious matter of conflict in Turkish-Greek relations since the 1950s has been [[Cyprus]]; at the time, it was a British colony with a Greek-Cypriot population share of 82% of the island's total. Some of the Greek Cypriots wanted unity (''enosis'') with Greece and, as early as 1931, there were nationalist riots in [[Nicosia]]. The Greek government was, due to its financial and diplomatic dependence on Britain, forced to disavow any aims for unification with Cyprus.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Cyprus issue flared up again when the Greek Cypriots, under [[Archbishop Makarios]], claimed union with Greece, and the [[EOKA]] group launched a paramilitary movement on the island - mainly against the British, but also inflicting collateral damage to other parties and civilians. Eventually, Greek Prime Minister [[Alexander Papagos]] took the Cyprus issue to the [[United Nations]].\n\nTurkish nationalist sentiment, angered by the discrimination against the Turkish Cypriots, became inflamed at the idea that Cyprus would be ceded to Greece. This led to the Greek community of Istanbul becoming the target in the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] of 1955. In response, Greece withdrew from all co-operation with Turkey, which caused the Balkan Pact to collapse.\n\nIn 1960, a compromise solution to the Cyprus issue was agreed on: Britain granted independence to Cyprus, and a constitution was hammered out. Greek and Turkish troops were stationed on the island to protect their respective communities. Greek Prime Minister [[Constantine Karamanlis]] was the main architect of this plan, which led to an immediate improvement in relations with Turkey, particularly once [[Adnan Menderes]] was removed from power in Turkey.\n\nDuring the period of [[Cyprus crisis of 1963\u201364|intercommunal strife in 1963 and 1964]], Greek and Turkish Cypriots were displaced and many were massacred on both sides.\n\nOn 30 December 1964, Makarios declared his proposal for a constitutional amendment that included 13 articles. Turkey, however, restated that she was against this and threatened war if Cyprus tried to achieve unity with Greece. In August, Turkish aircraft bombed Greek troops that surrounded a Turkish village (Erenkoy) and war seemed imminent. Once again, the Greek minority in Turkey suffered from the crisis, causing many Greeks to flee the country, and there were even threats to expel the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]. Eventually, intervention by the [[United Nations]] led to another compromise solution.\n\nIn 1964 Turkish prime minister [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] renounced the 1930 Greek-Turkish Treaty of friendship and took actions against the Greek minority.<ref name=The_New_York_Times_Aug_9_1964/><ref>{{cite book|last1= Roudometof |first1=Victor |last2=Agadjanian |first2=Alexander |last3=Pankhurst|first3=Jerry |title=Eastern Orthodoxy in a Global Age: Tradition Faces the 21st Century  |url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=mQRtAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |year=2006 |publisher= AltaMira Press| isbn=978-0759105379|pages=273}}</ref> Turkey enforced strictly a long\u2010overlooked law barring Greek nationals from 30 professions and occupations, for example Greeks could not be doctors, nurses, architects, shoemakers, tailors, plumbers, cabaret singers, ironsmiths, cooks, tourist guides, etc.<ref name=The_New_York_Times_Aug_9_1964>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/09/archives/turks-expelling-istanbul-greeks-communitys-plight-worsens-during.html|title=TURKS EXPELLING ISTANBUL GREEKS; Community's Plight Worsens During Cyprus Crisis|date=August 9, 1964|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Many Greek have been ordered to give up their jobs after this law.<ref name=The_New_York_Times_Apr_24_1964>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/24/archives/greeks-of-istanbul-unhappy-with-both-ankara-and-athens.html|title=Greeks of Istanbul Unhappy With Both Ankara and Athens|date=April 24, 1964|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> 50,000 more Greeks were deported.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2019-05-14|title=Why Turkey and Greece cannot reconcile|url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/12/14/why-turkey-and-greece-cannot-reconcile|newspaper=The Economist|date=14 December 2017|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> They were given a week to leave the country.

Under the diplomacy of the military regime, there were periodic crises with Turkey, which suspected that the Greek regime was planning a pro-unification coup in Cyprus.\n\n[[File:Grenspost.jpg|thumb|[[Northern Cyprus]] in 2009]]\nA 1971 Turkish law nationalized religious high schools and closed the [[Halki seminary]] on Istanbul's [[Heybeli]] Island which had trained [[Greek Orthodox]] clergy since 1844.\n\nOn July 15, 1974, a band of Greek Cypriot nationalists formed [[EOKA B]], advocating [[Enosis]] (Union) with Greece and, backed by the [[Greek military junta]] in Athens, staged a coup against the Cypriot President and [[Archbishop Makarios]]. An ex-[[EOKA]] man, [[Nikos Sampson]] was appointed President. On July 20, Turkey\u2014using its guarantor status arising from the trilateral accords of the 1959\u20131960 [[Z\u00fcrich and London Agreement]]\u2014[[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded Cyprus]] without any resistance from the British forces based on the island, occupied 37% of the northern part and expelled the Greek population. Once again, war between Greece and Turkey seemed imminent, but actual war was averted when Sampson's coup collapsed a few days later and Makarios returned to power. Also, the [[Greek military junta]] in Athens, which failed to confront the Turkish invasion, fell from power on 24 July. The damage to Turkish-Greek relations was done, and the occupation of [[Northern Cyprus]] by Turkish troops would be a sticking point in Greco-Turkish relations for decades to come.\n\nIn 2018, declassified documents of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Bulgaria]] revealed a plan to foment crisis between [[Turkey]] and Greece in 1971. The operation codenamed \"Cross\" and the plan was that Bulgarian secret agents would set fire to the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] and make it look like the work of Turks.

In addition, the Bulgarians also planned to boost the effectiveness of its operation against Greece and Turkey by conducting \u201cactive measures\" \u201cfor putting the enemy in a position of delusion.\" The plan was developed by the 7th Department of the First Main Directorate of the [[Committee for State Security (Bulgaria)|DS]] (intelligence and secret police services of communist Bulgaria) and was affirmed by Deputy Head of the Directorate on November 16, 1970, and approved by its Head.

The [[Balkan Wars]] of 1913 had given Greece all the Aegean islands except [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]], some of them only a few kilometres (barely more than three nautical miles) off the Turkish coast. Since the end of [[World War II]], Turkish officials insisted that this led to questions regarding the [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of territorial waters, air space and other related zones of control. The conflict was motivated both by considerations of military tactical advantages and by questions of economic exploitation of the Aegean. The latter issue became particularly significant as after 1970 there were expectations of finding oil in the Aegean. This was highlighted during the [[1987 Aegean crisis|crisis]] in 1987, when a Turkish ship was about to enter disputed waters to conduct an oil survey. The Greek Prime Minister of the time, [[Andreas Papandreou]], ordered the ship to be sunk if found within disputed waters claimed by Greece. Consultations about this issue were held in [[Davos]] between the Greek and Turkish Prime Ministers.\n\nIssues unresolved to this day concern the mutual delimitation of several zones of control:\n*The width of the [[territorial waters]]. Both sides currently possess 6 nautical miles (11&nbsp;km) off their shores in the Aegean Sea. Greece claims a right to unilateral expansion to 12 nautical miles, based on the International [[Law of the Sea]]. Turkey, which already has expanded its own territorial waters to 12 miles on its other coasts, denies the applicability of the 12-miles rule in the Aegean and has threatened Greece with war in the case it should try to apply it unilaterally.\n*The width of the national airspace. Greece currently claims 10 miles, while Turkey only acknowledges 6 miles.\n*The future delimitation of the [[continental shelf]] zone in the international parts of the Aegean, which would give the states exclusive rights to economic exploitation.\n*The right of Greece to exercise flight control over Turkish military flight activities within the international parts of the Aegean, based on conflicting interpretations of the rules about [[Flight Information Region]]s (FIR) set by the [[ICAO]].\n*Since 1996, the sovereignty over some small uninhabited islets, most notably [[Imia/Kardak]]\n\nThe conflict over military flight activities has led to a practice of continuous tactical military provocations. Turkish aircraft regularly fly in the zones over which Greece claims control (i.e., the outer four miles of the claimed Greek airspace and the international parts of Athens FIR), while Greek aircraft constantly intercept them. Aircraft from both countries frequently engage in mock dogfights. These operations often cause casualties and losses for both the Greek and Turkish Air Forces.\n\n===Incidents===\n* On 22 July 1974, during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], a pair of Greek [[Northrop F-5|F-5\u0391]]s intercepted a pair of Turkish [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102]] near [[Agios Efstratios]]. The aircraft engaged in a dogfight, during which one of the Turkish pilots fired a [[AIM-4 Falcon|Falcon]] missile against one of the F-5s piloted by Thomas Skampardonis. Skampardonis managed to evade the missile and then the other Greek pilot Ioannis Dinopoulos, who up to that point was undetected by the Turks, fired two [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9B]] missiles. The first AIM-9 missed its target but the second shot down one of the F-102s. The pilot of the remaining F-102 became disoriented and fled westwards. When he realized his mistake, he turned east towards the Turkish coast but ran out of fuel. This forced him to ditch his aircraft and crash, suffering fatal injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acig.info/CMS/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=107 |title=The Shooting Down of the Turkish F-102s |publisher=acig.info |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6lncnxMFT?url=https://electrical-greece.blogspot.gr/2016/05/the-shooting-down-of-turkish-f-102s-1974.html |archive-date=5 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* On 18 June 1992, a Greek [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F1CG]] crashed near the island of [[Agios Efstratios]] in the Northern Aegean, during a low-altitude dogfight with two Turkish [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]]s.

The so-called \"earthquake diplomacy\" generated an outpouring of sympathy and generous assistance provided by ordinary Greeks and Turks in both cases. These acts were encouraged from the top and took many foreigners by surprise, preparing the public for a breakthrough in bilateral relations, which had been marred by decades of hostility over anti-Greek [[pogrom]]s, territorial disputes and the situation in the divided island of Cyprus.\n\nTen years later, Greece has become one of the key supporters of Turkey's struggle to enter the [[European Union]]. Yet, despite the confidence Greece and Cyprus have shown, voting YES for Turkey in order to begin its entry negotiations with the European Union in October 2005, many key issues remain unresolved. Furthermore, Turkey still denies access to Cypriot vessels to its territory, an obligation towards the EU with a 2006 deadline. The Turkish government counters that this restriction regarding Cypriot vessels was taken after the trade embargo decision against the portion of Cyprus illegally occupied by Turkey. The issue remains deadlocked, despite UN and EU attempts to mediate. Other unfulfilled obligations include Christian minority rights, acknowledgement of the [[Orthodox Church]] of Constantinople and the role of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]].\n\nIn 2002, Turkey and Greece made an unsuccessful attempt to jointly host the 2008 UEFA European Football Championship. The bid was one of the four candidacies that was recommended to the UEFA Executive Committee, the joint Austria/Switzerland bid winning the right to host the tournament.\n\nA sign of improved relations was visible in the response to a mid-air collision by Greek and Turkish fighter jets in the southern Aegean in May 2006. While the Turkish pilot ejected safely, the Greek pilot lost his life. However, both countries agreed that the event should not affect their bilateral relations<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5008178.stm BBC News Online] May 23, 2006</ref> and made a strong effort to maintain them by agreeing to a set of confidence-building measures in the aftermath of the accident.\n\n==Forest arson==\nIn December 2011, the Turkish newspaper ''Birgun'' reported on an interview with former Turkish prime minister [[Mesut Yilmaz]] saying that Turkey was behind a number of large [[forest fires]] in Greece in the 1990s. Yilmaz later denied the statements, saying he had been misquoted by the newspaper and that he had been actually referring to unsubstantiated reports of Greek involvement in Turkish forest fires.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Turkish PM's arson admission fuels anger|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/137956/article/ekathimerini/news/former-turkish-pms-arson-admission-fuels-anger|date=December 28, 2011|publisher=[[Business Insider]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Outrage As Former Turkish Prime Minister Says The Country Secretly Started Huge Forest Fires In Greece|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/turkey-greece-yilmaz-2011-12|date=December 28, 2011|publisher=[[Business Insider]]}}</ref>\nHowever, despite Yilmaz's denial, the allegations strained the relations between the two countries.

As a result of bilateral negotiations, a readmission agreement was signed between Turkey and Greece in November 2001 and went into effect in April 2002. For third-country nationals, this protocol gives the parties 14 days to inform each other of the number of persons to be returned after the date of [[illegal entry]]. For nationals of the two countries the authorities can make use of simplified procedures. But the strict application of the agreement is reported to have retrograded as of 2003. Incidents concerning illegal immigration are frequent on the border of the two countries. Turkey, which is a transit point for illegal immigrants trying to reach Europe, has been accused of not being able to secure its borders with Greece.

He went to England in 1786, carrying several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from prominent individuals he had met in Philadelphia. He had already corresponded with artist [[Benjamin West]]; their fathers had been close friends. West took Fulton into his home, where Fulton lived for several years and studied painting. Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes, which allowed him to support himself. He continued to experiment with mechanical inventions.<ref name=buckman/>\n\nFulton became caught up in the enthusiasm of the \"Canal Mania\". In 1793 he began developing his ideas for [[tugboat]] [[canal]]s with inclined planes instead of locks. He obtained a patent for this idea in 1794 and also  began working on ideas for the steam power of boats. He published a pamphlet about canals and patented a [[Dredging|dredging machine]] and several other inventions. In 1794, he moved to [[Manchester]] to gain practical knowledge of English canal engineering. While there he became friendly with [[Robert Owen]], a cotton manufacturer and early [[socialist]]. Owen agreed to finance the development and promotion of Fulton's designs for inclined planes and earth-digging machines; he was instrumental in introducing the American to a canal company, which awarded him a sub-contract. But Fulton was not successful at this practical effort and he gave up the contract after a short time.<ref>Boyes, Graham.

The first [[steamship]]s had appeared considerably earlier. The earliest steam-powered ship, in which the engine moved oars, was built by [[Claude de Jouffroy]] in France. Called ''Palmip\u00e8de'', it was tested on the [[Doubs (river)|Doubs]] in 1776. In 1783, de Jouffroy built {{ship||Phyroscaphe}}, the first paddle steamer, which sailed successfully on the [[Sa\u00f4ne]]. The first successful trial run of a steamboat in America had been made by inventor [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]], on the [[Delaware River]] on August 22, 1787. [[William Symington]] had successfully tried steamboats in 1788, and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments.\n\nIn Britain, Fulton met the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater, Francis Egerton]], whose canal, the first to be constructed in the country, was being used for trials of a steam tug. Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals, and wrote a 1796 treatise on canal construction, suggesting improvements to locks and other features. Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799, Fulton had a boat constructed in the Duke's timber yard, under the supervision of [[Benjamin Powell]]. After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford, the boat was duly christened ''Bonaparte'' in honour of Fulton having served under [[Napoleon]]. After expensive trials, because of the configuration of the design, the team feared the paddles might damage the clay lining of the canal and eventually abandoned the experiment. In 1801, Bridgewater instead ordered eight vessels for his canal based on {{ship||Charlotte Dundas}}, constructed by Symington. \n\n[[File:Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment 9 August 1803.jpg|thumb|Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment of August 9, 1803.]]\n\nIn 1797 Fulton went to [[Paris]], where he was well known as an inventor. He studied [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], along with mathematics and chemistry. In Paris, Fulton met [[James Rumsey]], an inventor from [[Virginia]] with an interest in steamboats, who in 1786 ran his own first steamboat up the [[Potomac River]]. Fulton also exhibited the first [[panorama]] painting to be shown in Paris, [[Pierre Pr\u00e9vost (painter)|Pierre Pr\u00e9vost]]'s ''Vue de Paris depuis les Tuileries'' (1800), on what is still called ''Rue des Panoramas'' (Panorama Street) today.<ref name=sutcliffe63>[[#sutcliffe|Sutcliffe, 1909]], p. 63.</ref> While living in France, Fulton designed the first working muscle-powered submarine, {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}, between 1793 and 1797. He also experimented with torpedoes. When tested, his submarine operated underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water. He asked the government to subsidize its construction, but he was turned down twice. Eventually he approached the [[Minister of Marine (France)|Minister of Marine]] and in 1800 was granted permission to build.<ref name=\"Burgess1\">{{cite book|author=Burgess, Robert Forrest|title=Ships Beneath the Sea|url=https://archive.org/details/shipsbeneathseaa00burg|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-008958-7|url-access=registration|author-link=Robert Forrest Burgess}}</ref> The shipyard Perrier in [[Rouen]] built it, and the submarine sailed first in July 1800 on the [[Seine River]] in the same city.\n\n[[File:Plaque comm\u00e9morative \u00e0 Robert Fulton, Rouen.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque to Robert Fulton in the port of [[Rouen]], made in 1918 to thank the United States for their involvement in the First World War]]\n\nIn France, Fulton met [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], who was appointed [[U.S. Ambassador to France]] in 1801. He also had a scientifically curious mind, and the two men decided to collaborate on building a steamboat and to try operating it on the Seine. Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes, made drawings and models, and had a steamboat constructed. At the first trial the boat ran perfectly, but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened. On August 9, 1803, when this boat was driven up the River Seine, it sank. The boat was {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} long, with an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|adj=on}} beam, and made between {{convert|3|and|4|mph|km/h}} against the current.\n\nIn 1804, Fulton [[allegiance|switched allegiance]] and moved to Britain, where he was commissioned by Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] to build a range of weapons for use by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] invasion scares. Among his inventions were the world's first modern naval \"torpedoes\" (modern \"mines\"). These were tested, along with several other of his inventions, during the 1804 [[Raid on Boulogne]], but met with limited success. Although Fulton continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806, the decisive naval victory by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] at the 1805 [[Battle of Trafalgar]] greatly reduced the risk of French invasion. Fulton was increasingly ignored.<ref name=\"Best\"/>\n\n=== Career in the United States (1806\u20131815) ===\nIn 1806, Fulton returned to the United States. In 1807, he and Robert R. Livingston built the first commercially successful steamboat, {{ship||North River Steamboat}} (later known as ''Clermont''). Livingston's shipping company began using it to carry passengers between [[New York City]] and up the Hudson River to the state capital [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. ''Clermont'' made the {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=on}} trip in 32 hours. Passengers on the [[maiden voyage]] included a lawyer Jones and his family from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]. His infant daughter Alexandra Jones later served as a [[Union (Civil War)|Union]] nurse on a steamboat hospital in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Alice Crary Sutcliffe, ''Robert Fulton and the 'Claremont' ''</ref>\n\nFrom 1811 until his death, Fulton was a member of the [[Erie Canal Commission]], appointed by the [[Governor of New York]].\n\nFulton's final design was the [[floating battery]] {{ship|United States floating battery|Demologos||2}}. This first steam-driven warship in the world was built for the [[United States Navy]] for the [[War of 1812]]. The heavy vessel was not completed until after Fulton's death and was named in his honor.\n\nFrom October 1811 to January 1812, Fulton, along with Livingston and [[Nicholas Roosevelt (inventor)|Nicholas Roosevelt]] (1767\u20131854), worked together on a joint project to build a new steamboat, {{ship||New Orleans|steamboat|2}}, sturdy enough to take down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers to [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. It traveled from industrial [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where it was built, with stops at [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; past the \"[[Falls of the Ohio]]\" at [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; to near [[Cairo, Illinois]], and the confluence with the Mississippi River; and down past [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], to New Orleans some {{convert|90|mi}} by river from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast. This was less than a decade after the United States had acquired the [[Louisiana Territory]] from [[France]]. These rivers were not well settled, mapped, or protected. By achieving this first breakthrough voyage and also proving the ability of the steamboat to travel upstream against powerful river currents, Fulton changed the entire trade and transportation outlook for the American heartland.\n\nFulton was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistf|title=MemberListF|work=American Antiquarian Society}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn January 8, 1808, Fulton married Harriet Livingston (1786\u20131824), the daughter of [[Walter Livingston]] and niece of Robert Livingston, prominent men in the Hudson River area, whose family dated to the colonial era.<ref name=Reynolds1911>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Cuyler |title=Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs: A Record of Achievements of the People of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys in New York State, Included Within the Present Counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Washington, Saratoga, Montgomery, Fulton, Schenectady, Columbia and Greene |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ |year=1911 |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ/page/n370 302]\u2013303}}</ref><ref name=Lancaster1909>{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP47AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA227 |year=1909 |pages=227\u2013228}}</ref>  Harriet, who was nineteen years his junior, was well educated and was an accomplished amateur painter and musician.<ref name=\"Philip2003\"/>  Together, they had four children:<ref name=\"LCHS1909\">{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society: January 8, 1909.

In 1785, Fulton bought a farm at [[Hopewell Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania|Hopewell Township]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]] near [[Pittsburgh]] for \u00a380 <!-- according to {{Inflation|UK|80|1785}}, \u00a380 = \u00a39,956 in 2018 pounds --> (equivalent to ${{To USD|9956|GBR|round=yes}} in 2018),{{Inflation/fn|UK}} and moved his mother and family into it.\n\n== Work ==\n=== Career in Europe (1786\u20131806) ===\n[[File:Fulton's submarine design.jpg|alt=Fulton's 1806 submarine design for the U.S. government.|thumb|Fulton's 1806 submarine design for the U.S. government.]]\nAt the age of 23, Fulton traveled to Europe, where he would live for the next twenty years. He went to England in 1786, carrying several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from prominent individuals he had met in Philadelphia. He had already corresponded with artist [[Benjamin West]]; their fathers had been close friends. West took Fulton into his home, where Fulton lived for several years and studied painting. Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes, which allowed him to support himself. He continued to experiment with mechanical inventions.<ref name=buckman/>\n\nFulton became caught up in the enthusiasm of the \"Canal Mania\". In 1793 he began developing his ideas for [[tugboat]] [[canal]]s with inclined planes instead of locks. He obtained a patent for this idea in 1794 and also  began working on ideas for the steam power of boats. He published a pamphlet about canals and patented a [[Dredging|dredging machine]] and several other inventions. In 1794, he moved to [[Manchester]] to gain practical knowledge of English canal engineering. While there he became friendly with [[Robert Owen]], a cotton manufacturer and early [[socialist]]. Owen agreed to finance the development and promotion of Fulton's designs for inclined planes and earth-digging machines; he was instrumental in introducing the American to a canal company, which awarded him a sub-contract. But Fulton was not successful at this practical effort and he gave up the contract after a short time.<ref>Boyes, Graham. ''The Peak Forest Canal''. {{ISBN|9780901461599}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Fulton por HOUDON, Jean-Antoine 1803.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Robert Fulton by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], 1803.]]\n\nAs early as 1793, Fulton proposed plans for steam-powered vessels to both the United States and British governments. The first [[steamship]]s had appeared considerably earlier. The earliest steam-powered ship, in which the engine moved oars, was built by [[Claude de Jouffroy]] in France. Called ''Palmip\u00e8de'', it was tested on the [[Doubs (river)|Doubs]] in 1776. In 1783, de Jouffroy built {{ship||Phyroscaphe}}, the first paddle steamer, which sailed successfully on the [[Sa\u00f4ne]]. The first successful trial run of a steamboat in America had been made by inventor [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]], on the [[Delaware River]] on August 22, 1787. [[William Symington]] had successfully tried steamboats in 1788, and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments.\n\nIn Britain, Fulton met the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater, Francis Egerton]], whose canal, the first to be constructed in the country, was being used for trials of a steam tug. Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals, and wrote a 1796 treatise on canal construction, suggesting improvements to locks and other features. Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799, Fulton had a boat constructed in the Duke's timber yard, under the supervision of [[Benjamin Powell]]. After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford, the boat was duly christened ''Bonaparte'' in honour of Fulton having served under [[Napoleon]]. After expensive trials, because of the configuration of the design, the team feared the paddles might damage the clay lining of the canal and eventually abandoned the experiment. In 1801, Bridgewater instead ordered eight vessels for his canal based on {{ship||Charlotte Dundas}}, constructed by Symington. \n\n[[File:Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment 9 August 1803.jpg|thumb|Location and plaque of the Fulton experiment of August 9, 1803.]]\n\nIn 1797 Fulton went to [[Paris]], where he was well known as an inventor. He studied [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], along with mathematics and chemistry. In Paris, Fulton met [[James Rumsey]], an inventor from [[Virginia]] with an interest in steamboats, who in 1786 ran his own first steamboat up the [[Potomac River]]. Fulton also exhibited the first [[panorama]] painting to be shown in Paris, [[Pierre Pr\u00e9vost (painter)|Pierre Pr\u00e9vost]]'s ''Vue de Paris depuis les Tuileries'' (1800), on what is still called ''Rue des Panoramas'' (Panorama Street) today.<ref name=sutcliffe63>[[#sutcliffe|Sutcliffe, 1909]], p. 63.</ref> While living in France, Fulton designed the first working muscle-powered submarine, {{ship||Nautilus|1800 submarine|2}}, between 1793 and 1797. He also experimented with torpedoes. When tested, his submarine operated underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water. He asked the government to subsidize its construction, but he was turned down twice. Eventually he approached the [[Minister of Marine (France)|Minister of Marine]] and in 1800 was granted permission to build.<ref name=\"Burgess1\">{{cite book|author=Burgess, Robert Forrest|title=Ships Beneath the Sea|url=https://archive.org/details/shipsbeneathseaa00burg|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-008958-7|url-access=registration|author-link=Robert Forrest Burgess}}</ref> The shipyard Perrier in [[Rouen]] built it, and the submarine sailed first in July 1800 on the [[Seine River]] in the same city.\n\n[[File:Plaque comm\u00e9morative \u00e0 Robert Fulton, Rouen.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque to Robert Fulton in the port of [[Rouen]], made in 1918 to thank the United States for their involvement in the First World War]]\n\nIn France, Fulton met [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], who was appointed [[U.S. Ambassador to France]] in 1801. He also had a scientifically curious mind, and the two men decided to collaborate on building a steamboat and to try operating it on the Seine. Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes, made drawings and models, and had a steamboat constructed. At the first trial the boat ran perfectly, but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened. On August 9, 1803, when this boat was driven up the River Seine, it sank. The boat was {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} long, with an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|adj=on}} beam, and made between {{convert|3|and|4|mph|km/h}} against the current.\n\nIn 1804, Fulton [[allegiance|switched allegiance]] and moved to Britain, where he was commissioned by Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] to build a range of weapons for use by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] invasion scares. Among his inventions were the world's first modern naval \"torpedoes\" (modern \"mines\"). These were tested, along with several other of his inventions, during the 1804 [[Raid on Boulogne]], but met with limited success. Although Fulton continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806, the decisive naval victory by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] at the 1805 [[Battle of Trafalgar]] greatly reduced the risk of French invasion. Fulton was increasingly ignored.<ref name=\"Best\"/>\n\n=== Career in the United States (1806\u20131815) ===\nIn 1806, Fulton returned to the United States. In 1807, he and Robert R. Livingston built the first commercially successful steamboat, {{ship||North River Steamboat}} (later known as ''Clermont''). Livingston's shipping company began using it to carry passengers between [[New York City]] and up the Hudson River to the state capital [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. ''Clermont'' made the {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=on}} trip in 32 hours. Passengers on the [[maiden voyage]] included a lawyer Jones and his family from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]. His infant daughter Alexandra Jones later served as a [[Union (Civil War)|Union]] nurse on a steamboat hospital in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Alice Crary Sutcliffe, ''Robert Fulton and the 'Claremont' ''</ref>\n\nFrom 1811 until his death, Fulton was a member of the [[Erie Canal Commission]], appointed by the [[Governor of New York]].\n\nFulton's final design was the [[floating battery]] {{ship|United States floating battery|Demologos||2}}. This first steam-driven warship in the world was built for the [[United States Navy]] for the [[War of 1812]]. The heavy vessel was not completed until after Fulton's death and was named in his honor.\n\nFrom October 1811 to January 1812, Fulton, along with Livingston and [[Nicholas Roosevelt (inventor)|Nicholas Roosevelt]] (1767\u20131854), worked together on a joint project to build a new steamboat, {{ship||New Orleans|steamboat|2}}, sturdy enough to take down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers to [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. It traveled from industrial [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], where it was built, with stops at [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; past the \"[[Falls of the Ohio]]\" at [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; to near [[Cairo, Illinois]], and the confluence with the Mississippi River; and down past [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi]], to New Orleans some {{convert|90|mi}} by river from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast. This was less than a decade after the United States had acquired the [[Louisiana Territory]] from [[France]]. These rivers were not well settled, mapped, or protected. By achieving this first breakthrough voyage and also proving the ability of the steamboat to travel upstream against powerful river currents, Fulton changed the entire trade and transportation outlook for the American heartland.\n\nFulton was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistf|title=MemberListF|work=American Antiquarian Society}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn January 8, 1808, Fulton married Harriet Livingston (1786\u20131824), the daughter of [[Walter Livingston]] and niece of Robert Livingston, prominent men in the Hudson River area, whose family dated to the colonial era.<ref name=Reynolds1911>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Cuyler |title=Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs: A Record of Achievements of the People of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys in New York State, Included Within the Present Counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Washington, Saratoga, Montgomery, Fulton, Schenectady, Columbia and Greene |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ |year=1911 |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_b4k-AAAAYAAJ/page/n370 302]\u2013303}}</ref><ref name=Lancaster1909>{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP47AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA227 |year=1909 |pages=227\u2013228}}</ref>  Harriet, who was nineteen years his junior, was well educated and was an accomplished amateur painter and musician.<ref name=\"Philip2003\"/>  Together, they had four children:<ref name=\"LCHS1909\">{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society: January 8, 1909.

Together they make up the subgenus called \u201cCitharoedus\u201d, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Morphology ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />.

The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991).

They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M.

These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.  \n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.''

Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />\n\n== Diet and Feeding ==\n''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms.

Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />.

They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />.
