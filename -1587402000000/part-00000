IBM places these offerings under three umbrellas: SmartCloud Foundation, SmartCloud Services and SmartCloud Solutions.<ref name=\"Homepage\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/smartcloud |title=IBM SmartCloud |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nSmartCloud Foundation consists of the infrastructure, hardware, provisioning, management, integration and security that serve as the underpinnings of a private or hybrid cloud. Built using those foundational components, PaaS, IaaS and backup services make up SmartCloud Services. Running on this cloud platform and infrastructure, SmartCloud Solutions consist of a number of collaboration, analytics and marketing SaaS applications.\n\nIBM also builds cloud environments for clients that are not necessarily on the SmartCloud Platform. For example, features of the SmartCloud platform\u2014such as Tivoli management software or IBM Systems Director virtualization\u2014can be integrated separately as part of a non-IBM cloud platform. The SmartCloud platform consists solely of IBM hardware, software, services and practices.\n\nIBM SmartCloud Enterprise and SmartCloud Enterprise+ compete with products like those of [[Rackspace]] and [[Amazon Web Services]]. Erich Clementi, vice president of Global Technology Services at IBM, said in 2012 that the goal with SmartCloud Enterprise and SmartCloud Enterprise+ was to provide an [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud|Amazon EC2]]-like experience primarily for test and development purposes and to provide a more robust experience for production workloads.<ref name=\"GigaOm\">{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/cloud/watch-out-world-ibm-finally-offers-a-real-cloud/ |title=Watch Out, World: IBM Finally Offers a Real Cloud |author=Derrick Harris |date=6 April 2011 |work= |publisher=Giga Om |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=DHAC>\n{{cite book\n  |title=Developing and Hosting Applications on the Cloud\n  |date=July 2012\n  |publisher=IBM Press\n  |isbn=978-0-13-306684-5\n  |url=http://www.ibmpressbooks.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=9780133066845\n  |chapter = Infrastructure as a Service Cloud Concepts\n  |first1 = Alex\n  |last1 = Amies\n  |first2 = Harm\n  |last2 = Sluiman\n  |first3 = Qiang Guo\n  |last3 = Tong\n  |first4 = Guo Ning\n  |last4 = Liu\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 2011, IBM SmartCloud integrated [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]]-based InfoSphere BigInsights for big data,<ref name=\"Hadoop\">{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/cloud/ibm-doing-hadoop-as-a-service-in-its-cloud/ |title=IBM doing Hadoop as a service in its cloud |author=Derrick Harris |date=24 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Giga Om |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> Green Hat for software testing<ref name=\"Green Hat\">{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/ibm-acquires-green-hat-a-cloud-software-testing-outfit/66142 |title=IBM acquires Green Hat, a cloud software testing outfit |author=Larry Dignan |date=4 January 2012 |work= |publisher=ZDNet |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> and [[Nirvanix]]<ref name=\"Nirvanix\">{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/12/ibm-announces-new-smartcloud-services-partnership-with-nirvanix |title=IBM Announces New SmartCloud Services, Partnership With Nirvanix |author=Derrick Harris |date=12 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Tech Crunch |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> for cloud storage.

Users may also purchase IBM hardware, software and services to build their customized cloud environment.\n\nBy 2014, the name SmartCloud was replaced with products that have a prefix of [[IBM Cloud]]. A product called IBM Cloud Manager with OpenStack was IBM's integration of OpenStack along with a multitude of value additions that would serve enterprise customers. A product called IBM Cloud Orchestrator would serve the orchestration needs of an enterprise. The aforementioned SmartCloud products have been discontinued.\n\nBy 2016, the aforementioned product called IBM Cloud Manager with OpenStack was discontinued, although the services organization may be using other versions of OpenStack for large scale cloud deployments.\n\n==Public, private and hybrid cloud models==\nIBM offers cloud delivery options including solely private cloud, solely public cloud, and variations in between. Private, public and hybrid clouds are not strictly distinct, as IBM allows the option to build a customized cloud out of a combination of public cloud and private cloud elements. Companies that prefer to keep all data and processes behind their own firewall can use private cloud services managed by their own IT staff. A company may also choose pay-as-you-go pricing. Hybrid cloud options allow for some processes to be hosted and managed by IBM, while others are kept on a private cloud or on a [[VPN]] or [[VLAN]]. IBM also offers planning and consultation throughout the deployment process. IBM offers five cloud provision models:\n* Private cloud, owned and operated by the customer\n* Private cloud, owned by the customer, but operated by IBM (or another provider)\n* Private cloud, owned and operated by IBM (or another provider)\n* Virtual private cloud services (based on multi-tenanted support for individual enterprises)\n* Public cloud services (based on the provision of functions to individuals)<ref name=\"IBM gets smart with cloud\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cloudpro.co.uk/clive-longbottom/1397/ibm-gets-smart-cloud |title=IBM gets smart with cloud |author=Clive Longbottom |date=2011-07-29 |publisher=CloudPro |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref>\nThe majority of cloud users choose a hybrid cloud model, with some workloads being served by internal systems, some from commercial cloud providers and some from public cloud service providers.<ref name=\"IBM gets smart with cloud\"/>\n\nOn August 25, 2011, IBM announced the release of a new hybrid cloud model orchestrated by [[IBM WebSphere]] Cast Iron integration of on- and off-premises resources.<ref name=\"IBM Unveils New Hybrid Cloud Solution for the Enterprise\">{{cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/35291.wss |title=IBM Unveils New Hybrid Cloud Solution for the Enterprise |date=2011-08-25 |publisher= |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> Enterprises can use Cast Iron integration to link their public cloud appliances\u2014 hosted on environments like [[Amazon EC2]], [[Google Apps]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[Oracle CRM]], [[SugarCRM]] and a number of others\u2014to their existing systems or in-house, private cloud environments.<ref name=\"WebSphere Cast Iron Cloud Integration\">{{cite web |url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/cast-iron-cloud-integration/ |title=WebSphere Cast Iron Cloud Integration |date=2011-08-25 |publisher= |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> Cast Iron Integration aims to reduce the time and effort needed for customized coding, in favor of simple workload provisioning through [[Tivoli Software|Tivoli Management Framework]].<ref name=\"IBM Connects Tivoli To Hybrid Cloud\">{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/cloud-computing/infrastructure/231600296 |title=IBM Connects Tivoli To Hybrid Cloud |author=Charles Babcock |date=2011-08-29 |publisher=InformationWeek |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe IBM public cloud offering, SmartCloud Enterprise, was launched on April 7, 2011.

IBM places these offerings under three umbrellas: SmartCloud Foundation, SmartCloud Services and SmartCloud Solutions.<ref name=\"Homepage\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/smartcloud |title=IBM SmartCloud |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nSmartCloud Foundation consists of the infrastructure, hardware, provisioning, management, integration and security that serve as the underpinnings of a private or hybrid cloud. Built using those foundational components, PaaS, IaaS and backup services make up SmartCloud Services. Running on this cloud platform and infrastructure, SmartCloud Solutions consist of a number of collaboration, analytics and marketing SaaS applications.\n\nIBM also builds cloud environments for clients that are not necessarily on the SmartCloud Platform. For example, features of the SmartCloud platform\u2014such as Tivoli management software or IBM Systems Director virtualization\u2014can be integrated separately as part of a non-IBM cloud platform. The SmartCloud platform consists solely of IBM hardware, software, services and practices.\n\nIBM SmartCloud Enterprise and SmartCloud Enterprise+ compete with products like those of [[Rackspace]] and [[Amazon Web Services]]. Erich Clementi, vice president of Global Technology Services at IBM, said in 2012 that the goal with SmartCloud Enterprise and SmartCloud Enterprise+ was to provide an [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud|Amazon EC2]]-like experience primarily for test and development purposes and to provide a more robust experience for production workloads.<ref name=\"GigaOm\">{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/cloud/watch-out-world-ibm-finally-offers-a-real-cloud/ |title=Watch Out, World: IBM Finally Offers a Real Cloud |author=Derrick Harris |date=6 April 2011 |work= |publisher=Giga Om |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=DHAC>\n{{cite book\n  |title=Developing and Hosting Applications on the Cloud\n  |date=July 2012\n  |publisher=IBM Press\n  |isbn=978-0-13-306684-5\n  |url=http://www.ibmpressbooks.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=9780133066845\n  |chapter = Infrastructure as a Service Cloud Concepts\n  |first1 = Alex\n  |last1 = Amies\n  |first2 = Harm\n  |last2 = Sluiman\n  |first3 = Qiang Guo\n  |last3 = Tong\n  |first4 = Guo Ning\n  |last4 = Liu\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 2011, IBM SmartCloud integrated [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]]-based InfoSphere BigInsights for big data,<ref name=\"Hadoop\">{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/cloud/ibm-doing-hadoop-as-a-service-in-its-cloud/ |title=IBM doing Hadoop as a service in its cloud |author=Derrick Harris |date=24 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Giga Om |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> Green Hat for software testing<ref name=\"Green Hat\">{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/ibm-acquires-green-hat-a-cloud-software-testing-outfit/66142 |title=IBM acquires Green Hat, a cloud software testing outfit |author=Larry Dignan |date=4 January 2012 |work= |publisher=ZDNet |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> and [[Nirvanix]]<ref name=\"Nirvanix\">{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/12/ibm-announces-new-smartcloud-services-partnership-with-nirvanix |title=IBM Announces New SmartCloud Services, Partnership With Nirvanix |author=Derrick Harris |date=12 October 2011 |work= |publisher=Tech Crunch |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> for cloud storage.

Users may also purchase IBM hardware, software and services to build their customized cloud environment.\n\nBy 2014, the name SmartCloud was replaced with products that have a prefix of IBM Cloud. A product called IBM Cloud Manager with OpenStack was IBM's integration of OpenStack along with a multitude of value additions that would serve enterprise customers. A product called IBM Cloud Orchestrator would serve the orchestration needs of an enterprise. The aforementioned SmartCloud products have been discontinued.\n\nBy 2016, the aforementioned product called IBM Cloud Manager with OpenStack was discontinued, although the services organization may be using other versions of OpenStack for large scale cloud deployments.\n\n==Public, private and hybrid cloud models==\nIBM offers cloud delivery options including solely private cloud, solely public cloud, and variations in between. Private, public and hybrid clouds are not strictly distinct, as IBM allows the option to build a customized cloud out of a combination of public cloud and private cloud elements. Companies that prefer to keep all data and processes behind their own firewall can use private cloud services managed by their own IT staff. A company may also choose pay-as-you-go pricing. Hybrid cloud options allow for some processes to be hosted and managed by IBM, while others are kept on a private cloud or on a [[VPN]] or [[VLAN]]. IBM also offers planning and consultation throughout the deployment process. IBM offers five cloud provision models:\n* Private cloud, owned and operated by the customer\n* Private cloud, owned by the customer, but operated by IBM (or another provider)\n* Private cloud, owned and operated by IBM (or another provider)\n* Virtual private cloud services (based on multi-tenanted support for individual enterprises)\n* Public cloud services (based on the provision of functions to individuals)<ref name=\"IBM gets smart with cloud\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cloudpro.co.uk/clive-longbottom/1397/ibm-gets-smart-cloud |title=IBM gets smart with cloud |author=Clive Longbottom |date=2011-07-29 |publisher=CloudPro |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref>\nThe majority of cloud users choose a hybrid cloud model, with some workloads being served by internal systems, some from commercial cloud providers and some from public cloud service providers.<ref name=\"IBM gets smart with cloud\"/>\n\nOn August 25, 2011, IBM announced the release of a new hybrid cloud model orchestrated by [[IBM WebSphere]] Cast Iron integration of on- and off-premises resources.<ref name=\"IBM Unveils New Hybrid Cloud Solution for the Enterprise\">{{cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/35291.wss |title=IBM Unveils New Hybrid Cloud Solution for the Enterprise |date=2011-08-25 |publisher= |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> Enterprises can use Cast Iron integration to link their public cloud appliances\u2014 hosted on environments like [[Amazon EC2]], [[Google Apps]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[Oracle CRM]], [[SugarCRM]] and a number of others\u2014to their existing systems or in-house, private cloud environments.<ref name=\"WebSphere Cast Iron Cloud Integration\">{{cite web |url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/cast-iron-cloud-integration/ |title=WebSphere Cast Iron Cloud Integration |date=2011-08-25 |publisher= |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> Cast Iron Integration aims to reduce the time and effort needed for customized coding, in favor of simple workload provisioning through [[Tivoli Software|Tivoli Management Framework]].<ref name=\"IBM Connects Tivoli To Hybrid Cloud\">{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/cloud-computing/infrastructure/231600296 |title=IBM Connects Tivoli To Hybrid Cloud |author=Charles Babcock |date=2011-08-29 |publisher=InformationWeek |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe IBM public cloud offering, SmartCloud Enterprise, was launched on April 7, 2011.

{"title_page": "Titles of Mary", "text_new": "[[File:Our Lady of Good Counsel by Pasquale Sarullo.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Our Lady of Good Counsel]]'' by [[Pasquale Sarullo]], 19th century.]]\n[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is known by many different titles (Blessed Mother, Madonna, Our Lady), [[epithet]]s ([[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]], [[Queen of Heaven]], Cause of Our Joy), invocations (''[[Theotokos]]'', ''[[Panagia]]'', Mother of Mercy) and other names ([[Our Lady of Loreto]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]).\n{{Mary}}\nAll of these titles refer to the same individual named Mary, the mother of [[Jesus Christ]] (in the [[New Testament]]) and are used variably by [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and some [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].  (Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a[[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as [[Irenaeus]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (and others).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".<ref>[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. \"Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese\", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]</ref>\n\n* Mary was identified as the \"[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].<ref>Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html \u201cMary the New Eve,\u201d] ''Frei Francisco''.</ref>\n* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary.

Furthermore, she is interested by four different dogmas and a lot of Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles and arts witness her prominent role at the sight of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is told that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man\", meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit God into her body, the degree of her participation to the life of the Holy Trinity as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the holy spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]] are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.

Explains the meaning of the Marian titles Assumpta, Mediatrix, Co-Redemptrix. \n\n{{Catholic saints}}\n{{Virgin Mary}}\n\n[[Category:Titles of Mary| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Our Lady of Good Counsel by Pasquale Sarullo.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Our Lady of Good Counsel]]'' by [[Pasquale Sarullo]], 19th century.]]\n[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is known by many different titles (Blessed Mother, Madonna, Our Lady), [[epithet]]s ([[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]], [[Queen of Heaven]], Cause of Our Joy), invocations (''[[Theotokos]]'', ''[[Panagia]]'', Mother of Mercy) and other names ([[Our Lady of Loreto]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]).\n{{Mary}}\nAll of these titles refer to the same individual named Mary, the mother of [[Jesus Christ]] (in the [[New Testament]]) and are used variably by [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and some [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].  (Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a[[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (Divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as [[Irenaeus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and others.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".<ref>[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. \"Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese\", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]</ref>\n\n* Mary was identified as the \"[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].<ref>Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html \u201cMary the New Eve,\u201d] ''Frei Francisco''.</ref>\n* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\n* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians. It is attributed to [[Jerome]] and cited by [[Paschasius Radbertus]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=150| English !! width=100| Latin !! width=100| Greek !!

Furthermore, she is interested by four different dogmas and a lot of Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles and arts witness her prominent role at the sight of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is told that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man\", meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit God into her body, the degree of her participation to the life of the Holy Trinity as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the holy spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]] are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.

{"title_page": "Servaea gens", "text_new": "{{Short description|Ancient Roman family}}\nThe '''gens Servaea''' was a minor [[plebs|plebeian]] family at [[ancient Rome]].  Members of this [[gens]] are first mentioned during the reign of [[Tiberius]], from which time they presumably rose steadily through the [[Roman Empire|imperial]] bureaucracy, attaining the [[Roman consul|consulship]] under [[Domitian]].  A number of inscriptions from the second century or later indicate some of them had settled in [[Africa proconsularis|Africa]], where one family of this gens became particularly illustrious under the [[Antonine dynasty|Antonine]] and [[Severan dynasty|Severan]] dynasties.\n\n==Origin==\nThe [[Roman naming conventions#nomen|nomen]] ''Servaeus'' belongs to a class of gentilicia formed with the suffix ''{{not a typo|-aeus}}'', which was typical among families of [[Oscan language|Oscan]] or [[Umbri]]an derivation.<ref>Chase, p. 120.</ref>  The root resembles and may be cognate with the Latin [[praenomen]] ''[[Servius (praenomen)|Servius]]'', meaning one who \"keeps safe\" or \"preserves\".  In this case, ''Servaeus'' is most likely an Oscan or Umbrian cognate of the more common nomen ''[[Servilia gens|Servilius]]''.<ref>Chase, pp. 154, 155.</ref>  A few of the Servaei mentioned in inscriptions lived in central or southern Italy, and one family of this gens bore the surname ''Sabinus'', suggesting that they were of [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin.<ref name=\"CIL 3 14398\"/><ref name=\"AE 1930 109\"/>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe chief praenomen of the Servaei was ''[[Quintus (praenomen)|Quintus]]'', with ''[[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]]'' and ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]'' evidently being used for younger sons.  All were among the most common names throughout Roman history.  Other praenomina occur infrequently.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe earliest of the Servaei to rise to prominence bore no surname.  The first [[cognomen]] to appear among the family is ''Longinus'', a diminutive of ''Longus'', a surname originally designating someone who was tall; Servaeus Longinus may have acquired the surname as the son or grandson of a Servaeus Longus, or because he was moderately tall.<ref name=\"Chase 110\">Chase, p. 110.</ref>  The name does not seem to have been passed down to subsequent generations.  ''Sabinus'', borne by two soldiers, a father and son who served in [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]] during the early second century, probably indicated that the family claimed descent from the Sabines, an ancient people of central Italy, some of whom had migrated to Rome at the time of the city's legendary founding in the eighth century BC.<ref>Chase, pp. 113, 114.</ref>\n\n''Innocens'', borne by the two Servaei, perhaps father and son, who attained the consulship under Domitian and [[Trajan]], indicated someone of blameless character, and belonged to a large class of surnames derived from a person's habits.<ref>Chase, pp. 110, 111.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.v. innocens''.</ref>  The full nomenclature of the first Innocens is uncertain, but the second, who held office in AD 101, bore the polyonymous appelation of ''Gaius Sertorius Brocchus Quintus Servaeus Innocens'', probably indicating that he was descended from the more illustrious house of the [[Sertoria (gens)|Sertorii]] through a female line.<ref>Salway, ''What's in a Name?'', pp. 131\u2013133.</ref>  Given the high station that this family reached, it seems possible that the Servaei of [[Gigthi]]s in [[Africa Proconsularis]] was descended from them.\n\nThis family seems to have come to prominence with Quintus Servaeus Macer during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]].  His surname, ''Macer'', designated someone who was notably lean, but the chief cognomen of this family seems to have been ''Fuscus'', \"dark\", which would likely have referred to someone with dark brown hair.<ref name=\"Chase 110\"/><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.v. fuscus''.</ref>  This alternated with ''Firmus'', \"strong\" or \"steadfast\", and ''Felix'', \"happy\" or \"fortunate\".<ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.vv. firmus, felix''.</ref>  The Servaei Fusci were of [[equites|equestrian]] rank, and seem to have formed part of the nobility of Gigthis, where they served in the local senate, and at least one of them, Quintus Servaeus Fuscus Cornelianus, served in the [[Roman Senate]] and held a number of important positions throughout the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].  Another family of colonial Servaei lived at [[Sbeitla|Sufetula]] in [[Numidia (Roman province)|Numidia]], but it remains unclear whether or how they might have been related to the Fusci.  Some of them bore the surname ''Potitianus'', perhaps commemorating their descent from the ancient [[Potitia (gens)|Potitia gens]].\n\n==Members==\n{{Filiation}}\n\n* [[Quintus Servaeus]], a man of [[praetor]]ian rank, was appointed governor of [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagene]] in AD 18.  He was among the friends of [[Germanicus]] who accused [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]] of having poisoned the young general.  After the downfall of [[Sejanus]], Servaeus was one of those who were falsely accused of conspiring with the disgraced consul, and condemned; but he avoided execution by giving evidence against Sejanus' accomplices.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', ii. 56, iii. 13, vi. 7.</ref><ref>''PIR'', S. 398.</ref>\n* Servaea \u0186. l.

In this case, ''Servaeus'' is most likely an Oscan or Umbrian cognate of the more common nomen ''[[Servilia gens|Servilius]]''.<ref>Chase, pp. 154, 155.</ref>  A few of the Servaei mentioned in inscriptions lived in central or southern Italy, and one family of this gens bore the surname ''Sabinus'', suggesting that they were of [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin.<ref name=\"CIL 3 14398\"/><ref name=\"AE 1930 109\"/>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe chief praenomen of the Servaei was ''[[Quintus (praenomen)|Quintus]]'', with ''[[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]]'' and ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]'' evidently being used for younger sons.  All were among the most common names throughout Roman history.  Other praenomina occur infrequently.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe earliest of the Servaei to rise to prominence bore no surname.  The first [[cognomen]] to appear among the family is ''Longinus'', a diminutive of ''Longus'', a surname originally designating someone who was tall; Servaeus Longinus may have acquired the surname as the son or grandson of a Servaeus Longus, or because he was moderately tall.<ref name=\"Chase 110\">Chase, p. 110.</ref>  The name does not seem to have been passed down to subsequent generations.  ''Sabinus'', borne by two soldiers, a father and son who served in [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]] during the early second century, probably indicated that the family claimed descent from the Sabines, an ancient people of central Italy, some of whom had migrated to Rome at the time of the city's legendary founding in the eighth century BC.<ref>Chase, pp. 113, 114.</ref>\n\n''Innocens'', borne by the two Servaei, perhaps father and son, who attained the consulship under Domitian and [[Trajan]], indicated someone of blameless character, and belonged to a large class of surnames derived from a person's habits.<ref>Chase, pp. 110, 111.</ref><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.v. innocens''.</ref>  The full nomenclature of the first Innocens is uncertain, but the second, who held office in AD 101, bore the polyonymous appelation of ''Gaius Sertorius Brocchus Quintus Servaeus Innocens'', probably indicating that he was descended from the more illustrious house of the [[Sertoria (gens)|Sertorii]] through a female line.<ref>Salway, ''What's in a Name?'', pp. 131\u2013133.</ref>  Given the high station that this family reached, it seems possible that the Servaei of [[Gigthi]]s in [[Africa Proconsularis]] was descended from them.\n\nThis family seems to have come to prominence with Quintus Servaeus Macer during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]].  His surname, ''Macer'', designated someone who was notably lean, but the chief cognomen of this family seems to have been ''Fuscus'', \"dark\", which would likely have referred to someone with dark brown hair.<ref name=\"Chase 110\"/><ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.v. fuscus''.</ref>  This alternated with ''Firmus'', \"strong\" or \"steadfast\", and ''Felix'', \"happy\" or \"fortunate\".<ref>''New College Latin & English Dictionary'', ''s.vv. firmus, felix''.</ref>  The Servaei Fusci were of [[equites|equestrian]] rank, and seem to have formed part of the nobility of Gigthis, where they served in the local senate, and at least one of them, Quintus Servaeus Fuscus Cornelianus, served in the [[Roman Senate]] and held a number of important positions throughout the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].  Another family of colonial Servaei lived at [[Sbeitla|Sufetula]] in [[Numidia (Roman province)|Numidia]], but it remains unclear whether or how they might have been related to the Fusci.  Some of them bore the surname ''Potitianus'', perhaps commemorating their descent from the ancient [[Potitia (gens)|Potitia gens]].\n\n==Members==\n{{Filiation}}\n\n* [[Quintus Servaeus]], a man of [[praetor]]ian rank, was appointed governor of [[Kingdom of Commagene|Commagene]] in AD 18.  He was among the friends of [[Germanicus]] who accused [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]] of having poisoned the young general.  After the downfall of [[Sejanus]], Servaeus was one of those who were falsely accused of conspiring with the disgraced consul, and condemned; but he avoided execution by giving evidence against Sejanus' accomplices.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', ii. 56, iii. 13, vi. 7.</ref><ref>''PIR'', S. 398.</ref>\n* Servaea \u0186. l.

It is intended to be the third film in [[Sony's Marvel Universe]].<!-- Do NOT change to \"Sony's Universe of Marvel Characters\", as this is not supported by the sourcing. Thank you. --> The film is directed by [[Daniel Espinosa]] from a script by [[Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless|Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpless]] and [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway|Art Marcum & Matt Holloway]], and stars [[Jared Leto]] as Michael Morbius alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]], [[Adria Arjona]], [[Jared Harris]], [[Al Madrigal]], and [[Tyrese Gibson]]. In the film, Morbius turns into a type of vampire after attempting to cure himself of a rare blood disease.\n\nAfter announcing plans for a new shared universe of films inspired by [[Spider-Man]] characters beginning with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' (2018), Sony was revealed to be developing one based on Morbius. Sazama and Sharpless had written a script by November 2017, with Marcum and Holloway joining later. Leto and Espinosa officially joined in June 2018. Work began in earnest at the end of the year with further casting, ahead of a production start in February 2019 in [[London]]. Filming was confirmed to have been completed by June 2019.<!-- The film is the first of Sony's Marvel Universe to include references to [[Spider-Man in film#Licensing agreement with Marvel Studios|the ''Spider-Man'' films]] set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].-->\n\n''Morbius'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 19, 2021, delayed from an initial July 2020 release date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nSuffering from a rare blood disease, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] tries a dangerous cure that afflicts him with a form of [[Vampire|vampirism]].<ref name=\"Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"LetoEspinosa2\" />\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jared Leto]] as [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]]:<br />A scientist suffering from a rare blood disease who attempts to cure himself and instead becomes afflicted with a form of [[Vampire|vampirism]],<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa2\" /> which gives him superhuman abilities but none of the superstitious weaknesses usually associated with vampires.

He expressed interest in taking on the project, and said that if he was to make a film in the superhero genre he would want to make it \"something that's closer to what I get excited about.\"<ref name=\"FuquaApr2018\" /> He ultimately chose not to take on the project.<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" /> Other directors that Sony approached about the film included [[F. Gary Gray]], who considered directing the film but ultimately turned down the role,<ref name=\"GrayTHS\" /> and [[Daniel Espinosa]], who previously directed the film ''[[Life (2017 film)|Life]]'' (2017) for the studio.<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" /> In May, while [[Monolith Tour|on tour in Germany]] with his band [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], Leto met with Espinosa to talk about the film,<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" /> and the pair were both confirmed for the project at the end of June. [[Avi Arad]], [[Matt Tolmach]], and [[Lucas Foster]] were set to produce,<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa2\" /> and Sony was expected to give the film a release date shortly after with filming set to begin by the end of 2018. The studio hoped the film would fit in with its already-set Marvel slate, including ''Venom'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nBy the end of September, Sony was intending for production on the film to take place in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]\u2014where ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) and ''Venom'' were previously produced\u2014but had still not set a release date for the film.<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"AradSep2018\" /> [[Screen Rant]]'s Cooper Hood opined that Sony was likely waiting to see the response to ''Venom'' in early October, with Arad confirming at that time that there was excitement at Sony to produce ''Morbius'', especially due to the story of a \"healer that becomes a killer, and how do you deal with [that?]\"<ref name=\"AradSep2018\" /> Tolmach said the project was \"very far along\" at that stage and they were now planning to begin filming in early 2019,<ref name=\"TolmachSep2018\" /><ref name=\"AradTolmachOct2018\" /> with the intention that ''Morbius'' would be the second film released as part of Sony's shared universe after ''Venom''.<ref name=\"TolmachSep2018\" /> He added that Leto was bringing the same \"intensity\" to the film that he had playing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"LetoIntensitySep2018\" /> By November, box office analysts believed that ''Venom'' had been successful enough for Sony to move ahead with other films like ''Morbius'',<ref name=\"VenomBOSuccess\" /> and at the end of that month the studio dated an untitled Marvel film that was believed to be ''Morbius'' for a July 10, 2020, release.<ref name=\"2020Dates\" /> [[Adria Arjona]] entered negotiations to portray the film's female lead, Martine Bancroft, in December;<ref name=\"Arjona\" /> her involvement was confirmed a month later when Sony pushed the release date to July 31,<ref name=\"SolidDate\" /> and [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] also joined the cast.<ref name=\"Smith\" /><ref name=\"Smith2\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began during the last week of February 2019 in [[London]],<ref name=\"LetoFilmingBegin\" /><ref name=\"LetoLondon\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Plasma''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Oliver Wood (cinematographer)|Oliver Wood]] served as cinematographer for the film.<ref name=\"Wood\" /> With the start of filming, [[Jared Harris]] and [[Tyrese Gibson]] joined the cast as Morbius's mentor and an FBI agent hunting Morbius, respectively.<ref name=\"Harris\" /><ref name=\"Gibson\" /><ref name=\"Gibson2\" /> Smith was revealed to be portraying the villainous Loxias Crown.<ref name=\"Gibson2\" /> In March, filming took place in [[Manchester]]'s [[Northern Quarter (Manchester)|Northern Quarter]], portraying [[New York City]].<ref name=\"ManNQ\" /> A month later, Gibson revealed that he was portraying Simon Stroud, and that [[Al Madrigal]] had been cast as his partner, Alberto Rodriguez.<ref name=\"GibsonAgents\" /> At the end of the month, [[Justin Haythe]] was believed to have contributed to the film's script.<ref name=\"Haythe\" /> Filming was scheduled to take 12 weeks,<ref name=\"LetoFilmingBegin\" /><ref name=\"SmithLAMar2019\" /> and ''Venom'' producer [[Amy Pascal]] said in June that production had \"just wrapped\" on the project.<ref name=\"PascalWrapped\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn September 2019, Sony announced a new agreement with [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]] that extended a previous deal to have [[Marvel Studios]] and its president [[Kevin Feige]] produce a sequel to ''Far From Home'', keeping Spider-Man in Marvel's shared universe, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). As part of the new agreement, Feige stated that moving forward the MCU's Spider-Man would be able to \"cross cinematic universes\" and appear in Sony's own shared universe as well.<ref name=\"SonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> This interaction was said to be \"a 'call and answer' between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe\".<ref name=\"DeadlineSonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> The film's first trailer, released in January 2020, included an image of Spider-Man that commentators equated to the [[Sam Raimi]]-directed ''[[Spider-Man in film#Raimi films|Spider-Man]]'' films though it appeared to be used as a reference to the ending of ''Far From Home''.<ref name=\"SpiderManRef\" /> The trailer also included a brief appearance by [[Michael Keaton]], who previously portrayed [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes / Vulture]] from the co-produced Marvel Studios Spider-Man film, ''Spider-Man: Homecoming''.<ref name=\"Keaton\" /><ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" /> At that time, Sony also revealed that [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway]] had contributed to the film's script.<ref name=\"MarcumHolloway\" />\n\nReshoots for the film had begun in [[Los Angeles]] by early February 2020.<ref name=\"LAReshoots\" /> A month later, as film productions around the United States were halted due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Sony was said to no longer be in production on the film.<ref name=\"DisneyHaltsCoronavirus\" /> At the end of the month, the film's release date was pushed back to March 19, 2021, due to the pandemic closing theaters around the world.<ref name=\"2021Date\" />\n\n== Music==\nBy October 2019, [[Jon Ekstrand]] was set to compose the score for ''Morbius'' after doing the same for Espinosa's previous films.<ref name=\"Ekstrand\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe first trailer for the film was released on January 13, 2020.<ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" /> Julia Alexander at [[The Verge]] described the premise of the film as presented by the trailer as \"ridiculous\",<ref name=\"VergeTrailer\" /> while Matt Goldberg of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] felt it looked \"silly\" and also noted that the film looked very similar to ''Venom'', which he acknowledged was commercially successful.<ref name=\"ColliderTrailer\" /> Scott Mendelson, writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', agreed with the comparison to ''Venom'' which he felt was a good move by Sony due to the success of their last few ''Spider-Man'' films, but cautioned that Leto may not have the same box office draw for general audiences that [[Tom Hardy]] gave to ''Venom''.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> Much of the discussion surrounding the trailer centered on the revelation of Keaton's role and the visual reference to Spider-Man, which led to questions about the film's relationship with the ''Spider-Man'' films and the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref

same name]], produced by [[Columbia Pictures]] in association with [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. It is intended to be the third film in [[Sony's Marvel Universe]].<!-- Do NOT change to \"Sony's Universe of Marvel Characters\", as this is not supported by the sourcing. Thank you. --> The film is directed by [[Daniel Espinosa]] from a script by [[Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless|Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpless]] and [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway|Art Marcum & Matt Holloway]], and stars [[Jared Leto]] as Michael Morbius alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]], [[Adria Arjona]], [[Jared Harris]], [[Al Madrigal]], and [[Tyrese Gibson]]. In the film, Morbius turns into a type of vampire after attempting to cure himself of a rare blood disease.\n\nAfter announcing plans for a new shared universe of films inspired by [[Spider-Man]] characters beginning with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' (2018), Sony was revealed to be developing one based on Morbius. Sazama and Sharpless had written a script by November 2017, with Marcum and Holloway joining later. Leto and Espinosa officially joined in June 2018. Work began in earnest at the end of the year with further casting, ahead of a production start in February 2019 in [[London]]. Filming was confirmed to have been completed by June 2019.<!-- The film is the first of Sony's Marvel Universe to include references to [[Spider-Man in film#Licensing agreement with Marvel Studios|the ''Spider-Man'' films]] set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].-->\n\n''Morbius'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 19, 2021, delayed from an initial July 2020 release date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nSuffering from a rare blood disease, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] tries a dangerous cure that afflicts him with a form of [[Vampire|vampirism]].<ref name=\"Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"LetoEspinosa2\" />\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jared Leto]] as [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]]:<br />A scientist suffering from a rare blood disease who attempts to cure himself and instead becomes afflicted with a form of [[Vampire|vampirism]],<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa2\" /> which gives him superhuman abilities but none of the superstitious weaknesses usually associated with vampires. Leto was drawn to the character's struggle with his disease, and to the moral implications of a person who wants to be a hero but also has a thirst for blood.<ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" />\n* [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as [[Hunger (Marvel Comics)|Loxias Crown]]:<br />Morbius' friend who suffers from the same rare blood disease.<ref name=\"Smith2\" /><ref name=\"Gibson2\" /> Smith joined the film, after previously turning down other superhero film roles, due to director [[Daniel Espinosa]]'s involvement and encouragement from [[Karen Gillan]], who portrays [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and previously worked with Smith on ''[[Doctor Who]]''.<ref name=\"SmithLAMar2019\" />\n* [[Adria Arjona]] as Martine Bancroft: Morbius' fianc\u00e9e.<ref name=\"Arjona\" /><ref name=\"SolidDate\" />\n* [[Jared Harris]] as Morbius' mentor.<ref name=\"Harris\" /><ref name=\"Gibson2\" />\n* [[Al Madrigal]] as Alberto Rodriguez: An FBI agent hunting Morbius.<ref name=\"GibsonAgents\" />\n* [[Tyrese Gibson]] as [[Venom (2018 film)|Simon]] Stroud: An FBI agent hunting Morbius.<ref name=\"Gibson2\" /><ref name=\"GibsonAgents\" /> Gibson signed a three-picture deal when he joined the film.<ref name=\"Gibson3\" />\n*[[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as   [[Spider-Man|Peter Paker/Spider-Man]] :A high-school junior and [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.His appearance in [[Venom (2018 film)]] was deleted.\n*r.\n\nAdditionally, [[Michael Keaton]] will appear in the film. He  portrayed [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes / Vulture]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), and it has been confirmed he is to be reprising that role.\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[Artisan Entertainment]] announced a deal with [[Marvel Entertainment]] in May 2000 to co-produce, finance, and distribute several films based on [[Marvel Comics]] characters, including [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]].<ref name=\"ArtisanDeal\" /> In May 2017, Sony officially announced plans for a new [[shared universe]] named \"[[Sony's Marvel Universe]]\", to feature [[Spider-Man]]-related properties beginning with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' in October 2018.<ref name=\"SonyMU\" /> That November, [[Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless]] submitted a script to Sony for a potential ''Morbius'' film, after a \"secret development process\" at the studio for the character.<ref name=\"WritersNov2017\" /> [[Jared Leto]] became \"loosely attached\" to the project to potentially star in the title role, but would not fully commit to the film until he was happy with the direction it was going; Leto asked to personally meet with several of the directors that Sony was looking at for the film.<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" />\n\nBy the end of April 2018, Sony had approached [[Antoine Fuqua]] about potentially directing the film. He expressed interest in taking on the project, and said that if he was to make a film in the superhero genre he would want to make it \"something that's closer to what I get excited about.\"<ref name=\"FuquaApr2018\" /> He ultimately chose not to take on the project.<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" /> Other directors that Sony approached about the film included [[F. Gary Gray]], who considered directing the film but ultimately turned down the role,<ref name=\"GrayTHS\" /> and [[Daniel Espinosa]], who previously directed the film ''[[Life (2017 film)|Life]]'' (2017) for the studio.<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" /> In May, while [[Monolith Tour|on tour in Germany]] with his band [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], Leto met with Espinosa to talk about the film,<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" /> and the pair were both confirmed for the project at the end of June. [[Avi Arad]], [[Matt Tolmach]], and [[Lucas Foster]] were set to produce,<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa2\" /> and Sony was expected to give the film a release date shortly after with filming set to begin by the end of 2018. The studio hoped the film would fit in with its already-set Marvel slate, including ''Venom'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nBy the end of September, Sony was intending for production on the film to take place in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]\u2014where ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) and ''Venom'' were previously produced\u2014but had still not set a release date for the film.<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"AradSep2018\" /> [[Screen Rant]]'s Cooper Hood opined that Sony was likely waiting to see the response to ''Venom'' in early October, with Arad confirming at that time that there was excitement at Sony to produce ''Morbius'', especially due to the story of a \"healer that becomes a killer, and how do you deal with [that?]\"<ref name=\"AradSep2018\" /> Tolmach said the project was \"very far along\" at that stage and they were now planning to begin filming in early 2019,<ref name=\"TolmachSep2018\" /><ref name=\"AradTolmachOct2018\" /> with the intention that ''Morbius'' would be the second film released as part of Sony's shared universe after ''Venom''.<ref name=\"TolmachSep2018\" /> He added that Leto was bringing the same \"intensity\" to the film that he had playing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"LetoIntensitySep2018\" /> By November, box office analysts believed that ''Venom'' had been successful enough for Sony to move ahead with other films like ''Morbius'',<ref name=\"VenomBOSuccess\" /> and at the end of that month the studio dated an untitled Marvel film that was believed to be ''Morbius'' for a July 10, 2020, release.<ref name=\"2020Dates\" /> [[Adria Arjona]] entered negotiations to portray the film's female lead, Martine Bancroft, in December;<ref name=\"Arjona\" /> her involvement was confirmed a month later when Sony pushed the release date to July 31,<ref name=\"SolidDate\" /> and [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] also joined the cast.<ref name=\"Smith\" /><ref name=\"Smith2\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began during the last week of February 2019 in [[London]],<ref name=\"LetoFilmingBegin\" /><ref name=\"LetoLondon\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Plasma''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Oliver Wood (cinematographer)|Oliver Wood]] served as cinematographer for the film.<ref name=\"Wood\" /> With the start of filming, [[Jared Harris]] and [[Tyrese Gibson]] joined the cast as Morbius's mentor and an FBI agent hunting Morbius, respectively.<ref name=\"Harris\" /><ref name=\"Gibson\" /><ref name=\"Gibson2\" /> Smith was revealed to be portraying the villainous Loxias Crown.<ref name=\"Gibson2\" /> In March, filming took place in [[Manchester]]'s [[Northern Quarter (Manchester)|Northern Quarter]], portraying [[New York City]].<ref name=\"ManNQ\" /> A month later, Gibson revealed that he was portraying Simon Stroud, and that [[Al Madrigal]] had been cast as his partner, Alberto Rodriguez.<ref name=\"GibsonAgents\" /> At the end of the month, [[Justin Haythe]] was believed to have contributed to the film's script.<ref name=\"Haythe\" /> Filming was scheduled to take 12 weeks,<ref name=\"LetoFilmingBegin\" /><ref name=\"SmithLAMar2019\" /> and ''Venom'' producer [[Amy Pascal]] said in June that production had \"just wrapped\" on the project.<ref name=\"PascalWrapped\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn September 2019, Sony announced a new agreement with [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]] that extended a previous deal to have [[Marvel Studios]] and its president [[Kevin Feige]] produce a sequel to ''Far From Home'', keeping Spider-Man in Marvel's shared universe, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). As part of the new agreement, Feige stated that moving forward the MCU's Spider-Man would be able to \"cross cinematic universes\" and appear in Sony's own shared universe as well.<ref name=\"SonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> This interaction was said to be \"a 'call and answer' between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe\".<ref name=\"DeadlineSonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> The film's first trailer, released in January 2020, included an image of Spider-Man that commentators equated to the [[Sam Raimi]]-directed ''[[Spider-Man in film#Raimi films|Spider-Man]]'' films though it appeared to be used as a reference to the ending of ''Far From Home''.<ref name=\"SpiderManRef\" /> The trailer also included a brief appearance by [[Michael Keaton]], who previously portrayed [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes / Vulture]] from the co-produced Marvel Studios Spider-Man film, ''Spider-Man: Homecoming''.<ref name=\"Keaton\" /><ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" /> At that time, Sony also revealed that [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway]] had contributed to the film's script.<ref name=\"MarcumHolloway\" />\n\nReshoots for the film had begun in [[Los Angeles]] by early February 2020.<ref name=\"LAReshoots\" /> A month later, as film productions around the United States were halted due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Sony was said to no longer be in production on the film.<ref name=\"DisneyHaltsCoronavirus\" /> At the end of the month, the film's release date was pushed back to March 19, 2021, due to the pandemic closing theaters around the world.<ref name=\"2021Date\" />\n\n== Music==\nBy October 2019, [[Jon Ekstrand]] was set to compose the score for ''Morbius'' after doing the same for Espinosa's previous films.<ref name=\"Ekstrand\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe first trailer for the film was released on January 13, 2020.<ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" /> Julia Alexander at [[The Verge]] described the premise of the film as presented by the trailer as \"ridiculous\",<ref name=\"VergeTrailer\" /> while Matt Goldberg of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] felt it looked \"silly\" and also noted that the film looked very similar to ''Venom'', which he acknowledged was commercially successful.<ref name=\"ColliderTrailer\" /> Scott Mendelson, writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', agreed with the comparison to ''Venom'' which he felt was a good move by Sony due to the success of their last few ''Spider-Man'' films, but cautioned that Leto may not have the same box office draw for general audiences that [[Tom Hardy]] gave to ''Venom''.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> Much of the discussion surrounding the trailer centered on the revelation of Keaton's role and the visual reference to Spider-Man, which led to questions about the film's relationship with the ''Spider-Man'' films and the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" /><ref name=\"SpiderManRef\" /><ref name=\"VergeTrailer\" /><ref name=\"ColliderTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Morbius'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 19, 2021.<ref name=\"2021Date\" /> It had previously been set by Sony for release on July 10, 2020,<ref name=\"2020Dates\" /><ref name=\"SolidDate\" /> before moving to July 31, 2020.<ref name=\"SolidDate\" /> The film was then delayed to the March 2021 date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"2021Date\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref

First and foremost an [[Abstract art|abstract]] painter, she also pursues numerous projects that investigate the effect and impact of painting in architectural spaces and the process of painting including site-specific settings. Von Gaza lives and works in [[Munich]], Venice and [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]].\n\n== Life ==\nThe [[Hamburg]]-born artist Sylke von Gaza was first taken to Italy as a three-year-old by her great-grandmother, whom she accompanied on long journeys to Venice and the Emilia-Romagna. It was during those childhood visits to the churches of [[Ravenna]], [[Assisi]] and [[Venice]], to name but a few, that she first came to appreciate painting and architecture. The experience made a lasting impression and continues to inspire her work to this day.<ref name=\":10\">Giloy-Hirtz (2008): ''From the Grey to the Colourful.''</ref>\n\nSylke von Gaza's first university degree is in [[engineering|<u>engineering</u>]]. Later, as a student of painting at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts in Munich]] from 2002 to 2007 under the Irish painter [[Sean Scully]], she found herself drawn to the [[Old Master]]s and [[Abstract expressionism]].<ref name=\":4\">Giloy-Hirtz (2008): ''From the Grey to the Colourful'' & Drexler (2013): ''Sylke von Gaza in Conversation''.</ref> She completed her studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich in 2007, graduating with a [[Meistersch\u00fcler]] diploma (\"summa cum laude\").<ref name=\":7\">[http://matrikel.adbk.de/ \"Matrikeldatenbank\"] (in German). Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste M\u00fcnchen. Retrieved 2017-07-24. In the German academy tradition, \"Meistersch\u00fcler\" is the title awarded only to exceptionally talented students who successfully complete a postgraduate masterclass, equal to \"summa cum laude\".</ref>\n\n== Work ==\n[[Art of the Low Countries|Netherlandish]] and [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italian Renaissance]] painting has always been a key source of inspiration for Sylke von Gaza. With her large-scale abstract [[oil painting]]s she positions herself within the tradition of the Old Masters without, however, referencing them directly in her formal language.<ref name=\":4\" /> Oscillating between past and present, Venice provides an ideal creative environment for the artist,<ref name=\":5\" /> whose works not only probe the questions of tradition and [[Identity (social science)|identity]] in painting, but also provoke a discussion of the intrinsic value of art and society.<ref>Schmidt (2007): ''Die Schleier der Sylke von Gaza'' & Giloy-Hirtz (2008): ''From the Grey to the Colourful'' & Drexler (2013): ''Sylke von Gaza in Conversation'' & Sinninghe Damst\u00e9 (2013): ''Sacraments of a Deeper Reality''.</ref>\n\nHer work thus far can be divided into different strands. Her principal body of work consists of ''Early Works'', individual works, themed groups of works, site-specific works and the series of ''Veil Paintings'', among them the ''Grey Veil Paintings'' and ''Red Veil Paintings''.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn Sylke von Gaza's creative practice, the [[veil]], the metaphor for [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] and permeability, plays a central role.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.curator4art.de/sv-gaza.htm|title=Die Schleier der Sylke von Gaza \u2013 Who is afraid of grey, white and red?|last=Martin H.

First and foremost an [[Abstract art|abstract]] painter, she also pursues numerous projects that investigate the effect and impact of painting in architectural spaces and the process of painting including site-specific settings. Von Gaza lives and works in [[Munich]], Venice and [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]].\n\n== Life ==\nThe [[Hamburg]]-born artist Sylke von Gaza was first taken to Italy as a three-year-old by her great-grandmother, whom she accompanied on long journeys to Venice and the Emilia-Romagna. It was during those childhood visits to the churches of [[Ravenna]], [[Assisi]] and [[Venice]], to name but a few, that she first came to appreciate painting and architecture. The experience made a lasting impression and continues to inspire her work to this day.<ref name=\":10\">Giloy-Hirtz (2008): ''From the Grey to the Colourful.''</ref>\n\nSylke von Gaza's first university degree is in [[engineering|<u>engineering</u>]]. Later, as a student of painting at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts in Munich]] from 2002 to 2007 under the Irish painter [[Sean Scully]], she found herself drawn to the [[Old Master]]s and [[Abstract expressionism]].<ref name=\":4\">Giloy-Hirtz (2008): ''From the Grey to the Colourful'' & Drexler (2013): ''Sylke von Gaza in Conversation''.</ref> She completed her studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich in 2007, graduating with a [[Meistersch\u00fcler]] diploma (\"summa cum laude\").<ref name=\":7\">[http://matrikel.adbk.de/ \"Matrikeldatenbank\"] (in German). Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste M\u00fcnchen. Retrieved 2017-07-24. In the German academy tradition, \"Meistersch\u00fcler\" is the titel awarded only to exceptionally talented students who successfully complete a postgraduate masterclass, equal to \"summa cum laude\".</ref>\n\n== Work ==\n[[Art of the Low Countries|Netherlandish]] and [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italian Renaissance]] painting has always been a key source of inspiration for Sylke von Gaza. With her large-scale abstract [[oil painting]]s she positions herself within the tradition of the Old Masters without, however, referencing them directly in her formal language.<ref name=\":4\" /> Oscillating between past and present, Venice provides an ideal creative environment for the artist,<ref name=\":5\" /> whose works not only probe the questions of tradition and [[Identity (social science)|identity]] in painting, but also provoke a discussion of the intrinsic value of art and society.<ref>Schmidt (2007): ''Die Schleier der Sylke von Gaza'' & Giloy-Hirtz (2008): ''From the Grey to the Colourful'' & Drexler (2013): ''Sylke von Gaza in Conversation'' & Sinninghe Damst\u00e9 (2013): ''Sacraments of a Deeper Reality''.</ref>\n\nHer work thus far can be divided into different strands. Her principal body of work consists of ''Early Works'', individual works, themed groups of works, site-specific works and the series of ''Veil Paintings'', among them the ''Grey Veil Paintings'' and ''Red Veil Paintings''.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn Sylke von Gaza's creative practice, the [[veil]], the metaphor for [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] and permeability, plays a central role.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.curator4art.de/sv-gaza.htm|title=Die Schleier der Sylke von Gaza \u2013 Who is afraid of grey, white and red?|last=Martin H.
