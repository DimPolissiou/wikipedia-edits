Its mission is to guard and protect the sovereignty of [[Bulgaria]]n airspace, to provide aerial support and to assist the Land Forces in case of war. The Bulgarian Air Force is one of the oldest [[air force]]s in [[Europe]] and the world. In recent times it has been actively taking part in numerous [[NATO]] missions and [[military exercise|exercises]] in [[Europe]].\nThe current commanding officer of the Bulgarian Air Force is [[Major General]] Constantin Popov.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Masl.jpg|left|thumb|Boris Maslennikov's airplane in flight, Sofia 1910]]\n\nThe Bulgarian Air Force dates back to the end of the 19th century. At the 1892 [[Plovdiv International Fair]], two lieutenants of the [[Bulgarian Army]] flew in the 'La France' [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] owned by the Frenchman [[Eug\u00e8ne Godard]].<ref name=bulg1>Nedialkov, D. \"Air Power of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Part I\"</ref> Later, inspired by the flight, they succeeded in convincing the Bulgarian General Staff that the Army should build a balloon force. Despite numerous refusals from military schools around Europe who would not teach Bulgarian officers to use airships, eventually the Imperial Aviation School in [[St. Petersburg]] enrolled Lieutenant Vasil Zlatarov as a student. On 20 April 1906 \"Vazduhoplavatelno Otdelenie\" (roughly translated as Aviation Squad) was created to operate observation balloons for the Army, initially as a part of Railway Battalion.<ref name=bulg1/> After graduation Lt. Zlatarov was appointed its first commander. After operating small balloons, in 1911 a bigger Godard balloon was bought, and in 1912 the first indigenous balloon, Sofia-1, was constructed in Bulgaria using materials bought from [[Russia]].<ref name=bulg1/>\n\nIn 1910 a Russian aircraft engineer, Boris Maslennikov, was invited to [[Bulgaria]], where he presented his airplane, a modification of the French [[Farman III]]. Following his demonstration, assisted by Vasil Zlatarov over the hippodrome in [[Sofia]], the Bulgarian Government decided to acquire airplanes for The Aviation Corps. In early 1912 thirteen army officers were sent abroad for training as pilots and orders were placed for five French, British and German airplanes.<ref name=bulg1/> The officers sent to France completed their training first and returned to Bulgaria in July 1912. The same year Bulgaria received its first airplane \u2013 a [[Bleriot XXI]], which Simeon Petrov flew on 13 August 1912 to become the first Bulgarian to pilot an airplane over Bulgaria.<ref name=bulg1/>\n\n===First and Second Balkan Wars===\n[[File:Bleriot XI - Simeon Petrov.jpg|right|thumb|[[Simon Petrov]] in a Bleriot XI 1912]]\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]], Bulgarian pilots still abroad hastily procured aircraft to be shipped home after them and foreign volunteer pilots converged from all over Europe to fly for Bulgaria.<ref name=\"aeroflight.co.uk\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/bulgaria/af/bulgaf_narrative_history.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019132330/http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/bulgaria/af/bulgaf_narrative_history.htm |archive-date=19 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> After the front lines had stabilized, an Aeroplane Platoon was established at a new airfield close to the fighting.<ref name=\"aeroflight.co.uk\"/>\n\nIntelligence about the [[Turkish army]] strength and dispositions in the [[Edirne]] was required, and on [[1912 in aviation|16 October 1912]], two aviators performed a reconnaissance flight over the city in an [[Farman III|Albatros F.2]] biplane, also dropping two bombs. This was not only the first military mission performed by a Bulgarian aircraft, but also the first combat use of an aircraft in Europe and one of the first bombing attacks.<ref name=bulg1/><ref>Rajlich, Boshniakov and Mandjukov, 2002, p.68</ref>\n\nLater that month the Bulgarian Aviation Corps was expanded to three Aeroplane Platoons. Foreign volunteers began flying operational sorties alongside Bulgarian pilots and carried out [[reconnaissance]], leaflet-dropping and bombing missions. During the war at least three aircraft were shot down. Considerable help was received from the Russians in terms of aircraft, maintenance and training. Due to low aircraft serviceability and frequent accidents, the number of missions flown was relatively low. Despite that, the Bulgarian airmen and their foreign allies were able to gather enough intelligence for the Army General Staff to help successfully capture of the city after a long [[Siege of Adrianople (1912\u201313)|siege]]. Although inflicting little physical damage, the bombs had a devastating effect on the defending Turkish garrison's morale and played a crucial part in the fall of the city, which was until then considered nearly impregnable.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\nDuring the First Balkan War Bulgarian aviation undertook 70 combat sorties, including 11 bombing raids, during the Second Balkan War it undertook 6 sorties.<ref name=bulg1/> All in all, during both wars, there were over 230 aircraft sorties, including non-combat flights.<ref name=bulg1/> In addition to the Albatros F.2, Bulgaria flew [[Bl\u00e9riot XI]] and [[Bl\u00e9riot XXI|XXI]], [[Bristol Prier monoplane|Bristol Prier]], Farman VII and [[Nieuport IV]] aircraft, as well as examples provided by Sommer and Voisin.<ref name=bulg1/>\n\n===World War I (1914\u20131918)===\n====Army air action====\nThe [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] entered [[World War I]] as an ally of the [[Central Powers]] on 4 October 1915. The Aeroplane Section of the Bulgarian Army was reformed with assistance from Germany and Austria.<ref>Wragg, 2002, p.21</ref> Aircraft were deployed to [[Kumanovo]] Airfield in support of advancing Bulgarian forces, but bad weather initially prevented any flying. Until then they had completed 11 combat sorties from an airfield in [[Sofia]] (now the central railway station).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} As the frontline advanced, the unit re-deployed to airfields near Belitsa and [[Xanthi]], in modern [[Greece]]. Newly acquired German [[LVG]] aircraft were hastily pressed into action.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Two more airfields were constructed near Udovo and Levunovo. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] began flying reconnaissance and bomber sorties against Bulgarian units on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Southern Balkan Front]]. Throughout World War I Bulgarian military aviation experienced a steady increase in both numbers and quality of aircraft; however, they remained inferior to those flown by the Allies, especially the British and French. The First Aeroplane Section (the country's only aircraft unit) was attached to the Second Bulgarian Army. It flew 255 sorties compared to 397 flown by the four squadrons of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] it opposed, and operated the following types:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n* 12 [[LVG B.II]] \u2013 reconnaissance aircraft, the first group of six arriving in November 1915. Those two seaters were also used as fighters by the Bulgarians, as dedicated \"scouts\" were not available.\n* 13 [[Otto C.I]] \u2013 a twin-tailed pusher bomber. The first Otto in arrived in May 1916.\n* 18 [[Albatros C.III]] \u2013 reconnaissance aircraft, also used as trainers. First delivery in August 1916.\n* 12 [[DFW C.V]] \u2013 reconnaissance aircraft, first arrived in August 1917.\n* 6 [[Roland D.II]] fighters. During July 1917 the first of these arrived with the Section.\n* 6 [[Roland D.III]] fighters, the first arriving at the end of 1917.\n* 3 [[Fokker E.III]] fighters, first of these delivered in the spring of 1916.\n* 8 [[Fokker D.VII]] \u2013 the best fighter used by Bulgaria in World War I. Delivery took place in September 1918 and they saw no action. 7 were scrapped in accordance with the peace treaty. The 8th flew as a two-seater after the war.\n* 2 [[Albatros C.I]]. These were ordered by the Ottoman Empire before Bulgaria entered the war. During early 1915 a couple landed on then neutral Bulgarian territory after a navigational error, and they were seized.\n\nIn addition, the Bulgarian Navy used the following airplanes:\n* 8 [[Friedrichshafen FF.33]] floatplane bombers, starting in 1916\n* 2 [[Rumpler 6B|Rumpler 6B1]] floatplane fighters, starting in 1916\n\nA number of Bulgarian pilots flew with German air units at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and at Xanthi. They operated several types, including the [[Albatros D.III]] and Halberstadt, which would later mistakenly be listed on the Bulgarian inventory by some sources.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=====Captured Allied aircraft=====\n[[File:Armstrong-Whitworth FK3 captured.jpg|thumb|left|Bulgarian airmen in captured British [[Armstrong Whitworth FK.3]]]]\nOn 30 September 1916 a French [[Farman F.40]] bomber of Escadrille 384 was tasked with attacking the Bulgarian capital, [[Sofia]]. Two Bulgarian [[Fokker E.III]]s were positioned south of Sofia to intercept the intruder, while a flight of three armed Albatros C.III two-seat trainers covered the center of the city as backup. The bomber successfully dropped its bombs over Sofia while escaping anti-aircraft fire but, while departing, was attacked by the Bulgarian Fokkers, one piloted by Marko Parvanov, which brought the Farman down with a dead engine.<ref>Nedialkov, 2001</ref>\n\nAnother Allied aircraft, a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Armstrong Whitworth F.K.3]], was captured by Bulgarian troops on 12 February 1917 after engine problems forced it to land. Both it and the crew were captured. It would receive Bulgarian insignia and be used to bomb Allied positions at night. Four such sorties were flown before being shot down on 23 May 1918.<ref>Tapper, 1973, p.57</ref>\n\nA [[Nieuport 24bis]] and a [[Nieuport 27]] were also captured. Lieutenant Vladimir Balan, a Bulgarian fighter pilot who had been flying with a German Jasta on the Western Front, was flying one of the Nieuports when he shot down the squadron leader of [[No. 17 Squadron RAF]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Naval air action====\nBulgarian naval aviators also played an important role in the air war. In 1912 [[Petty-Officer]]s Lyapchev and Mikhailov were sent, along with other officers and seamen, to the German naval aviation forming facilities for training. Another group of naval personnel followed in the beginning of the First World War. Training was held at List, Nordenhai and Kiel. In November 1915 a [[seaplane station]] under German control was established near [[Varna]], initially operating four Friedrichshafen FF.33 bombers and a Rumpler 6B1 fighter. Later, at the coast of the Varna Lake, a second [[seaplane]] station was built (this one under Bulgarian control), operating the same inventory. Near [[Sozopol]] a forward fuel and ammunition replenishment base was established in support of patrol flights over the southern Bulgarian coastline. At the end of 1917 the German station was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy. At the time of the armistice the Bulgarian fleet air arm comprised two seaplane stations, a forward replenishment base, three hangars, three workshops, ammunition warehouses and 10 seaplanes. After the cease-fire the machines were used for mine reconnaissance. At the end of 1919 they are transported by train to [[Bozhurishte]] Airfield to be scrapped along with the army aviation inventory.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Bulgarian balloon observers also took part in the war. They were most active on the [[Dobruja|Dobrudzha]] Front, where aircraft activities were scarce (a German bomber squadron, flying missions against [[Bucharest]] and [[Constan\u0163a]]: \"Gotha\" bombers accounted for the most flights). Near the Bulgarian city of [[Yambol]] an [[airship hangar]] was constructed to house German airships. The airship Sch\u00fctte-Lanz SL 10 was the first to use it. According to documents of the time it was assigned to the Bulgarian Army, but was actually under German control. It was lost during a flight over the [[Black Sea]] in July 1916. In August 1916 the LZ 101 replaced it. After performing raids on targets in Romania and Greece it returned to Germany in August 1917. In November 1917 the naval airship [[Zeppelin LZ104|L 59]] arrived. That airship flew a series of remarkable missions, such as an attempted resupply of the garrison in the colony [[German East Africa]] and the bombing of [[Naples]] and [[Port Said]]. During a mission against the British naval base in [[Malta]], a lightning strike over the [[Mediterranean Sea]] set it alight and completely destroyed it. All hands were lost.<ref name=\"Fallschirmjaeger\">Rumen Kirilov, Ivan Borislavov, \"The Bulgarian Aviation in the Chains of the Neuilly Peace Treaty\", in: \"Klub Krile Magazine\", special, Vol. 11, 1999, \"Air Group 2000\" Publishing, Sofia, Bulgaria</ref>\n\n===Destruction and survival under the peace treaty (1919\u20131936)===\nOn 4 October 1918 the Bulgarian Tsar issued a Royal Act of Demobilization. This resulted in military aviation being converted to its peacetime structure.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The Aeroplane group, based in Bozhurishte comprised the following: \n* Two aeroplane companies\n* An aeroplane school\n* An aeroplane atelli\u00e9r\n* An aeroplane depot\nThe Chaika Naval Seaplane station at Varna was under Naval command.\n\nOn 27 November 1919 the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]] was signed. In accordance with the [[treaty]] the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] was banned from operating [[military aircraft]] under any form for the next 20 years. All Bulgarian airplanes, balloons, aviation equipment, weaponry and ammunition were to be destroyed under Allied control and all personnel demobilised.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Bulgarian Treaty|journal=Flight|volume=11|number=39|date=September 1919|page=1284|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201282.html|accessdate=16 May 2019}}</ref> Under the terms of the treaty any aircraft procured for civilian purposes had to be bought from the countries on the winning side. The combined engine power for any airplane (including multi-engined ones) was not to exceed 180&nbsp;hp. In addition, the Bulgarian airspace was to be controlled by the allies and used according to the victorious countries' interests.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn accordance with the treaty during 1920 no less than 70 [[airplanes]], 110 [[aircraft engines]], 3 air balloons, 76 [[machine guns]], a number of photographic [[camera]]s and other aviation equipment were destroyed at the [[military airfield]] of Bozhurishte. The [[seaplanes]] of the [[Bulgarian Navy]] were delivered by train to the same airfield and scrapped soon after that.\n\n[[File:Dar10.jpg|thumb|right|A Bulgarian-manufactured [[DAR-10]] training plane. DAR produced small numbers of locally designed aircraft]]\n\nDue to the devotion of the Air Troops personnel and the help of the population of the surrounding villages, several aircraft were hidden, thus evading Allied inspection following destruction. Seven DFW C.V, Albatros C.III and a single Fokker D.VII were among the survivors. In addition, at least ten aviation engines ([[Benz Bz.IV]] and [[Mercedes D.III]]) were also saved.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Bulgarian government tried to get around the ban for military flight activity by establishing a Gendarmery Aeroplane Section in 1919. Since the Gendarmery was at that time a service under the Ministry of War, the creation of the unit was met by fierce opposition by the Allied commission. This almost resulted in the destruction of the whole [[Sofia Airport|Vrazhdebna Airfield]], but the disbandment of the unit prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAn Aeroflight Section under the Ministry of [[Railway]]s, [[Postal Service]] and [[Telegraph]] was created in 1920. Bulgarian aviation personnel assembled two airplanes from hidden spares and parts, salvaged from the destroyed military airplanes. The two aircraft, known as \"the mixed planes\", recorded about 1000 flight hours altogether. The sole remaining Bulgarian Fokker D.VII was disguised as a two-seater, thus being classified as a trainer and returning to active service.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn 5 July 1923 Bulgaria ratified the International Civil Aviation Treaty. From that moment on its air vehicles would carry a registration in the form B-B??? (the latter three signs being a combination of capital letters). In 1923 the first group of cadets, called \"student-flyers\" entered the Flying school at Vrazhdebna AF.\n\nThe following year (1924) the first new airplanes were acquired. Those were machines of the [[Potez VIII]], [[Caudron C.59]], Henriot XD.14 and Bristol 29 Tourer types; [[Avro 522]] seaplanes were also procured. During the same year the Bulgarian airplane construction specialist Atanas Grigorov (who obtained his qualification at the \"Albatroswerke \u2013 Berlin\") assembled his seaplane, called \"Grigorov-1\". The aircraft made several test-flights, recording excellent characteristics, but was damaged beyond repair by a storm in the hangar where it was stationed. Also in 1924 the Aeroplane Section was expanded to an Aeroflight Directorate still under the Ministry of Railways, Postal Service and Telegraph.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n1925 saw the [[Potez XVII]], [[Bristol Primary Trainer|Bristol Lucifer]] and [[Alenia Aermacchi|Macchi]] 2000/18 flying boat boosting the country's aircraft inventory. The Bulgarian government invited a group of German aircraft engineers, headed by the constructor Herr Hermann Winter to help establish an aviation factory. Named The State's Aeroconstruction Atelli\u00e9r or [[Darzhavna Aeroplanna Rabotilnitsa]] (DAR) the factory was initially managed by the first Bulgarian pilot to achieve an aerial victory \u2013 Mr. Marko Parvanov. The first aircraft types produced at the plant were the U-1 or \"Uzounov-1\" (an indigenous variant of the wartime German DFW C.V) and the [[DAR 2]] (an indigenous variant of the German [[Albatros C.III]] of the same era). Both types became well-known and loved by the personnel of the former Air Troops and gained Bulgarian combat service experience.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Development of a new type \u2013 the [[DAR 1]] \u2013 was also started.\n\n[[File:Stele-Plovdiv.jpg|thumb|right|One of the eagles that decorated the entrance of [[Bozhurishte Air Base]] in the 1930s and 1940s, now preserved at the [[Plovdiv Museum of Aviation]]]]\n\nDuring the course of 1926 the Airplane School was moved to the geographical center of the country. The town of [[Kazanlak]] was well suited, for it was far away from the Allied Control Commission. The [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] company [[Aero Vodochody]] also built an aircraft factory near that city, but its models were not up to the requirements of the Bulgarian authorities. After an unsuccessful switch to automotive production, the plant was finally sold to the Italian [[Caproni]] company. The factory became popular as \"Balgarski Kaproni\" or \"Bulgarian Caproni\". The first examples of the DAR 1 biplane were produced and entered service with the Aeroflight Directorate during 1926.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe 1927 structure of the Directorate was the following:\n* A fighter yato,<ref group=\"NOTE\">The Bulgarian word \"yato\" means a \"flock of birds\" and was the Bulgarian equivalent of an air force squadron at the time</ref> flying the DAR 1\n* A bomber yato, flying the DAR U-1 and DAR 2\n* A recon yato, flying the Potez XVII\n* A seaplane yato, flying Avro 522 floatplanes and Macchi 2000/18 flying boats\n* An aeroplane school, flying the [[Caudron C.59]], the [[Hanriot HD.14]] and the \u0160molnik \u0160.18\n\nIn 1928 the Ministry of War started the ambitious 10-year program for development of the military aviation (still banned by the peace treaty). According to the plan the following structure had to be achieved:\n* 4 army fighter orlyaks,<ref group=\"NOTE\">The Bulgarian word \"orlyak\" used here means a \"Air Group\"</ref> each made of two yatos, or overall 8 yatos flying 96 fighter planes\n* 4 army recon orlyaks, each made of two yatos, or overall 8 yatos flying 96 recon planes\n* 18 divisionary recon yatos, basically air support aviation, each flying 12 planes or 216 planes altogether\n* Strike Aviation Brigade with:\n** Fighter Orlyak of 48 machines\n** Bomber Orlyak of 36 machines\n** Recon Orlyak of 2 machines\n* Maritime Orlyak\n** 2 seaplane fighter yatos, flying 24 fighters\n** 2 seaplane bomber yatos, flying 18 bombers\n\nIn 1931 Bulgaria signed the Warsaw Treaty, concerning international civil air activities and the country was assigned the new civil registration \u2013 LZ-??? (the latter three signs being a combination of capital letters). In 1933 the Bulgarian Council of Ministers approved the following wartime order of battle of the aviation:\n* a mixed orlyak of:\n** a fighter yato\n** a bomber yato\n** a recon yato\n** a liaison and photographic survey yato\n* a maritime yato\n* a training orlyak\n* a Pilot School at Kazanlak airfield\n* a balloon company (which was never actually created, as the balloon was considered obsolete for military purposes at the time).\nBulgaria started acquiring German, Czechoslovak and Polish airplanes.\n\nIn 1934 the Aviation Regiment was renamed His Majesty's Air Troops, comprising a headquarters, with two army orlyaks (based at [[Bozhurishte]] and [[Plovdiv]] airfields), a training orlyak (in [[Plovdiv]]), a maritime yato (at NAS Chaika, Varna) and additional operational support units. Colonel Ivan Mikhailov was appointed the first chief of the air force with Lieutenant-Colonel Georgi Vasilev appointed as his Deputy.<ref name=\"Fallschirmjaeger\"/>\n\n===Years of Rebirth (1937\u20131939)===\n[[File:Roundel of Bulgaria (1937-1941).svg|right|thumb|160px|Insignia from 1937 to 1941, also the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Bulgaria|Medal of Bravery]]]]\n\nThe first combat aircraft that entered service in the reestablished air force in 1937 were 12 [[Arado Ar 65]] fighters, 12 [[Heinkel He 51]] fighters, 12 [[Dornier Do 11]] bombers and 12 [[Heinkel He 45]]B reconnaissance aircraft.

A month later Boris III himself presented the Bulgarian air regiments with their new combat flags at an official ceremony at Vrazhdebna Airfield.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn 1937 14 [[PZL P.24]]B fighters and 12 [[PZL.43]]A light bombers were ordered from Poland, with deliveries starting later that year, while in 1938, orders were placed for 42 more PZL.43B light bombers and 12 PZL.24F fighters, which differed from the earlier aircraft in having more powerful engines.<ref name=\"AE39 p63\">Green and Swanborough, 1989, p. 63.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Third Reich]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupied]] [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938, the Czechoslovak air force was broken up. Bulgaria used the opportunity to acquire large numbers of relatively modern ex-Czech aircraft from the Germans at a bargain price. Bulgaria purchased 78 [[Avia B-534]] biplane fighters, 32 Avia B.71 bombers (a license version of the [[Tupolev SB|Soviet SB]] bomber), 12 [[Bloch MB.200]] bombers, 62 [[Letov \u0160-28|Letov \u0160-328]] reconnaissance aircraft and 28 [[Avia B.122|Avia Bs.122]] trainers.<ref name=\"AE39 p64-5\">Green and Swanborough, 1989, pp. 64\u201365.</ref> Deliveries of the second batch of Polish orders started in early 1939, with 33 PZL.43Bs and 8 PZL.11Fs delivered before the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]] stopped deliveries (although two more PZL.43Bs were delivered by the Germans later).<ref name=\"AE39 p66\">Green and Swanborough, 1989, p. 66.</ref> In less than 3 years the Air Force inventory had grown up to 478 aircraft of which 135 were of Bulgarian construction.\n\n===World War II (1939\u20131945)===\nAt the beginning of [[World War II]], the combat air fleet comprised 374 machines in various roles.

Each orlyak had a fighter, a line bomber and two reconnaissance yatos (Squadrons). There was also an Independent Aviation corps, which combined the 5th Bomber and 6th Fighter Regiments. The training units consisted of the \"Junker\" School Orlyak at [[Vrazhdebna]] airfield, the 2nd Training Orlyak at Telish airfield (called the Blind Flying Training School) and the 3rd Training Orlyak at [[Stara Zagora]] airfield. In 1940, the Bulgarian aviation industry provided the air force with 42 [[DAR 9 Siniger]] and 45 [[Caproni Ca.113|Kaproni-Bulgarski KB-5 Chuchuliga]] aircraft, along with preparing for serial production of the [[Caproni Ca.309|KB-6]] \u2013 Bulgaria's first twin-engined aircraft.

At the Black Sea shores the \"Galata\" Fighter Orlyak was established at [[NAS Chaika]], [[Varna]], with the 10 Bf 109E-4s and 6 Avia B.534s. The S.328s were also used for anti-submarine patrols over the [[Black Sea]], flying out of the [[Sarafovo]] and [[Balchik]] airfields. At the end of 1941 the inventory of His Majesty's Air Troops consisted of 609 aircraft of 40 different types.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn 22 June 1941, [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded the Soviet Union]], but Bulgaria refused to take part, although it did declare war with Great Britain and the United States of America in December 1941. Bulgaria's inaction against the Soviet Union meant that supplies of German aircraft slowed to a trickle, with only four aircraft delivered from January to September 1942.<ref name=\"apap72 p141\">Bateson, April 1972, p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe war declared by the Kingdom of Bulgaria against the US and Great Britain was a tragedy for the little country. The city of Sofia and Bulgarian towns and villages were hit by air strikes in late 1943 and in 1944. In all, 187 inhabited places were attacked, 45,000 destructive and incendiary bombs were dropped. There were about 2,000 casualties, and about 4700 wounded, 12,000 damaged or ruined buildings and the total losses were estimated at nearly 24 billion dollars. For the citizens of Sofia, the \"Black\" days were 14 and 24 November, 10 and 20 December 1943, and 10 January and 16, 24, 30 March and 17 April 1944 when large formations of [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] and B-24 bombers ruined parts of the capital city including the central area. The Bulgarians also see successes. On 1 August 1943, an enormous armada of about 700 American [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers flew over several Balkan countries their way to bomb \"the taproot of German might\", the giant oil refineries at [[Ploie\u0219ti]], Romania.<ref>Dugan and Stewart, 2002, pp. 202-203; Stout, 2011, pp. 68-70, 180\u2013185</ref> Termed [[Operation Tidal Wave]], the aircraft flew over Bulgarian territory and Bulgarian fighter pilots Sub-lieutenant Peter Bochev (5 victories), Captain Tschudomir Toplodolski (4 victories), Lieutenant Stoyan Stoyanov (5 victories) and Sublieutenant Hristo Krastev (1 victory) inflicted heavy losses on the bombers.<ref>Rajlich, Boshniakov and Mandjukov, 2002, p. 75</ref>\n\nIn total, about 23,000 enemy sorties were registered over Bulgaria in the years 1943\u20131944. Bulgarian pilots fought an enemy outnumbering them by 10 to 50 times.

The force expanded rapidly with deliveries of different types of combat aircraft. The first shipments of Soviet equipment arrived immediately after the end of World War II, mostly consisting of propeller-driven aircraft, such as the [[Ilyushin Il-2]] (120 Il-2 and 10 Il-2U), the [[Ilyushin Il-10]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-2]]. By 1954, these types were being withdrawn from service, as the [[Korean War]] marked the beginning of the jet fighter era and in 1955 a new wave of deliveries began, starting with the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Migs in Bulgaria|journal=Flight|date=13 May 1955|volume=67|number=2416|page=604|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1955/1955%20-%200604.html|accessdate=16 May 2019}}</ref> Later additions included [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]] fighters and [[Ilyushin Il-28]] bombers, as well as the [[Mil Mi-1]], the first helicopter.

The MiG-21s in service were scheduled to be replaced with possible American or European aircraft. \nOn 11 November 2016, the Bulgarian government signed a 21.8-million euro contract for 10 MiG-29 engines (four new and six repaired), with the first pair scheduled to arrive by April 2017. The deal would eventually bring the number of active service MiG-29 aircraft from 9 to 14, as Bulgaria also announced it was looking to overhaul the fleet and buy eight new or second-hand fighter jets during the coming year. <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-defence-idUSKBN1351ND |title=Bulgaria signs deal to buy 10 Russian engines for aging fleet (Reuters, November 11, 2016) |access-date=2 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305001333/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-defence-idUSKBN1351ND |archive-date=5 March 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref>As of January 2020, the Bulgarian government has plans to aquire the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16V Block 70]] aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.flightglobal.com/fixed-wing/bulgarian-parliament-clears-f-16v-buy-for-second-time/133717.article |title= Bulgarian parliament clears F-16V buy for second time |publisher= flightglobal.com |date=|accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref>\n=== Current inventory ===\n[[File:Bulgarian mig-29 (altered).jpg|thumb|right|A MiG-29A in flight]]\n[[File:Bulgarian Air Force Airbus A319 Milinkovic.jpg|thumb|right|Bulgaria's Presidential flight]]\n[[File:Mil Mi-24 belly.jpg|thumb|right|A Mi-24 in flight]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align:center;

Its mission is to guard and protect the sovereignty of [[Bulgaria]]n airspace, to provide aerial support and to assist the Land Forces in case of war. The Bulgarian Air Force is one of the oldest [[air force]]s in [[Europe]] and the world. In recent times it has been actively taking part in numerous [[NATO]] missions and [[military exercise|exercises]] in [[Europe]].\nThe current commanding officer of the Bulgarian Air Force is [[Major General]] Constantin Popov.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Masl.jpg|left|thumb|Boris Maslennikov's airplane in flight, Sofia 1910]]\n\nThe Bulgarian Air Force dates back to the end of the 19th century. At the 1892 [[Plovdiv International Fair]], two lieutenants of the [[Bulgarian Army]] flew in the 'La France' [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] owned by the Frenchman [[Eug\u00e8ne Godard]].<ref name=bulg1>Nedialkov, D. \"Air Power of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Part I\"</ref> Later, inspired by the flight, they succeeded in convincing the Bulgarian General Staff that the Army should build a balloon force. Despite numerous refusals from military schools around Europe who would not teach Bulgarian officers to use airships, eventually the Imperial Aviation School in [[St. Petersburg]] enrolled Lieutenant Vasil Zlatarov as a student. On 20 April 1906 \"Vazduhoplavatelno Otdelenie\" (roughly translated as Aviation Squad) was created to operate observation balloons for the Army, initially as a part of Railway Battalion.<ref name=bulg1/> After graduation Lt. Zlatarov was appointed its first commander. After operating small balloons, in 1911 a bigger Godard balloon was bought, and in 1912 the first indigenous balloon, Sofia-1, was constructed in Bulgaria using materials bought from [[Russia]].<ref name=bulg1/>\n\nIn 1910 a Russian aircraft engineer, Boris Maslennikov, was invited to [[Bulgaria]], where he presented his airplane, a modification of the French [[Farman III]]. Following his demonstration, assisted by Vasil Zlatarov over the hippodrome in [[Sofia]], the Bulgarian Government decided to acquire airplanes for The Aviation Corps. In early 1912 thirteen army officers were sent abroad for training as pilots and orders were placed for five French, British and German airplanes.<ref name=bulg1/> The officers sent to France completed their training first and returned to Bulgaria in July 1912. The same year Bulgaria received its first airplane \u2013 a [[Bleriot XXI]], which Simeon Petrov flew on 13 August 1912 to become the first Bulgarian to pilot an airplane over Bulgaria.<ref name=bulg1/>\n\n===First and Second Balkan Wars===\n[[File:Bleriot XI - Simeon Petrov.jpg|right|thumb|[[Simon Petrov]] in a Bleriot XI 1912]]\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]], Bulgarian pilots still abroad hastily procured aircraft to be shipped home after them and foreign volunteer pilots converged from all over Europe to fly for Bulgaria.<ref name=\"aeroflight.co.uk\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/bulgaria/af/bulgaf_narrative_history.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019132330/http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/bulgaria/af/bulgaf_narrative_history.htm |archive-date=19 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> After the front lines had stabilized, an Aeroplane Platoon was established at a new airfield close to the fighting.<ref name=\"aeroflight.co.uk\"/>\n\nIntelligence about the [[Turkish army]] strength and dispositions in the [[Edirne]] was required, and on [[1912 in aviation|16 October 1912]], two aviators performed a reconnaissance flight over the city in an [[Farman III|Albatros F.2]] biplane, also dropping two bombs. This was not only the first military mission performed by a Bulgarian aircraft, but also the first combat use of an aircraft in Europe and one of the first bombing attacks.<ref name=bulg1/><ref>Rajlich, Boshniakov and Mandjukov, 2002, p.68</ref>\n\nLater that month the Bulgarian Aviation Corps was expanded to three Aeroplane Platoons. Foreign volunteers began flying operational sorties alongside Bulgarian pilots and carried out [[reconnaissance]], leaflet-dropping and bombing missions. During the war at least three aircraft were shot down. Considerable help was received from the Russians in terms of aircraft, maintenance and training. Due to low aircraft serviceability and frequent accidents, the number of missions flown was relatively low. Despite that, the Bulgarian airmen and their foreign allies were able to gather enough intelligence for the Army General Staff to help successfully capture of the city after a long [[Siege of Adrianople (1912\u201313)|siege]]. Although inflicting little physical damage, the bombs had a devastating effect on the defending Turkish garrison's morale and played a crucial part in the fall of the city, which was until then considered nearly impregnable.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\nDuring the First Balkan War Bulgarian aviation undertook 70 combat sorties, including 11 bombing raids, during the Second Balkan War it undertook 6 sorties.<ref name=bulg1/> All in all, during both wars, there were over 230 aircraft sorties, including non-combat flights.<ref name=bulg1/> In addition to the Albatros F.2, Bulgaria flew [[Bl\u00e9riot XI]] and [[Bl\u00e9riot XXI|XXI]], [[Bristol Prier monoplane|Bristol Prier]], Farman VII and [[Nieuport IV]] aircraft, as well as examples provided by Sommer and Voisin.<ref name=bulg1/>\n\n===World War I (1914\u20131918)===\n====Army air action====\nThe [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] entered [[World War I]] as an ally of the [[Central Powers]] on 4 October 1915. The Aeroplane Section of the Bulgarian Army was reformed with assistance from Germany and Austria.<ref>Wragg, 2002, p.21</ref> Aircraft were deployed to [[Kumanovo]] Airfield in support of advancing Bulgarian forces, but bad weather initially prevented any flying. Until then they had completed 11 combat sorties from an airfield in [[Sofia]] (now the central railway station).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} As the frontline advanced, the unit re-deployed to airfields near Belitsa and [[Xanthi]], in modern [[Greece]]. Newly acquired German [[LVG]] aircraft were hastily pressed into action.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Two more airfields were constructed near Udovo and Levunovo. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] began flying reconnaissance and bomber sorties against Bulgarian units on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Southern Balkan Front]]. Throughout World War I Bulgarian military aviation experienced a steady increase in both numbers and quality of aircraft; however, they remained inferior to those flown by the Allies, especially the British and French. The First Aeroplane Section (the country's only aircraft unit) was attached to the Second Bulgarian Army. It flew 255 sorties compared to 397 flown by the four squadrons of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] it opposed, and operated the following types:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n* 12 [[LVG B.II]] \u2013 reconnaissance aircraft, the first group of six arriving in November 1915.

Two Bulgarian [[Fokker E.III]]s were positioned south of Sofia to intercept the intruder, while a flight of three armed Albatros C.III two-seat trainers covered the center of the city as backup. The bomber successfully dropped its bombs over Sofia while escaping anti-aircraft fire but, while departing, was attacked by the Bulgarian Fokkers, one piloted by Marko Parvanov, which brought the Farman down with a dead engine.<ref>Nedialkov, 2001</ref>\n\nAnother Allied aircraft, a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Armstrong Whitworth F.K.3]], was captured by Bulgarian troops on 12 February 1917 after engine problems forced it to land. Both it and the crew were captured. It would receive Bulgarian insignia and be used to bomb Allied positions at night. Four such sorties were flown before being shot down on 23 May 1918.<ref>Tapper, 1973, p.57</ref>\n\nA [[Nieuport 24bis]] and a [[Nieuport 27]] were also captured. Lieutenant Vladimir Balan, a Bulgarian fighter pilot who had been flying with a German Jasta on the Western Front, was flying one of the Nieuports when he shot down the squadron leader of [[No. 17 Squadron RAF]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Naval air action====\nBulgarian naval aviators also played an important role in the air war. In 1912 [[Petty-Officer]]s Lyapchev and Mikhailov were sent, along with other officers and seamen, to the German naval aviation forming facilities for training. Another group of naval personnel followed in the beginning of the First World War. Training was held at List, Nordenhai and Kiel. In November 1915 a [[seaplane station]] under German control was established near [[Varna]], initially operating four Friedrichshafen FF.33 bombers and a Rumpler 6B1 fighter. Later, at the coast of the Varna Lake, a second [[seaplane]] station was built (this one under Bulgarian control), operating the same inventory. Near [[Sozopol]] a forward fuel and ammunition replenishment base was established in support of patrol flights over the southern Bulgarian coastline. At the end of 1917 the German station was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy. At the time of the armistice the Bulgarian fleet air arm comprised two seaplane stations, a forward replenishment base, three hangars, three workshops, ammunition warehouses and 10 seaplanes. After the cease-fire the machines were used for mine reconnaissance. At the end of 1919 they are transported by train to [[Bozhurishte]] Airfield to be scrapped along with the army aviation inventory.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Bulgarian balloon observers also took part in the war. They were most active on the [[Dobruja|Dobrudzha]] Front, where aircraft activities were scarce (a German bomber squadron, flying missions against [[Bucharest]] and [[Constan\u0163a]]: \"Gotha\" bombers accounted for the most flights). Near the Bulgarian city of [[Yambol]] an [[airship hangar]] was constructed to house German airships. The airship Sch\u00fctte-Lanz SL 10 was the first to use it. According to documents of the time it was assigned to the Bulgarian Army, but was actually under German control. It was lost during a flight over the [[Black Sea]] in July 1916. In August 1916 the LZ 101 replaced it. After performing raids on targets in Romania and Greece it returned to Germany in August 1917. In November 1917 the naval airship [[Zeppelin LZ104|L 59]] arrived. That airship flew a series of remarkable missions, such as an attempted resupply of the garrison in the colony [[German East Africa]] and the bombing of [[Naples]] and [[Port Said]]. During a mission against the British naval base in [[Malta]], a lightning strike over the [[Mediterranean Sea]] set it alight and completely destroyed it. All hands were lost.<ref name=\"Fallschirmjaeger\">Rumen Kirilov, Ivan Borislavov, \"The Bulgarian Aviation in the Chains of the Neuilly Peace Treaty\", in: \"Klub Krile Magazine\", special, Vol. 11, 1999, \"Air Group 2000\" Publishing, Sofia, Bulgaria</ref>\n\n===Destruction and survival under the peace treaty (1919\u20131936)===\nOn 4 October 1918 the Bulgarian Tsar issued a Royal Act of Demobilization.

DAR produced small numbers of locally designed aircraft]]\n\nDue to the devotion of the Air Troops personnel and the help of the population of the surrounding villages, several aircraft were hidden, thus evading Allied inspection following destruction. Seven DFW C.V, Albatros C.III and a single Fokker D.VII were among the survivors. In addition, at least ten aviation engines ([[Benz Bz.IV]] and [[Mercedes D.III]]) were also saved.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Bulgarian government tried to get around the ban for military flight activity by establishing a Gendarmery Aeroplane Section in 1919. Since the Gendarmery was at that time a service under the Ministry of War, the creation of the unit was met by fierce opposition by the Allied commission. This almost resulted in the destruction of the whole [[Sofia Airport|Vrazhdebna Airfield]], but the disbandment of the unit prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAn Aeroflight Section under the Ministry of [[Railway]]s, [[Postal Service]] and [[Telegraph]] was created in 1920. Bulgarian aviation personnel assembled two airplanes from hidden spares and parts, salvaged from the destroyed military airplanes. The two aircraft, known as \"the mixed planes\", recorded about 1000 flight hours altogether. The sole remaining Bulgarian Fokker D.VII was disguised as a two-seater, thus being classified as a trainer and returning to active service.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn 5 July 1923 Bulgaria ratified the International Civil Aviation Treaty. From that moment on its air vehicles would carry a registration in the form B-B??? (the latter three signs being a combination of capital letters). In 1923 the first group of cadets, called \"student-flyers\" entered the Flying school at Vrazhdebna AF.\n\nThe following year (1924) the first new airplanes were acquired. Those were machines of the [[Potez VIII]], [[Caudron C.59]], Henriot XD.14 and Bristol 29 Tourer types; [[Avro 522]] seaplanes were also procured. During the same year the Bulgarian airplane construction specialist Atanas Grigorov (who obtained his qualification at the \"Albatroswerke \u2013 Berlin\") assembled his seaplane, called \"Grigorov-1\". The aircraft made several test-flights, recording excellent characteristics, but was damaged beyond repair by a storm in the hangar where it was stationed. Also in 1924 the Aeroplane Section was expanded to an Aeroflight Directorate still under the Ministry of Railways, Postal Service and Telegraph.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n1925 saw the [[Potez XVII]], [[Bristol Primary Trainer|Bristol Lucifer]] and [[Alenia Aermacchi|Macchi]] 2000/18 flying boat boosting the country's aircraft inventory. The Bulgarian government invited a group of German aircraft engineers, headed by the constructor Herr Hermann Winter to help establish an aviation factory. Named The State's Aeroconstruction Atelli\u00e9r or [[Darzhavna Aeroplanna Rabotilnitsa]] (DAR) the factory was initially managed by the first Bulgarian pilot to achieve an aerial victory \u2013 Mr. Marko Parvanov. The first aircraft types produced at the plant were the U-1 or \"Uzounov-1\" (an indigenous variant of the wartime German DFW C.V) and the [[DAR 2]] (an indigenous variant of the German [[Albatros C.III]] of the same era). Both types became well-known and loved by the personnel of the former Air Troops and gained Bulgarian combat service experience.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Development of a new type \u2013 the [[DAR 1]] \u2013 was also started.\n\n[[File:Stele-Plovdiv.jpg|thumb|right|One of the eagles that decorated the entrance of [[Bozhurishte Air Base]] in the 1930s and 1940s, now preserved at the [[Plovdiv Museum of Aviation]]]]\n\nDuring the course of 1926 the Airplane School was moved to the geographical center of the country. The town of [[Kazanlak]] was well suited, for it was far away from the Allied Control Commission. The [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] company [[Aero Vodochody]] also built an aircraft factory near that city, but its models were not up to the requirements of the Bulgarian authorities. After an unsuccessful switch to automotive production, the plant was finally sold to the Italian [[Caproni]] company. The factory became popular as \"Balgarski Kaproni\" or \"Bulgarian Caproni\". The first examples of the DAR 1 biplane were produced and entered service with the Aeroflight Directorate during 1926.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe 1927 structure of the Directorate was the following:\n* A fighter yato,<ref group=\"NOTE\">The Bulgarian word \"yato\" means a \"flock of birds\" and was the Bulgarian equivalent of an air force squadron at the time</ref> flying the DAR 1\n* A bomber yato, flying the DAR U-1 and DAR 2\n* A recon yato, flying the Potez XVII\n* A seaplane yato, flying Avro 522 floatplanes and Macchi 2000/18 flying boats\n* An aeroplane school, flying the [[Caudron C.59]], the [[Hanriot HD.14]] and the \u0160molnik \u0160.18\n\nIn 1928 the Ministry of War started the ambitious 10-year program for development of the military aviation (still banned by the peace treaty). According to the plan the following structure had to be achieved:\n* 4 army fighter orlyaks,<ref group=\"NOTE\">The Bulgarian word \"orlyak\" used here means a \"Air Group\"</ref> each made of two yatos, or overall 8 yatos flying 96 fighter planes\n* 4 army recon orlyaks, each made of two yatos, or overall 8 yatos flying 96 recon planes\n* 18 divisionary recon yatos, basically air support aviation, each flying 12 planes or 216 planes altogether\n* Strike Aviation Brigade with:\n** Fighter Orlyak of 48 machines\n** Bomber Orlyak of 36 machines\n** Recon Orlyak of 2 machines\n* Maritime Orlyak\n** 2 seaplane fighter yatos, flying 24 fighters\n** 2 seaplane bomber yatos, flying 18 bombers\n\nIn 1931 Bulgaria signed the Warsaw Treaty, concerning international civil air activities and the country was assigned the new civil registration \u2013 LZ-??? (the latter three signs being a combination of capital letters). In 1933 the Bulgarian Council of Ministers approved the following wartime order of battle of the aviation:\n* a mixed orlyak of:\n** a fighter yato\n** a bomber yato\n** a recon yato\n** a liaison and photographic survey yato\n* a maritime yato\n* a training orlyak\n* a Pilot School at Kazanlak airfield\n* a balloon company (which was never actually created, as the balloon was considered obsolete for military purposes at the time).\nBulgaria started acquiring German, Czechoslovak and Polish airplanes.\n\nIn 1934 the Aviation Regiment was renamed His Majesty's Air Troops, comprising a headquarters, with two army orlyaks (based at [[Bozhurishte]] and [[Plovdiv]] airfields), a training orlyak (in [[Plovdiv]]), a maritime yato (at NAS Chaika, Varna) and additional operational support units.

Each orlyak had a fighter, a line bomber and two reconnaissance yatos (Squadrons). There was also an Independent Aviation corps, which combined the 5th Bomber and 6th Fighter Regiments. The training units consisted of the \"Junker\" School Orlyak at [[Vrazhdebna]] airfield, the 2nd Training Orlyak at Telish airfield (called the Blind Flying Training School) and the 3rd Training Orlyak at [[Stara Zagora]] airfield. In 1940, the Bulgarian aviation industry provided the air force with 42 [[DAR 9 Siniger]] and 45 [[Caproni Ca.113|Kaproni-Bulgarski KB-5 Chuchuliga]] aircraft, along with preparing for serial production of the [[Caproni Ca.309|KB-6]] \u2013 Bulgaria's first twin-engined aircraft.

The new command's headquarters was created on 26 July 1941, at No. 1, Calle Victoria, [[Manila]], [[Luzon]], the [[Philippines]], with General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as commander. The Chief of Staff was Brigadier General [[Richard K. Sutherland]] and the Deputy Chief of Staff was Lieutenant Colonel [[Richard J. Marshall]]. The core of this command (including MacArthur, Marshall, and Sutherland) was drawn from the [[Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government (Philippines)|Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government]].\n\nCreation of this command led to the subordination of the headquarters of the [[Philippine Department]] of the U.S. Army, as a service command, since planning and tactical control were now under USAFFE control. MacArthur explains, \"It became an administrative echelon. It was analogous to a [[corps area]]\".<ref>HyperWar notes source as 'Extract of rad from CG USAFFE in memo, Jah Gen William Bryden, DCofS for ACofS G-1, 13 Oct 41, OCS 18136-78; see also memo, Bryden for WPD, 7 Oct 41, OCS 18136-71.'</ref> MacArthur recommended that Philippine Department commander [[George Grunert|Major General Grunert]] be reassigned, as his services were no longer needed. On 23 October, Grunert returned to the United States and MacArthur was temporarily appointed as the Philippine Department's commander.\n\n==History==\nIn January 1941, the intelligence officer ([[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|G-2]]) of the Philippine Department had recommended, to his superior in [[Washington D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], that an American high command in the Far East be created, with the commander of the Philippine Department as the designated commander of said command. It does not appear this idea was seriously considered until [[Douglas MacArthur]] suggested, to the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]], that such a command be created with MacArthur as the Far Eastern Commander.\n\nOn 6 June, Acting Chief of the War Plans Division Brigadier General [[Leonard T. Gerow]] noted that he saw no need for such a command, as US Forces in the Far East were concentrated in the [[Philippines]]. As such, Gerow argued that should a \"crisis\" occur, then MacArthur should become the commander of, not some new command, but rather, of the Philippine Department itself.\n\n[[File:Philippine Scouts at Fort McKinley.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Philippine Scouts]] being trained at [[Fort William McKinley]] on a [[37 mm Gun M3|37 mm (M3) anti-tank gun]].]]\n\nOn 20 June, [[George C. Marshall|Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall]] informed MacArthur, \"Both the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] ([[Henry L.

The [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry Regiment]] of the Philippine Scouts moves past a [[M3 Stuart]] tank, into [[Pozorrubio, Pangasinan|Pozorrubio]], in an attempt to repel Japanese forces.]]\n\nOn 17 July, Gerow made the following recommendations:\n\n* The President should call into the service of the United States all organized military forces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines;\n* General MacArthur should be called to active duty as a [[General|Major General]] and assigned as commander of Army Forces in the Far East;\n* [[United States dollar|$]]10,000,000, from the [[President's Emergency Fund]] should be allotted to cover the costs of mobilization and training of the Philippine Army;\n* Training of the Philippine Army be financed from the sugar excise fund, or from other funds; and\n* 425 U.S. Army reserve officers be sent to the Philippines to assist in [[mobilization]] and training.\n\nOn 25 July, Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]] requested that President Roosevelt issue orders calling the military forces of the Commonwealth into active service for the United States. Stimson explains, \"All practical steps should be taken to increase the defensive strength of the Philippine Islands\". The following day, Roosevelt froze all Japanese assets within the United States and issued the orders to absorb the forces of the Philippine Army. That same day, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] created the USAFFE command, with jurisdiction over the Philippine Department and the military forces of [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] (seemingly principally the [[Philippine Army]], with two regular and ten reserve [[division (military)|division]]s). At the same time, MacArthur was recalled to active duty, with the rank of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], as the USAFFE commander, from his positions as military advisor to the Philippine government and [[Field Marshal of the Philippine Army]].\n\nFollowing the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in December 1941, the short-lived [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]] (ABDACOM) was formed on 1 January 1942, to control all [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces in [[South East Asia]] and the [[South West Pacific]]. ABDACOM nominally controlled USAFFE forces, although the latter was effectively an independent force.\n\nIn March, due to the worsening Allied position in Asia and the Pacific, Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to relocate his command to Australia. MacArthur's famous speech regarding the Philippines, in which he said, \"I came out of [[Battle of Bataan|Bataan]] and I shall return\" was made at [[Terowie, South Australia]] on 20 March. General [[Jonathan M. Wainwright (general)|Jonathan Wainwright]] officially assumed control of the remaining forces in the Philippines, now known as '''United States Forces in the Philippines''' (USFIP) on 23 March.\n\nOn 18 April 1942, ABDACOM was replaced by [[South West Pacific Area (command)|General Headquarters (GHQ), Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA) in [[Melbourne]], including USFIP. MacArthur was appointed Supreme Commander, SWPA. USFIP, with the exception of some ad hoc [[Philippine resistance against Japan|guerilla and resistance]] outfits, had surrendered to Japanese by 8 May.\n\nMacArthur formally reconstituted USAFFE in Australia in February 1943, to assume responsibility for all administrative staff duties pertaining to U.S. Army units in the SWPA, as well as control of guerrilla forces in the Philippines.\n\nOn 20 October 1944, the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u20131945)|recapture of the Philippines]] commenced when Allied forces [[Battle of Leyte|landed in Leyte Gulf]]. The campaign was declared completed on 4 July 1945.\n\nUSAFFE was formally dissolved in the lead-up to [[Republic Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]] on 4 July 1946.\n\n==Order of battle==\n=== 31 July 1941 ===\nTotal Strength\u201422,532 (1,434 officers\u201421,098 enlisted, including 11,937 Philippine Scouts)\n\n* USAFFE Headquarters (5)\n* [[Philippine Department Headquarters]] (289)\n* [[Philippine Division]] (10,473)\n* [[Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays]] (5,360)\n* [[Philippine Army Air Corps]] (2,407)\n* [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry Regiment]] (838)\n* [[43rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|43rd Infantry Regiment]] (329)\n* [[U.S. 86th Field Artillery Regiment (PS)]] (388)\n* [[U.S. 88th Field Artillery Regiment (PS)]] (518)\n* [[U.S. 808th Military Police Company]] (69)\n* Service Detachments (1,836)\n* Other (20)\n\n=== 30 November 1941 ===\nTotal Strength: 31,095 (2,504 [[commissioned officer|officers]] and 28,591 enlisted, including 11,957 [[Philippine Scouts]])\n\n* USAFFE Headquarters (61)\n* Headquarters, [[Philippine Department]] (553)\n* [[Headquarters - North Luzon Force]] (38)\n* [[Headquarters - South Luzon Force]] (10)\n* [[Headquarters - Visayan-Mindanao Force]] (9)\n* [[Philippine Division]] (10,233)\n* [[Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays]] (5,225)\n* [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]] (5,609)\n* [[26th Cavalry Regiment|26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] (842)\n* [[43rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|43d Infantry Regiment (PS)]] (328)\n* [[U.S. 86th Field Artillery Regiment (PS)]] (395)\n* [[U.S. 88th Field Artillery Regiment (PS)]] (538)\n* [[200th Coast Artillery (United States)|U.S. 200th Coast Artillery (AA) Regiment]] (1,809)\n* [[192nd Tank Battalion|U.S. 192d Tank Battalion]] (588)\n* [[194th Tank Battalion|U.S. 194th Tank Battalion]] (410)\n* [[U.S. 808th Military Police Company]] (160)\n* Service Detachments (4,268)\n* Other (19)\n\n==Awards==\nUSAFFE received four Distinguished Unit Citations (later converted to [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]]s) for the following time periods -\n* 7 December 1941 to 10 May 1942 (WD GO 22-42 amended by DA GO 46-48)\n* 8 to 31 December 1941 (WD GO 14-42)\n* 12 January to 14 February 1942 (WD GO 32-42)\n* 21 January 1942 (WD GO 14-42) <ref>DA PAM 672-1, Unit Citation and Campaign Participation Credit Register, Headquarters United States Army, July 1961,  pg. 529.</ref>\n\nUSAFFE also received the [[Philippine Presidential Unit Citation]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Asiatic Fleet]]\n*[[Military History of the Philippines]]\n*[[Military History of the United States]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*National Archives, [https://www.archives.gov/research/military/ww2/philippine/timeline.html Timeline] [Philippine Archives Collection].\n*HyperWar, [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-PI/USA-P-PI-2.html U.S. Army Forces, Far East]\n*Orbat.com, [http://niehorster.org/013_usa/_41_usarmy/philippines/_usaffe.htm USAFFE December 1941]\n*United States Army, [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1/ch12.htm Final SWPA operations and organization of AFPAC], extracted from MacArthur Reports, [[Center for Military History]]\n\n{{World War II US Army Commands}}\n\n[[Category:Military history of the Philippines during World War II]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations of the United States Army in World War II]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1941]]\n[[Category:History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)]]\n[[Category:United States military in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Regional commands of the United States Army]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n{{One source|date=April 2012}}\n\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name=United States Army Forces in<br /> the Far East (USAFFE) <br /> ''Hukbong Katihan ng Estados Unidos sa Malayong Silangan (HKEUMS)''\n|image=Douglas MacArthur at Philippine Army.jpg\n|image_size=300px\n|caption=Lt.

The new command's headquarters was created on 26 July 1941, at No. 1, Calle Victoria, [[Manila]], [[Luzon]], the [[Philippines]], with General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as commander. The Chief of Staff was Brigadier General [[Richard K. Sutherland]] and the Deputy Chief of Staff was Lieutenant Colonel [[Richard J. Marshall]]. The core of this command (including MacArthur, Marshall, and Sutherland) was drawn from the [[Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government (Philippines)|Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government]].\n\nCreation of this command led to the subordination of the headquarters of the [[Philippine Department]] of the U.S. Army, as a service command, since planning and tactical control were now under USAFFE control. MacArthur explains, \"It became an administrative echelon. It was analogous to a [[corps area]]\".<ref>HyperWar notes source as 'Extract of rad from CG USAFFE in memo, Jah Gen William Bryden, DCofS for ACofS G-1, 13 Oct 41, OCS 18136-78; see also memo, Bryden for WPD, 7 Oct 41, OCS 18136-71.'</ref> MacArthur recommended that Philippine Department commander [[George Grunert|Major General Grunert]] be reassigned, as his services were no longer needed. On 23 October, Grunert returned to the United States and MacArthur was temporarily appointed as the Philippine Department's commander.\n\n==History==\nIn January 1941, the intelligence officer ([[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|G-2]]) of the Philippine Department had recommended, to his superior in [[Washington D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], that an American high command in the Far East be created, with the commander of the Philippine Department as the designated commander of said command. It does not appear this idea was seriously considered until [[Douglas MacArthur]] suggested, to the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]], that such a command be created with MacArthur as the Far Eastern Commander.\n\nOn 6 June, Acting Chief of the War Plans Division Brigadier General [[Leonard T. Gerow]] noted that he saw no need for such a command, as US Forces in the Far East were concentrated in the [[Philippines]]. As such, Gerow argued that should a \"crisis\" occur, then MacArthur should become the commander of, not some new command, but rather, of the Philippine Department itself.\n\n[[File:Philippine Scouts at Fort McKinley.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Philippine Scouts]] being trained at [[Fort William McKinley]] on a [[37 mm Gun M3|37 mm (M3) anti-tank gun]].]]\n\nOn 20 June, [[George C.

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

Williams of [[Eureka, Utah]] visited the [[Las Vegas Valley]], back when [[Las Vegas]], [[Las Vegas Indian Colony]], and [[Arden, Nevada|Arden]] were the only entities in the valley.<ref name=evans/> He did not approve of Las Vegas, perhaps because of its rowdiness (he was a [[Christians|Christian]], or at least went to church), or because Las Vegas' attempts at municipal control over its citizens. However, he was pleased by the abundance of the valley's [[artesian water]] and potential for agriculture.<ref name=evans/> Two years later in 1919, he moved himself and his family (his wife and three sons) to a 160 acre piece of land a mile from Las Vegas. That year, he founded his town, developing the town by building he and his family a house, sinking a well, grading roads, extending power lines, and forming a system of [[irrigation ditch|irrigation ditches]].<ref name=evans/> Williams believed that churches and church people should govern the new town, and so encouraged churches to buy property in the town.<ref name=evans/> In 1919, the federally enforced [[Volstead Act]] was passed, which prohibited the sale, possession, and consumption of alcohol. Since there was no local law against alcohol, and because of a system of tunnels that would connect the town's underground [[speakeasies]], the town attracted bootleggers from Las Vegas, although Williams was initially unaware of this. This gave his town the nickname of \"Old Town\".<ref name=evans/> When he did discover of it, he sticked with agriculture for his economic purposes.<ref name=evans/>\n\nIn 1924, he built his second house that was the first business of the town. It was named the Oasis Auto Court, and it contained a grocery store, a campground, a post office, a community center, and a telephone. At the time, it was the town's only telephone.<ref name=evans/> Between 1928 and 1935, a large influx of workers from the [[Hoover Dam]] settled in William's town, as Las Vegas was intolerant towards them.<ref name=evans/> In 1932, the town board was created. That same year, the town's first grammar school, Washington School, opened.<ref name=evans/> A proper name had not yet been established for the town, and Williams did not want it named after himself, which lead to the town board voting for either \"North Las Vegas\" or \"Vegas Verde\" (which means \"Green Meadows\" in Spanish). \"Vegas Verde\" won, and that became the name for the town for a few months. George Hansen, a town board member who voted for the name \"North Las Vegas\", noticed that at one town board meeting, two members who voted the name \"Vegas Verde\" were absent. The vote for a name came once again, and \"North Las Vegas\" won.<ref name=evans/> In 1939, Williams died of [[stroke]], and that left North Las Vegas to the ruling of the town board. An elementary school was eventually named after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomwilliamselementary.com/about-us|title=Tom Williams|website=tomwilliamselementary.com|accessdate=April 7, 2020}}</ref> During [[World War II]], the [[Army Air Forces Gunnery Schools|Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School]] opened in North Las Vegas.

Williams of [[Eureka, Utah]] visited the [[Las Vegas Valley]], back when [[Las Vegas]], [[Las Vegas Indian Colony]], and [[Arden, Nevada|Arden]] were the only entities in the valley.<ref name=evans/> He did not approve of Las Vegas, perhaps because of its rowdiness (he was a [[Christians|Christian]], or at least went to church), or because Las Vegas' attempts at municipal control over its citizens. However, he was pleased by the abundance of the valley's [[artesian water]] and potential for agriculture.<ref name=evans/> Two years later in 1919, he moved himself and his family (his wife and three sons) to a 160 acre piece of land a mile from Las Vegas. That year, he founded his town, developing the town by building he and his family a house, sinking a well, grading roads, extending power lines, and forming a system of [[irrigation ditch|irrigation ditches]].<ref name=evans/> Williams believed that churches and church people should govern the new town, and so encouraged churches to buy property in the town.<ref name=evans/> In 1919, the federally enforced [[Volstead Act]] was passed, which prohibited the sale, possession, and consumption of alcohol. Since there was no local law against alcohol, and because of a system of tunnels that would connect the town's underground [[speakeasies]], the town attracted bootleggers from Las Vegas, although Williams was initially unaware of this. This gave his town the nickname of \"Old Town\".<ref name=evans/> When he did discover of it, he sticked with agriculture for his economic purposes.<ref name=evans/>\n\nIn 1924, he built his second house that was the first business of the town. It was named the Oasis Auto Court, and it contained a grocery store, a campground, a post office, a community center, and a telephone. At the time, it was the town's only telephone.<ref name=evans/> Between 1928 and 1935, a large influx of workers from the [[Hoover Dam]] settled in William's town, as Las Vegas was intolerant towards them.<ref name=evans/> In 1932, the town board was created. That same year, the town's first grammar school, Washington School, opened.<ref name=evans/> A proper name had not yet been established for the town, and Williams did not want it named after himself, which lead to the town board voting for either \"North Las Vegas\" or \"Vegas Verde\". \"Vegas Verde\" won, and that became the name for the town for a few months. George Hansen, a town board member who voted for the name \"North Las Vegas\", noticed that at one town board meeting, two members who voted the name \"Vegas Verde\" were absent. The vote for a name came once again, and \"North Las Vegas\" won.<ref name=evans/> In 1939, Williams died of [[stroke]], and that left North Las Vegas to the ruling of the town board. An elementary school was eventually named after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomwilliamselementary.com/about-us|title=Tom Williams|website=tomwilliamselementary.com|accessdate=April 7, 2020}}</ref> During [[World War II]], the [[Army Air Forces Gunnery Schools|Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School]] opened in North Las Vegas.
