The [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] seek refuge with [[Krishna]] at His abode 'on an island called [[Kshir Sagar|Svetadvipa]], which is situated in the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of milk]]' (Canto 8: Chapter 5). Krishna instructs the Devas to form a pact with the [[Asura|Asuras]] (led by [[Mahabali|Bali]]) to churn the ocean of milk and warns them about the emergence of the poison, Kalakuta. Later, 'observing that most of the demons and demigods had been crushed by the falling of the mountain' to be used as a churning rod, Krishna brings them back to life, lifts the Mandara mountain, and carries it on the back of Garuda to the Ocean of Milk (Canto 8: Chapter 6). The Ocean is churned with [[Vasuki]] as a rope, the sleepy Kurma as the base who 'extended for eight hundred thousand miles like a large island' and felt a 'pleasing sensation' at being scratched, and Ajita Himself personally helping. Poison is generated, to which [[Shiva]] 'compassionately took the whole quantity of poison in his palm and drank it' as an example of voluntary suffering for others; the remaining poison was drunk by animals with poisonous bites such as [[Scorpion|scorpions]] and [[Cobra|Cobras]] (Canto 8: Chapter 7).\n\nChurned with a renewed vigor by 'the sons of Kasyapa', the Ocean of Milk produces auspicious beings, including [[Lakshmi]] and [[Dhanvantari]] - 'a plenary portion of a plenary portion of Lord [[Vishnu|Visnu]]' - with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]; Canto 8: Chapter 8). After the demons steal the nectar, [[Vishnu]] incarnates as [[Mohini]]-[[Murti]], who despite warning the lustful and infatuated demons not to trust Her, is still given the Amrita which She distributes to the Devas (Canto 8: Chapter 9).

In the first, the churning of the ocean of Milk takes place after [[Indra]] is cursed by the sage [[Durvasa]] for arrogance, resulting in the gods and the people of Earth being 'deprived of their glory' (Prakriti-Khanda: 36/XXXVI).

In this account, the [[Daitya|Daityas]] led by [[Mahabali|Bali]] repeatedly defeat the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] led by [[Indra]] due to being resurrected by the sage [[Shukra|Sukra]] (son of [[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]]) when killed, using a mantra provided by [[Shiva]]. Advised by [[Brahma]], the Devas secure an alliance with Bali in [[Patala]], the agreement of Mandarachala (king of the mountains) to be used as a churning rod, and the agreement of [[Shesha|Sesa]] and Kurma - said to be 'endowed with 1/4 of Vishnu's power... to support the Earth' - as the rope and base of the churning rod, respectively. Unable the churn the Ocean of Milk by themselves, the Devas and Asuras approach [[Vishnu]] 'absorbed in deep meditation' in [[Vaikuntha]] for help, who agrees (CCXLIX). \n\nAfter producing several auspicious items (e.g. the [[Kaustubha|Kaustubha Gem]]) and beings (e.g. [[Lakshmi]]), several 'venomous insects and terrible beings' are produced along with 'hundreds of poisonous things' such as [[Halahala]], before the emergence of a powerful poison-being called Kalakuta that wishes to destroy both the Devas and Demons. After challenging them to either swallow him or 'go to Lord [[Shiva]]', the latter is approached and swallows the poison-being before returning to his abode (CCL). The [[Kshir Sagar|Ocean of Milk]] being churned once again produces more auspicious beings and items, including [[Dhanvantari]] with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]), before [[Vishnu]] 'assumes the form of a bewitching damsel' ([[Mohini]]) to take the nectar from the Asuras and give it to the Devas. The Asuras are then destroyed by Vishnu in battle using His 'terrible [[Sudarshana Chakra|Chakra]]' (CCLI).

In the first, narrated by [[Pulastya]], as a result of the curse the 'three worlds, along with Indra, were void of affluence... [and] the [[Daitya|Daityas]] (sons of [[Diti]]) and [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danavas]] (sons of [[Danu (Asura)|Danu]]) started military operations against [the] gods', forcing them to seek refuge with [[Vishnu]]. [[Vasuki]] is used as a rope to churn the ocean. Notably, during the churning, [[Varuni]] (Goddess of Wine) is upon emerging rejected by the gods and accepted by the [[Asura|Asuras]], the opposite of the account given in the [[Brahmanda Purana]] (to explain the meaning of 'Asura'). Unnamed poison also emerges which is drunk by [[Shiva]], before the emergence of [[Dhanvantari]] with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]) as well as [[Lakshmi]].

[[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]] ([[Vasuki]] in the first account) is used as a churning rope. On [[Ekadashi]] day, the poison Kalakuta emerges, which is swallowed by [[Shiva]] 'meditating upon Vishnu in his heart'. An evil being called [[Alakshmi|Alaksmi]] (i.e. a-Laksmi or 'not [[Lakshmi|Laksmi]]') them emerges and is told to reside in places such as where there is quarrel, gambling, adultery, theft, and so forth (Part 5: 9). The churning continues and auspicious beings and items emerge, including 'the brother of Laksmi, [who] sprang up with nectar. (So also) [[Ocimum tenuiflorum|Tulasi]] [i.e. [[Lakshmi]]], Visnu's wife'. On this occasion, Vishnu assumes the form of [[Mohini]] merely to distribute the nectar amongst the gods, without mention of tricking the Asuras (Part 5: 10).\n\nThe third account, narrated by [[Shiva]], is very similar to the others except with a far greater emphasis on [[Lakshmi]], and although the poison Kalakuta emerges and is swallowed by Shiva, there is no mention of Alaksmi or the Mohini avatar (Part 9: 231-232). The [[N\u0101ga|Naga]] used as a rope for churning is referred to as 'the Lord of the Serpents' (likely [[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]]). Other details include:\n\n* Kurma is mentioned as an avatar of [[Vishnu]] (Part 1: 3.25b-29), as a giver of boons (Part 1: 5.81-87), and is stated to have appeared during the fourth war between the Devas and Asuras (Part 1: 13.180); during the churning, [[Indra]] is stated to have vanquished [[Prahlada]] (Part 1: 13.186)\n* Relating to Kurma as the [[World Turtle|world-turtle]], it is stated 'Due to truth (alone), the sun rises; also the wind blows; the ocean would (i.e. does) not cross its boundary nor would (i.e. does) the Tortoise avert (sustaining) the earth' (Part 2: 53.3); Kurma is also mentioned as the 'first tortoise', the prop of everything, cause of production of ambrosia, and the support of the Earth (Part 7: 71.169-188); finally, after raising the earth from the waters in the form of a boar ([[Varaha]]), it is stated that [[Vishnu]] placed it on the head of [[Shesha|Sesa]] before taking the form of Kurma (Part 9: 237.15-19)\n* Kurma is named as one of the 10 primary avatars ([[Dashavatara]]) of [[Vishnu]] by [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] (Part 7: 66.44-54), [[Brahma]] (Part 7: 71.23-29b), and [[Shiva]] (Part 9: 229.40-44) \n*[[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] and [[Aditi]] are stated to incarnate as [[Vasudeva Anakadundubhi]] and [[Devaki]], the parents of [[Krishna]] (Part 7: 71.244-264)\n* The [[Shaligram|salagrama]] of Kurma is described as 'raised, round on the surface, and is filled with a disc (like figure).

The second mentions the [[Mohini]] avatar of [[Vishnu]] incarnating at the 'behest of [[Shiva|Siva]]' (Part 3: 22).

It rolled on the back, neck, thighs, and space between the knees of the noble-souled tortoise.

In the first, the churning of the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of Milk]] takes place after [[Indra]] is cursed by the sage [[B\u1e5bhaspati|Brhaspati]], resulting in the disappearance of [[Lakshmi]], misery to all, and ruin of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], defeated in battle by the [[Asura|Asuras]] who take their precious items such as gems to [[Patala]]. On the advice of [[Brahma]], Indra and the Devas make a pact with [[Mahabali|Bali]], leader of Asuras, to recover the gems from the Ocean of Milk. Unable to move the Mandara mountain to use as a churning rod, [[Vishnu]] is asked for help, who arrives on [[Garuda]], takes the mountain to the ocean, and incarnates as Kurma. [[Vasuki]] is used as the churning rope. The Kalakuta poison generated envelopes the Devas and [[Daitya|Daityas]] - causing ignorance and lust - before enveloping all existence (including [[Vaikuntha]]) and reducing the [[World egg|cosmic egg]] to ash (Part 1: 9). [[Shiva]] is approached for refuge, and the origin and need to worship [[Ganesha]] to 'achieve success in undertaking' is explained before Shiva drinks the poison (Part 1: 10). More information on Ganesha-worship is given before the churning resumes, producing many auspicious items and beings, including Lakshmi (Part 1: 11). [[Dhanvantari]] emerges with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]), which is taken by the Asuras. Vishnu incarnates as [[Mohini]], and despite warning Bali that 'Women should never be trusted by a wise man' is still given the nectar which She gives to the Devas (Part 1: 12).\n\nIn the second account, Indra is again cursed by the sage [[B\u1e5bhaspati|Brhaspati]] (Part 7: 8), resulting in the disappearance of [[Lakshmi|Laksmi]], and with her, an absence of 'Penance, Purity, Mercy, Truth... True [[Dharma]], Prosperity... Strength [and] [[Sattva]] (quality of goodness)'. Hunger, poverty, anger, lust, flesh-eating, and perverse-thinking abound, including belief that [[adharma]] is [[dharma]], and perverse interpretations of the [[Vedas]] to justify killing animals (Part 7: 9). [[Vishnu]] is approached for refuge by the Devas and instructs them to churn the [[Kshir Sagar|Ocean of Milk]] (Part 7: 10). Indra forms a pact with the Asuras, [[Shesha|Sesa]] is used as a churning rope with the Mandara Mountain, and Vishnu incarnates as Kurma as the base. After a thousand years of churning the poison [[Halahala]] is generated and swallowed by Shiva; the drops that fell are taken by serpents, scorpions, and some [[Medicine|medicinal]] plants (Part 7: 11). The churning continues for another thousand years, producing auspicious items and beings, including Laksmi (Part 7: 12). [[Dhanvantari]] emerges with the pitcher of [[Amrita]] which is taken by the Asuras, and Vishnu assumes 'a marvellously beautiful feminine form that enchanted all the world' ([[Mohini]]). Despite warning the Asuras not to trust her, Mohini is given the Amrita which is handed to the Devas before the Asuras are destroyed in battle (Part 7: 13).\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Mohini (Oleograph).jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[Mohini]], the female enchantress avatar of [[Vishnu]].]]\nIn the third brief account, the churning takes place after 'a great loss of gems due to wicked souls' and the loss of righteousness. [[Vasuki]] is used as the churning cord as the Devas and Asuras 'placed the main plant of activity on the back of the (divine) tortoise and churned out the precious gems'. Many auspicious items and beings are generated, including Sura (alcohol; in other accounts [[Varuni]]) and [[Dhanvantari]]. Quarreling ensues between the Devas and Asuras, and Vishnu incarnates as 'the fascinating form of a woman' ([[Mohini]]) to beguile the demons as [[Indra]] gives them the Sura and via 'slight of hand' takes the [[Amrita]]. Halahala poison is also generated which is consumed by [[Shiva]] (Part 12: 44).\n\nIn the fourth account, the legend is briefly retold by [[Vishvamitra|Visvamitra]]. The details are much the same as the previous accounts, with Vasuki as the cord as the 'Kacchapa (Tortoise incarnation of [[Vishnu|Visnu]]) held up (the mountain)', including the Kalakuta poison drunk by [[Shiva]] and the incarnation of [[Mohini]] to trick the Asuras. The notable exception is that the churning first produces a 'hideous' family of three of [[Samudra manthan|Ratnas]] (jewels); rejected by both the Devas and [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danavas]], they are accepted by Ka (i.e. [[Brahma]]; Part 18: 210). \n\nNotably, reminiscent the account of [[Prajapati]] and the [[Tortoise]] in the [[Taittiriya Shakha|Taittiriya Aranyaka]] (see above), there is also an account, during the time of the universal dissolution, when [[Brahma]] 'assumed the form of a ''Khadyota'' ([[Firefly]], Glow-worm)' and moved about for a thousand divine years before finding 'the Lord [<nowiki/>[[Vishnu]]] asleep in the form of a tortoise'. Woken by Brahma, Vishnu 'got up ejecting the three worlds that had been swallowed at the time of the close of the [previous] [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]]' with all creation - including the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danavas]], moon, sun, and planets - being generated from and by Him. Vishnu also sees the Earth 'was in the great ocean perched on the back of the tortoise' (Part 14: Reva Khanda: 7). Other details include:\n\n* Kurma is mentioned to have held the Mandara Mountain (Part 1: 8.89);\n* After being resorted to by [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]] and 'Permeated by her, Kurma, the sire of the universe, lifted up the [[Vedas]]' (Part 2: 47.12-15)\n* Exploring the [[Lingam|Linga]] of [[Shiva]], 'The primordial Tortoise that was stationed as the bulbous root of the Golden Mountain as well as its support was seen by Acyuta [Vishnu]'; It is also by Shiva's blessing that [[Shesha|Sesa]], Kurma, and others are capable of bearing the burden of that Linga (Part 3: Uttarardha: 11.8-11)\n* After [[Varaha]] lifted the earth out of the waters, [[Vishnu]] 'placed the Elephants of the Quarters, the King of Serpents and the Tortoise for giving her extra support. That receptacle of Mercy ([[Hari]]) willingly applied his own [[Shakti|Sakti]] (power) in an unmanifest form as a support for them all' (Part 4: Venkatacala Mahatmya: 36.20-26); [[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]] also states Kurma supports the earth (Part 15: Reva-Khanda: 182.1-22); and [[Shesha|Sesa]] and Kurma are also later stated to stabilise the Earth (Part 17: Nagara Khanda: 144.117)\n* Kurma is mentioned where [[Vishnu]] is stated to be the annihilator in the form of [[Rudra]] (Part 5: Purusottama-Ksetra Mahatmya:  22.32-43)\n* Kurma is named as one of 12 incarnations of [[Vishnu]], who states to [[Brahma]]:\n\n{{quote|When the sons of [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] (i.e. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] and [[Asura|Asuras]]) will churn the ocean for (obtaining) nectar, I [<nowiki/>[[Vishnu]]], assuming the form of a tortoise, will bear on my back Mount Mandara used as the churning rod.|source=Skanda Purana (Unknown translator, 1951), Part 7, Chapter 18, Verses 12-20}}\n\n* In the procedure for [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] [[Mandala]] construction, [[Matsya]] and Kurma should be installed in the South-West and depicted as animals below the waist but in human form above (Part 7: Vasudeva-Mamatmya: 27.32-33)\n*It is stated that the [[Lingam|Linga]] of [[Shiva]] evolved from 'the back of a tortoise (shell)' (Part 9: Dharmaranya Khanda: 19.16) and that 'The [[B\u012bj\u0101|Bija]] [origin] of Vahni (Fire) is accompanied by (the seed of) [[Vayu|Vata]] (Wind) and the Bija of Kurma (tortoise)' (Part 9: Dharmaranya Khanda: 20.20-23)\n*One of the names of the Goddess [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ganga]] is 'Kurmayana', meaning 'Having the tortoise as her vehicle' (Part 10: Purvardha: 29.17-168)\n*It is stated that 'Like a tortoise that withdraws all its limbs, he who withdraws the sense-organs though the proper procedure of [[Pratyahara]] shall become free from sins' (Part 10: Purvardha: 41.102)\n*[[Kumari (goddess)|Kumari]] - the [[Shakti]] of Kurma - has a noose in her hand and is located to the south of [[Lakshmi|Mahalaksmi]] (Part 11: Uttarardha: 70.69)\n*'Kurma' is one of the thousand names ([[Vishnu Sahasranama]]) of [[Vishnu]] (Part 12: Avantiksetra Mahatmya: 63.83)\n*Kurma is listed in the [[Dashavatara]], or ten primary incarnations of Vishnu (Part 15: Reva-Khanda, 151.1-7)\n*[[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]] refers to a Ksetra (temple) that stands on Kaccapa (i.e. a tortoise) and states there will be a city named after Him, ''Bhrgukaccha'' (Part 15: Reva-Khanda: 182.1-22)\n*[[Indradyumna|Indrayumna]] visits a tortoise living in [[Manasa]] Lake, called Mantharaka. The tortoise reveals it used to be a [[Brahmin]] called [[Shandilya (Rishi)|Sandilya]], who as a boy he would use baked bricks to build altars. Although reborn as great King, he was overtaken by lust and was cursed by [[Shiva]] to incarnate as a tortoise (Part 18: Nagara Khanda: 271.245-455)\n*The star constellations in the form of Kurma (i.e. the tortoise) are discussed, where it is also stated Kurma is stationed in [[Bharata Khanda|Bharata]] and faces the east (Part 19: Prabhasa-Ksetra Mahatmya: 7.17-37 and 11.18)\n*A Holy spot called Prabhasa in [[Bharata Khanda|Bharata]] is located to the south-west of the shrine of Kurma (Part 20: Prabhasa Khanda: 167.33)\n*The 13 wives of [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] named are somewhat different to other Puranic accounts (Aditi, Diti, Vinata, Kadru, Simhika, Suprabha, Uluki, Anuviddha, Sita, Irsya, Himsa, Maya, and Niskrti; Part 20: Prabhasa Khanda: 199.11-12)\n\n=== Vamana Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Vamana Purana|Vamana]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|N/A\n|No notable mentions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.313087|title=The Vamana Purana With English Translation|last=Gupta|first=anand Swarup|date=1968}}</ref>\n|}\n\n=== Varaha Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Varaha Purana|Varaha]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Part 1:''' 4.2-3, 8.43, 12.10, 40, 41.46-48, 48.17, 55.36-39, 113.21, 113.42;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12962|title=THE VARAHA PURANA PART. 1|last=N.A|date=1960|publisher=MOTILAL BANARSIDASS, DELHI}}</ref> '''Part 2:''' 163.35, 211.69<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12972|title=THE VARAHA PURANA PART. 2|last=N.A|date=1960|publisher=MOTILAL BANARSIDASS, DELHI}}</ref>\n|}\n\n{{quote|...[''Kurmadvadasivrata'': In] the month of Pausa ([[Makara (month)|Makara]]) [[Amrita|amrta]] was churned from the ocean, and then lord [[Vishnu|Visnu]], on his own accord, became a Kurma (tortoise).

The [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] seek refuge with [[Krishna]] at His abode 'on an island called [[Kshir Sagar|Svetadvipa]], which is situated in the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of milk]]' (Canto 8: Chapter 5). Krishna instructs the Devas to form a pact with the [[Asura|Asuras]] (led by [[Mahabali|Bali]]) to churn the ocean of milk and warns them about the emergence of the poison, Kalakuta. Later, 'observing that most of the demons and demigods had been crushed by the falling of the mountain' to be used as a churning rod, Krishna brings them back to life, lifts the Mandara mountain, and carries it on the back of Garuda to the Ocean of Milk (Canto 8: Chapter 6). The Ocean is churned with [[Vasuki]] as a rope, the sleepy Kurma as the base who 'extended for eight hundred thousand miles like a large island' and felt a 'pleasing sensation' at being scratched, and Ajita Himself personally helping. Poison is generated, to which [[Shiva]] 'compassionately took the whole quantity of poison in his palm and drank it' as an example of voluntary suffering for others; the remaining poison was drunk by animals with poisonous bites such as [[Scorpion|scorpions]] and [[Cobra|Cobras]] (Canto 8: Chapter 7).\n\nChurned with a renewed vigor by 'the sons of Kasyapa', the Ocean of Milk produces auspicious beings, including [[Lakshmi]] and [[Dhanvantari]] - 'a plenary portion of a plenary portion of Lord [[Vishnu|Visnu]]' - with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]; Canto 8: Chapter 8). After the demons steal the nectar, [[Vishnu]] incarnates as [[Mohini]]-[[Murti]], who despite warning the lustful and infatuated demons not to trust Her, is still given the Amrita which She distributes to the Devas (Canto 8: Chapter 9). Vishnu leaves and a battle ensues between the Devas and Asuras.

In this account, the [[Daitya|Daityas]] led by [[Mahabali|Bali]] repeatedly defeat the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] led by [[Indra]] due to being resurrected by the sage [[Shukra|Sukra]] (son of [[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]]) when killed, using a mantra provided by [[Shiva]]. Advised by [[Brahma]], the Devas secure an alliance with Bali in [[Patala]], the agreement of Mandarachala (king of the mountains) to be used as a churning rod, and the agreement of [[Shesha|Sesa]] and Kurma - said to be 'endowed with 1/4 of Vishnu's power... to support the Earth' - as the rope and base of the churning rod, respectively. Unable the churn the Ocean of Milk by themselves, the Devas and Asuras approach [[Vishnu]] 'absorbed in deep meditation' in [[Vaikuntha]] for help, who agrees (CCXLIX). \n\nAfter producing several auspicious items (e.g. the [[Kaustubha|Kaustubha Gem]]) and beings (e.g. [[Lakshmi]]), several 'venomous insects and terrible beings' are produced along with 'hundreds of poisonous things' such as [[Halahala]], before the emergence of a powerful poison-being called Kalakuta that wishes to destroy both the Devas and Demons. After challenging them to either swallow him or 'go to Lord [[Shiva]]', the latter is approached and swallows the poison-being before returning to his abode (CCL). The [[Kshir Sagar|Ocean of Milk]] being churned once again produces more auspicious beings and items, including [[Dhanvantari]] with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]), before [[Vishnu]] 'assumes the form of a bewitching damsel' ([[Mohini]]) to take the nectar from the Asuras and give it to the Devas. The Asuras are then destroyed by Vishnu in battle using His 'terrible [[Sudarshana Chakra|Chakra]]' (CCLI).

I myself, in the form of a tortoise, shall fully hold the (Mandara) mountain (on my back).|source=Padma Purana (translated by N.A. Deshpande, 1988), Part 5, Chapter 8, Verses 19b-23}}\n[[File:Dashavatara.jpg|thumb|280x280px|the [[Dashavatara]], or ten principle [[Avatar|avatars]] of [[Vishnu]].]]\nIn the second account, narrated by [[S\u016bta|Suta]], as a result of the curse the 'mother of the worlds' ([[Lakshmi]]) disappears, and the world is ruined by drought and famine, forcing the gods - oppressed by hunger and thirst - to seek refuge with [[Vishnu]] at the shore of the [[Kshir Sagar|Milky Ocean]] (Part 5: 8). [[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]] ([[Vasuki]] in the first account) is used as a churning rope. On [[Ekadashi]] day, the poison Kalakuta emerges, which is swallowed by [[Shiva]] 'meditating upon Vishnu in his heart'. An evil being called [[Alakshmi|Alaksmi]] (i.e. a-Laksmi or 'not [[Lakshmi|Laksmi]]') them emerges and is told to reside in places such as where there is quarrel, gambling, adultery, theft, and so forth (Part 5: 9). The churning continues and auspicious beings and items emerge, including 'the brother of Laksmi, [who] sprang up with nectar. (So also) [[Ocimum tenuiflorum|Tulasi]] [i.e. [[Lakshmi]]], Visnu's wife'. On this occasion, Vishnu assumes the form of [[Mohini]] merely to distribute the nectar amongst the gods, without mention of tricking the Asuras (Part 5: 10).\n\nThe third account, narrated by [[Shiva]], is very similar to the others except with a far greater emphasis on [[Lakshmi]], and although the poison Kalakuta emerges and is swallowed by Shiva, there is no mention of Alaksmi or the Mohini avatar (Part 9: 231-232). The [[N\u0101ga|Naga]] used as a rope for churning is referred to as 'the Lord of the Serpents' (likely [[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]]). Other details include:\n\n* Kurma is mentioned as an avatar of [[Vishnu]] (Part 1: 3.25b-29), as a giver of boons (Part 1: 5.81-87), and is stated to have appeared during the fourth war between the Devas and Asuras (Part 1: 13.180); during the churning, [[Indra]] is stated to have vanquished [[Prahlada]] (Part 1: 13.186)\n* Relating to Kurma as the [[World Turtle|world-turtle]], it is stated 'Due to truth (alone), the sun rises; also the wind blows; the ocean would (i.e. does) not cross its boundary nor would (i.e. does) the Tortoise avert (sustaining) the earth' (Part 2: 53.3); Kurma is also mentioned as the 'first tortoise', the prop of everything, cause of production of ambrosia, and the support of the Earth (Part 7: 71.169-188); finally, after raising the earth from the waters in the form of a boar ([[Varaha]]), it is stated that [[Vishnu]] placed it on the head of [[Shesha|Sesa]] before taking the form of Kurma (Part 9: 237.15-19)\n* Kurma is named as one of the 10 primary avatars ([[Dashavatara]]) of [[Vishnu]] by [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] (Part 7: 66.44-54), [[Brahma]] (Part 7: 71.23-29b), and [[Shiva]] (Part 9: 229.40-44) \n*[[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] and [[Aditi]] are stated to incarnate as [[Vasudeva Anakadundubhi]] and [[Devaki]], the parents of [[Krishna]] (Part 7: 71.244-264)\n* The [[Shaligram|salagrama]] of Kurma is described as 'raised, round on the surface, and is filled with a disc (like figure). Marked with Kaustubha, it has a green colour' (Part 8: 20.51b-73)\n* Kurma is stated to reside in [[Vaikuntha]] (Part 9: 228.19-24); and is one of the 108 names of Vishnu (Part 10: 17.103-117)\n* Shiva gives salutations to Kurma, who 'extracted the Earth along with mountains, forests and groves, from inside the water of the deep ocean' (Part 10:  6.175-190)\n\n=== Shiva Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Shiva Purana|Shiva]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Part 2:''' 1.44-45, 16.5;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart2|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 2 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref> '''Part 3:''' 11.19, 11.49-50, 16, 22;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart3|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 3 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref> '''Part 4:''' 4.53, 10.38, 31.134-136, 37.35-39<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart4|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 4 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref>\n|Nothing notable in part 1<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 4|last=J.L.Shastri|date=1950}}</ref>\n|}\n\nIn the [[Shiva Purana]], neither of the two accounts of the [[Samudra manthan]] mention Kurma. Poison is generated by the churning in both accounts, although only in the first account is [[Shiva]] stated to have drank it (Part 3: 16). The second mentions the [[Mohini]] avatar of [[Vishnu]] incarnating at the 'behest of [[Shiva|Siva]]' (Part 3: 22). Other details include:\n\n* It stated that 'On account of the [sexual] alliance of [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Parvati]], the earth quaked with the weight along with [[Shesha|Sesa]] (the serpent) and Kacchapa (the tortoise [i.e. Kurma]). By the weight of Kacchapa, the cosmic air, the support of everything, was stunned and the three worlds became terrified and agitated' (Part 2: 1.44-45); Kurma supports the Earth (Part 3: 11.19)\n* The skull of Kurma is stated to be in the necklace of [[Shiva]] (Part 3: 11.49-50)\n* Kurma is named as one of the 10 primary avatars ([[Dashavatara]]) of [[Vishnu]] (Part 4: 31.134-136)\n* One of the ten 'vital breaths' ([[prana]] or [[Vayu]]) is called 'Kurma' (Part 4: 37.35-36) and is stated to be for 'the activity of closing the eyes' (Part 4: 37.39; the [[Agni Purana]] states it to be for opening the eyes)\n\n=== Skanda Purana ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Skanda Purana|Skanda]]\n!References\n!Notes\n|-\n|'''Part 1:''' 8.89, 9-12;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12961|title=THE SKANDA-PURANA PART. 1|last=N.A|date=1950|publisher=MOTILAL BANARSIDASS PUBLISHERS PVT.

It rolled on the back, neck, thighs, and space between the knees of the noble-souled tortoise.

In the first, the churning of the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of Milk]] takes place after [[Indra]] is cursed by the sage [[B\u1e5bhaspati|Brhaspati]], resulting in the disappearance of [[Lakshmi]], misery to all, and ruin of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], defeated in battle by the [[Asura|Asuras]] who take their precious items such as gems to [[Patala]]. On the advice of [[Brahma]], Indra and the Devas make a pact with [[Mahabali|Bali]], leader of Asuras, to recover the gems from the Ocean of Milk. Unable to move the Mandara mountain to use as a churning rod, [[Vishnu]] is asked for help, who arrives on [[Garuda]], takes the mountain to the ocean, and incarnates as Kurma. [[Vasuki]] is used as the churning rope. The Kalakuta poison generated envelopes the Devas and [[Daitya|Daityas]] - causing ignorance and lust - before enveloping all existence (including [[Vaikuntha]]) and reducing the [[World egg|cosmic egg]] to ash (Part 1: 9). [[Shiva]] is approached for refuge, and the origin and need to worship [[Ganesha]] to 'achieve success in undertaking' is explained before Shiva drinks the poison (Part 1: 10). More information on Ganesha-worship is given before the churning resumes, producing many auspicious items and beings, including Lakshmi (Part 1: 11). [[Dhanvantari]] emerges with the nectar of immortality ([[Amrita]]), which is taken by the Asuras. Vishnu incarnates as [[Mohini]], and despite warning Bali that 'Women should never be trusted by a wise man' is still given the nectar which She gives to the Devas (Part 1: 12).\n\nIn the second account, Indra is again cursed by the sage [[B\u1e5bhaspati|Brhaspati]] (Part 7: 8), resulting in the disappearance of [[Lakshmi|Laksmi]], and with her, an absence of 'Penance, Purity, Mercy, Truth... True [[Dharma]], Prosperity... Strength [and] [[Sattva]] (quality of goodness)'. Hunger, poverty, anger, lust, flesh-eating, and perverse-thinking abound, including belief that [[adharma]] is [[dharma]], and perverse interpretations of the [[Vedas]] to justify killing animals (Part 7: 9). [[Vishnu]] is approached for refuge by the Devas and instructs them to churn the [[Kshir Sagar|Ocean of Milk]] (Part 7: 10). Indra forms a pact with the Asuras, [[Shesha|Sesa]] is used as a churning rope with the Mandara Mountain, and Vishnu incarnates as Kurma as the base. After a thousand years of churning the poison [[Halahala]] is generated and swallowed by Shiva; the drops that fell are taken by serpents, scorpions, and some [[Medicine|medicinal]] plants (Part 7: 11). The churning continues for another thousand years, producing auspicious items and beings, including Laksmi (Part 7: 12). [[Dhanvantari]] emerges with the pitcher of [[Amrita]] which is taken by the Asuras, and Vishnu assumes 'a marvellously beautiful feminine form that enchanted all the world' ([[Mohini]]). Despite warning the Asuras not to trust her, Mohini is given the Amrita which is handed to the Devas before the Asuras are destroyed in battle (Part 7: 13).\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Mohini (Oleograph).jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[Mohini]], the female enchantress avatar of [[Vishnu]].]]\nIn the third brief account, the churning takes place after 'a great loss of gems due to wicked souls' and the loss of righteousness. [[Vasuki]] is used as the churning cord as the Devas and Asuras 'placed the main plant of activity on the back of the (divine) tortoise and churned out the precious gems'. Many auspicious items and beings are generated, including Sura (alcohol; in other accounts [[Varuni]]) and [[Dhanvantari]]. Quarreling ensues between the Devas and Asuras, and Vishnu incarnates as 'the fascinating form of a woman' ([[Mohini]]) to beguile the demons as [[Indra]] gives them the Sura and via 'slight of hand' takes the [[Amrita]]. Halahala poison is also generated which is consumed by [[Shiva]] (Part 12: 44).\n\nIn the fourth account, the legend is briefly retold by [[Vishvamitra|Visvamitra]]. The details are much the same as the previous accounts, with Vasuki as the cord as the 'Kacchapa (Tortoise incarnation of [[Vishnu|Visnu]]) held up (the mountain)', including the Kalakuta poison drunk by [[Shiva]] and the incarnation of [[Mohini]] to trick the Asuras. The notable exception is that the churning first produces a 'hideous' family of three of [[Samudra manthan|Ratnas]] (jewels); rejected by both the Devas and [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danavas]], they are accepted by Ka (i.e. [[Brahma]]; Part 18: 210). \n\nNotably, reminiscent the account of [[Prajapati]] and the [[Tortoise]] in the [[Taittiriya Shakha|Taittiriya Aranyaka]] (see above), there is also an account, during the time of the universal dissolution, when [[Brahma]] 'assumed the form of a ''Khadyota'' ([[Firefly]], Glow-worm)' and moved about for a thousand divine years before finding 'the Lord [<nowiki/>[[Vishnu]]] asleep in the form of a tortoise'. Woken by Brahma, Vishnu 'got up ejecting the three worlds that had been swallowed at the time of the close of the [previous] [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]]' with all creation - including the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danavas]], moon, sun, and planets - being generated from and by Him. Vishnu also sees the Earth 'was in the great ocean perched on the back of the tortoise' (Part 14: Reva Khanda: 7). Other details include:\n\n* Kurma is mentioned to have held the Mandara Mountain (Part 1: 8.89);\n* After being resorted to by [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]] and 'Permeated by her, Kurma, the sire of the universe, lifted up the [[Vedas]]' (Part 2: 47.12-15)\n* Exploring the [[Lingam|Linga]] of [[Shiva]], 'The primordial Tortoise that was stationed as the bulbous root of the Golden Mountain as well as its support was seen by Acyuta [Vishnu]'; It is also by Shiva's blessing that [[Shesha|Sesa]], Kurma, and others are capable of bearing the burden of that Linga (Part 3: Uttarardha: 11.8-11)\n* After [[Varaha]] lifted the earth out of the waters, [[Vishnu]] 'placed the Elephants of the Quarters, the King of Serpents and the Tortoise for giving her extra support. That receptacle of Mercy ([[Hari]]) willingly applied his own [[Shakti|Sakti]] (power) in an unmanifest form as a support for them all' (Part 4: Venkatacala Mahatmya: 36.20-26); [[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]] also states Kurma supports the earth (Part 15: Reva-Khanda: 182.1-22); and [[Shesha|Sesa]] and Kurma are also later stated to stabilise the Earth (Part 17: Nagara Khanda: 144.117)\n* Kurma is mentioned where [[Vishnu]] is stated to be the annihilator in the form of [[Rudra]] (Part 5: Purusottama-Ksetra Mahatmya:  22.32-43)\n* Kurma is named as one of 12 incarnations of [[Vishnu]], who states to [[Brahma]]:\n\n{{quote|When the sons of [[Kashyapa|Kasyapa]] (i.e. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] and [[Asura|Asuras]]) will churn the ocean for (obtaining) nectar, I [<nowiki/>[[Vishnu]]], assuming the form of a tortoise, will bear on my back Mount Mandara used as the churning rod.|source=Skanda Purana (Unknown translator, 1951), Part 7, Chapter 18, Verses 12-20}}\n\n* In the procedure for [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] [[Mandala]] construction, [[Matsya]] and Kurma should be installed in the South-West and depicted as animals below the waist but in human form above (Part 7: Vasudeva-Mamatmya: 27.32-33)\n*It is stated that the [[Lingam|Linga]] of [[Shiva]] evolved from 'the back of a tortoise (shell)' (Part 9: Dharmaranya Khanda: 19.16) and that 'The [[B\u012bj\u0101|Bija]] [origin] of Vahni (Fire) is accompanied by (the seed of) [[Vayu|Vata]] (Wind) and the Bija of Kurma (tortoise)' (Part 9: Dharmaranya Khanda: 20.20-23)\n*One of the names of the Goddess [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ganga]] is 'Kurmayana', meaning 'Having the tortoise as her vehicle' (Part 10: Purvardha: 29.17-168)\n*It is stated that 'Like a tortoise that withdraws all its limbs, he who withdraws the sense-organs though the proper procedure of [[Pratyahara]] shall become free from sins' (Part 10: Purvardha: 41.102)\n*[[Kumari (goddess)|Kumari]] - the [[Shakti]] of Kurma - has a noose in her hand and is located to the south of [[Lakshmi|Mahalaksmi]] (Part 11: Uttarardha: 70.69)\n*'Kurma' is one of the thousand names ([[Vishnu Sahasranama]]) of [[Vishnu]] (Part 12: Avantiksetra Mahatmya: 63.83)\n*Kurma is listed in the [[Dashavatara]], or ten primary incarnations of Vishnu (Part 15: Reva-Khanda, 151.1-7)\n*[[Bhrigu|Bhrgu]] refers to a Ksetra (temple) that stands on Kaccapa (i.e. a tortoise) and states there will be a city named after Him, ''Bhrgukaccha'' (Part 15: Reva-Khanda: 182.1-22)\n*[[Indradyumna|Indrayumna]] visits a tortoise living in [[Manasa]] Lake, called Mantharaka.

She is a professional communicator in various media: best-selling bilingual novelist, short story writer, screenwriter, advertising creative director, and film producer. Her award-winning literary work is known for addressing bi-cultural themes that deal with the immigration experience of Mexicans crossing over to the United States. Her stories concentrate on family relationships, loss, forgiveness, faith, and self-discovery. A linguist with a sharp ear for dialogue, she explores the dynamics of language in border sub-cultures and the evolution of [[Spanglish]]. Her innovative and brand new style of multiple voice narrations and her cleverly humorous, quirky, and compassionate stories with a feminine angle capture the magical reality of everyday life and place her among the top Latin American female writers. Her work has been translated into over 21 languages and is currently read in more than 85 countries.\n\n== Life and education ==\n[[Ram\u00f3n Corral]], who was the Vice-president of Mexico during the 30-year dictatorship of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], which finally came to an end with the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910, was Escand\u00f3n's maternal great-grandfather. [[Jos\u00e9 de Escand\u00f3n y Helguera]], 1st Count of Sierra Gorda, founder and first governor of [[Nuevo Santander]], currently part of the Mexican state of [[Tamaulipas]], is her paternal ancestor.\n\nHer father, Julio Escand\u00f3n, was a contractor in the construction business; and her mother, Mar\u00eda Amparo de Escand\u00f3n, headed professional training for the [[Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare (Mexico)|Labor Department]] in Mexico. Mar\u00eda is the eldest of four children and spent her childhood in Mexico City, jumping from one elementary school to the next due to disciplinary issues. Her vivid imagination led her to constant lying since she was seven years old, with the resulting problems both at home and at school. That was until her grandmother, Mar\u00eda Amparo Obreg\u00f3n, taught her the difference between lies and story telling. She said: \u201cThey are the same, but one is hurtful and the other is entertaining. The difference resides in the intention. Telling lies is not a bad thing, as long as everyone knows you made them up.\u201d Having received this approval to lie, Escand\u00f3n began to write and found a creative vehicle for her fantasies. At the age of thirteen, she was sent to study in rural Minnesota, near the pig farms, where she discovered the English language. Upon her return to Mexico, she read [[One Hundred Years of Solitude]] by [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]], and under his influence, initiated her career as a narrator.\n\nEscand\u00f3n studied Communications at [[Universidad An\u00e1huac]] and Universidad Nuevo Mundo in Mexico City from 1977 to 1982. She was briefly married to Luis Eduardo Gil, and later immigrated to the United States where she co-founded Acento,<ref>[http://www.acento.com Acento]</ref> currently one of the largest independent Hispanic advertising agencies in the US, with Benito Mart\u00ednez Creel, who would become her second husband. She went back to studying but in the arena of visual arts. She took Ceramics at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]] in Los Angeles, California, from 1983 to 1985. After living in the US for ten years and having published a number of short stories in Spanish, in 1993, she entered a creative writing workshop at UCLA ([[University of California Los Angeles]]) Extension, to learn how to write in English. Just a year later, in 1994, she was invited to become part of the teaching staff. To date, she continues to offer Creative Writing and Magical Realism workshops at UCLA Extension.<ref>[https://www.uclaextension.edu UCLA Extension]</ref>\n\nEscand\u00f3n has two children (Zooey and I\u00f1aki) by her ex-husband, Benito Mart\u00ednez-Creel (divorced in 2006). She currently lives in Los Angeles, California and Mexico City with Pedro Haas.\n\n==Literary career==\nMar\u00eda Amparo Escand\u00f3n developed her career in the early 1970s during the [[Latin American Boom]]. Her first published short story appeared in the Mexican literary journal ''Plural'' in 1973 when she was sixteen. The works of masters [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]], [[Octavio Paz]], [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Mario Benedetti]], [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], and others influenced her work. Convinced that men had better opportunities to succeed as writers than women, she wrote her first short stories from the male perspective. It was until she moved to Los Angeles in 1983 when she discovered women writers like [[Toni Morrison]] and [[Sandra Cisneros]] that she shifted her perspective and focused on women's issues and the Mexican American experience in the US.\n\nLiving in California, Escand\u00f3n began to view her culture of origin from an expatriate distance that provided her a deeper analysis of ingrained traditions, like the Mexicans' unique practice of Catholicism influenced by Pre-Columbian beliefs, women's position in society, female identity, illegal immigration, US-Mexico relations, and government corruption, all topics that she later drew on to write her novels and non-fiction work. In 1999, she wrote her first novel, ''Esperanza's Box of Saints'' published by [[Simon & Schuster]], and its Spanish version, ''Santitos'', published by Plaza & Jan\u00e9s, now [[Random House]]. ''Esperanza's Box of Saints'' deals with the universal fear of losing a child, with a woman's search for identity and a journey\u2014both geographical and spiritual\u2014that take Esperanza, the lead character, through sordid brothels throughout Mexico and into Los Angeles. Escand\u00f3n's novel has been the number one best seller in the ''Los Angeles Times'' Best Sellers List. She has been named the writer to watch for 1999 by Newsweek magazine and the writer to watch for 2000 by the ''Los Angeles Times''. Her second novel, ''Gonz\u00e1lez & Daughter Trucking Co.'', was published in English by [[Three Rivers Press]] in 2005 and in Spanish by Vintage Espa\u00f1ol under the title ''Transportes Gonz\u00e1lez e Hija''. It is set in a Mexican prison and the roads of America. It deals with women's relationships, guilt, crime, passion, corruption and forgiveness in a context of a hybrid border culture. In this novel Escand\u00f3n approaches her personal relationship with her own father who died of a heart attack three days after she finished writing her manuscript. She addresses paternal possessiveness and gender double standards in the Mexican society. The novel also reflects a linguistic reality in bicultural California exploring the vernacular merge of Spanish and English ([[Spanglish]]), as well as different sub-culture lingoes.\n\nAside from teaching Creative Writing at UCLA Extension, Escand\u00f3n has been an advisor at the [[Sundance Institute|Sundance Screenwriters Labs]] in Mexico and Brazil, as well as at the Fundaci\u00f3n Contenidos de Creaci\u00f3n Fiction Workshops in Barcelona, and participates as a mentor for young upcoming minority writers at the PEN Center's Emerging Voices Program.

The film was produced by [[John Sayles]] and directed in Mexico by [[Alejandro Springall]]. The film was the third largest grossing Mexican film in Mexico in 1999 and was successfully released in Spain and Latin America in January 2000. To date, the film has received awards in 14 film festivals around the world, such as the Latin Cinema Award at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], Best Film at the Guadalajara Film Festival, Best Actress at the Latin American Film Festival in Lima, Peru, Best Film at the Los Angeles Latino Film Festival, Best Actress at the Festival International du Film d'Amiens, Best Film at the Santa Fe International Film Festival, Grand Jury Award at the Cartagena International Film Festival, Best Opera Prima at the Heraldos Awards in Mexico, Special Jury Award at the Rencontres Cin\u00e9mas de Toulouse, and Best Opera Prima by the Critique Fran\u00e7aise (D\u00e9couverte de la Critique Fran\u00e7aise).\n\nEscand\u00f3n has recently completed the screenplay based on her novel ''Gonz\u00e1lez & Daughter Trucking Co.'' and the film is currently in active development at her own production company, The Other Truth Productions.<ref>[http://www.theothertruthproductions.com/index.php The Other Truth Productions]</ref>\n\n==Advertising career==\nEscand\u00f3n began working as a copywriter in 1982 at Guti\u00e9rrez Silva in Mexico City while studying her degree in Communications. She moved to Los Angeles in 1983 to start Acento,<ref>[http://www.acento.com Acento]</ref> today one of the nation's top 20 full-service agencies serving the U.S. Latino and Latin American markets in areas like creative, media planning and buying, production, direct marketing, public relations, grassroots, promotions, event marketing and entertainment. After selling Acento<ref>[http://www.acento.com Acento]</ref> in 2009 and complying with a three-year non-compete, she founded Leagas Delaney America<ref>[http://www.leagasdelaney.us Leagas Delaney America]</ref> in 2012, a joint venture with Leagas Delaney LTD,<ref>[http://www.leagasdelaney.com Leagas Delaney LTD]</ref> a London-based advertising agency owned and operated by Tim Delaney and Margaret Johnson OBE. The agency established in 1980 is known in the UK for its emphasis on distinctive creative work for luxury brands such as Patek Philippe [http://www.patek.com], Glenfiddich [http://www.glenfiddich.com/], Harrods [http://www.harrods.com/], as well as other brands including the British Red Cross [http://www.redcross.org.uk/], InterContinental Hotels [http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/intercontinental/hotels/us/es/reservation], Timberland [http://www.timberland.com/], Adidas [https://web.archive.org/web/20150823070258/http://www.adidas.com/], and the Ecuador Ministry of Tourism [http://www.ecuador.travel/]. The Leagas Delaney Group is privately owned with offices in London, Hamburg, Milan, Prague, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Los Angeles. Escand\u00f3n, heading the Los Angeles office, is known for her views on consumer behavior and cultural developments that have reshaped the way brands communicate with their audiences.

She is a professional communicator in various media: best-selling bilingual novelist, short story writer, screenwriter, advertising creative director, and film producer. Her award-winning literary work is known for addressing bi-cultural themes that deal with the immigration experience of Mexicans crossing over to the United States. Her stories concentrate on family relationships, loss, forgiveness, faith, and self-discovery. A linguist with a sharp ear for dialogue, she explores the dynamics of language in border sub-cultures and the evolution of [[Spanglish]]. Her innovative and brand new style of multiple voice narrations and her cleverly humorous, quirky, and compassionate stories with a feminine angle capture the magical reality of everyday life and place her among the top Latin American female writers. Her work has been translated into over 21 languages and is currently read in more than 85 countries.\n\n== Life and education ==\n[[Ram\u00f3n Corral]], who was the Vice-president of Mexico during the 30-year dictatorship of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], which finally came to an end with the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910, was Escand\u00f3n's maternal great-grandfather. [[Jos\u00e9 de Escand\u00f3n y Helguera]], 1st Count of Sierra Gorda, founder and first governor of [[Nuevo Santander]], currently part of the Mexican state of [[Tamaulipas]], is her paternal ancestor.\n\nHer father, Julio Escand\u00f3n, was a contractor in the construction business; and her mother, Mar\u00eda Amparo de Escand\u00f3n, headed professional training for the [[Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare (Mexico)|Labor Department]] in Mexico. Mar\u00eda is the eldest of four children and spent her childhood in Mexico City, jumping from one elementary school to the next due to disciplinary issues. Her vivid imagination led her to constant lying since she was seven years old, with the resulting problems both at home and at school. That was until her grandmother, Mar\u00eda Amparo Obreg\u00f3n, taught her the difference between lies and story telling. She said: \u201cThey are the same, but one is hurtful and the other is entertaining. The difference resides in the intention. Telling lies is not a bad thing, as long as everyone knows you made them up.\u201d Having received this approval to lie, Escand\u00f3n began to write and found a creative vehicle for her fantasies. At the age of thirteen, she was sent to study in rural Minnesota, near the pig farms, where she discovered the English language. Upon her return to Mexico, she read [[One Hundred Years of Solitude]] by [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]], and under his influence, initiated her career as a narrator.\n\nEscand\u00f3n studied Communications at [[Universidad An\u00e1huac]] and Universidad Nuevo Mundo in Mexico City from 1977 to 1982. She was briefly married to Luis Eduardo Gil, and later immigrated to the United States where she co-founded Acento,<ref>[http://www.acento.com Acento]</ref> currently one of the largest independent Hispanic advertising agencies in the US, with Benito Mart\u00ednez Creel, who would become her second husband. She went back to studying but in the arena of visual arts. She took Ceramics at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]] in Los Angeles, California, from 1983 to 1985. After living in the US for ten years and having published a number of short stories in Spanish, in 1993, she entered a creative writing workshop at UCLA ([[University of California Los Angeles]]) Extension, to learn how to write in English. Just a year later, in 1994, she was invited to become part of the teaching staff. To date, she continues to offer Creative Writing and Magical Realism workshops at UCLA Extension.<ref>[https://www.uclaextension.edu UCLA Extension]</ref>\n\nEscand\u00f3n has two children (Zooey and I\u00f1aki) by her ex-husband, Benito Mart\u00ednez-Creel (divorced in 2006). She currently lives in Los Angeles, California and Mexico City with Pedro Haas.\n\n==Literary career==\nMar\u00eda Amparo Escand\u00f3n developed her career in the early 1970s during the [[Latin American Boom]]. Her first published short story appeared in the Mexican literary journal ''Plural'' in 1973 when she was sixteen. The works of masters [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]], [[Octavio Paz]], [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Mario Benedetti]], [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], and others influenced her work. Convinced that men had better opportunities to succeed as writers than women, she wrote her first short stories from the male perspective. It was until she moved to Los Angeles in 1983 when she discovered women writers like [[Toni Morrison]] and [[Sandra Cisneros]] that she shifted her perspective and focused on women's issues and the Mexican American experience in the US.\n\nLiving in California, Escand\u00f3n began to view her culture of origin from an expatriate distance that provided her a deeper analysis of ingrained traditions, like the Mexicans' unique practice of Catholicism influenced by Pre-Columbian beliefs, women's position in society, female identity, illegal immigration, US-Mexico relations, and government corruption, all topics that she later drew on to write her novels and non-fiction work. In 1999, she wrote her first novel, ''Esperanza's Box of Saints'' published by [[Simon & Schuster]], and its Spanish version, ''Santitos'', published by Plaza & Jan\u00e9s, now [[Random House]]. ''Esperanza's Box of Saints'' deals with the universal fear of losing a child, with a woman's search for identity and a journey\u2014both geographical and spiritual\u2014that take Esperanza, the lead character, through sordid brothels throughout Mexico and into Los Angeles. Escand\u00f3n's novel has been the number one best seller in the ''Los Angeles Times'' Best Sellers List. She has been named the writer to watch for 1999 by Newsweek magazine and the writer to watch for 2000 by the ''Los Angeles Times''. Her second novel, ''Gonz\u00e1lez & Daughter Trucking Co.'', was published in English by [[Three Rivers Press]] in 2005 and in Spanish by Vintage Espa\u00f1ol under the title ''Transportes Gonz\u00e1lez e Hija''. It is set in a Mexican prison and the roads of America. It deals with women's relationships, guilt, crime, passion, corruption and forgiveness in a context of a hybrid border culture. In this novel Escand\u00f3n approaches her personal relationship with her own father who died of a heart attack three days after she finished writing her manuscript. She addresses paternal possessiveness and gender double standards in the Mexican society. The novel also reflects a linguistic reality in bicultural California exploring the vernacular merge of Spanish and English ([[Spanglish]]), as well as different sub-culture lingoes.\n\nAside from teaching Creative Writing at UCLA Extension, Escand\u00f3n has been an advisor at the [[Sundance Institute|Sundance Screenwriters Labs]] in Mexico and Brazil, as well as at the Fundaci\u00f3n Contenidos de Creaci\u00f3n Fiction Workshops in Barcelona, and participates as a mentor for young upcoming minority writers at the PEN Center's Emerging Voices Program.

The film was produced by [[John Sayles]] and directed in Mexico by [[Alejandro Springall]]. The film was the third largest grossing Mexican film in Mexico in 1999 and was successfully released in Spain and Latin America in January 2000. To date, the film has received awards in 14 film festivals around the world, such as the Latin Cinema Award at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], Best Film at the Guadalajara Film Festival, Best Actress at the Latin American Film Festival in Lima, Peru, Best Film at the Los Angeles Latino Film Festival, Best Actress at the Festival International du Film d'Amiens, Best Film at the Santa Fe International Film Festival, Grand Jury Award at the Cartagena International Film Festival, Best Opera Prima at the Heraldos Awards in Mexico, Special Jury Award at the Rencontres Cin\u00e9mas de Toulouse, and Best Opera Prima by the Critique Fran\u00e7aise (D\u00e9couverte de la Critique Fran\u00e7aise).\n\nEscand\u00f3n has recently completed the screenplay based on her novel ''Gonz\u00e1lez & Daughter Trucking Co.'' and the film is currently in active development at her own production company, The Other Truth Productions.<ref>[http://www.theothertruthproductions.com/index.php The Other Truth Productions]</ref>\n\n==Advertising career==\nEscand\u00f3n began working as a copywriter in 1982 at Guti\u00e9rrez Silva in Mexico City while studying her degree in Communications. She moved to Los Angeles in 1983 to start Acento,<ref>[http://www.acento.com Acento]</ref> today one of the nation's top 20 full-service agencies serving the U.S. Latino and Latin American markets in areas like creative, media planning and buying, production, direct marketing, public relations, grassroots, promotions, event marketing and entertainment. After selling Acento<ref>[http://www.acento.com Acento]</ref> in 2009 and complying with a three-year non-compete, she founded Leagas Delaney America<ref>[http://www.leagasdelaney.us Leagas Delaney America]</ref> in 2012, a joint venture with Leagas Delaney LTD,<ref>[http://www.leagasdelaney.com Leagas Delaney LTD]</ref> a London-based advertising agency owned and operated by Tim Delaney and Margaret Johnson OBE.

According to Daverio, there is no evidence of the middle name \"Alexander\" that appears in some sources.</ref> ({{IPA-de|\u02c8\u0283u\u02d0man|lang}}; 8 June 1810{{spaced ndash}}29 July 1856) was a German composer, pianist, and influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a [[virtuoso]] pianist. His teacher, [[Friedrich Wieck]], a German pianist, had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing.\n\nIn 1840, after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck, who opposed the marriage, Schumann married Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]]. A lifelong partnership in music began, as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy. Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer [[Johannes Brahms]].\n\nUntil 1840, Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano. Later, he composed piano and orchestral works, and many [[Lied]]er (songs for voice and piano). He composed four [[Symphony|symphonies]], one [[opera]], and other orchestral, [[choral]], and [[chamber music|chamber]] works. His best-known works include ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', ''[[Kinderszenen]]'', ''[[Kreisleriana]]'', and the ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]''. Schumann was known for infusing his music with characters through motifs, as well as references to works of literature. These characters bled into his editorial writing in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (New Journal for Music), a [[Leipzig]]-based publication that he co-founded.\n\nSchumann suffered from a [[mental disorder]] that first manifested in 1833 as a severe [[melancholic depression|melancholic depressive]] episode\u2014which recurred several times alternating with phases of \"exaltation\" and increasingly also delusional ideas of being poisoned or threatened with metallic items. What is now thought to have been a combination of [[bipolar disorder]] and perhaps [[mercury poisoning]] led to \"manic\" and \"depressive\" periods in Schumann's compositional productivity. After a suicide attempt in 1854, Schumann was admitted at his own request to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] in [[Endenich]] near [[Bonn]]. Diagnosed with ''psychotic [[melancholia]]'', he died of pneumonia two years later at the age of 46, without recovering from his mental illness.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Schumannhaus ALT.JPG|thumb|left|Schumann's birth house, now the [[Robert Schumann House]], after an anonymous colourized lithograph]]\n[[File:Rob.Schumann.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Robert Schumann in the museum of [[Zwickau]]]]\n\nSchumann was born in [[Zwickau]], in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (today [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]]), the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (n\u00e9e Schnabel) and August Schumann.<ref>{{harvnb|Ostwald|1985|p=11}}</ref> Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music\u2014undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist.<ref>{{cite book\n | author=Robert Schumann\n | editor = Konrad Wolff\n | others = Translated by Paul Rosenfeld\n | title = On Music and Musicians\n | year = 1982\n | publisher=University of California Press\n | isbn = 978-0-520-04685-6 }}</ref>\n\nAt age seven, Schumann began studying general music and piano with Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school. The boy immediately developed a love of music, and worked on his own compositions, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The ''Universal Journal of Music'' 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, \"It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody,\u2014ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.\"<ref>[[Eric Himy]], pianist, Recording ''Homage to Schumann'', CD Notes, (Centaur, 2006), CEN 2858, chosen by BBC December 2007 as CD of the month, includes \"Kinderscenen\", \"Tr\u00e4umerei\"</ref>\n\nAt age 14, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled ''Portraits of Famous Men''. While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], as well as [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and the [[Tragedy#Ancient Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]]. His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was [[Jean Paul]], a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels ''Juniusabende'', completed in 1826, and ''Selene''.\n\nSchumann's interest in music was sparked by attending a performance of [[Ignaz Moscheles]] playing at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], and he later developed an interest in the works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. His father, who had encouraged his musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16. Thereafter, neither his mother nor his guardian encouraged him to pursue a music career. In 1828, Schumann left high school, and after a trip during which he met the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] in Munich, he left to study law at the University of Leipzig under family pressure. But in Leipzig Schumann instead focused on improvisation, song composition, and writing novels. He also began to seriously study piano with Friedrick Wieck, a well-known piano teacher. In 1829, he continued his law studies in [[Heidelberg]], where he became a lifelong member of [[Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg]].\n\n{{See also|German Student Corps|Corps}}\n\n===1830\u201334===\n[[File:Robert-Schumann-Haus.JPG|thumb|upright|Schumann's music room in Zwickau]]\n\nDuring [[Eastertide]] 1830, he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] play in [[Frankfurt]]. In July he wrote to his mother, \"My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law.\" With her permission, by Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master [[Friedrich Wieck]], who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him.<ref>{{harvnb|Perrey|2007|p=11}}</ref> During his studies with Wieck, some stories claim that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand. Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger by using a mechanical device that held back one finger while he exercised the others\u2014which was supposed to strengthen the weakest fingers.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last1=Jensen|first1=Eric Frederick|title=Schumann|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195346060|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdGlFgzLW6MC&pg=PA70|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> [[Clara Schumann]] discredited the story, saying the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself referred to it as \"an affliction of the whole hand.\" Some argue that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was not likely caused by a finger strengthening device.<ref>{{cite journal| jstor= 954772 | first= Eric| last= Sams | title= Schumann's hand injury| journal= The Musical Times| volume= 112| pages= 1156\u20131159| number= 1546 |date= December 1971| doi= 10.2307/954772}}</ref>\n\nSchumann abandoned the idea of a concert career and devoted himself instead to composition. To this end he began a study of music theory under [[Heinrich Dorn]], a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the [[Leipzig Opera]].\n\n====''Papillons''====\nSchumann's fusion of literary ideas with musical ones\u2014known as [[program music]]\u2014may have first taken shape in ''[[Papillons]]'', Op. 2 (''Butterflies''), a musical portrayal of events in [[Jean Paul]]'s novel ''Die Flegeljahre''. In a letter from Leipzig dated April 1832, Schumann bids his brothers, \"Read the last scene in Jean Paul's ''Flegeljahre'' as soon as possible, because the ''Papillons'' are intended as a musical representation of that masquerade.\" This inspiration is foreshadowed to some extent in his first written criticism\u2014an 1831 essay on [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Variations on \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" (Chopin)|variations on a theme]] from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', published in the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]''. In it, Schumann\ncreates imaginary characters who discuss Chopin's work: Florestan (the embodiment of Schumann's passionate, voluble side) and Eusebius (his dreamy, introspective side)\u2014the counterparts of Vult and Walt in ''Flegeljahre.'' They call on a third, Meister Raro, for his opinion. Raro may represent either the composer himself, Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], or the combination of the two (Cla'''ra''' + '''Ro'''bert).\n\nIn the winter of 1832, at age 22, Schumann visited relatives in Zwickau and [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]], where he performed the first movement of his ''Symphony in G minor'' (without opus number, known as the \"Zwickauer\"). In Zwickau, the music was performed at a concert given by Clara Wieck, who was then just 13 years old. On this occasion Clara played bravura Variations by [[Henri Herz]], a composer whom Schumann was already deriding as a philistine.<ref>Robert Schumann, musical Journal</ref> Schumann's mother said to Clara, \"You must marry my Robert one day.\"<ref>Berthold Litzmann 1910</ref> The ''Symphony in G minor'' was not published during Schumann's lifetime but has been played and recorded in recent times.\n\nThe 1833 deaths of Schumann's brother Julius and his sister-in-law Rosalie in the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829-1851)|worldwide cholera pandemic]] brought on a [[Major depressive disorder|severe depressive]] episode.\n\n[[File:Robert Schumann in youth.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A youthful Robert Schumann]]\n\n====''Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik''====\nBy spring 1834, Schumann had sufficiently recovered to inaugurate ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik|Die Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (\"New Journal for Music\"), first published on 3 April 1834. In his writings, Schumann created a fictional music society based on people in his life, called the ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndler]]'', named after the biblical King David who fought against the Philistines. Schumann published most of his critical writings in the journal, and often lambasted the popular taste for flashy technical displays from figures whom Schumann perceived as inferior composers, or \"philistines\". Schumann campaigned to revive interest in major composers of the past, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. He also promoted the work of some contemporary composers, including [[Chopin]] (about whom Schumann famously wrote, \"Hats off, Gentlemen! A genius!\")<ref>[[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]'s notes, Favourite Chopin</ref> and [[Hector Berlioz]], whom he praised for creating music of substance. On the other hand, Schumann disparaged the school of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. Among Schumann's associates at this time were composers [[Norbert Burgm\u00fcller]] and [[Ludwig Schuncke]] (to whom Schumann dedicated his ''Toccata in C'').\n\nDuring the summer of 1834 Schumann became engaged to 16-year-old Ernestine von Fricken, the adopted daughter of a rich Bohemian-born noble. In August 1835, he learned that Ernestine von Fricken was born illegitimate, which meant that she would have no dowry. Fearful that her limited means would force him to earn his living like a \"day-labourer,\" Schumann made a complete break with her toward the end of the year. He felt a growing attraction to 15-year-old Clara Wieck. They made mutual declarations of love in December in Zwickau, where Clara appeared in concert. His budding romance with Clara was disrupted when her father learned of their trysts during the Christmas holidays. He summarily forbade them further meetings, and ordered all their correspondence burnt.\n\n====''Carnaval''====\n''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', Op. 9 (1834) is one of Schumann's most characteristic piano works. Schumann begins nearly every section of ''Carnaval'' with a [[musical cryptogram]], the musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell [[A\u0161|Asch]] (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C, and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As, C and H respectively), the [[Bohemia]]n town in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann's own name. Eusebius and Florestan, the imaginary figures appearing so often in his critical writings, also appear, alongside brilliant imitations of Chopin and Paganini. To each of these characters he devotes a section of ''Carnaval''. The work comes to a close with a march of the ''Davidsb\u00fcndler''\u2014the league of [[King David]]'s men against the [[Philistines]]\u2014in which may be heard the clear accents of truth in contest with the dull clamour of falsehood embodied in a [[Musical quotation|quotation]] from the seventeenth century ''[[Grossvater Tanz|Grandfather's Dance]]''. The march, a step nearly always in duple meter, is here in 3/4 time (triple meter). The work ends in joy and a degree of mock-triumph. In ''Carnaval'', Schumann went further than in ''Papillons'', by conceiving the story as well as the musical representation (and also displaying a maturation of compositional resource).\n\n===1835\u201339===\nOn 3 October 1835, Schumann met [[Felix Mendelssohn]] at Wieck's house in Leipzig, and his enthusiastic appreciation of that artist<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=134}}</ref> was shown with the same generous freedom that distinguished his acknowledgement of the greatness of Chopin and other colleagues, and later prompted him to publicly pronounce the then-unknown [[Johannes Brahms]] a genius.\n[[File:Andreas Staub - Clara Wieck (Lithographie 1839, cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Clara Wieck]] in an idealized lithograph by [[Andreas Staub]], c. 1839]]\n[[File:Friedrich Wieck um 1838.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Wieck]] in a sketch by [[Pauline Viardot-Garcia]], around 1838]]\n\nIn 1837 Schumann published his ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', a complex set of ''\u00e9tude''-like variations written in 1834\u20131835, which demanded a finished piano technique. These variations were based on a theme by the adoptive father of Ernestine von Fricken. The work\u2014described as \"one of the peaks of the piano literature, lofty in conception and faultless in workmanship\" [Hutcheson]\u2014was dedicated to the young English composer [[William Sterndale Bennett]], for whom Schumann had had a high regard when they worked together in Leipzig.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze]]'', Op.&nbsp;6, (also published in 1837 despite the low opus number) literally \"Dances of the League of David\", is an embodiment of the struggle between enlightened Romanticism and musical philistinism. Schumann credited the two sides of his character with the composition of the work (the more passionate numbers are signed F. (Florestan) and the more dreamy signed E. (Eusebius)). The work begins with the \"motto of C.&nbsp;W.\" (Clara Wieck) denoting her support for the ideals of the ''Davidsbund''. The ''Bund'' was a music society of Schumann's imagination, members of which were kindred spirits (as he saw them) such as Chopin, Paganini and Clara, as well as the personalized Florestan and Eusebius.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''[[Kinderszenen]]'', Op. 15, completed in 1838 and a favourite of Schumann's piano works, depicts the innocence and playfulness of childhood. The \"Tr\u00e4umerei\" in F major, No. 7 of the set, is one of the most famous piano pieces ever written, and has been performed in myriad forms and transcriptions. It has been the favourite [[Encore (concert)|encore]] of several great pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]]. Melodic and deceptively simple, the piece is \"complex\" in its harmonic structure.<ref>[[Alban Berg]], replying to charges that modern music was overly complex, pointed out that ''Kinderszenen'' is constructed on a complex base.</ref>\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Kreisleriana]], Op. 16 (1838)\n| filename    = Robert Schumann Kreisleriana Op. 16 N3 Giorgi Latsabidze.ogg\n| title       = N8.

[[Johannes Kreisler]] was a fictional musician created by poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], and characterized as a \"romantic brought into contact with reality.\" Schumann used the figure to express \"fantastic and mad\" emotional states. According to [[Ernest Hutcheson#Works|Hutcheson (\"The Literature of the Piano\")]], this work is \"among the finest efforts of Schumann's genius. He never surpassed the searching beauty of the slow movements (Nos. 2, 4, 6) or the urgent passion of others (Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7) [\u2026] To appreciate it a high level of aesthetic intelligence is required [\u2026] This is no facile music, there is severity alike in its beauty and its passion.\"\n\nThe ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]'', Op. 17, composed in the summer of 1836, is a work of passion and deep pathos, imbued with the spirit of the late Beethoven. Schumann intended to use proceeds from sales of the work toward the construction of [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|a monument to Beethoven]], who had died in 1827. The first movement of the ''Fantasie'' contains a [[Musical quotation|musical quote]] from Beethoven's song cycle, ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'', Op. 98 (at the Adagio coda, taken from the last song of the cycle). The original titles of the movements were ''Ruins'', ''Triumphal Arch'', and ''The Starry Crown''. According to [[Franz Liszt]],<ref>Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''</ref> who played the work for Schumann and to whom it was dedicated, the ''Fantasie'' was apt to be played too heavily, and should have a dreamier (''tr\u00e4umerisch'') character than vigorous German pianists tended to impart. Liszt also said: \"It is a noble work, worthy of Beethoven, whose career, by the way, it is supposed to represent\".<ref>Anton Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''. London, 1893.</ref> Again, according to Hutcheson: \"No words can describe the Phantasie, no quotations set forth the majesty of its genius. It must suffice to say that it is Schumann's greatest work in large form for piano solo.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Arabeske (Schumann)|Arabeske in C major, Op. 18 (1839)]]\n| filename    = Schumann-arabeske-andrea-valori.ogg\n| title       = Arabeske (Schumann)\n| description = [[Mario Andrea Valori]], piano, 2011\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nAfter a visit to [[Vienna]], during which he discovered [[Franz Schubert]]'s previously unknown [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 9 in C]], in 1839 Schumann wrote the ''[[Faschingsschwank aus Wien]]'' (''Carnival Prank from Vienna''). Most of the joke is in the central section of the first movement, which makes a thinly veiled reference to ''[[La Marseillaise]]''. (Vienna had banned the song due to harsh memories of [[Napoleon]]'s invasion.) The festive mood does not preclude moments of melancholic introspection in the Intermezzo.\n\n===1840\u201349===\nFrom 1832 to 1839, Schumann wrote almost exclusively for piano, but in 1840 alone he wrote at least 138 songs. Indeed, 1840 (the ''Liederjahr'' or ''year of song'') is highly significant in Schumann's musical legacy, despite his earlier deriding of works for piano and voice as inferior.\n\nAfter a long and acrimonious legal battle with her father, Schumann married Clara Wieck on 12 September 1840, at [[Leipzig-Sch\u00f6nefeld|Sch\u00f6nefeld]], the day before her 21st birthday. Had they waited another day, they would no longer have required her father's consent. Their marriage supported a remarkable business partnership, with Clara  acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidante to her husband. Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after their marriage, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren.\n\nPrior to the legal case and subsequent marriage, the lovers exchanged love letters and rendezvoused in secret. Robert often waited for hours in a cafe in a nearby city just to see Clara for a few minutes after one of her concerts. The strain of this long courtship and its consummation may have led to this great outpouring of Lieder (vocal songs with piano accompaniment). This is evident in ''Widmung'', for example, where he uses the melody from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|''Ave Maria'']] in the postlude in homage to Clara. Schumann's biographers attribute the sweetness, doubt, and despair of these songs to the emotions aroused by his love for Clara and the uncertainties of their future together.\n\nRobert and Clara had eight children, Emil (1846\u20131847), who died at 1 year; Marie (1841\u20131929); Elise (1843\u20131928); Julie (1845\u20131872); Ludwig (1848\u20131899); Ferdinand (1849\u20131891); [[Eugenie Schumann|Eugenie]] (1851\u20131938); and Felix (1854\u20131879).\n\n[[File:Robert and Clara Schumann.jpg|thumb|The stylized profiles of Clara and Robert Schumann]]\n\nHis chief song-cycles in this period were settings of the ''[[Liederkreis, Op. 39|Liederkreis]]'' of [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], Op. 39 (depicting a series of moods relating to or inspired by nature); the ''[[Frauenliebe und -leben]]'' of [[Adelbert von Chamisso|Chamisso]], Op. 42 (relating the tale of a woman's marriage, childbirth and widowhood); the ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' of [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], Op. 48 (depicting a lover rejected, but coming to terms with his painful loss through renunciation and forgiveness); and ''Myrthen'', a collection of songs, including poems by Goethe, [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert|R\u00fcckert]], Heine, Byron, [[Robert Burns|Burns]] and Moore. The songs ''Belsatzar'', Op. 57 and ''Die beiden Grenadiere'', Op. 49, both to Heine's words, show Schumann at his best as a ballad writer, although the dramatic ballad is less congenial to him than the introspective lyric. The Op. 35, 40 and 98a sets (words by [[Justinus Kerner]], Chamisso and Goethe respectively), although less well known, also contain songs of lyric and dramatic quality.\n\n{{listen\n | header       = Andante and Variations, Op. 46 (1843)<br />Performed by Neal and Nancy O'Doan (pianos), Carter Enyeart and Toby Saks (cellos) and Christopher Leuba (horn)\n | filename     = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Introduction, Theme and Variations 01-05.ogg\n | title        = Introduction, Theme and Variations 1\u20135\n | format       = [[ogg]]\n | description  =\n | filename2    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 06-10.ogg\n | title2       = Variations 6\u201310\n | format2      = [[ogg]]\n | description2 =\n | filename3    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 11-15.ogg\n | title3       = Variations 11\u201315\n | format3      = [[ogg]]\n | description3 =\n | image        = none\n}}\n\nIn 1841 he wrote two of his four symphonies, [[Symphony No. 1 (Schumann)|No. 1 in B-flat]], Op. 38, ''Spring'' and [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|No. 4 in D minor]] (the latter a pioneering work in \"cyclic form\", was performed that year but published only much later after revision and extensive re-orchestration as Op. 120). He devoted 1842 to composing chamber music, including the [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E-flat]], Op. 44, now one of his best known and most admired works; the [[Piano Quartet (Schumann)|Piano Quartet]] and [[String Quartets (Schumann)|three string quartets]]. In 1843 he wrote ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'', his first attempt at concerted vocal music, an [[oratorio]] style work based on ''[[Lalla-Rookh]]'' by [[Thomas Moore]]. After this, his compositions were not confined to any one form during any particular period.\n\nThe stage in his life when he was deeply engaged in setting Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' to music (1844\u201353) was a turbulent one for his health. He spent the first half of 1844 with Clara on tour in Russia, and his depression grew worse as he felt inferior to Clara as a musician. On returning to Germany, he abandoned his editorial work and left Leipzig for [[Dresden]], where he suffered from persistent \"[[nervous prostration]]\". As soon as he began to work, he was seized with fits of shivering and an apprehension of death, experiencing an abhorrence of high places, all metal instruments (even keys), and drugs. Schumann's diaries also state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the [[A (musical note)#Designation by octave|note A5]] sounding in his ears.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis state of unease and [[neurasthenia]] is reflected in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Schumann)|Symphony in C]], numbered second but third in order of composition, in which the composer explores states of exhaustion, obsession, and depression, culminating in Beethovenian spiritual triumph. Also published in 1845 was his [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54]], originally conceived and performed as a one-movement ''Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra'' in 1841. It is one of the most popular and oft-recorded of all piano concertos; according to Hutcheson \"Schumann achieved a masterly work and we inherited the finest piano concerto since Mozart and Beethoven\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Robert u Clara Schumann 1847.jpg|thumb|left|Robert and Clara Schumann in 1847, lithograph with a personal dedication]]\n\nIn 1846, he felt he had recovered. In the winter, the Schumanns revisited Vienna, traveling to [[Prague]] and Berlin in the spring of 1847 and in the summer to Zwickau, where he was received with enthusiasm. This pleased him, since until that time he was famous in only Dresden and Leipzig.\n\nHis only opera, ''[[Genoveva]]'', Op. 81, premiered in Spring 1850.{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=334}} In it, Schumann attempted to abolish [[recitative]], which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on [[Richard Wagner]]; Schumann's consistently flowing melody can be seen as a forerunner to Wagner's ''Melos''). The subject of ''Genoveva''\u2014based on [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]]'s plays\u2014was not seen an ideal choice. The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire. As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, \"Do you know my prayer as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera.' Here is a real field for enterprise ... something simple, profound, German\". And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: ''[[Nibelung]]en'', ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]''.\n\nThe music to [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'' was written in 1849, the overture of which is one of Schumann's most frequently performed orchestral works. The [[May Uprising in Dresden|insurrection of Dresden]] caused Schumann to move to [[Kreischa]], a little village a few miles outside the city. In August 1849, on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's birth, completed scenes of Schumann's ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' were performed in Dresden, Leipzig and [[Weimar]]. Liszt gave him assistance and encouragement. The rest of the work was written later in 1849, and the overture (which Schumann described as \"one of the sturdiest of [his] creations\") in 1853.\n\n===After 1850===\n[[File:Schumann-photo1850.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Schumann in an 1850 [[daguerreotype]]]]\n\nFrom 1850 to 1854, Schumann composed in a wide variety of genres. Critics have disputed the quality of his work at this time; a widely held view has been that his music showed signs of mental breakdown and creative decay. More recently, critics have suggested that the changes in style may be explained by \"lucid experimentation\".<ref name=\":1\">Daverio, Grove online, 19</ref>\n\nIn 1850, Schumann succeeded [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as musical director at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], but he was a poor conductor and quickly aroused the opposition of the musicians. According to [[Harold C. Schonberg]], in his 1967 ''The Great Conductors'': \"The great composer was impossible on the platform ... There is something heartrending about poor Schumann's epochal inefficiency as a conductor.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse |url-access=registration |author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]] |title=The Great Conductors |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1967 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse/page/126 126]}}</ref> His contract was eventually terminated. By the end of that year he completed his [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Symphony No. 3, \"Rhenish\"]] (a work containing five movements and whose 4th movement is apparently intended to represent an episcopal coronation ceremony). In 1851 he revised what would be published as his [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|fourth symphony]]. From 1851 to 1853 he visited Switzerland, Belgium and Leipzig.\n\nOn 30 September 1853, the 20-year-old composer [[Johannes Brahms]] arrived unannounced at the door of the Schumanns carrying a letter of introduction from violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. (Schumann was not at home, and would not meet Brahms until the next day.) Brahms amazed Clara and Robert with his music, stayed with them for several weeks, and became a close family friend. (He later worked closely with Clara to popularize Schumann's compositions during her long widowhood.)\n\nDuring this time Schumann, Brahms and Schumann's pupil [[Albert Dietrich]] collaborated on the composition of the ''[[F-A-E Sonata|''F-A-E'' Sonata]]'' for Joachim; Schumann also published an article, \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the ''Neue Zeitschrift'' (his first article in many years), hailing the unknown young Brahms from Hamburg, a man who had published nothing, as \"the Chosen One\" who \"was destined to give ideal expression to the times.\"<ref>Robert Schumann's \"Artikel Neue Bahnen\", 28 October 1853</ref> It was an extraordinary way to present Brahms to the musical world, setting up great expectations that he did not fulfill for many years.<ref>Brahms' [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']], published in 1868, brought the first widespread recognition of his talent.</ref> In January 1854, Schumann went to [[Hanover]], where he heard a performance of his ''Paradise and the Peri'' organized by Joachim and Brahms. Two years later at Schumann's request, the work received its first English performance conducted by [[William Sterndale Bennett]].\n[[File:Bonn graveyard robert schumann 20080509.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Robert and Clara Schumann at [[Bonn]]]]\n\nSchumann returned to D\u00fcsseldorf and began to edit his complete works and make an anthology on the subject of music. He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier. Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of [[tinnitus]],<ref name=\":0\" />) he imagined that voices sounded in his ear and he heard angelic music.<ref name=\":0\" /> One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a \"spirit theme\" to him. The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his ''Lieder-Album f\u00fcr die Jugend'', and finally in the slow movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]]. In the days leading up to his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last completed work, today known as the ''[[Geistervariationen]]'' (Ghost Variations).<ref>{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Stevenson |title=Robert Schumann: Variations on an original theme, for piano in E flat major (\"Geister-Variationen\"), WoO 24 |work=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/composition/variations-on-an-original-theme-for-piano-in-e-flat-major-geister-variationen-woo-24-mc0002377594 |accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> Brahms published it in a supplementary volume to the complete edition of Schumann's piano music. In 1861 Brahms published his ''Variations for Piano Four Hands'', Op. 23, based on this theme.\n\n[[File:Robertschumann.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Schumann monument at his birthplace [[Zwickau]], Germany]]\n\n===Final illness and death===\nIn late February 1854, Schumann's symptoms increased, the angelic visions sometimes being replaced by demonic ones. He warned Clara that he feared he might do her harm. On 27 February, he attempted suicide by throwing himself from a bridge into the [[Rhine]] River (his elder sister Emilie had committed suicide in 1825, possibly by drowning herself). Rescued by boatmen and taken home, he asked to be taken to an asylum for the insane. He entered Dr. Franz Richarz's [[sanatorium]] in [[Endenich]], a quarter of [[Bonn]], and remained there until he died on 29 July 1856 at the age of 46. During his confinement, he was not allowed to see Clara, although Brahms was free to visit him. Clara finally visited him two days before his death. He appeared to recognize her, but was able to speak only a few words.<ref>Daverio, Grove online, 20</ref>\n\nGiven his reported symptoms, one modern view is that he died from [[syphilis]], which he could have contracted during his student days, and which could have remained latent during most of his marriage.<ref>Reich, Nancy B., ''Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,'' Cornell University Press, 1985, p. 151.</ref> According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar [[Eric Sams]], Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of [[mercury poisoning]]; mercury was a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions. Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass. A report by Janisch and Nauhaus on Schumann's autopsy indicates that he had a \"gelatinous\" tumor at the base of the brain; it may have represented a [[colloid cyst]], a [[craniopharyngioma]], a [[chordoma]], or a chordoid [[meningioma]].<ref>J\u00e4nisch W, Nauhaus G. \"Autopsy report of the corpse of the composer Robert Schumann: publication and interpretation of a rediscovered document\", ''Zentralbl Allg Pathol'' 1986; 132: 129\u201336.</ref> In particular, meningiomas are known to produce musical auditory hallucinations such as Schumann reported.<ref>Scott M. \"Musical hallucinations from meningioma\", ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' 1979; 241: 1683. {{pmid|430721}}</ref> It has also been hypothesised that he suffered from [[schizophrenia]], or [[schizoaffective disorder]]; bipolar type,<ref>Yasmeen Cooper and Mark Agius, [http://www.psychiatria-danubina.com/UserDocsImages/pdf/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207_559.pdf \"Does Schizoaffective Disorder Explain the Mental Illness of Robert Schumann and Vincent Van Gogh?\"], Psychiatria Danubina, 2018; Vol. 30, Suppl. 7, pp 559-562</ref> or [[bipolar disorder]] and [[bipolar II disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/196/4/325 |title=Robert Schumann's contribution to the genetics of psychosis |first=Katharina |last=Domschke |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=196 |issue=4 |page=325 |date=March 2010 |accessdate=17 June 2015|doi=10.1192/bjp.196.4.325 |pmid=20357311 }}</ref>\n\nSchumann heard a persistent A-note at the end of his life.

From mid-career on, she mainly performed music by leading composers. A hired cook and housekeeper tended to the children while she traveled. In 1856, she first visited England. The critics received Robert's music coolly, with [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]] being particularly harsh. She returned to London in 1865 and made regular appearances there in later years, often performing chamber music with the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] and others. She became the authoritative editor of her husband's works for [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]. It was rumoured that she and Brahms destroyed many of Schumann's later works, which they thought were tainted by his madness, but only the ''Five Pieces for Cello and Piano'' are known to have been destroyed. Most of Schumann's late works, particularly the [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]], the ''Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra'' and the Violin Sonata No. 3, all from 1853, have entered the repertoire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Zwickau Robert Schumann Birth House.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Robert Schumann in Zwickau in 2005]]\n[[File:GDR stamp Robert Schumann 1956-vertical.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[East Germany]] 1956 Schumann/Schubert error: Schubert's music is on the top stamp, and Schumann's on the bottom]]\n[[File:1960 CPA 2422.jpg|thumb|upright|1960 [[Russian Post#Soviet Union|Post of the USSR]] stamp marking the 150th anniversary of Schumann's birth.]]\n\nSchumann had considerable influence in the nineteenth century and beyond, despite his adoption of more conservative modes of composition after his marriage. He left an array of acclaimed music in virtually all the forms then known. Partly through his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Brahms, Schumann's ideals and musical vocabulary became widely disseminated. Composer Sir [[Edward Elgar]] called Schumann \"my ideal.\"\n\nSchumann has often been confused with Austrian composer [[Franz Schubert]]; one well-known example occurred in 1956, when [[East Germany]] issued a pair of postage stamps featuring Schumann's picture against an open score that featured Schubert's music.

According to Daverio, there is no evidence of the middle name \"Alexander\" that appears in some sources.</ref> ({{IPA-de|\u02c8\u0283u\u02d0man|lang}}; 8 June 1810{{spaced ndash}}29 July 1856) was a German composer, pianist, and influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a [[virtuoso]] pianist. His teacher, [[Friedrich Wieck]], a German pianist, had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing.\n\nIn 1840, after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck, who opposed the marriage, Schumann married Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]]. A lifelong partnership in music began, as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy. Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer [[Johannes Brahms]].\n\nUntil 1840, Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano. Later, he composed piano and orchestral works, and many [[Lied]]er (songs for voice and piano). He composed four [[Symphony|symphonies]], one [[opera]], and other orchestral, [[choral]], and [[chamber music|chamber]] works. His best-known works include ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', ''[[Kinderszenen]]'', ''[[Kreisleriana]]'', and the ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]''. Schumann was known for infusing his music with characters through motifs, as well as references to works of literature. These characters bled into his editorial writing in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (New Journal for Music), a [[Leipzig]]-based publication that he co-founded.\n\nSchumann suffered from a [[mental disorder]] that first manifested in 1833 as a severe [[melancholic depression|melancholic depressive]] episode\u2014which recurred several times alternating with phases of \"exaltation\" and increasingly also delusional ideas of being poisoned or threatened with metallic items. What is now thought to have been a combination of [[bipolar disorder]] and perhaps [[mercury poisoning]] led to \"manic\" and \"depressive\" periods in Schumann's compositional productivity. After a suicide attempt in 1854, Schumann was admitted at his own request to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] in [[Endenich]] near [[Bonn]]. Diagnosed with ''psychotic [[melancholia]]'', he died of pneumonia two years later at the age of 46, without recovering from his mental illness.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Schumannhaus ALT.JPG|thumb|left|Schumann's birth house, now the [[Robert Schumann House]], after an anonymous colourized lithograph]]\n[[File:Rob.Schumann.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Robert Schumann in the museum of [[Zwickau]]]]\n\nSchumann was born in [[Zwickau]], in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (today [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]]), the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (n\u00e9e Schnabel) and August Schumann.<ref>{{harvnb|Ostwald|1985|p=11}}</ref> Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music\u2014undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist.<ref>{{cite book\n | author=Robert Schumann\n | editor = Konrad Wolff\n | others = Translated by Paul Rosenfeld\n | title = On Music and Musicians\n | year = 1982\n | publisher=University of California Press\n | isbn = 978-0-520-04685-6 }}</ref>\n\nAt age seven, Schumann began studying general music and piano with Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school. The boy immediately developed a love of music, and worked on his own compositions, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The ''Universal Journal of Music'' 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, \"It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody,\u2014ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.\"<ref>[[Eric Himy]], pianist, Recording ''Homage to Schumann'', CD Notes, (Centaur, 2006), CEN 2858, chosen by BBC December 2007 as CD of the month, includes \"Kinderscenen\", \"Tr\u00e4umerei\"</ref>\n\nAt age 14, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled ''Portraits of Famous Men''. While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], as well as [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and the [[Tragedy#Ancient Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]]. His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was [[Jean Paul]], a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels ''Juniusabende'', completed in 1826, and ''Selene''.\n\nSchumann's interest in music was sparked by attending a performance of [[Ignaz Moscheles]] playing at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], and he later developed an interest in the works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. His father, who had encouraged his musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16. Thereafter, neither his mother nor his guardian encouraged him to pursue a music career. In 1828, Schumann left high school, and after a trip during which he met the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] in Munich, he left to study law at the University of Leipzig under family pressure. But in Leipzig Schumann instead focused on improvisation, song composition, and writing novels. He also began to seriously study piano with Friedrick Wieck, a well-known piano teacher. In 1829, he continued his law studies in [[Heidelberg]], where he became a lifelong member of [[Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg]].\n\n{{See also|German Student Corps|Corps}}\n\n===1830\u201334===\n[[File:Robert-Schumann-Haus.JPG|thumb|upright|Schumann's music room in Zwickau]]\n\nDuring [[Eastertide]] 1830, he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] play in [[Frankfurt]]. In July he wrote to his mother, \"My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law.\" With her permission, by Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master [[Friedrich Wieck]], who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him.<ref>{{harvnb|Perrey|2007|p=11}}</ref> During his studies with Wieck, some stories claim that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand. Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger by using a mechanical device that held back one finger while he exercised the others\u2014which was supposed to strengthen the weakest fingers.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last1=Jensen|first1=Eric Frederick|title=Schumann|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195346060|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdGlFgzLW6MC&pg=PA70|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> [[Clara Schumann]] discredited the story, saying the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself referred to it as \"an affliction of the whole hand.\" Some argue that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was not likely caused by a finger strengthening device.<ref>{{cite journal| jstor= 954772 | first= Eric| last= Sams | title= Schumann's hand injury| journal= The Musical Times| volume= 112| pages= 1156\u20131159| number= 1546 |date= December 1971| doi= 10.2307/954772}}</ref>\n\nSchumann abandoned the idea of a concert career and devoted himself instead to composition. To this end he began a study of music theory under [[Heinrich Dorn]], a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the [[Leipzig Opera]].\n\n====''Papillons''====\nSchumann's fusion of literary ideas with musical ones\u2014known as [[program music]]\u2014may have first taken shape in ''[[Papillons]]'', Op. 2 (''Butterflies''), a musical portrayal of events in [[Jean Paul]]'s novel ''Die Flegeljahre''. In a letter from Leipzig dated April 1832, Schumann bids his brothers, \"Read the last scene in Jean Paul's ''Flegeljahre'' as soon as possible, because the ''Papillons'' are intended as a musical representation of that masquerade.\" This inspiration is foreshadowed to some extent in his first written criticism\u2014an 1831 essay on [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Variations on \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" (Chopin)|variations on a theme]] from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', published in the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]''. In it, Schumann\ncreates imaginary characters who discuss Chopin's work: Florestan (the embodiment of Schumann's passionate, voluble side) and Eusebius (his dreamy, introspective side)\u2014the counterparts of Vult and Walt in ''Flegeljahre.'' They call on a third, Meister Raro, for his opinion. Raro may represent either the composer himself, Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], or the combination of the two (Cla'''ra''' + '''Ro'''bert).\n\nIn the winter of 1832, at age 22, Schumann visited relatives in Zwickau and [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]], where he performed the first movement of his ''Symphony in G minor'' (without opus number, known as the \"Zwickauer\"). In Zwickau, the music was performed at a concert given by Clara Wieck, who was then just 13 years old. On this occasion Clara played bravura Variations by [[Henri Herz]], a composer whom Schumann was already deriding as a philistine.<ref>Robert Schumann, musical Journal</ref> Schumann's mother said to Clara, \"You must marry my Robert one day.\"<ref>Berthold Litzmann 1910</ref> The ''Symphony in G minor'' was not published during Schumann's lifetime but has been played and recorded in recent times.\n\nThe 1833 deaths of Schumann's brother Julius and his sister-in-law Rosalie in the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829-1851)|worldwide cholera pandemic]] brought on a [[Major depressive disorder|severe depressive]] episode.\n\n[[File:Robert Schumann in youth.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A youthful Robert Schumann]]\n\n====''Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik''====\nBy spring 1834, Schumann had sufficiently recovered to inaugurate ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik|Die Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (\"New Journal for Music\"), first published on 3 April 1834. In his writings, Schumann created a fictional music society based on people in his life, called the ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndler]]'', named after the biblical King David who fought against the Philistines. Schumann published most of his critical writings in the journal, and often lambasted the popular taste for flashy technical displays from figures whom Schumann perceived as inferior composers, or \"philistines\". Schumann campaigned to revive interest in major composers of the past, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. He also promoted the work of some contemporary composers, including [[Chopin]] (about whom Schumann famously wrote, \"Hats off, Gentlemen! A genius!\")<ref>[[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]'s notes, Favourite Chopin</ref> and [[Hector Berlioz]], whom he praised for creating music of substance. On the other hand, Schumann disparaged the school of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. Among Schumann's associates at this time were composers [[Norbert Burgm\u00fcller]] and [[Ludwig Schuncke]] (to whom Schumann dedicated his ''Toccata in C'').\n\nDuring the summer of 1834 Schumann became engaged to 16-year-old Ernestine von Fricken, the adopted daughter of a rich Bohemian-born noble. In August 1835, he learned that Ernestine von Fricken was born illegitimate, which meant that she would have no dowry. Fearful that her limited means would force him to earn his living like a \"day-labourer,\" Schumann made a complete break with her toward the end of the year. He felt a growing attraction to 15-year-old Clara Wieck. They made mutual declarations of love in December in Zwickau, where Clara appeared in concert. His budding romance with Clara was disrupted when her father learned of their trysts during the Christmas holidays. He summarily forbade them further meetings, and ordered all their correspondence burnt.\n\n====''Carnaval''====\n''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', Op. 9 (1834) is one of Schumann's most characteristic piano works. Schumann begins nearly every section of ''Carnaval'' with a [[musical cryptogram]], the musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell [[A\u0161|Asch]] (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C, and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As, C and H respectively), the [[Bohemia]]n town in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann's own name. Eusebius and Florestan, the imaginary figures appearing so often in his critical writings, also appear, alongside brilliant imitations of Chopin and Paganini. To each of these characters he devotes a section of ''Carnaval''. The work comes to a close with a march of the ''Davidsb\u00fcndler''\u2014the league of [[King David]]'s men against the [[Philistines]]\u2014in which may be heard the clear accents of truth in contest with the dull clamour of falsehood embodied in a [[Musical quotation|quotation]] from the seventeenth century ''[[Grossvater Tanz|Grandfather's Dance]]''. The march, a step nearly always in duple meter, is here in 3/4 time (triple meter). The work ends in joy and a degree of mock-triumph. In ''Carnaval'', Schumann went further than in ''Papillons'', by conceiving the story as well as the musical representation (and also displaying a maturation of compositional resource).\n\n===1835\u201339===\nOn 3 October 1835, Schumann met [[Felix Mendelssohn]] at Wieck's house in Leipzig, and his enthusiastic appreciation of that artist<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=134}}</ref> was shown with the same generous freedom that distinguished his acknowledgement of the greatness of Chopin and other colleagues, and later prompted him to publicly pronounce the then-unknown [[Johannes Brahms]] a genius.\n[[File:Andreas Staub - Clara Wieck (Lithographie 1839, cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Clara Wieck]] in an idealized lithograph by [[Andreas Staub]], c. 1839]]\n[[File:Friedrich Wieck um 1838.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Wieck]] in a sketch by [[Pauline Viardot-Garcia]], around 1838]]\n\nIn 1837 Schumann published his ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', a complex set of ''\u00e9tude''-like variations written in 1834\u20131835, which demanded a finished piano technique. These variations were based on a theme by the adoptive father of Ernestine von Fricken. The work\u2014described as \"one of the peaks of the piano literature, lofty in conception and faultless in workmanship\" [Hutcheson]\u2014was dedicated to the young English composer [[William Sterndale Bennett]], for whom Schumann had had a high regard when they worked together in Leipzig.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze]]'', Op.&nbsp;6, (also published in 1837 despite the low opus number) literally \"Dances of the League of David\", is an embodiment of the struggle between enlightened Romanticism and musical philistinism. Schumann credited the two sides of his character with the composition of the work (the more passionate numbers are signed F. (Florestan) and the more dreamy signed E. (Eusebius)). The work begins with the \"motto of C.&nbsp;W.\" (Clara Wieck) denoting her support for the ideals of the ''Davidsbund''. The ''Bund'' was a music society of Schumann's imagination, members of which were kindred spirits (as he saw them) such as Chopin, Paganini and Clara, as well as the personalized Florestan and Eusebius.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''[[Kinderszenen]]'', Op. 15, completed in 1838 and a favourite of Schumann's piano works, depicts the innocence and playfulness of childhood. The \"Tr\u00e4umerei\" in F major, No. 7 of the set, is one of the most famous piano pieces ever written, and has been performed in myriad forms and transcriptions. It has been the favourite [[Encore (concert)|encore]] of several great pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]]. Melodic and deceptively simple, the piece is \"complex\" in its harmonic structure.<ref>[[Alban Berg]], replying to charges that modern music was overly complex, pointed out that ''Kinderszenen'' is constructed on a complex base.</ref>\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Kreisleriana]], Op. 16 (1838)\n| filename    = Robert Schumann Kreisleriana Op. 16 N3 Giorgi Latsabidze.ogg\n| title       = N8.

[[Johannes Kreisler]] was a fictional musician created by poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], and characterized as a \"romantic brought into contact with reality.\" Schumann used the figure to express \"fantastic and mad\" emotional states. According to [[Ernest Hutcheson#Works|Hutcheson (\"The Literature of the Piano\")]], this work is \"among the finest efforts of Schumann's genius. He never surpassed the searching beauty of the slow movements (Nos. 2, 4, 6) or the urgent passion of others (Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7) [\u2026] To appreciate it a high level of aesthetic intelligence is required [\u2026] This is no facile music, there is severity alike in its beauty and its passion.\"\n\nThe ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]'', Op. 17, composed in the summer of 1836, is a work of passion and deep pathos, imbued with the spirit of the late Beethoven. Schumann intended to use proceeds from sales of the work toward the construction of [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|a monument to Beethoven]], who had died in 1827. The first movement of the ''Fantasie'' contains a [[Musical quotation|musical quote]] from Beethoven's song cycle, ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'', Op. 98 (at the Adagio coda, taken from the last song of the cycle). The original titles of the movements were ''Ruins'', ''Triumphal Arch'', and ''The Starry Crown''. According to [[Franz Liszt]],<ref>Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''</ref> who played the work for Schumann and to whom it was dedicated, the ''Fantasie'' was apt to be played too heavily, and should have a dreamier (''tr\u00e4umerisch'') character than vigorous German pianists tended to impart.

London, 1893.</ref> Again, according to Hutcheson: \"No words can describe the Phantasie, no quotations set forth the majesty of its genius. It must suffice to say that it is Schumann's greatest work in large form for piano solo.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Arabeske (Schumann)|Arabeske in C major, Op. 18 (1839)]]\n| filename    = Schumann-arabeske-andrea-valori.ogg\n| title       = Arabeske (Schumann)\n| description = [[Mario Andrea Valori]], piano, 2011\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nAfter a visit to [[Vienna]], during which he discovered [[Franz Schubert]]'s previously unknown [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 9 in C]], in 1839 Schumann wrote the ''[[Faschingsschwank aus Wien]]'' (''Carnival Prank from Vienna''). Most of the joke is in the central section of the first movement, which makes a thinly veiled reference to ''[[La Marseillaise]]''. (Vienna had banned the song due to harsh memories of [[Napoleon]]'s invasion.) The festive mood does not preclude moments of melancholic introspection in the Intermezzo.\n\n===1840\u201349===\nFrom 1832 to 1839, Schumann wrote almost exclusively for piano, but in 1840 alone he wrote at least 138 songs. Indeed, 1840 (the ''Liederjahr'' or ''year of song'') is highly significant in Schumann's musical legacy, despite his earlier deriding of works for piano and voice as inferior.\n\nAfter a long and acrimonious legal battle with her father, Schumann married Clara Wieck on 12 September 1840, at [[Leipzig-Sch\u00f6nefeld|Sch\u00f6nefeld]], the day before her 21st birthday. Had they waited another day, they would no longer have required her father's consent. Their marriage supported a remarkable business partnership, with Clara  acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidante to her husband. Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after their marriage, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren.\n\nPrior to the legal case and subsequent marriage, the lovers exchanged love letters and rendezvoused in secret. Robert often waited for hours in a cafe in a nearby city just to see Clara for a few minutes after one of her concerts. The strain of this long courtship and its consummation may have led to this great outpouring of Lieder (vocal songs with piano accompaniment). This is evident in ''Widmung'', for example, where he uses the melody from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|''Ave Maria'']] in the postlude in homage to Clara. Schumann's biographers attribute the sweetness, doubt, and despair of these songs to the emotions aroused by his love for Clara and the uncertainties of their future together.\n\nRobert and Clara had eight children, Emil (1846\u20131847), who died at 1 year; Marie (1841\u20131929); Elise (1843\u20131928); Julie (1845\u20131872); Ludwig (1848\u20131899); Ferdinand (1849\u20131891); [[Eugenie Schumann|Eugenie]] (1851\u20131938); and Felix (1854\u20131879).\n\n[[File:Robert and Clara Schumann.jpg|thumb|The stylized profiles of Clara and Robert Schumann]]\n\nHis chief song-cycles in this period were settings of the ''[[Liederkreis, Op. 39|Liederkreis]]'' of [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], Op. 39 (depicting a series of moods relating to or inspired by nature); the ''[[Frauenliebe und -leben]]'' of [[Adelbert von Chamisso|Chamisso]], Op. 42 (relating the tale of a woman's marriage, childbirth and widowhood); the ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' of [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], Op. 48 (depicting a lover rejected, but coming to terms with his painful loss through renunciation and forgiveness); and ''Myrthen'', a collection of songs, including poems by Goethe, [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert|R\u00fcckert]], Heine, Byron, [[Robert Burns|Burns]] and Moore. The songs ''Belsatzar'', Op. 57 and ''Die beiden Grenadiere'', Op. 49, both to Heine's words, show Schumann at his best as a ballad writer, although the dramatic ballad is less congenial to him than the introspective lyric. The Op. 35, 40 and 98a sets (words by [[Justinus Kerner]], Chamisso and Goethe respectively), although less well known, also contain songs of lyric and dramatic quality.\n\n{{listen\n | header       = Andante and Variations, Op. 46 (1843)<br />Performed by Neal and Nancy O'Doan (pianos), Carter Enyeart and Toby Saks (cellos) and Christopher Leuba (horn)\n | filename     = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Introduction, Theme and Variations 01-05.ogg\n | title        = Introduction, Theme and Variations 1\u20135\n | format       = [[ogg]]\n | description  =\n | filename2    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 06-10.ogg\n | title2       = Variations 6\u201310\n | format2      = [[ogg]]\n | description2 =\n | filename3    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 11-15.ogg\n | title3       = Variations 11\u201315\n | format3      = [[ogg]]\n | description3 =\n | image        = none\n}}\n\nIn 1841 he wrote two of his four symphonies, [[Symphony No. 1 (Schumann)|No. 1 in B-flat]], Op. 38, ''Spring'' and [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|No. 4 in D minor]] (the latter a pioneering work in \"cyclic form\", was performed that year but published only much later after revision and extensive re-orchestration as Op. 120). He devoted 1842 to composing chamber music, including the [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E-flat]], Op. 44, now one of his best known and most admired works; the [[Piano Quartet (Schumann)|Piano Quartet]] and [[String Quartets (Schumann)|three string quartets]]. In 1843 he wrote ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'', his first attempt at concerted vocal music, an [[oratorio]] style work based on ''[[Lalla-Rookh]]'' by [[Thomas Moore]]. After this, his compositions were not confined to any one form during any particular period.\n\nThe stage in his life when he was deeply engaged in setting Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' to music (1844\u201353) was a turbulent one for his health. He spent the first half of 1844 with Clara on tour in Russia, and his depression grew worse as he felt inferior to Clara as a musician. On returning to Germany, he abandoned his editorial work and left Leipzig for [[Dresden]], where he suffered from persistent \"[[nervous prostration]]\". As soon as he began to work, he was seized with fits of shivering and an apprehension of death, experiencing an abhorrence of high places, all metal instruments (even keys), and drugs. Schumann's diaries also state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the [[A (musical note)#Designation by octave|note A5]] sounding in his ears.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis state of unease and [[neurasthenia]] is reflected in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Schumann)|Symphony in C]], numbered second but third in order of composition, in which the composer explores states of exhaustion, obsession, and depression, culminating in Beethovenian spiritual triumph. Also published in 1845 was his [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54]], originally conceived and performed as a one-movement ''Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra'' in 1841. It is one of the most popular and oft-recorded of all piano concertos; according to Hutcheson \"Schumann achieved a masterly work and we inherited the finest piano concerto since Mozart and Beethoven\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Robert u Clara Schumann 1847.jpg|thumb|left|Robert and Clara Schumann in 1847, lithograph with a personal dedication]]\n\nIn 1846, he felt he had recovered. In the winter, the Schumanns revisited Vienna, traveling to [[Prague]] and Berlin in the spring of 1847 and in the summer to Zwickau, where he was received with enthusiasm. This pleased him, since until that time he was famous in only Dresden and Leipzig.\n\nHis only opera, ''[[Genoveva]]'', Op. 81, premiered in Spring 1850.{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=334}} In it, Schumann attempted to abolish [[recitative]], which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on [[Richard Wagner]]; Schumann's consistently flowing melody can be seen as a forerunner to Wagner's ''Melos''). The subject of ''Genoveva''\u2014based on [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]]'s plays\u2014was not seen an ideal choice. The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire. As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, \"Do you know my prayer as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera.' Here is a real field for enterprise ... something simple, profound, German\". And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: ''[[Nibelung]]en'', ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]''.\n\nThe music to [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'' was written in 1849, the overture of which is one of Schumann's most frequently performed orchestral works. The [[May Uprising in Dresden|insurrection of Dresden]] caused Schumann to move to [[Kreischa]], a little village a few miles outside the city. In August 1849, on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's birth, completed scenes of Schumann's ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' were performed in Dresden, Leipzig and [[Weimar]]. Liszt gave him assistance and encouragement. The rest of the work was written later in 1849, and the overture (which Schumann described as \"one of the sturdiest of [his] creations\") in 1853.\n\n===After 1850===\n[[File:Schumann-photo1850.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Schumann in an 1850 [[daguerreotype]]]]\n\nFrom 1850 to 1854, Schumann composed in a wide variety of genres. Critics have disputed the quality of his work at this time; a widely held view has been that his music showed signs of mental breakdown and creative decay. More recently, critics have suggested that the changes in style may be explained by \"lucid experimentation\".<ref name=\":1\">Daverio, Grove online, 19</ref>\n\nIn 1850, Schumann succeeded [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as musical director at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], but he was a poor conductor and quickly aroused the opposition of the musicians. According to [[Harold C. Schonberg]], in his 1967 ''The Great Conductors'': \"The great composer was impossible on the platform ... There is something heartrending about poor Schumann's epochal inefficiency as a conductor.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse |url-access=registration |author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]] |title=The Great Conductors |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1967 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse/page/126 126]}}</ref> His contract was eventually terminated. By the end of that year he completed his [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Symphony No. 3, \"Rhenish\"]] (a work containing five movements and whose 4th movement is apparently intended to represent an episcopal coronation ceremony). In 1851 he revised what would be published as his [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|fourth symphony]]. From 1851 to 1853 he visited Switzerland, Belgium and Leipzig.\n\nOn 30 September 1853, the 20-year-old composer [[Johannes Brahms]] arrived unannounced at the door of the Schumanns carrying a letter of introduction from violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. (Schumann was not at home, and would not meet Brahms until the next day.) Brahms amazed Clara and Robert with his music, stayed with them for several weeks, and became a close family friend. (He later worked closely with Clara to popularize Schumann's compositions during her long widowhood.)\n\nDuring this time Schumann, Brahms and Schumann's pupil [[Albert Dietrich]] collaborated on the composition of the ''[[F-A-E Sonata|''F-A-E'' Sonata]]'' for Joachim; Schumann also published an article, \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the ''Neue Zeitschrift'' (his first article in many years), hailing the unknown young Brahms from Hamburg, a man who had published nothing, as \"the Chosen One\" who \"was destined to give ideal expression to the times.\"<ref>Robert Schumann's \"Artikel Neue Bahnen\", 28 October 1853</ref> It was an extraordinary way to present Brahms to the musical world, setting up great expectations that he did not fulfill for many years.<ref>Brahms' [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']], published in 1868, brought the first widespread recognition of his talent.</ref> In January 1854, Schumann went to [[Hanover]], where he heard a performance of his ''Paradise and the Peri'' organized by Joachim and Brahms. Two years later at Schumann's request, the work received its first English performance conducted by [[William Sterndale Bennett]].\n[[File:Bonn graveyard robert schumann 20080509.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Robert and Clara Schumann at [[Bonn]]]]\n\nSchumann returned to D\u00fcsseldorf and began to edit his complete works and make an anthology on the subject of music. He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier. Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of [[tinnitus]],<ref name=\":0\" />) he imagined that voices sounded in his ear and he heard angelic music.<ref name=\":0\" /> One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a \"spirit theme\" to him. The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his ''Lieder-Album f\u00fcr die Jugend'', and finally in the slow movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]]. In the days leading up to his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last completed work, today known as the ''[[Geistervariationen]]'' (Ghost Variations).<ref>{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Stevenson |title=Robert Schumann: Variations on an original theme, for piano in E flat major (\"Geister-Variationen\"), WoO 24 |work=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/composition/variations-on-an-original-theme-for-piano-in-e-flat-major-geister-variationen-woo-24-mc0002377594 |accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> Brahms published it in a supplementary volume to the complete edition of Schumann's piano music. In 1861 Brahms published his ''Variations for Piano Four Hands'', Op. 23, based on this theme.\n\n[[File:Robertschumann.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Schumann monument at his birthplace [[Zwickau]], Germany]]\n\n===Final illness and death===\nIn late February 1854, Schumann's symptoms increased, the angelic visions sometimes being replaced by demonic ones. He warned Clara that he feared he might do her harm. On 27 February, he attempted suicide by throwing himself from a bridge into the [[Rhine]] River (his elder sister Emilie had committed suicide in 1825, possibly by drowning herself). Rescued by boatmen and taken home, he asked to be taken to an asylum for the insane. He entered Dr. Franz Richarz's [[sanatorium]] in [[Endenich]], a quarter of [[Bonn]], and remained there until he died on 29 July 1856 at the age of 46. During his confinement, he was not allowed to see Clara, although Brahms was free to visit him. Clara finally visited him two days before his death. He appeared to recognize her, but was able to speak only a few words.<ref>Daverio, Grove online, 20</ref>\n\nGiven his reported symptoms, one modern view is that he died from [[syphilis]], which he could have contracted during his student days, and which could have remained latent during most of his marriage.<ref>Reich, Nancy B., ''Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,'' Cornell University Press, 1985, p. 151.</ref> According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar [[Eric Sams]], Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of [[mercury poisoning]]; mercury was a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions. Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass. A report by Janisch and Nauhaus on Schumann's autopsy indicates that he had a \"gelatinous\" tumor at the base of the brain; it may have represented a [[colloid cyst]], a [[craniopharyngioma]], a [[chordoma]], or a chordoid [[meningioma]].<ref>J\u00e4nisch W, Nauhaus G. \"Autopsy report of the corpse of the composer Robert Schumann: publication and interpretation of a rediscovered document\", ''Zentralbl Allg Pathol'' 1986; 132: 129\u201336.</ref> In particular, meningiomas are known to produce musical auditory hallucinations such as Schumann reported.<ref>Scott M. \"Musical hallucinations from meningioma\", ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' 1979; 241: 1683. {{pmid|430721}}</ref> It has also been hypothesised that he suffered from [[schizophrenia]], or [[schizoaffective disorder]]; bipolar type,<ref>Yasmeen Cooper and Mark Agius, [http://www.psychiatria-danubina.com/UserDocsImages/pdf/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207_559.pdf \"Does Schizoaffective Disorder Explain the Mental Illness of Robert Schumann and Vincent Van Gogh?\"], Psychiatria Danubina, 2018; Vol. 30, Suppl. 7, pp 559-562</ref> or [[bipolar disorder]] and [[bipolar II disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/196/4/325 |title=Robert Schumann's contribution to the genetics of psychosis |first=Katharina |last=Domschke |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=196 |issue=4 |page=325 |date=March 2010 |accessdate=17 June 2015|doi=10.1192/bjp.196.4.325 |pmid=20357311 }}</ref>\n\nSchumann heard a persistent A-note at the end of his life.

From mid-career on, she mainly performed music by leading composers. A hired cook and housekeeper tended to the children while she traveled. In 1856, she first visited England. The critics received Robert's music coolly, with [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]] being particularly harsh. She returned to London in 1865 and made regular appearances there in later years, often performing chamber music with the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] and others. She became the authoritative editor of her husband's works for [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]. It was rumoured that she and Brahms destroyed many of Schumann's later works, which they thought were tainted by his madness, but only the ''Five Pieces for Cello and Piano'' are known to have been destroyed. Most of Schumann's late works, particularly the [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]], the ''Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra'' and the Violin Sonata No. 3, all from 1853, have entered the repertoire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Zwickau Robert Schumann Birth House.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Robert Schumann in Zwickau in 2005]]\n[[File:GDR stamp Robert Schumann 1956-vertical.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[East Germany]] 1956 Schumann/Schubert error: Schubert's music is on the top stamp, and Schumann's on the bottom]]\n[[File:1960 CPA 2422.jpg|thumb|upright|1960 [[Russian Post#Soviet Union|Post of the USSR]] stamp marking the 150th anniversary of Schumann's birth.]]\n\nSchumann had considerable influence in the nineteenth century and beyond, despite his adoption of more conservative modes of composition after his marriage. He left an array of acclaimed music in virtually all the forms then known. Partly through his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Brahms, Schumann's ideals and musical vocabulary became widely disseminated. Composer Sir [[Edward Elgar]] called Schumann \"my ideal.\"\n\nSchumann has often been confused with Austrian composer [[Franz Schubert]]; one well-known example occurred in 1956, when [[East Germany]] issued a pair of postage stamps featuring Schumann's picture against an open score that featured Schubert's music.
