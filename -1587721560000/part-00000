Moreover, by the end of 1868 all male heads of household were enfranchised as a result of the end of compounding of rents. However, the Act introduced only a negligible redistribution of seats.  The overall intent was to help the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], yet it resulted in their loss of the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 general election]].\n\n==Background==\nFor the decades after the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act of 1832]], [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinets]] (in that era leading from both Houses) had resisted attempts to push through further reform, and in particular left unfulfilled the \nsix demands of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement. After 1848, this movement declined rapidly, but elite opinion began to pay attention.<ref>Christopher John Murray, ed. ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850: A-K''  (2004),'' p 115.</ref>  It was thus only 27 years after the initial, quite modest, Great Reform Act that leading politicians thought it prudent to introduce further electoral reform.  Following an unsuccessful attempt by [[Benjamin Disraeli]] to introduce a reform bill in 1859, Lord [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|John Russell]], who had played a major role in passing the 1832 Reform Act, attempted this in 1860;  but the Prime Minister, [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], a fellow [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], was against any further electoral reform.\n\nThe Union victory in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865 emboldened the forces in Britain that demanded more democracy and public input into the political system, to the dismay of the upper class landed gentry who identified with the US Southern States planters and feared the loss of influence and a popular radical movement. Influential commentators included [[Walter Bagehot]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Anthony Trollope]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].<ref name=bk>Brent E. Kinser, ''The American Civil War in the Shaping of British Democracy'' (Ashgate, 2011)</ref>\n\nPalmerston's death in 1865 opened the floodgates for reform. In 1866 Russell (Earl Russell as he had been since 1861, and now Prime Minister for the second time), introduced a Reform Bill. It was a cautious bill, which proposed to enfranchise \"respectable\" working men, excluding unskilled workers and what was known as the \"residuum\", those seen by MPs as the \"feckless and criminal\" poor. This was ensured by a \u00a37 annual rent qualification to vote\u2014or 26 shillings a week {{#tag:ref|\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|1.33|1866}} per week or \u00a3{{Inflation|UK|5.77|1866}} per month in present terms based on CPI inflation|group= n}}.  This entailed two \"fancy franchises,\" emulating measures of 1854, a \u00a310 lodger qualification for the boroughs, and a \u00a350 savings qualification in the counties. Liberals claimed that \"the middle classes, strengthened by the best of the artisans, would still have the preponderance of power.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Barrymore Smith|title=The Making of the Second Reform Bill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QV80AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA66|year=1966|pages=65\u201366}}</ref>\n\nWhen it came to the vote, however, this bill split the Liberal Party: a split partly engineered by [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who incited those threatened by the bill to rise up against it. On one side were the reactionary conservative Liberals, known as the [[Adullamites]]; on the other were pro-reform Liberals who supported the Government. The Adullamites were supported by Tories and the liberal Whigs were supported by radicals and reformists.\n\nThe bill was thus defeated and the Liberal government of Russell resigned.\n\n==Birth of the Act==\nThe Conservatives formed a ministry on 26 June 1866, led by [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and Disraeli as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. They were faced with the challenge of reviving Conservatism: Palmerston, the powerful Liberal leader, was dead and the Liberal Party split and defeated.  Thanks to manoeuvring by Disraeli, Derby's Conservatives saw an opportunity to be a strong, viable party of government; however, there was still a Liberal majority in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n\nThe Adullamites, led by [[Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke|Robert Lowe]], had already been working closely with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The Adullamites were anti-reform, as were the Conservatives, but the Adullamites declined the invitation to enter into Government with the Conservatives as they thought that they could have more influence from an independent position. Despite the fact that he had blocked the Liberal Reform Bill, in February 1867, Disraeli introduced his own Reform Bill into the House of Commons.\n\nBy this time the attitude of many in the country had ceased to be apathetic regarding reform of the House of Commons.  Huge meetings, especially the \u2018Hyde Park riots', and the feeling that many of the skilled working class were respectable, had persuaded many that there should be a Reform Bill.  However, wealthy Conservative MP [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]]{{#tag:ref|Later Cranborne became Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury|group= n}} resigned his government ministry in disgust at the bill's introduction.\n\nThe [[Reform League]], agitating for [[universal suffrage]], became much more active, and organized demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people in [[Manchester]], [[Glasgow]], and other towns. Though these movements did not normally use revolutionary language as some Chartists had in the 1840s, they were powerful movements. The high point came when a demonstration in May 1867 in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] was banned by the government. Thousands of troops and policemen were prepared, but the crowds were so huge that the government did not dare to attack. The [[Home Secretary]], [[Spencer Horatio Walpole|Spencer Walpole]], was forced to resign.\n\n[[File:Reform bill1867punchJohn Tenniel into the dark125.png|thumb|right|A ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon from August 1867 portraying Disraeli as a horse, taking [[Britannia]] on a leap in the dark]]\nFaced with the possibility of popular revolt going much further, the government rapidly included into the bill amendments which enfranchised far more people. Consequently, the bill was more far-reaching than any Members of Parliament had thought possible or really wanted; Disraeli appeared to accept most reform proposals, so long as they did not come from [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. An amendment tabled by the opposition (but not by Gladstone himself) trebled the new number entitled to vote under the bill; yet Disraeli simply accepted it. The bill enfranchised most men who lived in urban areas. The final proposals were as follows: a borough franchise for all who paid rates in person (that is, not compounders), and extra votes for graduates, professionals and those with over \u00a350 savings. These last \"fancy franchises\" were seen by Conservatives as a weapon against a mass electorate.\n\nHowever, Gladstone attacked the bill; a series of sparkling parliamentary debates with Disraeli resulted in the bill becoming much more radical. Having been given his chance by the belief that Gladstone's bill had gone too far in 1866, Disraeli had now gone further.\n\nDisraeli was able to persuade his party to vote for the bill on the basis that the newly enfranchised electorate would be grateful, and would vote Conservative at the next election. Despite this prediction, in 1868 the Conservatives lost the first [[1868 United Kingdom general election|general election]] in which the newly enfranchised electors voted.\n\nThe bill ultimately aided the rise of the radical wing of the Liberal Party, and helped Gladstone to victory.

Moreover, by the end of 1868 all male heads of household were enfranchised as a result of the end of compounding of rents. However, the Act introduced only a negligible redistribution of seats.  The overall intent was to help the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], yet it resulted in their loss of the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 general election]].\n\n==Background==\nFor the decades after the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act of 1832]], [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinets]] (in that era leading from both Houses) had resisted attempts to push through further reform, and in particular left unfulfilled the \nsix demands of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement. After 1848, this movement declined rapidly, but elite opinion began to pay attention.<ref>Christopher John Murray, ed. ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850: A-K''  (2004),'' p 115.</ref>  It was thus only 27 years after the initial, quite modest, Great Reform Act that leading politicians thought it prudent to introduce further electoral reform.  Following an unsuccessful attempt by [[Benjamin Disraeli]] to introduce a reform bill in 1859, Lord [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|John Russell]], who had played a major role in passing the 1832 Reform Act, attempted this in 1860;  but the Prime Minister, [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], a fellow [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], was against any further electoral reform.\n\nThe Union victory in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865 emboldened the forces in Britain that demanded more democracy and public input into the political system, to the dismay of the upper class landed gentry who identified with the US Southern States planters and feared the loss of influence and a popular radical movement. Influential commentators included [[Walter Bagehot]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Anthony Trollope]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].<ref name=bk>Brent E. Kinser, ''The American Civil War in the Shaping of British Democracy'' (Ashgate, 2011)</ref>\n\nPalmerston's death in 1865 opened the floodgates for reform. In 1866 Russell (Earl Russell as he had been since 1861, and now Prime Minister for the second time), introduced a Reform Bill. It was a cautious bill, which proposed to enfranchise \"respectable\" working men, excluding unskilled workers and what was known as the \"residuum\", those seen by MPs as the \"feckless and criminal\" poor. This was ensured by a \u00a37 annual rent qualification to vote\u2014or 26 shillings a week {{#tag:ref|\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|1.33|1866}} per week or \u00a3{{Inflation|UK|5.77|1866}} per month in present terms based on CPI inflation|group= n}}.  This entailed two \"fancy franchises,\" emulating measures of 1854, a \u00a310 lodger qualification for the boroughs, and a \u00a350 savings qualification in the counties. Liberals claimed that \"the middle classes, strengthened by the best of the artisans, would still have the preponderance of power.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Barrymore Smith|title=The Making of the Second Reform Bill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QV80AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA66|year=1966|pages=65\u201366}}</ref>\n\nWhen it came to the vote, however, this bill split the Liberal Party: a split partly engineered by [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who incited those threatened by the bill to rise up against it. On one side were the reactionary conservative Liberals, known as the [[Adullamites]]; on the other were pro-reform Liberals who supported the Government. The Adullamites were supported by Tories and the liberal Whigs were supported by radicals and reformists.\n\nThe bill was thus defeated and the Liberal government of Russell resigned.\n\n==Birth of the Act==\nThe Conservatives formed a ministry on 26 June 1866, led by [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and Disraeli as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. They were faced with the challenge of reviving Conservatism: Palmerston, the powerful Liberal leader, was dead and the Liberal Party split and defeated.  Thanks to manoeuvring by Disraeli, Derby's Conservatives saw an opportunity to be a strong, viable party of government; however, there was still a Liberal majority in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n\nThe Adullamites, led by [[Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke|Robert Lowe]], had already been working closely with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The Adullamites were anti-reform, as were the Conservatives, but the Adullamites declined the invitation to enter into Government with the Conservatives as they thought that they could have more influence from an independent position. Despite the fact that he had blocked the Liberal Reform Bill, in February 1867, Disraeli introduced his own Reform Bill into the House of Commons.\n\nBy this time the attitude of many in the country had ceased to be apathetic regarding reform of the House of Commons.  Huge meetings, especially the \u2018Hyde Park riots', and the feeling that many of the skilled working class were respectable, had persuaded many that there should be a Reform Bill.  However, wealthy Conservative MP [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]]{{#tag:ref|Later Cranborne became Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury|group= n}} resigned his government ministry in disgust at the bill's introduction.\n\nThe [[Reform League]], agitating for [[universal suffrage]], became much more active, and organized demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people in [[Manchester]], [[Glasgow]], and other towns. Though these movements did not normally use revolutionary language as some Chartists had in the 1840s, they were powerful movements. The high point came when a demonstration in May 1867 in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] was banned by the government. Thousands of troops and policemen were prepared, but the crowds were so huge that the government did not dare to attack. The [[Home Secretary]], [[Spencer Horatio Walpole|Spencer Walpole]], was forced to resign.\n\n[[File:Reform bill1867punchJohn Tenniel into the dark125.png|thumb|right|A ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon from August 1867 portraying Disraeli as a horse, taking [[Britannia]] on a leap in the dark]]\nFaced with the possibility of popular revolt going much further, the government rapidly included into the bill amendments which enfranchised far more people. Consequently, the bill was more far-reaching than any Members of Parliament had thought possible or really wanted; Disraeli appeared to accept most reform proposals, so long as they did not come from [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. An amendment tabled by the opposition (but not by Gladstone himself) trebled the new number entitled to vote under the bill; yet Disraeli simply accepted it. The bill enfranchised most men who lived in urban areas. The final proposals were as follows: a borough franchise for all who paid rates in person (that is, not compounders), and extra votes for graduates, professionals and those with over \u00a350 savings. These last \"fancy franchises\" were seen by Conservatives as a weapon against a mass electorate.\n\nHowever, Gladstone attacked the bill; a series of sparkling parliamentary debates with Disraeli resulted in the bill becoming much more radical. Having been given his chance by the belief that Gladstone's bill had gone too far in 1866, Disraeli had now gone further.\n\nDisraeli was able to persuade his party to vote for the bill on the basis that the newly enfranchised electorate would be grateful, and would vote Conservative at the next election. Despite this prediction, in 1868 the Conservatives lost the first [[1868 United Kingdom general election|general election]] in which the newly enfranchised electors voted.\n\nThe bill ultimately aided the rise of the radical wing of the Liberal Party, and helped Gladstone to victory. The Act was tidied up with many further Acts to alter electoral boundaries.\n\n==Provisions of the Act==\n\n=== Reduced representation ===\n\n==== Disenfranchised [[boroughs]] ====\nFour electoral boroughs were completely disenfranchised by the Act, for corruption:\n\n*[[Totnes]] (two MPs), Devon\n*[[Great Yarmouth]] (two MPs), Norfolk\n*[[Lancaster (UK Parliament constituency)|Lancaster]] (two MPs), Lancashire\n*[[Reigate]] (one MP), Surrey\n\nSeven English boroughs were disenfranchised by the [[Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868]] the subsequent year:\n\n*[[Arundel]], Sussex\n*[[Ashburton, England|Ashburton]], Devon\n*[[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], Devon\n*[[Honiton]], Devon\n*[[Lyme Regis]], Dorset\n*[[Thetford]], Norfolk\n*[[Wells, Somerset|Wells]], Somerset\n\nThree of these (Honiton, Thetford, Wells) had two MPs, but had been due to have their representation halved under the terms of the 1867 Act.

It was intended to participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] with similar formations from other parts of [[German-occupied Europe]].\n\nCreated in July 1941, the Walloon Legion was created by the [[Rexist Party]] as a means of demonstrating its loyalty and indispensability in German-occupied Belgium where it had been largely ignored since the [[Battle of Belgium|invasion of May 1940]]. A similar formation had already been created by Flemish collaborators. The Walloon Legion, initially part of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht]], was joined by the Rexist leader [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]] but remained no larger than a [[battalion]]. It participated in fighting on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] from February 1942 but the heavy losses experienced by the unit proved difficult to replace in Belgium. \n\nIt became part of the [[Waffen-SS]] in June 1943 as the '''SS-''Sturmbrigade'' Wallonia''' and was almost destroyed by Soviet forces in the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] in February 1944. It expanded slightly after the [[Liberation of Belgium|Allied Liberation of Belgium]] in September 1944 as Belgian, French, and Spanish soldiers were drafted in and was upgraded to the notional status of a [[Division (military)|division]]. After heavy losses and desertions, its remaining personnel surrendered to British forces in April 1945.\n\n==Origins==\n===Rexist Party and collaboration===\nAt the time of the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion in May 1940]], Belgium had several political parties that were broadly sympathetic to the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[anti-democratic]] ideals represented by [[Nazi Germany]]. In [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]], the largest of these groups was the [[Rexist Party]], led by [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]]. This had originated as a faction of the mainstream [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Block]], but split in 1935 to form an independent [[populism|populist]] party. Ideologically, Rex supported [[Belgian nationalism]], but its support for [[corporatism]] and [[anti-communism]] made it sympathetic towards aspects of [[Nazi ideology]]. It achieved some early success, peaking [[1936 Belgian general election|at the elections of 1936]] in which it received 11.5 percent of the national vote, but experienced a decline in the following years before the German invasion and remained marginal.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=261}}\n\nAfter the Belgian surrender on 28 May 1940, a German [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|Military Administration]] was created to govern the occupied  territory. Preferring a strategy of [[indirect rule]], the administration preferred to work with established Belgian political and social elites, largely ignoring fringe political groups such as the Rexists.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=262\u2013263}}\n\n===Creation of the Walloon Legion===\n[[File:You defend Belgium....jpg|thumb|Recruitment poster for the Walloon Legion, appealing to [[Belgian nationalism|Belgian nationalist]] sentiments. The caption reads \"You defend Belgium... by fighting on the Eastern Front\".]]\nIn order to acquire more influence and German support, Rex attempted to bring itself closer to the occupation authorities. On 1 January 1941, Degrelle announced Rex's total support for the occupation authorities and for the policy of collaborationism. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, it embraced the idea of raising a military unit, seen as \"a political opportunity to increase the importance of their movements and eliminate political competition\".{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=266}} At the same time, the [[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]] (VNV), a [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalist]] and rival authoritarian party in Flanders, also announced its intention to form a \"[[Flemish Legion]]\" to fight in the German Army in the [[Soviet Union]]. This move, combined with the Germans' favourable stance towards the VNV, meant that it would not be possible to realise Rex's preferred option of a national \"Belgian Legion\" on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=243}}\n\nIn July 1941, Rex announced that it would raise a unit of volunteers of its own, dubbed the Walloon Legion (''L\u00e9gion Wallonie''). The unit would form part of the [[Wehrmacht]] because Walloons were not considered sufficiently \"Germanic\" by [[Nazism and race|Nazi racial theorists]] to enlist in the [[Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=266}} Recruitment initially met with little success, leading Degrelle personally to volunteer for the unit as a private. In total, some 850 men (mostly Rexist [[Cadre (politics)|cadres]]) had volunteered by August 1941, bringing the unit up to the strength of an [[infantry battalion]].{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=267}} Officially designated as Infantry Battalion 373 (''Infanterie Bataillon 373''), it was sent for training in [[Kreis Meseritz|Meseritz]], Germany. As part of Degrelle's ideal of an expanded [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian-style Belgium]], the unit adopted the [[Cross of Burgundy]] as its insignia.\n\nInitially, most of the volunteers came from the cadres of Rex and in particular its paramilitary militia, the ''Formations de Combat''. In propaganda, Rex emphasised the anti-communist nature of the conflict and argued that collaboration was compatible with Belgian nationalism.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=266\u2013268}} Initially, the unit encountered various internal problems with some volunteers being unwilling to swear allegiance to [[Adolf Hitler]] and others being classed as medically unfit: almost a third of the volunteers were repatriated before October 1941.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=270}} Over the winter of 1941\u20131942, it participated in training and [[Anti-partisan operations in World War II|anti-partisan operations]] near [[Donetsk]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]].{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=244}}\n\n==Eastern Front==\n===In the Wehrmacht, 1942\u20131943===\nThe Walloon Legion fought its first engagement against Soviet forces at Gromowaja-Balka, near Donetsk, on 28 February 1942 as part of the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Army]]. It suffered heavy losses, both from disease and combat, and was reduced to 150 men within its first months.{{sfn|Plisnier|2011|p=100}} It continued to encounter \"enormous losses\" throughout 1942.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=271\u2013272}} Its record in combat, however, was widely exploited in propaganda and increased Degrelle's legitimacy in the eyes of the German leadership, especially [[Heinrich Himmler]] who commanded the SS. In late 1942, Himmler declared the Walloons to be a Germanic race, paving the way for the unit's incorporation into the Waffen-SS on 1 June 1943. The Walloon Legion was re-organised into an SS [[brigade]]-sized unit of 2,000 men, known as the SS-''Sturmbrigade'' Wallonia (''SS- Sturmbrigade Wallonien'').{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=272}}\n\nThe high attrition rate within the Walloon Legion required increasing focus on recruitment. A second recruitment drive was started in February 1942, recruiting 450 new volunteers of whom many came from Rex's small youth wing. A third \"frantic\" campaign in November 1942 raised a further 1,700 men. These recruitment drives weakened many Rexist institutions by diverting manpower away from projects in Belgium. Attempts to recruit from [[Belgian prisoners of war in World War II|Belgian prisoners of war]] proved a failure.{{sfn|Plisnier|2011|p=101}} However, Degrelle became increasingly keen on the political potential of the Walloon Legion which he saw as a more effective political tool than the Rexist Party in Belgium.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=271\u2013272}} As the war continued and the pool of Rexist members fell, the volunteers became \"largely non-political 'adventurers' or desperate men\", often drawn from the urban working class and the unemployed.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=286}}\n\n===In the Waffen-SS, 1943\u20131945===\n[[File:L\u00e9on Degrelle \u00e0 Charleroi - 02.jpg|thumb|[[L\u00e9on Degrelle]], leader of Rex and member of the Walloon Legion, pictured in [[Charleroi]] in April 1944. Degrelle saw the Legion as a political tool to gain German support]]\nIn November 1943, the new SS-''Sturmbrigade'' Wallonia was deployed for the first time to the Ukraine in response to the Soviet [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive]]. There, the brigade fought as part of the [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|SS ''Wiking'' Panzer Division]] in the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] in February 1944 and suffered 70 percent casualties.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} Among those killed was the unit's commander Lucien Lippert.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} A detachment also fought at the [[Battle of Tannenberg Line|Tannenberg Line]] in [[Estonia]] in June 1944, also suffering heavy losses. Degrelle, however, was widely celebrated for his role in the battle at Cherkassy and received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]], becoming \"the poster boy for all European collaborators\" and being featured in ''[[Signal (magazine)|Signal]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} The remnants of the unit returned to Belgium where parades were held in [[Brussels]] and [[Charleroi]] in April 1944. Ahead of its return, largely to encourage more enlistments, the unit was even loaned armoured vehicles by other German units to make it seem more prestigious.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Liberation of Belgium|Allied Liberation of Belgium]] in September 1944, Degrelle managed to get the brigade upgraded to [[division (military)|division]]-status, after drafting Rexist refugees fleeing the Allied advance and Walloon volunteers from the paramilitary [[National Socialist Motor Corps]] (NSKK). The new 28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division \"Wallonia\" (''28. SS-Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Division Wallonien'') was created in October 1944. It numbered fewer than 4,000 men, making it considerably understrength,{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} and French and Spanish soldiers from the [[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism]] (LVF) and [[Blue Division]] were folded into the unit to increase its numbers.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} During the retreat, Walloon soldiers participated in the massacre of 6,000 Jewish female prisoners of [[Stutthof concentration camp]] in January 1945.<ref>{{cite news |title=Des soldats wallons ont particip\u00e9 au massacre de 6000 femmes juives: \"Ils d\u00e9crivent le plaisir qu'ils \u00e9prouvaient \u00e0 les ex\u00e9cuter\" |url=https://www.lalibre.be/belgique/societe/des-soldats-wallons-ont-participe-au-massacre-de-6000-femmes-juives-ils-decrivent-le-plaisir-qu-ils-eprouvaient-a-executer-ces-femmes-5ddd2b4c9978e272f9317ae1 |accessdate=26 November 2019 |agency=La Libre Belgique |date=26 November 2019}}</ref> The following month, the remains of the \"division\" saw action during [[Operation Solstice]] and were forced to retreat through [[Central Pomerania]] to [[Stettin]] on the [[Oder river]]. After mass defections in April its remaining 400 personnel fled to [[L\u00fcbeck]] where they surrendered to the British Army to escape [[German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|capture by Soviet forces]].\n\nAltogether, between 7,000 and 8,000 men served in the Walloon Legion between 1941 and 1944, slightly less than the number of Flemish who served in comparable formations. Some 1,337 were killed,{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=274}} representing about a fifth of its total strength.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} However, its maximum field strength had never exceeded 2,000 men.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} Fearing execution for treason in Belgium, Degrelle escaped to [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] and then fled to [[Francoist Spain]] where he remained in exile until his death in 1994.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Plisnier|first=Flore|title=Ils ont pris les armes pour Hitler: la collaboration arm\u00e9e en Belgique francophone|location=Brussels|publisher=Renaissance du Livre|year=2011|isbn=9782507003616}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Wouters|first1=Nico|editor1-last=Stahel|editor1-first=David|title=Joining Hitler's Crusade: European Nations and the Invasion of the Soviet Union, 1941|date=2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-316-51034-6|pages=260\u2013287|chapter=Belgium}}\n*{{cite book |ref={{harvid|Dictionnaire|2008}}|editor1-last=Aron |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Gotovitch |editor2-first=Jos\u00e9 |title=Dictionnaire de la seconde guerre mondiale en Belgique |date=2008 |publisher=Andr\u00e9 Versaille |location=Brussels |isbn=978-2-87495-001-8 |pages=243\u2013245 |chapter=L\u00e9gion Wallonie}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last1=Conway|first1=Martin|title=Collaboration in Belgium: L\u00e9on Degrelle and the Rexist movement, 1940-1944|date=1993|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0300055009}}\n* {{cite book|last1=De Bruyne|first1=Eddy|title=Les Wallons meurent \u00e0 l'est: la L\u00e9gion Wallonie et L\u00e9on Degrelle sur le Front russe, 1941-1945 |date=1991|publisher=Didier Hatier|location=Paris |isbn=9782870887400}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Littlejohn|first1=David|title=The Patriotic Traitors: A History of Collaboration in German-occupied Europe, 1940-45 |date=1972|publisher=Heinemann |location=London|isbn=0-434-42725-X}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.belgiumwwii.be/belgique-en-guerre/articles/legion-wallonie.html L\u00e9gion Wallonie] at Belgium-WWII ([[Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society|Cegesoma]])\n\n{{SS Brigades}}\n{{SS Divisions}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Foreign volunteer units of the Waffen-SS]]\n[[Category:Infantry divisions of the Waffen-SS]]\n[[Category:Belgian collaboration during World War II]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1941]]\n[[Category:1941 establishments in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945]]\n[[Category:1945 disestablishments in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Collaboration with the Axis Powers]]\n[[Category:Anti-communist organizations]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the Belgian military expedition to Mexico in 1867|Belgian Legion}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n| unit_name               = Walloon Legion\n| abbreviation            = \n| image                   = Wallonie shield.svg\n| image_size              = 155px\n| caption                 = Insignia of the Walloon Legion, incorporating the [[flag of Belgium]]\n| dates                   = 1941\u20131945\n| country                 = {{flag|Belgium}}\n| allegiance              = {{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} [[Nazi Germany]]\n| branch                  = {{flagicon image|War Ensign of Germany (1938-1945).svg}} [[Wehrmacht]] <small>(1941-43)</small><br/>{{flagicon image|Flag Schutzstaffel.svg}} [[Waffen-SS]] <small>(1943-45)</small>\n| type                    = [[Battalion]], [[brigade]] and later [[division (military)|division]], though never larger than brigade-strength.\n| role                    = [[Infantry]]\n| size                    = 2,000 (maximum strength)<br/>7,000\u20138,000 men (total, 1941\u20131945)\n| command_structure       = \n| notable_commanders      = [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]]\n| battles                 = \n{{tree list}}\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] ([[World War II]])\n** [[Bandenbek\u00e4mpfung|Anti-Partisan operations in Ukraine]]\n** [[Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket]]\n**{{tree list/final branch}} [[Operation Solstice]]\n{{tree list/end}}\n}}\nThe '''Walloon Legion''' ({{lang-fr|L\u00e9gion Wallonie}}) was a [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationist]] military formation recruited among French-speaking volunteers from [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German-occupied Belgium]], notably from [[Brussels]] and [[Wallonia]], during [[World War II]].

Attempts to recruit from [[Belgian prisoners of war in World War II|Belgian prisoners of war]] proved a failure.{{sfn|Plisnier|2011|p=101}} However, Degrelle became increasingly keen on the political potential of the Walloon Legion which he saw as a more effective political tool than the Rexist Party in Belgium.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=271\u2013272}} As the war continued and the pool of Rexist members fell, the volunteers became \"largely non-political 'adventurers' or desperate men\", often drawn from the urban working class and the unemployed.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=286}}\n\n===In the Waffen-SS, 1943\u20131945===\n[[File:L\u00e9on Degrelle \u00e0 Charleroi - 02.jpg|thumb|[[L\u00e9on Degrelle]], leader of Rex and member of the Walloon Legion, pictured in [[Charleroi]] in April 1944.

There, the brigade fought as part of the [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|SS ''Wiking'' Panzer Division]] in the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] in February 1944 and suffered 70 percent casualties.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} Among those killed was the unit's commander Lucien Lippert.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} A detachment also fought at the [[Battle of Tannenberg Line|Tannenberg Line]] in [[Estonia]] in June 1944, also suffering heavy losses.

The new 28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division \"Wallonia\" (''28. SS-Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Division Wallonien'') was created in October 1944.

There are several \u2013 often contradictory and sometimes unreliable \u2013 Janams\u0101kh\u012bs and they are not held in the same regard as other sources of scriptural knowledge.\n\n==Observances==\n[[File:InsideSikhGurdwara.jpg|thumb|The [[Darbar Sahib Hall|Darbar Sahib]] of a [[Gurdwara]]]]\nObservant Sikhs adhere to long-standing practices and traditions to strengthen and express their faith. The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%).

The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\".

The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the [[partition of India|land was partitioned]] into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\">{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=86\u201393}}</ref> The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"[[Radcliffe Line]]\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the [[Muslim League]] demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of [[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru in Canada]] proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} These leaders, however, were largely ignored.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia's Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TBscBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62446-2|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nWhen partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of [[jhatka]] versus [[halal]] meat, the disputed ownership of [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque|Gurdwara Sahidganj]] in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian [[Gurmukhi]] script to Arabic-Persian [[Nastaliq]] script in schools.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} During and after the [[Simla Conference]] in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\".
