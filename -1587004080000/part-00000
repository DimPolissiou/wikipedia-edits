A [[tornado emergency]] was issued following real-time confirmation of a large tornado just west of Monroe. The tornado missed downtown Monroe by about a mile, but nonetheless inflicted roof damage to many homes. A metal building structure was damaged while a wooden power pole and steel street light assembly were snapped.
