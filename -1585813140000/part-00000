Stari Grad is also a municipality within the [[Split-Dalmatia County]].\n\nThe most ancient part of Stari Grad falls within the [[UNESCO]] Protected [[World Heritage Site]] of the [[Stari Grad Plain]], while the entire municipality lies within the surrounding buffer zone.\n\n== Name ==\nStari Grad was originally named Faros ({{lang-el|\u03a6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}) by the Greek settlers from the island of [[Paros]], who arrived in 384 BC. It is thought that the name may come from the previous inhabitants of the area. A great [[Battle of Pharos|naval battle]] was recorded a year after the establishment of Pharos colony by a Greek inscription in Pharos (384 \u2013 383 BC) and by the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (80 \u2013 29 BC), initiated by conflicts between the Greek colonists and the indigenous Hvar islanders, the [[Liburnians]], who asked their compatriots for support. 10,000 Liburnians sailed out from their capital ''Idassa'' ([[Zadar]]), led by the ''Iadasinoi'' (people of Zadar), and laid siege to Pharos. The [[Ancient Syracuse|Syracusan]] fleet positioned in [[Issa (polis)|Issa]] was informed in time, and Greek [[triremes]] attacked the siege fleet, taking victory in the end. According to Diodorus, the Greeks killed more than 5,000 and captured 2,000 prisoners, ran down or captured their ships, and burned their weapons in dedication to their gods.\n\nThis battle meant the loss of the most important strategic Liburnian positions in the centre of the Adriatic, resulting in their final retreat to their main ethnic region, [[Liburnia]], and their complete departure from the Italic coast, apart from [[Truentum]]. In Roman times, the town became known as Faria, which was turned into Hvar by the incoming Slav population. When the administrative capital of the island was moved to today's [[Hvar (town)|Hvar town]] on the south coast, the old town became simply known as Stari Grad. (\"Stari\" translates as \"old\" and \"grad\" as \"city\" in Croatian.)\n\n== Population ==\nThe municipality of Stari Grad has a population of 2,781 (2011 Census), of which 1,885 live in the town itself.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"/> Four other settlements fall within the municipality, namely [[Dol (Stari Grad)|Dol]] (Pop. 311), [[Rudina, Croatia|Rudina]] (Pop. 70), Selca Kod Starog Grada (Pop. 17) and Vrbanj (Pop. 498).<ref name=\"Census 2011\"/>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Young Grape Vines, Stari Grad (5970770474).jpg|thumb|right|Young grape vines in Stari Grad]]\nStari Grad lies on the north side of the island of [[Hvar]], at the end of the Stari Grad Bay, a deep water channel, protected to the north by the hills of the Kabal peninsula and by the high mountain ridge of Hvar to the south.\n\nThe island's best agricultural land opens up to the east of Stari Grad town. This fertile plain has been farmed since pre-historic times, and the Greek field layout is still largely intact, thanks to continuing maintenance over the years of its dry stone walls. In 2008, the [[Stari Grad Plain]] became a [[UNESCO]] protected world heritage site.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Stari Grad, dominikansky klaster2.jpg|thumb|right|Dominican Monastery in Stari Grad]]\n{{Historical populations\n|title  = Historical population<br /> of Stari Grad\n|shading     = off\n|source = Naselja i stanovni\u0161tvo Republike Hrvatske 1857\u20132001, DZS, Zagreb, 2005\n|1961 |3231\n|1971 |3016\n|1981 |2857\n|1991 |2884\n|2001 |2817\n|2011 |2781\n}}\n{{See also |Stari Grad Plain}}\n\nThe area around present day Stari Grad was settled by the [[neolithic]] tribes of the [[Hvar culture]] who occupied the island between 3500 and 2500 BC, and who traded with other settlements around the [[Mediterranean]]. Remains of their pottery and other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] have been found, along with that of the [[Illyrian tribe]]<ref>The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes,{{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, 1996</ref> that succeeded them. The settlement lay at the lower end of Stari Grad Bay, defended by two strongholds on the north and south hillsides overlooking the harbour (Glavica and Purkin Kuk).\n\nIn 384 BC, the town was formally founded by [[ancient Greeks]] from the island of [[Paros]] in the [[Aegean Sea]]. They gave the name Faros (\u03a6\u0391\u03a1\u039f\u03a3) to their new settlement, an independent state permitted to mint its own money. The nearby plain was marked out with roads at right angles, and divided into fields of standard size. The Stari Grad Plain today represents one of the best-preserved examples of ancient Greek agriculture throughout the Mediterranean.\n\nIn 218 BC, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] [[Illyrian Wars#Surrender of Dimallum and Issa - 219/8 BC|defeated]] the Illyrian army at Pharos during the [[Illyrian Wars#Second Illyrian War|Second Illyrian War]], and the town was destroyed by the Roman army, but remained under Illyrian control. The town came under permanent Roman control [[Illyrian Wars#Destruction of the Ardiaei kingdom - 168 BC|by force]] in 168 BC, following the defeat of [[Gentius]] during the [[Illyrian Wars#Third Illyrian War|Third Illyrian War]].\n\nAn inscription from the 2nd century BC, refers to the Farians and their delegation to the Greek island of Paros and the oracle at Delphi. It makes mention of the Roman senate and the people (who are) well disposed and benevolent towards the city of Faros from the times of their ancestors. Further inscriptions, mosaics, tombstones, stone reliefs, fine pottery, jewellery, coins, villae rusticae in the Plain tell the story of life in and around the ancient Roman town.\n\nThe first church was built in the 5th century, in the southeast corner of the town, close to the city walls, on the foundations of a prior Greek house. In the 6th century, a new church was built on the same site, a twin basilica with a baptistry dedicated to St Mary and St John.\n\nIn the 7th century, following the fall of [[Solin, Croatia|Salona]], the capital of the [[Roman province of Dalmatia]], many of its people sought refuge in Faria and other Roman towns in the nearby islands, as noted by the historian [[Thomas the Archdeacon|Archdeacon Thomas of Split]] (1200\u20131268) in his [[Historia Salonitana]].\n\nRoman Faria was taken over by the Slavs at the beginning of the 8th century. At this point, the town received the name we know it by today \u2013 ''Hvar'' (the letter F not being part of the [[Glagolitic alphabet|old Slavonic alphabet]]). During the 10th century, Hvar came under the [[Narentines]]. Pirates from [[Omi\u0161]] on the mainland were raiding the coastal settlements, and new villages grew up in the foothills \u2013 Dol, Vrbanj and Pitve.\n\nIn 1278, the people of Hvar chose to put themselves under the protection of the [[Venetian Republic]]. As part of the contract, they undertook to expand the existing settlement on the south side of the island as a more suitable base for the Venetian fleet. This is the site of the present day [[Hvar (town)|town of Hvar]]. The old town of Stari Grad, also referred to as \u201cOld Hvar\u201d, remained the centre of the most densely populated part of the island, the area surrounding the agricultural plain.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the town was attacked by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], the first time repulsing them, but in 1571 they lost, and much of the town was burnt down. Following that loss, Stari Grad was slowly rebuilt from the ruins. During the 17th and 18th centuries, prosperity once again grew from sea-trade. The old waterfront (Stara Riva) was extended and the town underwent a major architectural and urban transformation, resulting in the town structure we see today.\n\nIn 1797 [[Napoleon]] overthrew the Venetian Republic, and Hvar briefly became part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. When the French also took over Austria, they conferred the status of an [[autonomous province]] on the town of Stari Grad. With the fall of the [[Napoleonic Empire]], Stari Grad became part of the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatian Kingdom]], within the larger political body of the [[Austro-hungarian empire|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\nThe 19th century was peaceful, and a time of prosperity for the entire island. However, the advent of [[phylloxera]] destroyed the island's grapevines, and the town's sailing vessels could not compete with the new steam ships. Large numbers of people moved away to start a new life elsewhere. Today, Stari Grad is again rebuilding itself, this time with tourism as the main focus.<ref>A. \u010cavi\u0107: Stari Grad, povijesni vodi\u010d; izdanje Centra za kulturu Staroga Grada, 2004.</ref>\n<ref>Grga Novak: Hvar Through the Centuries (Hvar Kroz Stoljeca); published Narodni Odbor Opcine Hvar, 1960.</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Maslinovik starigradsko polje hvar.JPG|thumb|right|Maslinovik in the Stari Grad Plain]]\n[[File:Mlin starigrad hvar.jpg|thumb|Mlin (old windmill), Stari Grad harbour]]\n[[File:Tvrdalj.jpg|thumb|Tvrdalj]]\n[[File:Kuca mauzolej Ljubic.jpg|thumb|right|House and Mausoleum of \u0160ime Ljubi\u0107]]\n* '''Town Music''' a society of local music enthusiasts, founded in 1876.\n* '''Theatre \"Petar Hektorovi\u0107\"''' Amateur theatre troop, dating from 1893, specialises in comic plays\n* '''Town Library''' is the direct descendant of the \"Croatian National Reading Room\" founded in 1874.

The original walls are preserved up to the beginning of the barrel vault that was built during the restoration in the early Romanesque period (11th century). The church floor was decorated with geometrical and figural details of which some are preserved. In the interior is original Early Christian altar. The large rosette on the facade is from the Gothic-era adaptation of the church in the 14th century.\n\nThe Church of St. Rocco, patron of Stari Grad, was raised by the confraternity of the same name, with provisions by the poet and nobleman Petar Hektorovi\u0107 in the 16th century. The [[bell]] [[tower]] was added in 1783 and side chapels in 1898. The main altar is the work of Andrija Bruttapela from 1774; it is decorated with statue of St. Rocco made by unidentified Venetian workshop. St. Rocco is shown with a [[dog]] that was a faithful friend after he was abandoned by everyone. In 1898 the mosaic floor of ancient Roman baths was unearthed beneath the stairs. The place is marked with [[Latin language|Latin]] inscription on one of the steps.\n\nThe [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[monastery]] of St. Peter the Martyr was founded, with help of townspeople, by friar Germanicus of [[Piacenza]] in 1482. The church and the monastery were ransacked and burned by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in 1571 and after that the monastery was fortified with round towers. The church was partially demolished and built anew in 1894. All that remained from the old church is the bell tower and the chapel with the [[tomb]] of the Renaissance poet Petar Hektorovi\u0107. The monastery museum host the oldest Greek inscriptions from Pharos (4th century BC). The picture gallery has a number of valuable paintings of Venetian artists such as the famous \"The Lamentation of Christ\" by Tintoretto (1518\u20131594).\n\n== Notable inhabitants ==\nNotable inhabitants and persons with the origin from Stari Grad.\n* [[Petar Hektorovi\u0107]] (1487\u20131572), poet, author of \"[[Fishing and Fishermen's Talk|Ribanja i ribarskog prigovaranja]]\"\n* [[\u0160ime Ljubi\u0107]] (1822\u20131896), archaeologist\n* [[Jak\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]] (1868\u20131943), mayor of Split\n\n== Stari Grad bays ==\nThere are numerous bays on each side of [[Stari Grad Bay]]. One of the largest bays is Tiha, located on the northern side. Tiha is a perfect anchoring point as it is safe, and sheltered from all winds (the name Tiha translates to silent/calm). Zavala is a slightly smaller bay, but equally calm, with plenty of anchoring spots. The other side (south side) of Stari Grad bay, is quite higher, and offers smaller bays with hills meters away from the beach. Gracisce is one of those bays, with a pebble covered beach, and a thick pine forest just meters above.

Stari Grad is also a municipality within the [[Split-Dalmatia County]].\n\nThe most ancient part of Stari Grad falls within the [[UNESCO]] Protected [[World Heritage Site]] of the [[Stari Grad Plain]], while the entire municipality lies within the surrounding buffer zone.\n\n== Name ==\nStari Grad was originally named Faros ({{lang-el|\u03a6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}) by the Greek settlers from the island of [[Paros]], who arrived in 384 BC. It is thought that the name may come from the previous inhabitants of the area. A great [[Battle of Pharos|naval battle]] was recorded a year after the establishment of Pharos colony by a Greek inscription in Pharos (384 \u2013 383 BC) and by the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (80 \u2013 29 BC), initiated by conflicts between the Greek colonists and the indigenous Hvar islanders, the [[Liburnians]], who asked their compatriots for support. 10,000 Liburnians sailed out from their capital ''Idassa'' ([[Zadar]]), led by the ''Iadasinoi'' (people of Zadar), and laid siege to Pharos. The [[Ancient Syracuse|Syracusan]] fleet positioned in [[Issa (polis)|Issa]] was informed in time, and Greek [[triremes]] attacked the siege fleet, taking victory in the end. According to Diodorus, the Greeks killed more than 5,000 and captured 2,000 prisoners, ran down or captured their ships, and burned their weapons in dedication to their gods.\n\nThis battle meant the loss of the most important strategic Liburnian positions in the centre of the Adriatic, resulting in their final retreat to their main ethnic region, [[Liburnia]], and their complete departure from the Italic coast, apart from [[Truentum]]. In Roman times, the town became known as Faria, which was turned into Hvar by the incoming Slav population. When the administrative capital of the island was moved to today's [[Hvar (town)|Hvar town]] on the south coast, the old town became simply known as Stari Grad. (\"Stari\" translates as \"old\" and \"grad\" as \"city\" in Croatian.)\n\n== Population ==\nThe municipality of Stari Grad has a population of 2,781 (2011 Census), of which 1,885 live in the town itself.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"/> Four other settlements fall within the municipality, namely [[Dol (Stari Grad)|Dol]] (Pop. 311), [[Rudina, Croatia|Rudina]] (Pop. 70), Selca Kod Starog Grada (Pop. 17) and Vrbanj (Pop. 498).<ref name=\"Census 2011\"/>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Young Grape Vines, Stari Grad (5970770474).jpg|thumb|right|Young grape vines in Stari Grad]]\nStari Grad lies on the north side of the island of [[Hvar]], at the end of the Stari Grad Bay, a deep water channel, protected to the north by the hills of the Kabal peninsula and by the high mountain ridge of Hvar to the south.\n\nThe island's best agricultural land opens up to the east of Stari Grad town. This fertile plain has been farmed since pre-historic times, and the Greek field layout is still largely intact, thanks to continuing maintenance over the years of its dry stone walls. In 2008, the [[Stari Grad Plain]] became a [[UNESCO]] protected world heritage site.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Stari Grad, dominikansky klaster2.jpg|thumb|right|Dominican Monastery in Stari Grad]]\n{{Historical populations\n|title  = Historican population<br /> of Stari Grad\n|shading     = off\n|source = Naselja i stanovni\u0161tvo Republike Hrvatske 1857\u20132001, DZS, Zagreb, 2005\n|1961 |3231\n|1971 |3016\n|1981 |2857\n|1991 |2884\n|2001 |2817\n|2011 |2781\n}}\n{{See also |Stari Grad Plain}}\n\nThe area around present day Stari Grad was settled by the [[neolithic]] tribes of the [[Hvar culture]] who occupied the island between 3500 and 2500 BC, and who traded with other settlements around the [[Mediterranean]]. Remains of their pottery and other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] have been found, along with that of the [[Illyrian tribe]]<ref>The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes,{{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, 1996</ref> that succeeded them. The settlement lay at the lower end of Stari Grad Bay, defended by two strongholds on the north and south hillsides overlooking the harbour (Glavica and Purkin Kuk).\n\nIn 384 BC, the town was formally founded by [[ancient Greeks]] from the island of [[Paros]] in the [[Aegean Sea]]. They gave the name Faros (\u03a6\u0391\u03a1\u039f\u03a3) to their new settlement, an independent state permitted to mint its own money. The nearby plain was marked out with roads at right angles, and divided into fields of standard size. The Stari Grad Plain today represents one of the best-preserved examples of ancient Greek agriculture throughout the Mediterranean.\n\nIn 218 BC, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] [[Illyrian Wars#Surrender of Dimallum and Issa - 219/8 BC|defeated]] the Illyrian army at Pharos during the [[Illyrian Wars#Second Illyrian War|Second Illyrian War]], and the town was destroyed by the Roman army, but remained under Illyrian control. The town came under permanent Roman control [[Illyrian Wars#Destruction of the Ardiaei kingdom - 168 BC|by force]] in 168 BC, following the defeat of [[Gentius]] during the [[Illyrian Wars#Third Illyrian War|Third Illyrian War]].\n\nAn inscription from the 2nd century BC, refers to the Farians and their delegation to the Greek island of Paros and the oracle at Delphi. It makes mention of the Roman senate and the people (who are) well disposed and benevolent towards the city of Faros from the times of their ancestors. Further inscriptions, mosaics, tombstones, stone reliefs, fine pottery, jewellery, coins, villae rusticae in the Plain tell the story of life in and around the ancient Roman town.\n\nThe first church was built in the 5th century, in the southeast corner of the town, close to the city walls, on the foundations of a prior Greek house. In the 6th century, a new church was built on the same site, a twin basilica with a baptistry dedicated to St Mary and St John.\n\nIn the 7th century, following the fall of [[Solin, Croatia|Salona]], the capital of the [[Roman province of Dalmatia]], many of its people sought refuge in Faria and other Roman towns in the nearby islands, as noted by the historian [[Thomas the Archdeacon|Archdeacon Thomas of Split]] (1200\u20131268) in his [[Historia Salonitana]].\n\nRoman Faria was taken over by the Slavs at the beginning of the 8th century. At this point, the town received the name we know it by today \u2013 ''Hvar'' (the letter F not being part of the [[Glagolitic alphabet|old Slavonic alphabet]]). During the 10th century, Hvar came under the [[Narentines]]. Pirates from [[Omi\u0161]] on the mainland were raiding the coastal settlements, and new villages grew up in the foothills \u2013 Dol, Vrbanj and Pitve.\n\nIn 1278, the people of Hvar chose to put themselves under the protection of the [[Venetian Republic]]. As part of the contract, they undertook to expand the existing settlement on the south side of the island as a more suitable base for the Venetian fleet. This is the site of the present day [[Hvar (town)|town of Hvar]]. The old town of Stari Grad, also referred to as \u201cOld Hvar\u201d, remained the centre of the most densely populated part of the island, the area surrounding the agricultural plain.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the town was attacked by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], the first time repulsing them, but in 1571 they lost, and much of the town was burnt down. Following that loss, Stari Grad was slowly rebuilt from the ruins. During the 17th and 18th centuries, prosperity once again grew from sea-trade. The old waterfront (Stara Riva) was extended and the town underwent a major architectural and urban transformation, resulting in the town structure we see today.\n\nIn 1797 [[Napoleon]] overthrew the Venetian Republic, and Hvar briefly became part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. When the French also took over Austria, they conferred the status of an [[autonomous province]] on the town of Stari Grad. With the fall of the [[Napoleonic Empire]], Stari Grad became part of the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatian Kingdom]], within the larger political body of the [[Austro-hungarian empire|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\nThe 19th century was peaceful, and a time of prosperity for the entire island. However, the advent of [[phylloxera]] destroyed the island's grapevines, and the town's sailing vessels could not compete with the new steam ships. Large numbers of people moved away to start a new life elsewhere. Today, Stari Grad is again rebuilding itself, this time with tourism as the main focus.<ref>A. \u010cavi\u0107: Stari Grad, povijesni vodi\u010d; izdanje Centra za kulturu Staroga Grada, 2004.</ref>\n<ref>Grga Novak: Hvar Through the Centuries (Hvar Kroz Stoljeca); published Narodni Odbor Opcine Hvar, 1960.</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Maslinovik starigradsko polje hvar.JPG|thumb|right|Maslinovik in the Stari Grad Plain]]\n[[File:Mlin starigrad hvar.jpg|thumb|Mlin (old windmill), Stari Grad harbour]]\n[[File:Tvrdalj.jpg|thumb|Tvrdalj]]\n[[File:Kuca mauzolej Ljubic.jpg|thumb|right|House and Mausoleum of \u0160ime Ljubi\u0107]]\n* '''Town Music''' a society of local music enthusiasts, founded in 1876.\n* '''Theatre \"Petar Hektorovi\u0107\"''' Amateur theatre troop, dating from 1893, specialises in comic plays\n* '''Town Library''' is the direct descendant of the \"Croatian National Reading Room\" founded in 1874.

The original walls are preserved up to the beginning of the barrel vault that was built during the restoration in the early Romanesque period (11th century). The church floor was decorated with geometrical and figural details of which some are preserved. In the interior is original Early Christian altar. The large rosette on the facade is from the Gothic-era adaptation of the church in the 14th century.\n\nThe Church of St. Rocco, patron of Stari Grad, was raised by the confraternity of the same name, with provisions by the poet and nobleman Petar Hektorovi\u0107 in the 16th century. The [[bell]] [[tower]] was added in 1783 and side chapels in 1898. The main altar is the work of Andrija Bruttapela from 1774; it is decorated with statue of St. Rocco made by unidentified Venetian workshop. St. Rocco is shown with a [[dog]] that was a faithful friend after he was abandoned by everyone. In 1898 the mosaic floor of ancient Roman baths was unearthed beneath the stairs. The place is marked with [[Latin language|Latin]] inscription on one of the steps.\n\nThe [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[monastery]] of St. Peter the Martyr was founded, with help of townspeople, by friar Germanicus of [[Piacenza]] in 1482. The church and the monastery were ransacked and burned by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in 1571 and after that the monastery was fortified with round towers. The church was partially demolished and built anew in 1894. All that remained from the old church is the bell tower and the chapel with the [[tomb]] of the Renaissance poet Petar Hektorovi\u0107. The monastery museum host the oldest Greek inscriptions from Pharos (4th century BC). The picture gallery has a number of valuable paintings of Venetian artists such as the famous \"The Lamentation of Christ\" by Tintoretto (1518\u20131594).\n\n== Notable inhabitants ==\nNotable inhabitants and persons with the origin from Stari Grad.\n* [[Petar Hektorovi\u0107]] (1487\u20131572), poet, author of \"[[Fishing and Fishermen's Talk|Ribanja i ribarskog prigovaranja]]\"\n* [[\u0160ime Ljubi\u0107]] (1822\u20131896), archaeologist\n* [[Jak\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]] (1868\u20131943), mayor of Split\n\n== Stari Grad bays ==\nThere are numerous bays on each side of [[Stari Grad Bay]]. One of the largest bays is Tiha, located on the northern side. Tiha is a perfect anchoring point as it is safe, and sheltered from all winds (the name Tiha translates to silent/calm). Zavala is a slightly smaller bay, but equally calm, with plenty of anchoring spots. The other side (south side) of Stari Grad bay, is quite higher, and offers smaller bays with hills meters away from the beach. Gracisce is one of those bays, with a pebble covered beach, and a thick pine forest just meters above. Closer to the city on the southern side there are a few beautiful beaches, such as the small sandy Maslinica bay.

In 1945, he was detained in custody as a political offender at the Gwang-yang police station and was released at the time of [[Gwang-bok-jeol|independence from Japan]].\n\nAfter Korea's liberation from Japan, Lee taught at Cheong-gu University, Seoul National University, and Young-nam University. In 1954, he was invited to join the Korean Academy of the Arts, and by 1978 he had achieved a life-time membership in the Korean Academy of the Arts. Lee served as the chairman of the Admiral Lee Sun-sin Memorial Committee, a member of the Korea Alpinist's Association, the Korea Culture Preservation Association, and the People's Culture Association, as well as being Editor-in-Chief for the History of Korea Independence Movements.<ref name=\"klti.or.kr\"/>\n\nLee won the Rose of Sharon National Medal of Honor in 1970, and died in 1982.<ref name=\"klti.or.kr\"/>\n\n==Works==\nIn his childhood, Lee and his friends enjoyed playing near a stream close to his house on the hills of Mount No-bi-san. Whenever he visited Masan, his hometown, later in life, he went to the stream as it reminded him of his childhood. The poems ''Climbing Up the Old Hill'' and ''Symphony of Spring'' both depict the days when he played on the hill of Mount Nobisan. One of his motivations for writing poetry in the  ''[[sijo]]'' form is that his father would recited it to him when he was a child.\n\nIn 1921, the poem ''Hyul-jo'' was published for the first time, in ''Ah-sung'', volume 4, under the pen name ''Du-wu-seong''.\n\nLee Eun Sang earned a reputation as a poet who opened up a new modern free form of ''sijo''. Most of his poems became lyrics for classical style songs. ''Nosan Sijo-jip'', his first volume of poetry, was published in 1932. The works integrated characteristics of homesickness, sentimentality, and the beauty of nature. The poems ''Memory of Hometown'', ''Ga-go-pa'', and '' Night of Seong-bul Temple''  are filled with lyricism.\n\nHis deep lyricism in poems such as ''Bom-cheo-nyeo'' [Maid of Spring](\ubd04\ucc98\ub140) and 'Ga-go-pa' [Longing to Go Home] (\uac00\uace0\ud30c), and his mastery of ''sijo'' style into a new style, he is considered the best poet in the revival of ''sijo'' in modern era.\nHis ''Dong-hae-song'' (\ub3d9\ud574\uc1a1) and ''High Ground is Over There'' are celebrated as a great accomplishments.\n\nHe was a historian and a scholar of classical studies.  Among his many achievements in these fields, the most notable is the translation into modern Korean the Admiral Lee Sun-Shin's \"Diary of Battles of Im-Jin War\" [Journals Kept During the Hideyoshi Invasion of 1592]\n\nThe Korea Literature Translation Institute, summarizes Lee's contributions to Korean literature as follows:\n\n:A poet notable standing for his evolving style, Lee Eunsang\u2019s career consists of several distinct stages. When he made his literary debut in 1923, his poetic works were almost entirely in free verse form, and he also published critical essays on Western poets such as Whitman and Tennyson. It was only later on that Lee developed the passionate interest in Sijo, a traditional Korean poetic genre that was first invented during the Goryeo Dynasty, in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, consisting of a set rhythm pattern usually involving the systematic arrangement of lines in three and four syllables each. In the five hundred years that followed its invention, Sijo remained Korea\u2019s most popular form of verse, but it had long since lost its mass appeal by the early twentieth century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Source-attribution|\"Lee Eunsang\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |date=2013-09-21 }}</ref>\n\n:In the mid-1920s, the poet Lee Byeonggi began his well-known efforts preserve and revive the Sijo art form, and it is Lee Eunsang who is known to have joined him in his quest and matched him in his fervor. Both poets published numerous critical essays supporting the art form of Sijo with sound theoretical background and calling for the modernization that they felt was necessary in order to regain mass appeal. The actual Sijo poems of Lee Byeonggi and Lee Eunsang, however, were distinctly different in both style and tone despite the fact that they both contributed to the restoration of the genre to its prominent position in Korean literature. While Lee Byeonggi\u2019s technical innovations largely involved lengthening the Sijo verses and where his style was exquisitely refined, Lee Eunsang concentrated on condensing the three line poems even further into two lines, resulting in original works that were short but extremely dynamic and powerful. Lee Eunsang went on to create a new Sijo-form he called \u2018Yangjangsijo,\u2019 consisting of less disruptive line breaks and a smoother rhythm. Several of his \u2018Yangjangsijo\u2019 poems, such as \u201cGagopa,\u201d \u201cSeongbulsaui Bam,\u201dand \u201cYetdongsane Olla,\u201d were converted into song lyrics, and aided the popularization of Sijo a great deal.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n:After the Korean War, Lee Eunsang began to take a decided interest in the significance of historical context and its effect on literary works. The central themes of his earlier stages vary a great deal: for example, in poems such as \u201cGaneun Gonmada\u201d and \u201cSongdo Norae\u201d from his first collection Collected Sijo of Nosan (Nosan sijojip, 1932), treat of recollection and the love of history in general, but with \u201cHeureneun Bombit\u201dand \u201cSseulsseulhan Geunal,\u201d he addresses feelings regarding nature and personal experiences. In sharp contrast, the poems from this new, post-war period reflect Lee\u2019s newfound sense of social and political awareness, treating of subjects such as the pain of national division, the memories of patriots, and the glorification of the Korean nation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Awards==\nIn 1969, he was awarded the Presidential Prize, and in 1970, the National Medal of Honor, Republic of Korea, Mu-gung-hwa-jang The Medal of Rose of Sharon.<ref name=\"Naver Search\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Kim Sang-sun. \"On the Shijo (Koren Liric) of Lee un-sang.\" ''Korean Literature'',  May 1985. vol.93 n.1 p.&nbsp;209-229.\n* Park Sang-gon. \"A Study on Lee Eun-sang's shijo.\" ''KNUE'', 1992. \n* Lee Sung-won. \"The Status of Lee Eun-sang's shijo.\" ''A Collection of Treatises about Human Knowledge,'' vol.10.

After that, he worked for [[Dong-a Ilbo]] and [[Chosun Ilbo]] (Korean newspapers).<ref name=\"Lee1996\">{{cite book|title=Who's Who in Korean Literature|chapter=Yi Un-Sang|pages=524\u2013526|author=Lee, Kyung-ho|publisher=Hollym|location=Seoul|year=1996|isbn=1-56591-066-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1942, he was arrested on the suspicion of being implicated in the so-called \"incident of Chosun Language Academy\" (\uc870\uc120\uc5b4\ud559\ud68c\uc0ac\uac74), and was released the next year when his indictment suspended. In 1945, he was detained in custody as a political offender at the Gwang-yang police station and was released at the time of [[Gwang-bok-jeol|independence from Japan]].\n\nAfter Korea's liberation from Japan, Lee taught at Cheong-gu University, Seoul National University, and Young-nam University. In 1954, he was invited to join the Korean Academy of the Arts, and by 1978 he had achieved a life-time membership in the Korean Academy of the Arts. Lee served as the chairman of the Admiral Lee Sun-sin Memorial Committee, a member of the Korea Alpinist's Association, the Korea Culture Preservation Association, and the People's Culture Association, as well as being Editor-in-Chief for the History of Korea Independence Movements.<ref name=\"klti.or.kr\"/>\n\nLee won the Rose of Sharon National Medal of Honor in 1970, and died in 1982.<ref name=\"klti.or.kr\"/>\n\n==Works==\nIn his childhood, Lee and his friends enjoyed playing near a stream close to his house on the hills of Mount No-bi-san. Whenever he visited Masan, his hometown, later in life, he went to the stream as it reminded him of his childhood. The poems ''Climbing Up the Old Hill'' and ''Symphony of Spring'' both depict the days when he played on the hill of Mount Nobisan. One of his motivations for writing poetry in the  ''[[sijo]]'' form is that his father would recited it to him when he was a child.\n\nIn 1921, the poem ''Hyul-jo'' was published for the first time, in ''Ah-sung'', volume 4, under the pen name ''Du-wu-seong''.\n\nLee Eun Sang earned a reputation as a poet who opened up a new modern free form of ''sijo''. Most of his poems became lyrics for classical style songs. ''Nosan Sijo-jip'', his first volume of poetry, was published in 1932. The works integrated characteristics of homesickness, sentimentality, and the beauty of nature. The poems ''Memory of Hometown'', ''Ga-go-pa'', and '' Night of Seong-bul Temple''  are filled with lyricism.\n\nHis deep lyricism in poems such as ''Bom-cheo-nyeo'' [Maid of Spring](\ubd04\ucc98\ub140) and 'Ga-go-pa' [Longing to Go Home] (\uac00\uace0\ud30c), and his mastery of ''sijo'' style into a new style, he is considered the best poet in the revival of ''sijo'' in modern era.\nHis ''Dong-hae-song'' (\ub3d9\ud574\uc1a1) and ''High Ground is Over There'' are celebrated as a great accomplishments.\n\nHe was a historian and a scholar of classical studies.  Among his many achievements in these fields, the most notable is the translation into modern Korean the Admiral Lee Sun-Shin's \"Diary of Battles of Im-Jin War\" [Journals Kept During the Hideyoshi Invasion of 1592]\n\nThe Korea Literature Translation Institute, summarizes Lee's contributions to Korean literature as follows:\n\n:A poet notable standing for his evolving style, Lee Eunsang\u2019s career consists of several distinct stages. When he made his literary debut in 1923, his poetic works were almost entirely in free verse form, and he also published critical essays on Western poets such as Whitman and Tennyson. It was only later on that Lee developed the passionate interest in Sijo, a traditional Korean poetic genre that was first invented during the Goryeo Dynasty, in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, consisting of a set rhythm pattern usually involving the systematic arrangement of lines in three and four syllables each. In the five hundred years that followed its invention, Sijo remained Korea\u2019s most popular form of verse, but it had long since lost its mass appeal by the early twentieth century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Source-attribution|\"Lee Eunsang\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |date=2013-09-21 }}</ref>\n\n:In the mid-1920s, the poet Lee Byeonggi began his well-known efforts preserve and revive the Sijo art form, and it is Lee Eunsang who is known to have joined him in his quest and matched him in his fervor. Both poets published numerous critical essays supporting the art form of Sijo with sound theoretical background and calling for the modernization that they felt was necessary in order to regain mass appeal. The actual Sijo poems of Lee Byeonggi and Lee Eunsang, however, were distinctly different in both style and tone despite the fact that they both contributed to the restoration of the genre to its prominent position in Korean literature. While Lee Byeonggi\u2019s technical innovations largely involved lengthening the Sijo verses and where his style was exquisitely refined, Lee Eunsang concentrated on condensing the three line poems even further into two lines, resulting in original works that were short but extremely dynamic and powerful. Lee Eunsang went on to create a new Sijo-form he called \u2018Yangjangsijo,\u2019 consisting of less disruptive line breaks and a smoother rhythm. Several of his \u2018Yangjangsijo\u2019 poems, such as \u201cGagopa,\u201d \u201cSeongbulsaui Bam,\u201dand \u201cYetdongsane Olla,\u201d were converted into song lyrics, and aided the popularization of Sijo a great deal.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n:After the Korean War, Lee Eunsang began to take a decided interest in the significance of historical context and its effect on literary works. The central themes of his earlier stages vary a great deal: for example, in poems such as \u201cGaneun Gonmada\u201d and \u201cSongdo Norae\u201d from his first collection Collected Sijo of Nosan (Nosan sijojip, 1932), treat of recollection and the love of history in general, but with \u201cHeureneun Bombit\u201dand \u201cSseulsseulhan Geunal,\u201d he addresses feelings regarding nature and personal experiences. In sharp contrast, the poems from this new, post-war period reflect Lee\u2019s newfound sense of social and political awareness, treating of subjects such as the pain of national division, the memories of patriots, and the glorification of the Korean nation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Awards==\nIn 1969, he was awarded the Presidential Prize, and in 1970, the National Medal of Honor, Republic of Korea, Mu-gung-hwa-jang The Medal of Rose of Sharon.<ref name=\"Naver Search\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Kim Sang-sun. \"On the Shijo (Koren Liric) of Lee un-sang.\" ''Korean Literature'',  May 1985. vol.93 n.1 p.&nbsp;209-229.\n* Park Sang-gon. \"A Study on Lee Eun-sang's shijo.\" ''KNUE'', 1992. \n* Lee Sung-won. \"The Status of Lee Eun-sang's shijo.\" ''A Collection of Treatises about Human Knowledge,'' vol.10.

At age 76 in 2006, he became the second-oldest inmate at the time to be executed in the United States since 1976, after [[John B. Nixon]], who was executed in Mississippi in December 2005 at age 77. This record has since been broken by [[Walter Moody]].\n\nPro-death penalty activists cite Allen's actions as a reason to support capital punishment in the United States. He was already serving a life sentence for one murder when he was convicted of organizing the killing of three more people.\n\nWhile in prison, Allen then acknowledged his Native American [[Choctaw]] heritage. He also claimed to be deaf, blind and severely disabled, requiring a wheelchair for mobility. He did not know any [[sign language]] to communicate with hearing people. During his execution, he was able to walk from his wheelchair to the death podium unassisted. In addition, he appeared to be looking straight at his family prior to receiving the first dose of drugs during his lethal injection procedure. Allen had a confirmed advanced case of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], and he suffered a perhaps related [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on September 2, 2005. His lawyers declared that \"he presents absolutely no danger at this point, as incapacitated as he is. There's no legitimate state purpose served by executing him. It would be gratuitous punishment.\" They argued that his execution would constitute [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and requested that he be granted [[clemency]] by California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], which was subsequently refused.\n\n==Murder of Mary Sue Kitts==\nIn 1974, Allen plotted the [[burglary]] of Fran's Market, a [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] area [[supermarket]], owned by Ray and Fran Schletewitz, whom Allen had known for years. The plot involved his son, Roger Allen, as well as Ed Savala, Carl Mayfield, and Charles Jones. Mayfield and Jones worked for Clarence Ray Allen in his security guard business as well as part of a burglary enterprise allegedly operated by Allen. As part of the burglary plot against Fran's Market, he arranged for someone to steal a set of door and alarm keys from the market owner's son, Bryon Schletewitz, age 19, while Schletewitz was swimming in Allen's pool. Allen then arranged a date between Schletewitz and Mary Sue Kitts (his son Roger's girlfriend) for the evening, during which time the burglary took place. The burglary netted $500 in cash and $10,000 in money orders from the store's safe. Following the commission of the burglary, Kitts told Bryon Schletewitz that Allen had committed the crime, which she knew as she had helped Allen cash [[money order]]s that had been stolen from the store.<ref name=\"DoubleLife\">\n{{cite news\n |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-01-12/news/17275973_1_san-joaquin-valley-fresno-county-clarence-ray-allen/4\n |title=Double life of a Death Row killer \n |author=Jim Doyle \n |newspaper=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]] \n |date=January 12, 2006 \n}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSchletewitz confronted Roger Allen, informing him that he had been told of the crime by Kitts, and Roger Allen admitted the crime. When Roger Allen told his father Clarence of Bryon's accusation, Clarence Allen stated that they (Schletewitz and Kitts) would have to be \"dealt with.\" He enlisted three employees of his security firm, Charles Jones, Carl Mayfield, and Lee Furrow. According to an opinion filed on May 6, 2004 in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals:\n\n:Allen called a meeting at his house and told Jones, Mayfield, and Furrow that Kitts had been talking too much and should be killed. Allen called for a vote on the issue of Kitts's execution. The vote was unanimous because those present feared what would happen if they did not go along with Allen's plan. Allen had previously told his criminal accomplices that he would kill snitches and that he had friends and connections to do the job for him even if he were in prison. He had also referred to himself as a Mafia hitman and stated that the \"secret witness program\" was useless because a good lawyer could always discover an informant's name and address. Allen kept a newspaper article about the murder of a man and woman in Nevada, and claimed he had \"blown them in half\" with a shotgun.<ref name=\"FindLawOrder\">\n{{cite web\n |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1050550.html\n |title=ALLEN v.

After an unsuccessful attempt to poison her with [[cyanide]] capsules, Allen called Furrow to learn if he had killed Kitts. Furrow told Allen he was in the process of strangling her and Allen replied, \"do it.\" After killing Kitts, Furrow threw her body into the [[Friant-Kern Canal]]. The body has never been found.\n\n==Execution at Fran's Market==\nWhile in [[Folsom Prison]], Allen conspired with fellow inmate [[Billy Ray Hamilton]] to murder the various witnesses who had testified against him, including Bryon Schletewitz. Allen intended to obtain a new trial, where there would be no witnesses to testify to his acts.\n\nAfter Hamilton was [[paroled]] from Folsom Prison, he carried out Allen's orders. On September 5, 1980, Hamilton and his girlfriend, Connie Barbo, went to Fran's Market, east of Fresno, California. Bryon Schletewitz, the son of the market's owner, worked at the market. There, Hamilton murdered Schletewitz and fellow employees Josephine Rocha, 17, and Douglas White, 18, with a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and wounded two other people, Joe Rios and Jack Abbott.<ref name=\"FresnoExecution\">\n{{cite news\n |url=http://www.fresnobee.com/local/story/11697658p-12423869c.html\n |title=Fresno killer Allen put to death; U.S. Supreme Court refuses to intervene in 1980 triple murder\n |author=Bill McEwen, Tim Eberly and John Ellis\n |newspaper=[[The Fresno Bee]]\n |date=January 17, 2006\n}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> Hamilton shot Schletewitz at near point-blank range in the forehead and then killed Rocha and White after forcing them to lie on the floor of the store.  Rios, also an employee of the market, was shot as well but raised his arm as Hamilton fired on him and this action undoubtedly saved his life.  The other wounded survivor, Abbott, was a neighbor who heard the shotgun blasts, came to the market to investigate, and was also shot by Hamilton.  Abbott returned fire and wounded Hamilton, who escaped from the scene.\n\nFive days after the events at Fran's Market, Hamilton was arrested while attempting to rob a liquor store.  On his person was found a \"hit list\" with the names and addresses of the witnesses who testified against Allen at his trial for Kitts' murder; Bryon Schletewitz was on the list.\n\n==Legal proceedings==\nIn 1980, the [[California Attorney General]] filed charges against Allen and prosecuted the trial in [[Glenn County, California]], due to a change of venue. The trial took place in 1982 and lasted 23 days, and 58 witnesses were called to testify.<ref>''''Allen v. Woodford'', 395 F.3d 979, 989-990'', ''''</ref>  Ultimately, the jury convicted Allen of triple [[murder]] and [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to murder eight witnesses.\n\nAs special circumstances making Allen eligible for the death penalty, the jury also found that Allen had previously been convicted of murder, had committed multiple murders, and had murdered witnesses in retaliation for their prior testimony and to prevent future testimony.  During a seven-day penalty phase, the Attorney General introduced evidence of Allen's career orchestrating violent robberies in the Central Valley, including ten violent crimes and six prior felony convictions.  The jury returned a unanimous verdict of death, and the Glenn County Superior Court sentenced Allen on November 22, 1980.\n\nIn 1987, the [[California Supreme Court]] affirmed Allen's death sentence. [[Associate Justice]] Joseph Grodin's opinion referred to Allen's crimes as \"sordid events\" with an \"extraordinarily massive amount\" of aggravating evidence.  In a dissenting opinion, California Supreme Court Justice Broussard stated that the prosecutor influenced the jury by telling them that \"if you conclude that aggravating evidence outweighs the [[Mitigating factor|mitigating evidence]], you shall return a death sentence,\" while the law does not mandate a death sentence in such a situation.  According to Justice Broussard, this led to a lack of freedom for the jury to make a \"normative decision.\"\n\nIn 2005, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found that Allen's trial counsel had been inadequate, and the evidence against him was largely the testimony of Allen's several accomplices, who painted him as the mastermind who forced them by threats and scare tactics to commit robberies and murders.  However the court denied rehearing in Allen's case.  In her opinion for the panel, Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw concluded:\n\n: Evidence of Allen's guilt is overwhelming.  Given the nature of his crimes, sentencing him to another life term would achieve none of the traditional purposes underlying punishment.  Allen continues to pose a threat to society, indeed to those very persons who testified against him in the Fran's Market triple-murder trial here at issue, and has proven that he is beyond rehabilitation.  He has shown himself more than capable of arranging murders from behind bars.  If the death penalty is to serve any purpose at all, it is to prevent the very sort of murderous conduct for which Allen was convicted.\n\nDeputy [[California Attorney General]] Ward Campbell stated in an interview:\n: Well, Mr. Allen has cited his age, the length of time on death row, claims about innocence, errors at his trial.  We found and told the governor we found all those reasons to be unpersuasive given the nature of his crime, which was in fact a direct attack on the criminal justice system perpetrated by a man whom Society thought to be safe from.  They thought they were safe from him because he was behind bars and yet he continued to perpetrate these types of crimes and none of the factors that they cite now overshadow or outbalance those reasons for now executing the judgment of the people of the State of California.\n\nOn January 13, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to grant Allen [[clemency]], stating that \"his conduct did not result from youth or inexperience, but instead resulted from the hardened and calculating decisions of a mature man.\"  Schwarzenegger also cited a poem in which Allen glorified his actions, where Allen wrote, \"We rob and steal and for those who squeal are usually found dying or dead.\"\n\nOn January 15, 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Allen's claim that executing an aged or infirm person was cruel and unusual punishment, observing that his mental acuity was unimpaired and that he had been fifty years of age when he arranged the murders from prison.  Judge Kim Wardlaw writing for the panel of judges Susan Graber, Richard Clifton, and herself: \n: His age and experience only sharpened his ability to coldly calculate the execution of the crime.  Nothing about his current ailments reduces his culpability and thus they do not lessen the retributive or deterrent purposes of the death penalty.\n\nThe [[United States Supreme Court]] declined to hear the case, albeit over the dissent of Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], who stated: \"I believe that in the circumstances he raises a significant question as to whether his execution would constitute 'cruel and unusual punishment.'\"\n\n==1983 Chino Hills Murders==\n[[Kevin Cooper (prisoner)|Kevin Cooper]] was convicted of the 1983 murder of a family in the Chino Hills.

At age 76 in 2006, he became the second-oldest inmate at the time to be executed in the United States since 1976, after [[John B. Nixon]], who was executed in Mississippi in December 2005 at age 77. This record has since been broken by [[Walter Moody]].\n\nPro-death penalty activists cite Allen's actions as a reason to support capital punishment in the United States. He was already serving a life sentence for one murder when he was convicted of organizing the killing of three more people.\n\nWhile in prison, Allen then acknowledged his Native American [[Choctaw]] heritage. He also claimed to be deaf, blind and severely disabled, requiring a wheelchair for mobility. He did not know any [[sign language]] to communicate with hearing people. During his execution, he was able to walk from his wheelchair to the death podium unassisted. In addition, he appeared to be looking straight at his family prior to receiving the first dose of drugs during his lethal injection procedure. Allen had a confirmed advanced case of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], and he suffered a perhaps related [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on September 2, 2005. His lawyers declared that \"he presents absolutely no danger at this point, as incapacitated as he is. There's no legitimate state purpose served by executing him. It would be gratuitous punishment.\" They argued that his execution would constitute [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and requested that he be granted [[clemency]] by California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], which was subsequently refused.\n\n==Murder of Mary Sue Kitts==\nIn 1974, Allen plotted the [[burglary]] of Fran's Market, a [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] area [[supermarket]], owned by Ray and Fran Schletewitz, whom Allen had known for years. The plot involved his son, Roger Allen, as well as Ed Savala, Carl Mayfield, and Charles Jones. Mayfield and Jones worked for Clarence Ray Allen in his security guard business as well as part of a burglary enterprise allegedly operated by Allen. As part of the burglary plot against Fran's Market, he arranged for someone to steal a set of door and alarm keys from the market owner's son, Bryon Schletewitz, age 19, while Schletewitz was swimming in Allen's pool. Allen then arranged a date between Schletewitz and Mary Sue Kitts (his son Roger's girlfriend) for the evening, during which time the burglary took place. The burglary netted $500 in cash and $10,000 in money orders from the store's safe. Following the commission of the burglary, Kitts told Bryon Schletewitz that Allen had committed the crime, which she knew as she had helped Allen cash [[money order]]s that had been stolen from the store.<ref name=\"DoubleLife\">\n{{cite news\n |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-01-12/news/17275973_1_san-joaquin-valley-fresno-county-clarence-ray-allen/4\n |title=Double life of a Death Row killer \n |author=Jim Doyle \n |newspaper=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]] \n |date=January 12, 2006 \n}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSchletewitz confronted Roger Allen, informing him that he had been told of the crime by Kitts, and Roger Allen admitted the crime. When Roger Allen told his father Clarence of Bryon's accusation, Clarence Allen stated that they (Schletewitz and Kitts) would have to be \"dealt with.\" He enlisted three employees of his security firm, Charles Jones, Carl Mayfield, and Lee Furrow. According to an opinion filed on May 6, 2004 in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals:\n\n:Allen called a meeting at his house and told Jones, Mayfield, and Furrow that Kitts had been talking too much and should be killed. Allen called for a vote on the issue of Kitts's execution. The vote was unanimous because those present feared what would happen if they did not go along with Allen's plan. Allen had previously told his criminal accomplices that he would kill snitches and that he had friends and connections to do the job for him even if he were in prison. He had also referred to himself as a Mafia hitman and stated that the \"secret witness program\" was useless because a good lawyer could always discover an informant's name and address. Allen kept a newspaper article about the murder of a man and woman in Nevada, and claimed he had \"blown them in half\" with a shotgun.<ref name=\"FindLawOrder\">\n{{cite web\n |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1050550.html\n |title=ALLEN v.

After an unsuccessful attempt to poison her with [[cyanide]] capsules, Allen called Furrow to learn if he had killed Kitts. Furrow told Allen he was in the process of strangling her and Allen replied, \"do it.\" After killing Kitts, Furrow threw her body into the [[Friant-Kern Canal]]. The body has never been found.\n\n==Execution at Fran's Market==\nWhile in [[Folsom Prison]], Allen conspired with fellow inmate [[Billy Ray Hamilton]] to murder the various witnesses who had testified against him, including Bryon Schletewitz. Allen intended to obtain a new trial, where there would be no witnesses to testify to his acts.\n\nAfter Hamilton was [[paroled]] from Folsom Prison, he carried out Allen's orders. On September 5, 1980, Hamilton and his girlfriend, Connie Barbo, went to Fran's Market, east of Fresno, California. Bryon Schletewitz, the son of the market's owner, worked at the market. There, Hamilton murdered Schletewitz and fellow employees Josephine Rocha, 17, and Douglas White, 18, with a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and wounded two other people, Joe Rios and Jack Abbott.<ref name=\"FresnoExecution\">\n{{cite news\n |url=http://www.fresnobee.com/local/story/11697658p-12423869c.html\n |title=Fresno killer Allen put to death; U.S. Supreme Court refuses to intervene in 1980 triple murder\n |author=Bill McEwen, Tim Eberly and John Ellis\n |newspaper=[[The Fresno Bee]]\n |date=January 17, 2006\n}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> Hamilton shot Schletewitz at near point-blank range in the forehead and then killed Rocha and White after forcing them to lie on the floor of the store.  Rios, also an employee of the market, was shot as well but raised his arm as Hamilton fired on him and this action undoubtedly saved his life.  The other wounded survivor, Abbott, was a neighbor who heard the shotgun blasts, came to the market to investigate, and was also shot by Hamilton.  Abbott returned fire and wounded Hamilton, who escaped from the scene.\n\nFive days after the events at Fran's Market, Hamilton was arrested while attempting to rob a liquor store.  On his person was found a \"hit list\" with the names and addresses of the witnesses who testified against Allen at his trial for Kitts' murder; Bryon Schletewitz was on the list.\n\n==Legal proceedings==\nIn 1980, the [[California Attorney General]] filed charges against Allen and prosecuted the trial in [[Glenn County, California]], due to a change of venue. The trial took place in 1982 and lasted 23 days, and 58 witnesses were called to testify.<ref>''''Allen v. Woodford'', 395 F.3d 979, 989-990'', ''''</ref>  Ultimately, the jury convicted Allen of triple [[murder]] and [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to murder eight witnesses.\n\nAs special circumstances making Allen eligible for the death penalty, the jury also found that Allen had previously been convicted of murder, had committed multiple murders, and had murdered witnesses in retaliation for their prior testimony and to prevent future testimony.  During a seven-day penalty phase, the Attorney General introduced evidence of Allen's career orchestrating violent robberies in the Central Valley, including ten violent crimes and six prior felony convictions.  The jury returned a unanimous verdict of death, and the Glenn County Superior Court sentenced Allen on November 22, 1980.\n\nIn 1987, the [[California Supreme Court]] affirmed Allen's death sentence. [[Associate Justice]] Joseph Grodin's opinion referred to Allen's crimes as \"sordid events\" with an \"extraordinarily massive amount\" of aggravating evidence.  In a dissenting opinion, California Supreme Court Justice Broussard stated that the prosecutor influenced the jury by telling them that \"if you conclude that aggravating evidence outweighs the [[Mitigating factor|mitigating evidence]], you shall return a death sentence,\" while the law does not mandate a death sentence in such a situation.  According to Justice Broussard, this led to a lack of freedom for the jury to make a \"normative decision.\"\n\nIn 2005, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found that Allen's trial counsel had been inadequate, and the evidence against him was largely the testimony of Allen's several accomplices, who painted him as the mastermind who forced them by threats and scare tactics to commit robberies and murders.  However the court denied rehearing in Allen's case.  In her opinion for the panel, Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw concluded:\n\n: Evidence of Allen's guilt is overwhelming.  Given the nature of his crimes, sentencing him to another life term would achieve none of the traditional purposes underlying punishment.  Allen continues to pose a threat to society, indeed to those very persons who testified against him in the Fran's Market triple-murder trial here at issue, and has proven that he is beyond rehabilitation.  He has shown himself more than capable of arranging murders from behind bars.  If the death penalty is to serve any purpose at all, it is to prevent the very sort of murderous conduct for which Allen was convicted.\n\nDeputy [[California Attorney General]] Ward Campbell stated in an interview:\n: Well, Mr. Allen has cited his age, the length of time on death row, claims about innocence, errors at his trial.  We found and told the governor we found all those reasons to be unpersuasive given the nature of his crime, which was in fact a direct attack on the criminal justice system perpetrated by a man whom Society thought to be safe from.  They thought they were safe from him because he was behind bars and yet he continued to perpetrate these types of crimes and none of the factors that they cite now overshadow or outbalance those reasons for now executing the judgment of the people of the State of California.\n\nOn January 13, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to grant Allen [[clemency]], stating that \"his conduct did not result from youth or inexperience, but instead resulted from the hardened and calculating decisions of a mature man.\"  Schwarzenegger also cited a poem in which Allen glorified his actions, where Allen wrote, \"We rob and steal and for those who squeal are usually found dying or dead.\"\n\nOn January 15, 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Allen's claim that executing an aged or infirm person was cruel and unusual punishment, observing that his mental acuity was unimpaired and that he had been fifty years of age when he arranged the murders from prison.  Judge Kim Wardlaw writing for the panel of judges Susan Graber, Richard Clifton, and herself: \n: His age and experience only sharpened his ability to coldly calculate the execution of the crime.  Nothing about his current ailments reduces his culpability and thus they do not lessen the retributive or deterrent purposes of the death penalty.\n\nThe [[United States Supreme Court]] declined to hear the case, albeit over the dissent of Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], who stated: \"I believe that in the circumstances he raises a significant question as to whether his execution would constitute 'cruel and unusual punishment.'\"\n\n==1983 Chino Hills Murders==\n[[Kevin Cooper (prisoner)|Kevin Cooper]] was convicted of the 1983 murder of a family in the Chino Hills.

Donald Hughes (University of Denver), Vamik Volkan (University of Virginia Medical School), Henry Lawton (Author of ''The Psychohistorians Handbook'', 1988), Jacques Szaluta (US Merchant Marine Academy) and others.</ref> It examines the \"why\" of history, especially the difference between stated intention and actual behavior. Psychobiography, childhood, group dynamics, mechanisms of psychic defense, dreams, and creativity are primary areas of research. It works to combine the insights of psychology, especially [[psychoanalysis]], with the research methodology of the [[social sciences]] and humanities to understand the emotional origin of the behavior of individuals, groups and nations, past and present. Work in the field has been done in the areas of childhood, creativity, dreams, [[family|family dynamics]], overcoming adversity, personality, political and presidential psychobiography. There are major psychohistorical studies of studies of [[anthropology]], art, [[ethnology]], history, politics and political science, and much else. \n\n==Description==\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 035.jpg|thumb|right|Rembrandt's painting of the sacrifice of Isaac ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]].22).

That is the last person listed, and that sentence itself has been tagged as needing a citation for six and a half years. This smacks of the kind of stuff encountered at the \"Tanka prose\" article, where the inventor of the concept had in a number of self-published essays listed himself as the latest in a long line of \"practitioners\" stretching back more than a thousand years and Wikipedia mirrored this false characterization. Sources need to be added that specifically, and reliably, discuss the \"history\" of the \"discipline\" of \"psychohistory\" in these exact terms as beginning with Freud and Reich, Fromm, Adorno, Erikson and then deMause. ~Hijiri88, August 2016. -->\n[[Sigmund Freud]]'s well known work, ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929), included an analysis of history based on his theory of psychoanalysis. Yet, Freud's text is in no way a psycho-historical work since the focus of the study is to examine and explain the level of individual psyche which may arise from the influence of the structures of civilization. It is in fact the opposite of psycho-history in that it claims that the unconscious and the individual psyche are both structural effects of different social forces, i.e., civilization. In 1913, [[Freud | Sigmund Freud]] published ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'', which attempts to draw a parallel between the psychical experience of neurotics and primitive peoples through contemporaneous sociology, anthropology, and psychoanalytic theory. \n\n[[Wilhelm Reich]] combined his psychoanalytic and political theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' in 1933.\n\nThe psychologist and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]] wrote about the psychological motivation behind political ideology, starting with ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' in 1941.\n\nAnother member of the Frankfurt school, [[Theodor Adorno]], published ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', in 1950, which was an influential sociological book which could be taken as something of a proto-psychohistorical book.\n\nIts first academic use appeared in [[Erik Erikson]]'s book ''Young Man Luther'' (1958), where the author called for a discipline of \"psycho-history\" to examine the impact of human character on history.\n\n[[Lloyd deMause]] developed a formal psychohistorical approach from 1974 onwards, and continues to be an influential theorist in this field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Independence as a discipline===\n\nPsychohistorians have argued that psychohistory is a separate field of scholarly inquiry with its own particular methods, objectives and theories, which set it apart from conventional historical analysis and anthropology. Some historians, social scientists and anthropologists have, however, argued that their disciplines already describe psychological motivation and that psychohistory is not, therefore, a separate subject.

Due to these changes in the course of history, different ''psychoclasses'' (or ''psychogenic modes'') emerged. A psychoclass is a type of mentality that results from, and is associated with, a particular childrearing style, and in its turn influences the method of childrearing of the next generations. According to psychohistory theory, regardless of the changes in the environment, it is only when changes in childhood occur and new psychoclasses evolve that societies begin to progress.\n\nThe major psychogenic modes described by deMause are:<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026212029/http://www.geocities.com/kidhistory/modesw.htm ''The Evolution of Childrearing Modes'']</ref><ref name=\"PsFoundations\">{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= January 1982  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=0-940508-01-X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=61 & 132\u2013146}}{{cite web |url=http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703011204/http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |archivedate=2006-07-03 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

Routine infanticide was replaced by joining in the group fantasy of the sacrifice of Christ, who was sent by his father to be killed for the sins of others.<ref name=\"PsFoundations\" /> Routine pederasty of boys continued in monasteries and elsewhere, and the rape of girls was commonplace.<ref name=\"EMOL\" />\n| valign=\"top\" | Infanticide replaced by abandonment.

Early beating, shorter swaddling, mourning for deceased children, a precursor to [[empathy]].\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | Intrusive\n| valign=\"top\" | During the 16th century, particularly in England, parents shifted from trying to stop children's growth to trying to control them and make them obedient. Parents were prepared to give them attention as long as they controlled their minds, their insides, their anger and the lives they led.<ref name=\"PsFoundations\" />\n| valign=\"top\" | The intrusive parent began to unswaddle the infant. Early toilet training, [[Psychological repression|repression]] of child's sexuality. [[Hell]] threats turned into the Puritan child so familiar from early modern childrearing literature. On the other hand, the end of swaddling and wet-nursing made possible the explosive modern takeoff in scientific advance.\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | Socializing\n| valign=\"top\" | Beginning in the 18th century, mothers began to enjoy child care, and fathers began to participate in younger children's development.<ref name=\"PsFoundations\" /> The aim remained instilling parental goals rather than encouraging individuation. [[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] and [[spanking]] were used to make children obedient.

As parental injections continued to diminish, the rearing of the child became less a process of conquering its will than of training it. The socializing psychoclass built the modern world.<ref name=\"PsFoundations\" />\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | Helping\n| valign=\"top\" | Beginning in the mid-20th century, some parents adopted the role of helping children reach their own goals in life, rather than \"[[socialize]]\" them into fulfilling parental wishes.

It doesn't apply either to the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] world, where there was a wide variation in childrearing practices. It is notable that the arrival of the ''Ambivalent'' mode of child-rearing preceded the start of the [[Renaissance]] (mid 14th century) by only one or two generations, and the arrival of the ''Socializing'' mode coincided with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which began in the late 18th century.\n\nEarlier forms of childrearing coexist with later modes, even in the most advanced countries.

Presently the Western socializing mode of childrearing is considered much less abusive in the field, though this mode is not yet entirely free of abuse. In the opening paragraph of his seminal essay \"The Evolution of Childhood\" (first article in ''The History of Childhood''), DeMause states:\n\n<blockquote>The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken.  The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of childcare, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorized and sexually abused.</blockquote>\n\nThere is notwithstanding an optimistic trait in the field. In a world of \"helping mode\" parents, deMause believes, violence of any other sort will disappear as well, along with [[magical thinking]], mental disorders, wars and other inhumanities of man against man. Although, the criticism has been made that this itself is a form of magical thinking.<ref>[http://primal-page.com/ps4.htm The evolution of psyche and society] \u2013 deMause's explanatory chapter of ''The Emotional Life of Nations'' (op. cit.).</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nThere are no departments dedicated to \"psychohistory\" in any institution of higher learning, although some history departments have run courses in it.

Sources need to be added that specifically, and reliably, discuss the \"history\" of the \"discipline\" of \"psychohistory\" in these exact terms as beginning with Freud and Reich, Fromm, Adorno, Erikson and then deMause. ~Hijiri88, August 2016. -->\n[[Sigmund Freud]]'s well known work, ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929), included an analysis of history based on his theory of psychoanalysis. Yet, Freud's text is in no way a psycho-historical work since the focus of the study is to examine and explain the level of individual psyche which may arise from the influence of the structures of civilization. It is in fact the opposite of psycho-history in that it claims that the unconscious and the individual psyche are both structural effects of different social forces, i.e., civilization. In 1913, [[Freud | Sigmund Freud]] published ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'', which attempts to draw a parallel between the psychical experience of neurotics and primitive peoples through contemporaneous sociology, anthropology, and psychoanalytic theory. \n\n[[Wilhelm Reich]] combined his psychoanalytic and political theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' in 1933.\n\nThe psychologist and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]] wrote about the psychological motivation behind political ideology, starting with ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' in 1941.\n\nAnother member of the Frankfurt school, [[Theodor Adorno]], published ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', in 1950, which was an influential sociological book which could be taken as something of a proto-psychohistorical book.\n\nIts first academic use appeared in [[Erik Erikson]]'s book ''Young Man Luther'' (1958), where the author called for a discipline of \"psycho-history\" to examine the impact of human character on history.\n\n[[Lloyd deMause]] developed a formal psychohistorical approach from 1974 onwards, and continues to be an influential theorist in this field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Independence as a discipline===\n\nPsychohistorians have argued that psychohistory is a separate field of scholarly inquiry with its own particular methods, objectives and theories, which set it apart from conventional historical analysis and anthropology. Some historians, social scientists and anthropologists have, however, argued that their disciplines already describe psychological motivation and that psychohistory is not, therefore, a separate subject. Others regard it as an undisciplined field of study, due to its emphasis given to speculation on the psychological motivations of people in history. Doubt has also been cast on the viability of the application of post-mortem psychoanalysis by Freud's followers.<ref>[http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/shrinking-history/] Review of ''Shrinking History on Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory'' - Reviewed in 1980 by Cosma Shalizi\n:'''Note:''' The book under review criticizes the Freudian approach to psychohistory.

Due to these changes in the course of history, different ''psychoclasses'' (or ''psychogenic modes'') emerged. A psychoclass is a type of mentality that results from, and is associated with, a particular childrearing style, and in its turn influences the method of childrearing of the next generations. According to psychohistory theory, regardless of the changes in the environment, it is only when changes in childhood occur and new psychoclasses evolve that societies begin to progress.\n\nThe major psychogenic modes described by deMause are:<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026212029/http://www.geocities.com/kidhistory/modesw.htm ''The Evolution of Childrearing Modes'']</ref><ref name=\"PsFoundations\">{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= January 1982  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=0-940508-01-X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=61 & 132\u2013146}}{{cite web |url=http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703011204/http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm |archivedate=2006-07-03 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

Routine infanticide was replaced by joining in the group fantasy of the sacrifice of Christ, who was sent by his father to be killed for the sins of others.<ref name=\"PsFoundations\" /> Routine pederasty of boys continued in monasteries and elsewhere, and the rape of girls was commonplace.<ref name=\"EMOL\" />\n| valign=\"top\" | Infanticide replaced by abandonment.

Early beating, shorter swaddling, mourning for deceased children, a precursor to [[empathy]].\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | Intrusive\n| valign=\"top\" | During the 16th century, particularly in England, parents shifted from trying to stop children's growth to trying to control them and make them obedient. Parents were prepared to give them attention as long as they controlled their minds, their insides, their anger and the lives they led.<ref name=\"PsFoundations\" />\n| valign=\"top\" | The intrusive parent began to unswaddle the infant. Early toilet training, [[Psychological repression|repression]] of child's sexuality. [[Hell]] threats turned into the Puritan child so familiar from early modern childrearing literature. On the other hand, the end of swaddling and wet-nursing made possible the explosive modern takeoff in scientific advance.\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | Socializing\n| valign=\"top\" | Beginning in the 18th century, mothers began to enjoy child care, and fathers began to participate in younger children's development.<ref name=\"PsFoundations\" /> The aim remained instilling parental goals rather than encouraging individuation. [[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] and [[spanking]] were used to make children obedient.

As parental injections continued to diminish, the rearing of the child became less a process of conquering its will than of training it. The socializing psychoclass built the modern world.<ref name=\"PsFoundations\" />\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | Helping\n| valign=\"top\" | Beginning in the mid-20th century, some parents adopted the role of helping children reach their own goals in life, rather than \"[[socialize]]\" them into fulfilling parental wishes. Less manipulation, more unconditional love.

A black-and-white version of the chart appears in ''Foundations of Psychohistory''.<ref name=\"PsFoundations\" /><!-- p. 61 -->\n<br>\n[[File:Image-Evolution of psychogenic modes.png|centre]]\n\nThe Y-Axis on the above chart serves as an indicator of the new stage and not a measurement of the stage's size or relation to the x-axis.\n\nThe timeline doesn't apply to [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. It doesn't apply either to the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] world, where there was a wide variation in childrearing practices. It is notable that the arrival of the ''Ambivalent'' mode of child-rearing preceded the start of the [[Renaissance]] (mid 14th century) by only one or two generations, and the arrival of the ''Socializing'' mode coincided with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which began in the late 18th century.\n\nEarlier forms of childrearing coexist with later modes, even in the most advanced countries.

Presently the Western socializing mode of childrearing is considered much less abusive in the field, though this mode is not yet entirely free of abuse. In the opening paragraph of his seminal essay \"The Evolution of Childhood\" (first article in ''The History of Childhood''), DeMause states:\n\n<blockquote>The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken.  The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of childcare, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorized and sexually abused.</blockquote>\n\nThere is notwithstanding an optimistic trait in the field. In a world of \"helping mode\" parents, deMause believes, violence of any other sort will disappear as well, along with [[magical thinking]], mental disorders, wars and other inhumanities of man against man. Although, the criticism has been made that this itself is a form of magical thinking.<ref>[http://primal-page.com/ps4.htm The evolution of psyche and society] \u2013 deMause's explanatory chapter of ''The Emotional Life of Nations'' (op. cit.).</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nThere are no departments dedicated to \"psychohistory\" in any institution of higher learning, although some history departments have run courses in it.
