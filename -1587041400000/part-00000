Singers need to use English since the companies want to occupy markets in the other parts of Asia, which enables them to open the Western market in the end. Most of the K-pop singers learn English because it is a common language in the world of music, but some singers also learn other foreign languages such as Japanese to approach the Japanese market.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\"/> Similarly, increasing numbers of K-pop bands use English names rather than Korean ones. This allows songs and artists to be marketed to a wider audience around the world.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" />\n\n<!--I think the source for this is describing J-pop--><!--East Asia has many different languages, which makes recording in English a working choice to make up the language gap that disturbs the international music communication. Nonetheless, probably because singers do not want to take the risk of presenting a wrong identity, this option is certainly not used most commonly. Musicians who understand both cultures and are fluent English speakers such as [[Tata Young]] and [[Utada Hikaru]] have the most success while using this method to have international music markets. The reason why the frequency of the strategy is comparatively low is because not many East Asian artists have fluent English skills, which people often make comments about a singer's English fluency. More importantly, the East Asian music wave is not simply about the sounds and products of music. Flows of language and identity come with the East Asian wave, and more of these flows will enable researchers to have a better understanding of the international flow in East Asian music.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Phil|date=January 2013|title=English and identity in East Asian popular music|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/popular-music/article/english-and-identity-in-east-asian-popular-music/89BC456C9A2FEA66D58DC36FD613FB3B|journal=Popular Music|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=23\u201333|doi=10.1017/S0261143012000529|issn=0261-1430}}</ref>\n-->\nHowever, the use of English has not guaranteed the popularity of K-pop in the North American market. For some commentators, the reason for this is because the genre can be seen as a distilled version of Western music, making it difficult for K-pop to find acceptance in these markets.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" /> Furthermore, Western audiences tend to place emphasis on authenticity and individual expression in music, which the idol system can be seen as suppressing.<ref name=\"Chosun Ilbo\"/> \nAccording to Elaine W. Chun's research, even though [[hybridity]] appears more and more often in K-pop, and sometimes may even make fans admire K-pop stars more because it is fresh, new and interesting, it is hard to change those who believe in a perfect ideal for pure linguistic. This means that the original form of language is still difficult to alter.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chun|first=Elaine W.|date=February 2017|title=How to drop a name: Hybridity, purity, and the K-pop fan|journal=Language in Society|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=57\u201376|doi=10.1017/S0047404516000828|issn=0047-4045}}</ref>\n\nArtist names, song titles, and lyrics have exhibited a significant growth in the usage of English words. No singers in the top fifty charts in 1990 had English in their names: people who worked in the Korean music industry viewed using Korean names as standard. In 1995, most popular singers such as [[Kim Gun-mo]], Park Mi-kyung, [[Park Jin-young]], [[Lee Seung-chul]], and [[Byun Jin-sub]] still used Korean names, but fourteen of the singers and groups in the top fifty used English names, including [[DJ DOC]], [[015B]], Piano, and [[Solid (band)|Solid]]. After the 1997 financial crisis, the government stopped censoring English lyrics and Korea started to have a boom in English. Since the late 1990s, English usage in singers' names, song titles, and lyrics has grown quickly. Seventeen singers in the top fifty charts used English names in 2000, and thirty-one did so in 2005. In 2010, forty-one  singers used English names among the top fifty songs, but usually three or four singers and groups had more than one or two songs on the chart simultaneously. Korean names (e.g. [[Baek Ji-young]], [[Seo In-young]], and [[Huh Gak]]) are seen less frequently, and many K-pop singers have English names (e.g. [[IU (singer)|IU]], [[Sistar]], [[T-ara]], [[GD & TOP]], [[Beast (South Korean band)|Beast]], and [[After School (band)|After School]]). Notably, until the early 1990s, musicians with English names would [[transliterate]] them into [[hangul]], but now singers would use English names written with the [[Latin script|roman alphabet]].<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\"/> In 1995, the percentage of song titles using English in the top 50 charts was 8%. This fluctuated between 30% in 2000, 18% in 2005, and 44% in 2010. An example of a Korean song with a large proportion of English lyrics is [[Kara (South Korean band)|Kara]]'s \"[[Jumping (Kara song)|Jumping]],\" which was released at the same time in both Korea and Japan to much success.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" />\n\n====Criticism of hybrid identity====\nThere have been critical responses in South Korea regarding the identity of the genre since its ascendance. Some of the notable music critics in the region have criticized K-pop as \"a industrial label mainly designed to promote the national brand in the global market from the beginning\" and argued that it was \"not formed spontaneously as a pop culture but created with the orchestrated plan led by the government with commercial considerations\" although in fact \"the genre has practically no ties with traditional Korean identity\". There's also a perspective that the name of the genre was derived from [[J-pop]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/culture_general/29888.html|title=[\ub808\ub4dc \uae30\ud68d]\ucf00\uc774\ud31d, \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud574|website=h21.hani.co.kr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ch.yes24.com/Article/View/24536|title=\uac00\uc694, \ucf00\uc774\ud31d \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub108\uba38|last=Shin|first=Hyun-joon}}</ref>\n\nK-Pop has at times faced criticisms from journalists who perceive the music to be formulaic and unoriginal.<ref name=\"fast music2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2012/02/123_100092.html|title=K-pop grows on disposable 'fast music'|date=April 12, 2011|work=The Korea Times|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/725161/kpop-feature/|title=Hallyu, K-pop!

These songs were called ''changga'' in Korean, and they were typically based on a popular Western melody sung with Korean lyrics. For example, the song \"Oh My Darling, Clementine\" became known as \"Simcheongga.\"<ref group=\"note\">Not to be confused with the [[pansori]] story [[Simcheongga|of the same name]].</ref> During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1910\u20131945) the popularity of ''changga'' songs rose as Koreans expressed their feelings against Japanese oppression through music. One of the most popular songs was \"Huimangga\" (\ud76c\ub9dd\uac00, The Song of Hope). The Japanese confiscated the existing ''changga'' collections and published lyrics books of their own.<ref name=\"newforce47-492\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 47\u201379</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe first known Korean pop album was \"Yi Pungjin Sewol\" (This Tumultuous Time), by Park Chae-seon and Lee Ryu-saek in 1925, which contained popular songs translated from Japanese. The first pop song written by a Korean composer is thought to be \"Nakhwayusu\" (\ub099\ud654\uc720\uc218, Fallen Blossoms on Running Water) sung by Lee Jeong-suk in 1929.<ref name=\"newforce47-492\" /> In the mid-1920s, Japanese composer [[Masao Koga]] mixed traditional Korean music with Gospel music that American Evangelists introduced in the 1870s. This type of music became known as [[Enka]] in Japan, and later in Korea developed into [[Trot (music)|Trot]] ({{lang-ko|\"\ud2b8\ub85c\ud2b8\"}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jpnews.kr/sub_read.html?uid=8082&section=sc1&section2=%C0%CE%B9%B0|title=JPNews \uc77c\ubcf8\uc774 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4! \uc77c\ubcf8\ub274\uc2a4\ud3ec\ud138!|publisher=Jpnews.kr|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=\uace0\uac00\ub9c8\uc0ac\uc624|encyclopedia=Doosan Encyclopedia|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=200000000&docId=1164528&mobile&categoryId=200001546|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1940s\u20131960s: Arrival of Western culture===\n[[File:Marilyn Monroe.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Marilyn Monroe poses as a crowd of soldiers photograph her|[[Marilyn Monroe]] entertaining American soldiers in Korea in 1954]]\nAfter the [[Korean Peninsula]] was partitioned into North and South following its liberation in 1945 from [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], [[Western culture]] was introduced into South Korea on a small scale, with a few Western-styled bars and clubs playing Western music. After the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353) U.S. troops remained in South Korea, causing American and world culture to spread in South Korea and Western music to gradually become more accepted.

Since South Korea was impoverished after the Korean War, skilled Korean singers regarded performing for the U.S. troops as a good means to earn money. Many singers sang for the American troops, usually in dedicated clubs, the number of which rose to 264. They performed various genres like country music, blues, jazz and rock & roll. The [[Economy of South Korea|South Korean economy]] started blooming and popular music followed the trend, spread by the first commercial radio stations. [[Cinema of Korea|Korean cinema]] also began to develop and Korean musicians began performing to wider audiences.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nWhen [[Beatlemania]] reached the shores of Korea the first local rock bands appeared, the first of which is said to be [[Add 4|Add4]], a band founded in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychemusic.org/Add4.html|title=ADD4 & KOREAN PSYCH-ROCK & FOLK-POP reissues : ADD 4|publisher=psychemusic.org|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref> The first talent contest for rock bands in Seoul was organized in 1968.\n\nSome Korean singers gained international popularity. In 1959, [[the Kim Sisters]] went to Las Vegas and became the first Korean artist to release an album in the U.S. pop market. Their cover of \"Charlie Brown\" reached No.7 on the Billboard Single Chart. The Kim Sisters also appeared on TV programs and radio programs and held tours in the U.S. and Europe.

In the mid-1960s, due to the influence of the legendary British group [[The Beatles]], there was a rise of \"group sound\" in South Korea, for example, Add4 and the {{ill|Key Boys|ko|\ud0a4\ubcf4\uc774\uc2a4}}.&nbsp; Add4, Korea's first rock group, was formed by Shin Joong-hyun in 1962 and produced Korea's first rock song, \"The Woman in the Rain\", which is a form of light rock reminiscent of the early Beatles. Shin Joong-hyun was so instrumental in the development of Korean rock music that he is regarded as the \"godfather of Korean rock\" in South Korea.\n\nDuring this period, with the rise of Western pop music and Korean rock music, trot was no longer predominant in South Korea. However, trot singers like [[Lee Mi-ja]] still managed to attract a certain level of popularity, with famous songs like \"Camellia Lady\" ({{lang-ko|\"\ub3d9\ubc31 \uc544\uac00\uc528\"}}).\n\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, Western pop music, Korean rock music, and trot co-existed in South Korea.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n=== Late 1960s and 1970s: Hippie and folk influences ===\nAt the end of the 1960s Korean pop music underwent another transformation. More and more musicians were university students and graduates who were heavily influenced by American culture and lifestyle (including the [[hippie]] movement of the 1960s) and made lighthearted music unlike their predecessors, who were influenced by war and Japanese oppression.<ref name=\"encykorea3\"/> The younger generation opposed the [[Vietnam War]] as much as American hippies did, which resulted in the Korean government banning songs with more liberal lyrics. In spite of this, folk-influenced pop remained popular among the youth, and local television channel [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] organised a music contest for university students in 1977. This was the foundation of several modern music festivals.<ref name=\"newforce54-572\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 54\u201357</ref> The younger generation born after the 1950s had grown up under the U.S. influence and preferred the U.S. lifestyle, giving rise to the \"youth culture\" which was expressed through long hair, jeans, acoustic guitars and folk music. &nbsp;The folk music of that time is made up of melodies sung plainly, with the singing accompanied by a guitar or two. A majority of the folk music at that time was initiated by elite university students and those who graduated from prestigious schools. Like the activists of the U.S. student movement, they turned to folk music as the preferred music of politicized youth, who staged demonstrations against the authoritarian government. &nbsp;In turn, the government banned folk music due to its association with the students' anti-government movements. In the 1970s, the [[Park Chung-hee]] government banned American pop music and Korean rock music for their association with sex and drugs. Shin Joong-hyun, the \"godfather of Korean rock music\", was imprisoned in 1975 due to a marijuana scandal. &nbsp;In order to bolster its anti-Japanese credentials, the government also banned trot songs because of its \"Japaneseness\" given the influence of Japanese enka songs on trot. However, President Park actually embraced trot.\n\nOne of the leading figures of the era was [[Han Dae-soo]], who was raised in the United States and influenced by [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]] and [[John Lennon]]. Han's song \"Mul jom juso\" (\ubb3c \uc880 \uc8fc\uc18c, Give Me Water) became iconic among young people in Korea. His daring performances and unique singing style often shocked the public and later he was banned from performing in Korea. Han moved to [[New York City]] and pursued his musical career there, only returning to his home country in the 1990s.<ref name=\"newforce54-572\" /> Other notable singers of the period include [[Song Chang-sik]], [[Cho Young-nam]] and [[Yang Hee-eun]].<ref name=\":11\"/>{{failed verification|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the 1970s, [[DJ]]s also started to become popular.<ref name=\"encykorea3\" />\n\n===1980s: The era of ballads===\n{{Main|Korean ballad}}\nThe 1980s saw the rise of [[Pop ballad|ballad]] singers after {{ill|Lee Gwang-jo|ko|\uc774\uad11\uc870 (\uac00\uc218)}}'s 1985 album \"You\u2019re Too Far Away to Get Close to\" (\uac00\uae4c\uc774 \ud558\uae30\uc5d4 \ub108\ubb34 \uba3c \ub2f9\uc2e0, Gakkai Hagien Neomu Meon Dangsin) sold more than 300,000 copies. Other popular ballad singers included [[Lee Moon-se]] (\uc774\ubb38\uc138) and [[Byun Jin-sub]] (\ubcc0\uc9c4\uc12d), nicknamed the \"Prince of Ballads\". One of the most sought-after ballad composers of the era was [[Lee Young-hoon (composer)|Lee Young-hoon]] (\uc774\uc601\ud6c8), whose songs were compiled into a modern musical in 2011 titled ''Gwanghwamun Yeonga'' (\uad11\ud654\ubb38 \uc5f0\uac00, Gwanghwamun's Song).<ref name=\"newforce60-612\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nThe Asia Music Forum was launched in 1980, with representatives from five different Asian countries competing in the event. Korean singer [[Cho Yong-pil]] won first place and went on to have a successful career, performing in Hong Kong and Japan. His first album ''Chang bakkui yeoja'' (\ucc3d \ubc16\uc758 \uc5ec\uc790, Woman outside the window) was a hit and he became the first Korean singer to take to the stage at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York. Cho's musical repertoire included rock, dance, trot and folk-pop.<ref name=\"newforce60-612\" /> Despite his early association with rock music as an electric guitarist in a rock band, Cho Yong-pil's initial popularity came from his trot songs which were popular in both South Korea and Japan. For example, in 1976, his trot song, \u201cPlease Return to Pusan Port\u201d was a great hit.&nbsp;Despite the temporary setback due to his involvement in a marijuana incident in 1977, he managed to bounce back with the song \"The Woman Outside the Window\" which reached a record-breaking sales of 1 million in 1980.&nbsp; In 1988, he sang \"Seoul Seoul Seoul\" in three languages (Korean, English and Japanese) to celebrate the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n===1990s: Development of modern K-pop===\n[[File:DJ DOC @ Cyworld Dream Music Festival \uc2f8\uc774\uc6d4\ub4dc \ub4dc\ub9bc \ubba4\uc9c1 \ud398\uc2a4\ud2f0\ubc8c 36.jpg|thumb|alt=Three men performing on stage with upraised arms, wearing matching neon-orange shorts and polo shirts|[[DJ DOC]], one of the popular hip hop trios of the 1990s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_artist_detail.htm?No=10198|title=DJ DOC|publisher=KBS World|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>]]\nIn the 1990s, Korean pop musicians incorporated partially [[Europop]] and mostly [[American popular music]] styles such as [[hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], and [[electronic dance]] in their music.<ref name=\"Hartong 20062\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/musicaltermsworl0000hart|url-access=registration|title=Musical terms worldwide: a companion for the musical explorer|last=Hartong|first=Jan Laurens|publisher=Semar Publishers|year=2006|isbn=978-88-7778-090-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/musicaltermsworl0000hart/page/15 15]|quote=Since the 1990s, popular genres like rap, rock and techno house have been incorporated into Korean popular music... which often emulates American models.}}</ref> In 1992 the emergence of [[Seo Taiji & Boys]] marked a revolutionary moment in the history of K-pop.

H.O.T. disbanded in 2001, while other groups like Sechs Kies, S.E.S., Fin.K.L, Shinhwa, and  g.o.d became inactive by 2005. Solo singers like [[BoA]] and [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]] grew in success. However, the success of boy band [[TVXQ]] after its debut in 2003 marked the resurgence of idol groups to Korean entertainment and the growth of K-pop as part of ''Hallyu''. The birth of second-generation K-pop was followed with the successful debuts of [[SS501]] (2005), [[Super Junior]] (2005), [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]] (2006), [[Wonder Girls]] (2007), [[Girls' Generation]] (2007), [[Kara (South Korean band)|Kara]] (2007), [[Shinee]] (2008), [[2NE1]] (2009), [[4Minute]] (2009), [[T-ara]] (2009), [[f(x) (band)|f(x)]] (2009), and [[After School (band)|After School]] (2009).\n\nDuring the beginning of the 21st century, K-pop idols began receiving success elsewhere in Asia: in 2002, Baby Vox's single \"Coincidence\" became popular in many Asian countries after it was released and promoted during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in South Korea.

Moreover, agencies were able to terminate a trainee contract at any time for any reason.

Flash drives that used to cost upwards of US$50, can now be purchased for under $10, making them more affordable and easier to send into North Korea.<ref name=\":06\" /> The content on these USB drives and SD cards are then viewed by plugging the device into a [[notel]], a small portable media player.<ref name=\":03\" /> Although this practice had originally begun with banned books and simple radios, there is now an even higher demand for South Korean media following the cultural phenomena of [[hallyu]], or the Korean Wave.\n\nThose near the border who choose to stay away from the banned media from the flash drives often cannot escape it. Ever since the 1950s, both countries have blasted their own propaganda across the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]]: North Korea broadcasting anti-south propaganda and South Korea broadcasting Korean and world news as well as K-pop.<ref name=\":14\" /> In 2004, both countries agreed to end the broadcasts. After an incident in 2015, South Korea resumed broadcasting anti-North news for four days, as well as in 2016, after North Korea tested its hydrogen bomb and has been broadcasting since. In April 2018, in preparation and out of respect for the meeting between North leader Kim Jong Un and South leader, Moon Jae In, the South Korean speakers ceased their broadcasts. These 11 loudspeakers can be heard up to six miles into North Korean territory. This enables the broadcasts to influence possible defectors staying near the border as well as create bothersome propaganda that North Korean soldiers cannot escape.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThe dissemination of K-pop and Korean media has been crucial in presenting the realities of North Korea to its citizens. By detailing the basic conditions of life in South Korea and introducing foreign ideologies, Korean media has aroused civil unrest amongst both citizens and elites concerning the disparities between living conditions inside and outside North Korea.<ref name=\":03\" /> A defector explains that, when he escaped in 2012, only the wealthy families were the ones consuming the South Korean media because the costs of the flash drives and technology to use them were so high. Because most youth lacked the resources to afford the drives, most consumers of South Korean media before 2012 were middle-aged elite who favored K-dramas over K-pop due to their more traditional behavior.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2015/06/do-north-koreans-like-k-pop/|title=Do North Koreans like K-pop? {{!}} NK News - North Korea News|last=Lee|first=Je Son|date=June 17, 2015|work=NK News - North Korea News|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}</ref> The current high demand for Korean media continues to rise as now approximately 70% of North Koreans consume foreign media in their homes,<ref name=\":03\" /> which accounts for the higher youth following of South Korean media today. One researcher at the [[Korea Institute for National Unification]] claims to have never met a single defector who had not seen or listened to foreign media before entering South Korea. Yet experts remain wary that a cultural uprising will occur because of the media.

This changed in the early 2000s as the cultural dispersion of ''Hallyu'' has contributed to the reconstruction of South Korea's image among the Taiwanese. This change was in part prompted by the South Korean government, who wished to encourage goodwill between the two countries after the break of diplomacy.

This allows songs and artists to be marketed to a wider audience around the world.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" />\n\n<!--I think the source for this is describing J-pop--><!--East Asia has many different languages, which makes recording in English a working choice to make up the language gap that disturbs the international music communication. Nonetheless, probably because singers do not want to take the risk of presenting a wrong identity, this option is certainly not used most commonly. Musicians who understand both cultures and are fluent English speakers such as [[Tata Young]] and [[Utada Hikaru]] have the most success while using this method to have international music markets. The reason why the frequency of the strategy is comparatively low is because not many East Asian artists have fluent English skills, which people often make comments about a singer's English fluency. More importantly, the East Asian music wave is not simply about the sounds and products of music. Flows of language and identity come with the East Asian wave, and more of these flows will enable researchers to have a better understanding of the international flow in East Asian music.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Phil|date=January 2013|title=English and identity in East Asian popular music|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/popular-music/article/english-and-identity-in-east-asian-popular-music/89BC456C9A2FEA66D58DC36FD613FB3B|journal=Popular Music|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=23\u201333|doi=10.1017/S0261143012000529|issn=0261-1430}}</ref>\n-->\nHowever, the use of English has not guaranteed the popularity of K-pop in the North American market. For some commentators, the reason for this is because the genre can be seen as a distilled version of Western music, making it difficult for K-pop to find acceptance in these markets.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" /> Furthermore, Western audiences tend to place emphasis on authenticity and individual expression in music, which the idol system can be seen as suppressing.<ref name=\"Chosun Ilbo\"/> \nAccording to Elaine W. Chun's research, even though [[hybridity]] appears more and more often in K-pop, and sometimes may even make fans admire K-pop stars more because it is fresh, new and interesting, it is hard to change those who believe in a perfect ideal for pure linguistic. This means that the original form of language is still difficult to alter.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chun|first=Elaine W.|date=February 2017|title=How to drop a name: Hybridity, purity, and the K-pop fan|journal=Language in Society|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=57\u201376|doi=10.1017/S0047404516000828|issn=0047-4045}}</ref>\n\nArtist names, song titles, and lyrics have exhibited a significant growth in the usage of English words. No singers in the top fifty charts in 1990 had English in their names: people who worked in the Korean music industry viewed using Korean names as standard. In 1995, most popular singers such as [[Kim Gun-mo]], Park Mi-kyung, [[Park Jin-young]], [[Lee Seung-chul]], and [[Byun Jin-sub]] still used Korean names, but fourteen of the singers and groups in the top fifty used English names, including [[DJ DOC]], [[015B]], Piano, and [[Solid (band)|Solid]]. After the 1997 financial crisis, the government stopped censoring English lyrics and Korea started to have a boom in English. Since the late 1990s, English usage in singers' names, song titles, and lyrics has grown quickly. Seventeen singers in the top fifty charts used English names in 2000, and thirty-one did so in 2005. In 2010, forty-one  singers used English names among the top fifty songs, but usually three or four singers and groups had more than one or two songs on the chart simultaneously. Korean names (e.g. [[Baek Ji-young]], [[Seo In-young]], and [[Huh Gak]]) are seen less frequently, and many K-pop singers have English names (e.g. [[IU (singer)|IU]], [[Sistar]], [[T-ara]], [[GD & TOP]], [[Beast (South Korean band)|Beast]], and [[After School (band)|After School]]). Notably, until the early 1990s, musicians with English names would [[transliterate]] them into [[hangul]], but now singers would use English names written with the [[Latin script|roman alphabet]].<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\"/> In 1995, the percentage of song titles using English in the top 50 charts was 8%. This fluctuated between 30% in 2000, 18% in 2005, and 44% in 2010. An example of a Korean song with a large proportion of English lyrics is [[Kara (South Korean band)|Kara]]'s \"[[Jumping (Kara song)|Jumping]],\" which was released at the same time in both Korea and Japan to much success.<ref name=\"Jin 113\u20131312\" />\n\n====Criticism of hybrid identity====\nThere have been critical responses in South Korea regarding the identity of the genre since its ascendance. Some of the notable music critics in the region have criticized K-pop as \"a industrial label mainly designed to promote the national brand in the global market from the beginning\" and argued that it was \"not formed spontaneously as a pop culture but created with the orchestrated plan led by the government with commercial considerations\" although in fact \"the genre has practically no ties with traditional Korean identity\". There's also a perspective that the name of the genre was derived from [[J-pop]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/culture_general/29888.html|title=[\ub808\ub4dc \uae30\ud68d]\ucf00\uc774\ud31d, \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud574|website=h21.hani.co.kr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ch.yes24.com/Article/View/24536|title=\uac00\uc694, \ucf00\uc774\ud31d \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub108\uba38|last=Shin|first=Hyun-joon}}</ref>\n\nK-Pop has at times faced criticisms from journalists who perceive the music to be formulaic and unoriginal.<ref name=\"fast music2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2012/02/123_100092.html|title=K-pop grows on disposable 'fast music'|date=April 12, 2011|work=The Korea Times|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/725161/kpop-feature/|title=Hallyu, K-pop!

These songs were called ''changga'' in Korean, and they were typically based on a popular Western melody sung with Korean lyrics. For example, the song \"Oh My Darling, Clementine\" became known as \"Simcheongga.\"<ref group=\"note\">Not to be confused with the [[pansori]] story [[Simcheongga|of the same name]].</ref> During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1910\u20131945) the popularity of ''changga'' songs rose as Koreans expressed their feelings against Japanese oppression through music. One of the most popular songs was \"Huimangga\" (\ud76c\ub9dd\uac00, The Song of Hope). The Japanese confiscated the existing ''changga'' collections and published lyrics books of their own.<ref name=\"newforce47-492\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 47\u201379</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe first known Korean pop album was \"Yi Pungjin Sewol\" (This Tumultuous Time), by Park Chae-seon and Lee Ryu-saek in 1925, which contained popular songs translated from Japanese. The first pop song written by a Korean composer is thought to be \"Nakhwayusu\" (\ub099\ud654\uc720\uc218, Fallen Blossoms on Running Water) sung by Lee Jeong-suk in 1929.<ref name=\"newforce47-492\" /> In the mid-1920s, Japanese composer [[Masao Koga]] mixed traditional Korean music with Gospel music that American Evangelists introduced in the 1870s. This type of music became known as [[Enka]] in Japan, and later in Korea developed into [[Trot (music)|Trot]] ({{lang-ko|\"\ud2b8\ub85c\ud2b8\"}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jpnews.kr/sub_read.html?uid=8082&section=sc1&section2=%C0%CE%B9%B0|title=JPNews \uc77c\ubcf8\uc774 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4! \uc77c\ubcf8\ub274\uc2a4\ud3ec\ud138!|publisher=Jpnews.kr|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=\uace0\uac00\ub9c8\uc0ac\uc624|encyclopedia=Doosan Encyclopedia|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=200000000&docId=1164528&mobile&categoryId=200001546|accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1940s\u20131960s: Arrival of Western culture===\n[[File:Marilyn Monroe.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Marilyn Monroe poses as a crowd of soldiers photograph her|[[Marilyn Monroe]] entertaining American soldiers in Korea in 1954]]\nAfter the [[Korean Peninsula]] was partitioned into North and South following its liberation in 1945 from [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], [[Western culture]] was introduced into South Korea on a small scale, with a few Western-styled bars and clubs playing Western music. After the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353) U.S. troops remained in South Korea, causing American and world culture to spread in South Korea and Western music to gradually become more accepted.

Since South Korea was impoverished after the Korean War, skilled Korean singers regarded performing for the U.S. troops as a good means to earn money. Many singers sang for the American troops, usually in dedicated clubs, the number of which rose to 264. They performed various genres like country music, blues, jazz and rock & roll. The [[Economy of South Korea|South Korean economy]] started blooming and popular music followed the trend, spread by the first commercial radio stations.

In the mid-1960s, due to the influence of the legendary British group [[The Beatles]], there was a rise of \"group sound\" in South Korea, for example, Add4 and the {{ill|Key Boys|ko|\ud0a4\ubcf4\uc774\uc2a4}}.&nbsp; Add4, Korea's first rock group, was formed by Shin Joong-hyun in 1962 and produced Korea's first rock song, \"The Woman in the Rain\", which is a form of light rock reminiscent of the early Beatles. Shin Joong-hyun was so instrumental in the development of Korean rock music that he is regarded as the \"godfather of Korean rock\" in South Korea.\n\nDuring this period, with the rise of Western pop music and Korean rock music, trot was no longer predominant in South Korea. However, trot singers like [[Lee Mi-ja]] still managed to attract a certain level of popularity, with famous songs like \"Camellia Lady\" ({{lang-ko|\"\ub3d9\ubc31 \uc544\uac00\uc528\"}}).\n\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, Western pop music, Korean rock music, and trot co-existed in South Korea.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n=== Late 1960s and 1970s: Hippie and folk influences ===\nAt the end of the 1960s Korean pop music underwent another transformation. More and more musicians were university students and graduates who were heavily influenced by American culture and lifestyle (including the [[hippie]] movement of the 1960s) and made lighthearted music unlike their predecessors, who were influenced by war and Japanese oppression.<ref name=\"encykorea3\"/> The younger generation opposed the [[Vietnam War]] as much as American hippies did, which resulted in the Korean government banning songs with more liberal lyrics. In spite of this, folk-influenced pop remained popular among the youth, and local television channel [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] organised a music contest for university students in 1977. This was the foundation of several modern music festivals.<ref name=\"newforce54-572\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 54\u201357</ref> The younger generation born after the 1950s had grown up under the U.S. influence and preferred the U.S. lifestyle, giving rise to the \"youth culture\" which was expressed through long hair, jeans, acoustic guitars and folk music. &nbsp;The folk music of that time is made up of melodies sung plainly, with the singing accompanied by a guitar or two. A majority of the folk music at that time was initiated by elite university students and those who graduated from prestigious schools. Like the activists of the U.S. student movement, they turned to folk music as the preferred music of politicized youth, who staged demonstrations against the authoritarian government. &nbsp;In turn, the government banned folk music due to its association with the students' anti-government movements. In the 1970s, the [[Park Chung-hee]] government banned American pop music and Korean rock music for their association with sex and drugs. Shin Joong-hyun, the \"godfather of Korean rock music\", was imprisoned in 1975 due to a marijuana scandal. &nbsp;In order to bolster its anti-Japanese credentials, the government also banned trot songs because of its \"Japaneseness\" given the influence of Japanese enka songs on trot. However, President Park actually embraced trot.\n\nOne of the leading figures of the era was [[Han Dae-soo]], who was raised in the United States and influenced by [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]] and [[John Lennon]]. Han's song \"Mul jom juso\" (\ubb3c \uc880 \uc8fc\uc18c, Give Me Water) became iconic among young people in Korea. His daring performances and unique singing style often shocked the public and later he was banned from performing in Korea. Han moved to [[New York City]] and pursued his musical career there, only returning to his home country in the 1990s.<ref name=\"newforce54-572\" /> Other notable singers of the period include [[Song Chang-sik]], [[Cho Young-nam]] and [[Yang Hee-eun]].<ref name=\":11\"/>{{failed verification|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the 1970s, [[DJ]]s also started to become popular.<ref name=\"encykorea3\" />\n\n===1980s: The era of ballads===\n{{Main|Korean ballad}}\nThe 1980s saw the rise of [[Pop ballad|ballad]] singers after {{ill|Lee Gwang-jo|ko|\uc774\uad11\uc870 (\uac00\uc218)}}'s 1985 album \"You\u2019re Too Far Away to Get Close to\" (\uac00\uae4c\uc774 \ud558\uae30\uc5d4 \ub108\ubb34 \uba3c \ub2f9\uc2e0, Gakkai Hagien Neomu Meon Dangsin) sold more than 300,000 copies. Other popular ballad singers included [[Lee Moon-se]] (\uc774\ubb38\uc138) and [[Byun Jin-sub]] (\ubcc0\uc9c4\uc12d), nicknamed the \"Prince of Ballads\". One of the most sought-after ballad composers of the era was [[Lee Young-hoon (composer)|Lee Young-hoon]] (\uc774\uc601\ud6c8), whose songs were compiled into a modern musical in 2011 titled ''Gwanghwamun Yeonga'' (\uad11\ud654\ubb38 \uc5f0\uac00, Gwanghwamun's Song).<ref name=\"newforce60-612\">''K-Pop: A New Force in Pop Music'', pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nThe Asia Music Forum was launched in 1980, with representatives from five different Asian countries competing in the event. Korean singer [[Cho Yong-pil]] won first place and went on to have a successful career, performing in Hong Kong and Japan. His first album ''Chang bakkui yeoja'' (\ucc3d \ubc16\uc758 \uc5ec\uc790, Woman outside the window) was a hit and he became the first Korean singer to take to the stage at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York. Cho's musical repertoire included rock, dance, trot and folk-pop.<ref name=\"newforce60-612\" /> Despite his early association with rock music as an electric guitarist in a rock band, Cho Yong-pil's initial popularity came from his trot songs which were popular in both South Korea and Japan. For example, in 1976, his trot song, \u201cPlease Return to Pusan Port\u201d was a great hit.&nbsp;Despite the temporary setback due to his involvement in a marijuana incident in 1977, he managed to bounce back with the song \"The Woman Outside the Window\" which reached a record-breaking sales of 1 million in 1980.&nbsp; In 1988, he sang \"Seoul Seoul Seoul\" in three languages (Korean, English and Japanese) to celebrate the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\n===1990s: Development of modern K-pop===\n[[File:DJ DOC @ Cyworld Dream Music Festival \uc2f8\uc774\uc6d4\ub4dc \ub4dc\ub9bc \ubba4\uc9c1 \ud398\uc2a4\ud2f0\ubc8c 36.jpg|thumb|alt=Three men performing on stage with upraised arms, wearing matching neon-orange shorts and polo shirts|[[DJ DOC]], one of the popular hip hop trios of the 1990s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rki.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_artist_detail.htm?No=10198|title=DJ DOC|publisher=KBS World|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>]]\nIn the 1990s, Korean pop musicians incorporated partially [[Europop]] and mostly [[American popular music]] styles such as [[hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], and [[electronic dance]] in their music.<ref name=\"Hartong 20062\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/musicaltermsworl0000hart|url-access=registration|title=Musical terms worldwide: a companion for the musical explorer|last=Hartong|first=Jan Laurens|publisher=Semar Publishers|year=2006|isbn=978-88-7778-090-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/musicaltermsworl0000hart/page/15 15]|quote=Since the 1990s, popular genres like rap, rock and techno house have been incorporated into Korean popular music... which often emulates American models.}}</ref> In 1992 the emergence of [[Seo Taiji & Boys]] marked a revolutionary moment in the history of K-pop.

The song's success was attributed to its [[new jack swing]]-inspired beats and memorable chorus, as well as innovative lyrics which dealt with the problems of Korean society.

[[K-pop idol|Idol bands]] of young boys or girls were formed to cater to a growing teenage audience.<ref name=\"newforce63-662\" /> H.O.T. was one of the first idol boybands, debuting in 1996 after rigorous training encompassing not only singing and dancing skills but also etiquette, attitude, language and the ability to deal with the media.<ref name=\":11\"/>  The song \"Candy\" sung by H.O.T. presented a softer and gentler form of pop music with upbeat and cheerful melodies accompanied by energetic dance steps \u2013 a formula adopted by many subsequent idol groups. The group was a huge success and the fans copied the group's hairstyle and fashion. Merchandise affiliated with the group ranging from candy to perfume were sold as well.

Prior to these regulations, trainee idols at eight idol agencies were not permitted to seek contracts at any other agency while at training. Moreover, agencies were able to terminate a trainee contract at any time for any reason. The Fair Trade Commission states that they believe these changes will \"result in a more just contract culture within the entertainment industry between trainee and agency.\" For now these regulations only apply to eight major idol agencies but the Ministry of Culture intends to apply these regulations to all existing agencies throughout 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.koreaboo.com/longform/new-contractual-changes-cause-concern-within-music-industry|title=New contractual changes cause concern within music industry|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSome of the concerns raised by the idol agencies over these regulations include the risk of a trainee at one agency going undercover at another agency to receive training with the other agency.

Flash drives that used to cost upwards of US$50, can now be purchased for under $10, making them more affordable and easier to send into North Korea.<ref name=\":06\" /> The content on these USB drives and SD cards are then viewed by plugging the device into a [[notel]], a small portable media player.<ref name=\":03\" /> Although this practice had originally begun with banned books and simple radios, there is now an even higher demand for South Korean media following the cultural phenomena of [[hallyu]], or the Korean Wave.\n\nThose near the border who choose to stay away from the banned media from the flash drives often cannot escape it. Ever since the 1950s, both countries have blasted their own propaganda across the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]]: North Korea broadcasting anti-south propaganda and South Korea broadcasting Korean and world news as well as K-pop.<ref name=\":14\" /> In 2004, both countries agreed to end the broadcasts. After an incident in 2015, South Korea resumed broadcasting anti-North news for four days, as well as in 2016, after North Korea tested its hydrogen bomb and has been broadcasting since. In April 2018, in preparation and out of respect for the meeting between North leader Kim Jong Un and South leader, Moon Jae In, the South Korean speakers ceased their broadcasts. These 11 loudspeakers can be heard up to six miles into North Korean territory. This enables the broadcasts to influence possible defectors staying near the border as well as create bothersome propaganda that North Korean soldiers cannot escape.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThe dissemination of K-pop and Korean media has been crucial in presenting the realities of North Korea to its citizens. By detailing the basic conditions of life in South Korea and introducing foreign ideologies, Korean media has aroused civil unrest amongst both citizens and elites concerning the disparities between living conditions inside and outside North Korea.<ref name=\":03\" /> A defector explains that, when he escaped in 2012, only the wealthy families were the ones consuming the South Korean media because the costs of the flash drives and technology to use them were so high. Because most youth lacked the resources to afford the drives, most consumers of South Korean media before 2012 were middle-aged elite who favored K-dramas over K-pop due to their more traditional behavior.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2015/06/do-north-koreans-like-k-pop/|title=Do North Koreans like K-pop? {{!}} NK News - North Korea News|last=Lee|first=Je Son|date=June 17, 2015|work=NK News - North Korea News|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}</ref> The current high demand for Korean media continues to rise as now approximately 70% of North Koreans consume foreign media in their homes,<ref name=\":03\" /> which accounts for the higher youth following of South Korean media today. One researcher at the [[Korea Institute for National Unification]] claims to have never met a single defector who had not seen or listened to foreign media before entering South Korea. Yet experts remain wary that a cultural uprising will occur because of the media. Consuming South Korean media serves many purposes for North Koreans such as enjoyment and education, but few consider uprooting a totalitarian regime because of the cultures they've experienced through K-pop and K-dramas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Mikyoung|date=August 1, 2018|title=North Korea's Hidden Revolution: How the Information Underground Is Transforming a Closed Society.

This changed in the early 2000s as the cultural dispersion of ''Hallyu'' has contributed to the reconstruction of South Korea's image among the Taiwanese. This change was in part prompted by the South Korean government, who wished to encourage goodwill between the two countries after the break of diplomacy.

In many languages also using a word derived from the Greek, the form used is the one closest to ''trapezium'', not to ''trapezoid'' (e.g. French ''trap\u00e8ze'', Italian ''trapezio'', Portuguese ''trap\u00e9zio'', Spanish ''trapecio'', German ''Trapez'', Ukrainian \"\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0456\u044f\").\n\n===''Trapezium'' vs ''Trapezoid''===\nThe term ''trapezoid'' was once defined as a quadrilateral without any parallel sides in Britain and elsewhere. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) says \"Often called by English writers in the 19th century\".<ref name=\"oed\">''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' entries for trapezoid and trapezium.</ref> According to the OED, the sense of a figure with no sides parallel is the meaning for which Proclus introduced the term \"trapezoid\". This is retained in the French ''trap\u00e9zo\u00efde'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/trap%C3%A9zo%C3%AFde/79256|title=Larousse definition for trap\u00e9zo\u00efde}}</ref> German ''Trapezoid'', and in other languages. However, this particular sense is considered obsolete.\n\nA ''trapezium'' in Proclus' sense is a quadrilateral having one pair of its opposite sides parallel. This was the specific sense in England in the 17th and 18th centuries, and again the prevalent one in recent use outside North America. A trapezium as any quadrilateral more general than a [[parallelogram]] is the sense of the term in [[Euclid]].\n\nConfusingly, the word ''trapezium'' was sometimes used in England from c. 1800 to c. 1875, to denote an irregular quadrilateral having no sides parallel. This is now obsolete in England, but continues in North America. However this shape is more usually (and less confusingly) just called an irregular quadrilateral.<ref>[http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?xref=21C44644&title=21st&query=trapezoid ''Chambers 21st Century Dictionary'' Trapezoid]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trapezium |title=1913 American definition of trapezium |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Inclusive vs exclusive definition==\nThere is some disagreement whether [[parallelogram]]s, which have two pairs of parallel sides, should be regarded as trapezoids. Some define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral having ''only'' one pair of parallel sides (the exclusive definition), thereby excluding parallelograms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.com/school/glossary/defs/trapezoid.html |title=American School definition from \"math.com\" |accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref> Others<ref name=Mathworld>{{MathWorld |title=Trapezoid |urlname=Trapezoid}}</ref> define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral with ''at least'' one pair of parallel sides (the inclusive definition<ref>Trapezoids, [http://www.math.washington.edu/~king/coursedir/m444a00/syl/class/trapezoids/Trapezoids.html]. Retrieved 2012-02-24.</ref>), making the parallelogram a special type of trapezoid. The latter definition is consistent with its uses in higher mathematics such as [[calculus]].  This article uses the inclusive definition and considers parallelograms as special cases of a trapezoid. This is also advocated in the [[Quadrilateral#Taxonomy|taxonomy of quadrilaterals]].\n\nUnder the inclusive definition, all parallelograms (including [[rhombus]]es, [[rectangle]]s and [[Square (geometry)|square]]s) are trapezoids. Rectangles have mirror symmetry on mid-edges; rhombuses have mirror symmetry on vertices, while squares have mirror symmetry on both mid-edges and vertices.\n\n==Special cases==\n[[File:Trapezoid special cases.png|280px|thumb|Trapezoid special cases.  The orange figures also qualify as parallelograms.]]\n\nA '''right trapezoid''' (also called ''right-angled trapezoid'') has two adjacent [[right angles]].<ref name=Mathworld/> Right trapezoids are used in the [[trapezoidal rule]] for estimating areas under a curve.\n\nAn '''acute trapezoid''' has two adjacent acute angles on its longer ''base'' edge, while an '''obtuse trapezoid''' has one acute and one obtuse angle on each ''base''.\n\nAn '''[[isosceles trapezoid]]''' is a trapezoid where the base angles have the same measure. As a consequence the two legs are also of equal length and it has [[reflection symmetry]].  This is possible for acute trapezoids or right trapezoids (rectangles).\n\nA '''[[parallelogram]]''' is a trapezoid with two pairs of parallel sides.

In many languages also using a word derived from the Greek, the form used is the one closest to ''trapezium'', not to ''trapezoid'' (e.g. French ''trap\u00e8ze'', Italian ''trapezio'', Portuguese ''trap\u00e9zio'', Spanish ''trapecio'', German ''Trapez'', Ukrainian \"\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0456\u044f\").\n\n===''Trapezium'' vs ''Trapezoid''===\nThe term ''trapezoid'' was once defined as a quadrilateral without any parallel sides in Britain and elsewhere.

A trapezium as any quadrilateral more general than a [[parallelogram]] is the sense of the term in [[Euclid]].\n\nConfusingly, the word ''trapezium'' was sometimes used in England from c. 1800 to c. 1875, to denote an irregular quadrilateral having no sides parallel.

In 499 AD [[Aryabhata]], a great [[mathematician]]-[[astronomer]] from the classical age of [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Indian astronomy]], used this method in the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (section 2.8). This yields as a [[special case]] the well-known formula for the area of a [[triangle]], by considering a triangle as a degenerate trapezoid in which one of the parallel sides has shrunk to a point.\n\nThe 7th-century Indian mathematician [[Bh\u0101skara I]] derived the following formula for the area of a trapezoid with consecutive sides ''a'', ''c'', ''b'', ''d'':\n:<math>K=\\frac{1}{2}(a+b)\\sqrt{c^2-\\frac{1}{4}\\left((b-a)+\\frac{c^2-d^2}{b-a}\\right)^2}</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are parallel and ''b'' > ''a''.<ref>T.

London: [[Her Majesty's Stationery Office|His Majesty's Stationery Office]]. Some sources give J.J.Turpin rather than Harold</ref>\nOver four million Stens in various versions were made in the 1940s.\n\n==History==\nThe Sten emerged while Britain was engaged in the [[Battle of Britain]], facing invasion by Germany. The army was forced to replace weapons lost during the evacuation from [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]] while expanding at the same time. Prior to 1941 (and even later) the British were purchasing all the [[Thompson submachine gun]]s they could from the United States, but these did not meet demand. American entry into the war at the end of 1941 placed an even bigger demand on the facilities making Thompsons. In order to rapidly equip a sufficient fighting force to counter the Axis threat, the [[Royal Small Arms Factory]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], was commissioned to produce an alternative.\n\nThe credited designers were Major R. V. Shepherd, [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], Inspector of Armaments in the [[Ministry of Supply (UK)|Ministry of Supply]] Design Department at The [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]], (later Assistant Chief Superintendent at the Armaments Design Department) and Mr. Harold John Turpin, Senior [[technical drawing|Draughtsman]] of the Design Department of the [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] (RSAF), Enfield. Shepherd had been recalled to service after having retired and spending some time at the Birmingham Small Arms Company ([[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]]).\n\nThe Sten shared design features, such as its side-mounted magazine configuration, with the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Lanchester submachine gun]], which was a copy of the German [[MP 18|MP28]]. In terms of manufacture, the Lanchester was entirely different, being made of high-quality materials with pre-war fit and finish, in stark contrast to the Sten's austere execution. The Lanchester and Sten magazines were even interchangeable (though the Lanchester's magazine was longer with a 50-round capacity, compared to the Sten's 32-round capacity).\n\nThe Sten used simple stamped metal components and minor welding, which required minimal machining and manufacturing. Much of the production could be performed by small workshops, with the firearms assembled at the Enfield site. Over the period of manufacture the Sten design was further simplified: the most basic model, the Mark III, could be produced from five man-hours of work. Some of the cheapest versions were made from only 47 different parts. It was distinctive for its bare appearance (just a pipe with a metal loop for a stock), and its horizontal magazine. The Mark I was a more finely finished weapon with a wooden foregrip and handle; later versions were generally more spartan, although the final version, the Mark V, which was produced after the threat of invasion had died down, was produced to a higher standard.\n\nThe Sten has been described by [[Max Hastings]] as: \"highly unreliable, prone to jamming, and inaccurate beyond 30 metres. It was unsuitable for guerrilla operations in open country because it encouraged waste of ammunition. But it was easy and cheap to produce, a gun was said to cost fifteen shillings (three quarters of a pound), and was supplied to the (French) Resistance in huge quantities\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hastings |authorlink=Max Hastings |first=Max |title=Das Reich: The March of the 2nd SS Panzer Division through France, June 1944 |edition=2 |origyear=1981 |year=2013 |publisher=Zenith Press |location=Minneapolis, USA |isbn=978-0-7603-4491-0 |page=237}}</ref>\n\nThe Sten underwent various design improvements over the course of the war. For example, the Mark 4 cocking handle and corresponding hole drilled in the receiver were created to lock the bolt in the closed position to reduce the likelihood of accidental discharges inherent in the design. Most changes to the production process were more subtle, designed to give greater ease of manufacture and increased reliability. Build quality ranged from quite good (Canadian production) to poor (early British production.) Sten guns of late 1942 and beyond were, in general, highly effective weapons, though complaints of accidental discharge continued throughout the war.\n\nThe Sten was replaced by the [[Sterling submachine gun]] from 1953 and was gradually withdrawn from British service in the 1960s. The other Commonwealth nations made or adopted their own replacements.\n\n==Design==\nThe Sten was a [[Blowback (firearms)|blowback-operated]] submachine gun firing from an [[open bolt]] with a fixed firing pin on the face of the bolt. This means the bolt remains to the rear when the weapon is cocked, and on pulling the trigger the bolt moves forward under spring pressure, stripping the round from the magazine, chambering it and firing the weapon all in the same movement. There is no breech locking mechanism, the rearward movement of the bolt caused by the recoil impulse is arrested only by the mainspring and the bolt's inertia. The basic operating principles were similar to those of the German [[MP40]], Russian [[PPSh-41]], US [[M3 submachine gun]] and numerous other designs. These shared similar attributes and faults; they were simple and cheap to manufacture, and put an automatic weapon into the hands of soldiers, greatly increasing the short-range firepower of the infantry, especially when the main infantry weapon was a [[bolt-action rifle]] capable of only around 15 rounds per minute and not suited for short-range combat. However, the open-bolt firing mechanism, short barrel, and use of pistol ammunition severely restricted accuracy, with an effective range of around 100m.\n\nStoppages could occur for a variety of reasons: some as a result of poor maintenance, while others were particular to the Sten. Carbon buildup on the face of the breech<ref>Carbine, Machine, STEN 9mm Mk II, ''General Instructions'', (February 1942) [http://ferret-afv.org/manuals/sten_mk_2_users_manual.pdf Manual]: Heavy carbon buildup could prevent the firing pin from detonating the primer.</ref> or debris in the bolt raceway could cause a failure to fire, while a dirty chamber could cause a failure to feed.<ref name=\"Carbine, Machine 1942\">Carbine, Machine, STEN 9mm Mk II, ''General Instructions'', (February 1942)</ref> Firing the Sten by grasping the magazine with the supporting hand tended to wear the magazine catch, altering the angle of feed and causing a failure to feed \u2013 the correct method of holding the weapon was as with a rifle, the left hand cradling the fore piece, as per the picture of [[Winston Churchill]] firing one below.\n\nAdditional problems stemmed from the Sten's magazine, which was a direct copy of the one used in the German MP-38, originally in order to facilitate the use of German 9&nbsp;mm magazines.<ref>Dunlap, Roy F., ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 80</ref> Unfortunately, this decision necessarily incorporated the Erma magazine's faults in the process. The magazine had two columns of 9&nbsp;mm cartridges in a staggered arrangement, merging at the top to form a single column. While other staggered magazines, such as the Thompson, fed from both the left and right side alternately (double-column, double feed), the Sten magazine, like the MP38, required the cartridges to gradually merge at the top of the magazine to form a single column (double column, single feed). As a consequence, any dirt or foreign matter in this taper area could cause feed [[Firearm malfunction|malfunctions]]. Additionally, the walls of the magazine lip had to endure the full stresses of the rounds being pushed in by the spring. This, along with rough handling could result in deformation of the magazine lips (which required a precise 8\u00b0 feed angle to operate), resulting in misfeeding and a failure to fire.\n\nModern 9&nbsp;mm magazines, such as those used by the [[Sterling SMG]], are curved and feed both sides to avoid this problem. If a Sten failed to feed due to jammed cartridges in the magazine, standard practice to clear it was as follows: remove magazine from Sten, tap the base of the magazine against the knee, re-insert magazine in Sten, then recocking the weapon and firing again as normal.<ref name=\"Carbine, Machine 1942\" /> To facilitate easier loading when attempting to push the cartridges down to insert the next one, a magazine filler tool was developed and formed part of the weapon's kit.\n\nThe slot on the side of the body where the cocking knob ran was also a target of criticism, as the long opening could allow foreign objects to enter. On the other hand, a beneficial side-effect of the Sten's [[minimalist]] design was that it would fire without any lubrication.<ref name=\"Carbine, Machine 1942\"/> This proved useful in desert environments such as the [[Western Desert Campaign]], where lubricating oil retained dust and sand.\n\nThe open bolt design combined with cheap manufacture and rudimentary safety devices also meant the weapon was prone to accidental discharges, which proved hazardous. A simple safety could be engaged while the bolt was in the rearwards (cocked) position. However, if a Sten with a loaded magazine, with the bolt in the closed position, was dropped or the butt was knocked against the ground, the bolt could move far enough rearward to pick up a round (but not far enough to be engaged by the trigger mechanism) and the spring pressure could be enough to chamber and fire the round. The Mk 4 cocking handle was designed to prevent this by enabling the bolt to be locked in its forward position, thereby immobilising it. Wear and manufacturing tolerances could render these safety devices ineffective.\n\n==Variants==\nSten guns were produced in several basic marks (though the Mk I saw limited service, and the Mk IV was never issued), and nearly half of the total produced were Mark II versions. Approximately 4.5 million Stens were produced during the second world war.\n\n===Mark I===\nThe first ever Mk I Sten gun (number 'T-40/1' indicating its originator Harold Turpin, the year 1940 and the serial number \"1\") was handmade by Turpin at the Philco Radio works at [[Perivale]], [[Middlesex]] during December 1940/January 1941. This particular weapon is held by the historical weapons collection of the [[British Army]]'s Infantry and [[Small Arms School Corps]] in [[Warminster]], [[Wiltshire]].<ref>{{cite web |author=D Cuthbertson |url=http://infantry-weapons.org/smg_lmgs.htm |title=infantry-weapons.org |publisher=infantry-weapons.org |accessdate=9 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522121134/http://infantry-weapons.org/smg_lmgs.htm |archivedate=22 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe first model had a conical [[flash hider]] and fine finish. It had a wooden foregrip and forward handle (sometimes this was made of steel), as well for a section of the stock. The stock was a small tube outline, rather like the Mark II Canadian. One unique feature was that the front pistol grip could be rotated forward to make the firearm easier to stow. The barrel sleeve extended all the way to the end, where it met the flash hider. Along the top of the tube surrounding the barrel was a line of small holes and its sights were configured somewhat differently. About 100,000 were made before production switched to the Mark II. Sten Mk I's in German possession were designated MP 748(e), the 'e' standing for ''englisch''.\n\n===Mark I*===\nThis was the first simplification of the Mk I. The foregrip, the wooden furniture and the flash hider were removed for production expediency.<ref>{{cite book |last=Skennerton |first=Ian\n|title=British Small Arms of World War 2: The Complete Reference Guide to Weapons, Codes and Contracts, 1936-1946. |publisher=Greenhill Books |date=September 1988 |page=32 |isbn=978-0-949749-09-3}}</ref>\n\n===Mark II===\nThe Mark II was the most common variant, with two million units produced. It was a much rougher weapon than the Mk I. The flash eliminator and the folding handle (the grip) of the Mk I were omitted. A removable barrel was now provided which projected {{convert|3|in|mm}} beyond the barrel sleeve. Also, a special catch allowed the magazine to be slid partly out of the magazine housing and the housing rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (from the operator's perspective), together covering the ejection opening and allowing the weapon and magazine both to lie flat on its side.[[File:Winston Churchill As Prime Minister 1940-45 H10688.jpg|thumb|[[Winston Churchill]] with a Sten Mk II in [[Shoeburyness]] on 13 June 1941.]] The barrel sleeve was shorter and rather than having small holes on the top, it had three sets of three holes equally spaced on the shroud. To allow a soldier to hold a Sten by the hot barrel sleeve with the supporting hand, an insulating lace-on leather sleeve guard was sometimes issued.<ref>The barrel sleeve was generally considered the proper place for the supporting hand, as holding the weapon by its magazine could sometimes initiate a feed malfunction. However, the metal barrel sleeve heated rapidly after only a few bursts.</ref> Sten Mk II's in German possession were designated MP 749(e), the \"e\" signifying \"englisch\". Some Mk IIs were fitted with a wooden stock as this part was desirable and interchangeable with the Mk V. Also, the [[Wimmersperg Spz-kr|Spz-kr assault rifle]] uses the receiver and components from the Sten Mk II.\n\nRegular Mark II:\n* Overall length: {{convert|762|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Barrel length: {{convert|197|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Weight: {{convert|3.2|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n\n===Mark II (Canadian)===\nDuring [[World War II]] a version of the Sten gun was produced at the Long Branch Arsenal in [[Long Branch, Toronto|Long Branch, Ontario]] now part of [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]. This was very similar to the regular Mark II, with a different stock ('skeleton' type instead of strut type) and improved quality of manufacture. It was first used in combat in the [[Dieppe Raid]] in 1942.\n\nThe Mark II is made in China with a copy known as the M38.<ref name=\"SA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=4312|title=Stens of the World: Part I|author=|date=|website=Small Arms Defense Journal}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sten factory 1942.jpg|thumb|Worker posing with a Sten Mk II in the factory on 26 May 1942.]]\n[[File:Warszawskie, Krak\u00f3w, Poland - panoramio (162).jpg|thumb|A Sten Mk II held in the [[Armia Krajowa Museum in Krak\u00f3w|Polish Home Army Museum]], Krak\u00f3w, Poland.]]\nMark II:\n* Overall length: {{convert|896|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Barrel length: {{convert|198|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Weight: {{convert|3.8|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n\n===Mark III===\nThis simple design was the next most commonly produced after the Mark II. A result of the manufacturer [[Lines Bros Ltd]] stating it could build a modified design that was quicker and cheaper to build than the Mk II, it was a simplification of the Mk I made both in Canada and the UK. Lines Bros Ltd was the largest manufacturer. The biggest difference from the Mark II was the unification of the receiver, ejection port, and barrel shroud that now extended farther up the barrel. The barrel was fixed and the body was welded shut along the centre of the top. Captured Sten Mk IIIs in German possession were designated MP 750(e).\n\n===Mark V===\n[[File:British paratroopers in Oosterbeek.jpg|thumb|right|British paratroopers in [[Oosterbeek]] during [[Operation Market Garden]] armed with the Sten Mk V.]]\nIntroduced in 1944, the Mk V was essentially a better-quality, more elaborate version of the Mk 2. Changes included a wooden pistol grip, a vertical wooden fore grip, a wooden stock, and a bayonet mount. There was a No4 Lee\u2013Enfield foresight and the weapon was of better quality manufacture and finish than the Mk2 and Mk3. The Sten [[bandolier]] issued to paratroopers held seven full magazines.\n\nAnother variant of the Mk V had a swivel stock and rear sight mirror intended for firing around corners in urban warfare, similar to the [[Krummlauf]] developed by the Germans for the [[StG 44]].\n\n===Mark VI===\nSee suppressed models.\n* Overall length: {{convert|908|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Barrel length: {{convert|198|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Weight: {{convert|4.5|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n\n===Suppressed models===\n[[File:Smg sten MK IIS 01.jpg|thumb|Sten Mk IIS ([[suppressor|suppressed]])]]\n[[File:Smg sten Mk VI.jpg|thumb|Sten Mk VIS ([[suppressor|suppressed]])]]\n\nMk IIS and Mk VI models incorporated an integral [[suppressor]] (\"silencer\") and had a lower muzzle velocity than the others due to a ported barrel intended to reduce velocity to below the speed of sound; {{convert| 305|m/s|0|abbr=on}}. The suppressor heated up rapidly when the weapon was fired, and a canvas cover was laced around the suppressor for some protection for the firer's supporting hand.<ref>Wolfgang Michel: ''Britische Schalld\u00e4mpferwaffen 1939-1945: Entwicklung, Technik, Wirkung''. {{ISBN|978-3-8370-2149-3}}</ref>\n\n====Mk IIS====\nThe Mk IIS was, as the name suggests, a suppressed version of the Mk II. Captured examples of the Sten Mk IIS in German service were designated MP 751(e).\n\n====Mk VI====\nThe Mk VI (or '6') was a suppressed version of the Mk V. The Mk VI was the heaviest version due to the added weight of the suppressor, as well as using a wooden pistol grip and wooden stock.\n\nThe suppressed models were produced at the request of the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) for use on clandestine operations in occupied Europe, starting with the Mk IIS in 1943. Owing to their tendency to overheat, they were fired in short bursts or single shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://firearms.96.lt/pages/Silencedsten2.html|title=Silencedsten|author=|date=|work=96.lt}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to its use in the European Theatre, the Mk IIS saw service with clandestine units in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA) such as the [[Services Reconnaissance Department]] and SOE's [[Force 136]] on operations against Imperial Japanese forces. The Sten Mk IIS was used by the [[Operation Jaywick]] party during their raid into Japanese-occupied [[Singapore]] Harbour.\n\nThe Sten Mk IIS also saw service with the Australian Special Air Service (SAS) in Vietnam.\n\n===Experimental models===\n====Mark II (wooden butt model)====\nThis was a standard Sten Mk.II submachine gun with a wooden butt attached in place of the wireframe steel butt used with Mk.IIs. This wooden butt model was never put into service; it is likely that this was due to the cost of producing it.\n\n====Mark II (Rosciszewski model)====\nThis was a Sten Mk.II modified by Antoni Rosciszewski of Small Arms Ltd. The magazine was mechanically operated by the breech block movement. The trigger was split into two sections, with the upper part of the trigger offering full-auto fire and a lower part offering single shots. It was very complex in design and never fielded.\n\n====Mark II (pistol grip model)====\nThis was a Sten Mk.II with a wireframe pistol grip, intended for use with paratroopers. It was compact but predictably uncomfortable to fire.\n\n====Model T42====\nThis was a Sten Mk.II modified with a 5-inch barrel and folding stock, as well as a conventional pistol grip and redesigned trigger guard. It was dubbed the \"T42\" in prototype phases, but never entered service.\n\n====Mark III (wooden model)====\nThis was a Sten Mk.III with a \"Lanchester\" type wooden body and butt, and bayonet fittings. Sling swivels were also added. It never entered service due to the costs associated with producing it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====Mark III (wooden model II)====\nThis was a Sten Mk.III entirely encased in a wooden body, with the only external metal parts being the trigger, barrel, magazine and cocking handle. The trigger and pistol grip were in line with the magazine. The reasons for its creation are  likely an experiment into increasing the comfort and handling of the weapon in freezing temperatures.\n\n====Mark IV====\nThe [http://world.guns.ru/userfiles/images/smg/smg27/sten_mkIV.jpg Mark IV] was a smaller version which did not progress beyond the prototype stage. It was near pistol-sized and it had a different configuration with a conical flash hider, a rear pistol grip, a very light stock and a much shorter barrel.\n\n====Rofsten====\nDeveloped at the Royal Ordnance Factory at Fazakerley (ROF), the Rofsten was an odd Sten prototype with a redesigned magazine feed, ergonomic pistol grip, selector switch and cocking system. The weapon was cocked by pulling the small ring above the stock. A large flash eliminator was fixed onto the barrel, and a No.5 bayonet could be fixed. It was made to a very high quality standard and had an increased rate of fire (around 900 rounds per minute).\nThe Rofsten was made in 1944 as a single prototype and ROF wanted to submit it to trials the next year. Despite better quality there were numerous reliability problems due to the much higher rate of fire. The budget cuts prevented the modifications and this version never got beyond the prototype stage.\n\n===Foreign-built variants and post 1945 derivatives===\n====Argentine Sten====\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 38.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Modelo C.4 Sten gun.]]\nSten MkIIs were licence-copied in Argentina by [[Hispano-Argentina|Pistola Hispano Argentino]] and can be recognised with a wooden handguard in front of the trigger group. It was known as the '''Modelo C.4'''.<ref>*Julio S.

One variant had an unusual stock shape that proved detrimental to the firer's aim. Internally it was basically a Sten gun but had two triggers for semi/full auto, a grip safety and a foregrip that used MP40 magazines. Another had a folding stock with a folding magazine insert. The trigger mechanism was complicated and unusual. Neither of these prototypes had any kind of success and MAC closed its doors not long after their conception. The French were not short of SMGs after the war; they had some 3,750 Thompsons and Stens, as well as MAS 38s.\n\n====Norwegian Sten====\nIn German-occupied Norway the resistance, under the leadership of [[Bror With]], created a large number of Sten guns from scratch, mainly to equip members of the underground army ''[[Milorg]]''. In his autobiography, Norwegian resistance fighter [[Max Manus]] frequently mentions the Sten<ref>Manus, Max, ''Part I, Det vil helst g\u00e5 godt'' (It'd best be all right); ''Part II, Det blir alvor'' (It gets serious), Familieforlaget (1946), {{ISBN|978-82-8214-043-0}}</ref> as one of the weapons his groups of commandos and resistance fighters used effectively against German troops.\n\n====Danish Sten====\nSeveral groups in the Danish resistance movement manufactured Sten guns for their own use. [[BOPA]] produced around 200 in a bicycle repair shop on Gammel K\u00f8ge landevej (Old K\u00f8ge road), south of Copenhagen. [[Holger Danske (resistance group)|Holger Danske]] produced about 150 in workshops in Copenhagen, while employees of the construction company [[MT H\u00f8jgaard|Monberg & Thorsen]] built approximately 200\u2013300 in what is now the municipality of [[Gladsaxe]] (a suburb of Copenhagen) for use by Holger Danske and others. The resistance groups 'Frit Danmark' and 'Ringen' also built significant numbers of Stens.\n\n====Polish Sten====\n{{see also|B\u0142yskawica submachine gun}}\n[[File:B\u0142yskawica and other insurgent weapons.jpg|thumb|right|B\u0142yskawica and Polish Sten on display in the [[Warsaw Uprising Museum]]]]\nThe Polish resistance was provided with numerous Stens of various models by the SOE and the [[Cichociemni]]. Between 1942 and 1944, approximately 11,000 Sten Mk IIs were delivered to the ''[[Armia Krajowa]]''. Due to the simplicity of design, local production of Sten variants was started in at least 23 underground workshops in Poland. Some of them produced copies of Mark IIs, while others produced the so-called ''Polski Sten'' and ''[[KIS (weapon)|KIS]]''. The Polski Stens made in Warsaw under the command of [[Ryszard Bia\u0142ostocki]] were built from a number of \"legal\" elements made in official factories or acquired through other means. The main body of the machine pistol was made from hydraulic cylinders produced for hospital equipment. All the machine pistols were marked in English to disguise their origin. Stens' barrels were also used for SMGs produced in Poland under the name [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]].\n\n====Belgian Sten MkII====\n[[File:Belgian Sten Gun .jpg|thumb|upright|Details of magazine well stamping on Belgian Sten]]\n\nA little known version of the MkII Sten was built in Belgium by ''l'arsenale militare belga'' (the Belgian military arsenal).  The magazine well was stamped AsArm (the manufacturer),  ABL (for Arm\u00e9e Belge Belgisch Leger), the Belgian Royal Crown and a serial number of typically five figure with no letter prefix.  It is believed the Belgian built Mk II Stens remained in ABL service until the early 1980s, particularly with helicopter-borne forces.  Some of the weapons had a \"Parkerised\" finish.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====Ger\u00e4t Potsdam====\nIn late 1944, the [[Mauser]] works in Germany secretly started manufacturing copies of the Mk II Sten. These weapons were intended to duplicate the British original as closely as possible, including the markings. The series was referred to as the ''Ger\u00e4t Potsdam'' (Potsdam Device){{sfn|Smith|1969|p=429}} and approximately 28,000 weapons were made \u2013 even though the Germans had ample stocks of captured original Stens available.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====German MP 3008====\n[[File:MP 3008 Sub Machine Gun.jpg|right|275px|thumb|MP 3008 copy]]\nLate in the war Germany was seeking a cheap version of the [[MP40]] machine pistol for the ''[[Volkssturm]]''. For that purpose a modified Sten was designed by [[Mauser]] and named the [[MP 3008]].{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=429}} The main difference was the magazine attached below the weapon. Altogether, roughly 10,000 were produced in early 1945, just before the end of [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====[[Austen_submachine_gun|Austen]] submachine gun====\nThe '''Mark I Austen''' (from \"'''Au'''stralian '''Sten'''\") was a 9mm Australian submachine gun derived from the British Sten gun developed during the [[Second World War]] by the [[Lithgow Small Arms Factory]]. It externally resembled the Sten but had twin pistol grips and folding stock resembling those of the German [[MP40]].<ref name=\"Smith198\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Joseph E.|title=Small Arms of the World|edition =11|location=Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|publisher= The Stackpole Company|year=1969|ref=harv}}</ref> A Mk 2 version was also produced which was of different appearance and which made more use of die-cast components.{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=200}} 20,000 Austens were made during the war and the Austen was replaced by the [[F1 submachine gun]] in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Smith198\"/>\n\n====Imperia submachine gun====\nAfter the Second World War the Belgian Army was mainly equipped with a mixture of British and American submachine guns. The army, wanting to replace them with a modern and preferably native design, tested various designs with the [[Vigneron submachine gun|Vigneron M2]] and licence-produced [[Uzi|FN Uzi]] being selected. However, the Imperia was an improved Sten with a fire selector and retractable stock.\n\n====Sputter Gun====\nA short-lived American invention developed in the 1980s, the [[Sputter Gun]] was designed to circumvent [[National Firearms Act|the law]] that defined a [[machine gun]] as something that fired multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. The Sputter Gun had no trigger, but fired continuously after loading and the pulling back of its bolt, firing until it ran out of ammunition. The gun was very short lived as the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] quickly reclassified it.\n\n====Halcon ML-57====\nThe [[Halcon ML-57]] was a simpler derivative of the Sten gun of Argentine origin that was fed from a vertically inserted magazine.\n\n====International Ordnance MP2====\nDuring the 1970s-1980s, International Ordnance of San Antonio, Texas, United States released the MP2 machine pistol. It was intended as a more compact, simpler derivative of the British Sten gun to be used in urban guerrilla actions, to be manufactured cheaply and/or in less-than-well-equipped workshops and distributed to \"friendly\" undercover forces. Much like the [[FP-45 Liberator]] pistol of World War II, it could be discarded during an escape with no substantial loss for the force's arsenal. The MP2 is a blowback-operated weapon that fires from an open bolt with an extremely high rate of fire.\n\n====Cellini Dunn SM-9====\nThe [[SM-9]] is a machine pistol of Guatemalan origin and manufactured by Cellini-Dunn IMG, Military Research Corp and Wildfire Munitions as the SM-90. It is blowback operated, firing from an open bolt and can use magazines from Ingram [[MAC-10]] submachine guns inserted into a similar foregrip that can be rotated 45 and 90 degrees for left/right handed operators. The layout of the receiver is somewhat simpler than that of a Sten with its internal components light in weight enabling a very high rate of fire of 1200rpm. Its forward pistol grip can hold a spare magazine as well as handling the weapon when firing.\n\n====Pleter 91====\nThe [[Pleter 91 submachine gun|Pleter submachine gun]] was created in 1991 when the breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in the midst of emerging war left the newly formed Republic of Croatia with small number of military firearms. Since the [[embargo]] prevented the Croatian military from legally buying them on open market (so they were mostly obtained on the world black market, but with significantly higher price and sometimes of questionable quality), to fulfill the immediate need for arms, they tried to resort on quick and simple locally made designs.\n\nDespite having a vertical magazine well (designed to accept 32-round double-feed direct copy of [[UZI]] magazine, rather than original single-feed Sten-type magazine), analogies with the Sten include a striking resemblance in the barrel assembly and in the bolt and recoil spring. In addition, this gun also fires from an open bolt, and is further simplified by removing fire mode selector or any safety.\n\n====SaskSten====\nSMG International in Canada manufactured reproductions of the Sten in six variants.{{When|date=June 2016}} They made copies of the Sten's Mk 1*, Mk II and Mk III, a \"New Zealand Sten\" (a Mk II/III Sten hybrid, with sights and a fixed magazine housing similar to the Mk III), then branched out into \"hypothetical\" Sten-guns with a \"Rotary Magazine Sten\" (a Mk II Sten with a drum magazine attached below the weapon and wooden horizontal forward grip on the left side of the weapon) and the \"FRT Gun\" (a long barrel Sten with a wooden or Mk 1* type butt stock, a drum magazine attached below the weapon and sliding ramp rear sights). These last two being obviously not Sten reproductions, especially if they included a drum magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smginternational.net/Products/FireArms/Sten/ProdFrtGunStenSuomi.html |title=SMG International Sten SaskSten FRT Gun |date=29 November 2010 |work=archive.org |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129115125/http://www.smginternational.net/Products/FireArms/Sten/ProdFrtGunStenSuomi.html |archivedate=29 November 2010 }}</ref>  The \"Rotary Magazine Sten\" is a vertically fed Sten which uses a modified Sten bolt, which can use either PPSh drum magazines or stick magazines. The FRT gun is essentially a Suomi that uses a Sten trigger mechanism.  All SaskSten guns fire from an open bolt.<ref>Mick Boon</ref>\n\n==Service==\nThe Sten, especially the Mark II, tended to attract affection and loathing in equal measure. Its peculiar appearance when compared to other firearms of the era, combined with sometimes questionable reliability made it unpopular with some front-line troops.<ref>Weeks, John, ''World War II Small Arms'', Galahad Books (1979), {{ISBN|0-88365-403-2}}, p. 84</ref> It gained nicknames such as \"Plumber's Nightmare\", \"Plumber's Abortion\", or \"Stench Gun\". The Sten's advantage was its ease of mass-production manufacture in a time of shortage during a major conflict.\n\nMade by a variety of manufacturers, often with subcontracted parts, some early Sten guns were made poorly and/or not made to specification, and could malfunction in operation, sometimes in combat.<ref name=\"Willbanks, James H. 2004 p. 91\">Willbanks, James H., ''Machine Guns: An Illustrated History of Their Impact'', ABC-CLIO Press (2004), {{ISBN|1-85109-480-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85109-480-6}}, p. 91</ref> The double-column, single-feed magazine copied from the German MP28 was never completely satisfactory, and hasty manufacturing processes often exacerbated misfeed problems inherent in the design. A common statement heard from British forces at the time was that the Sten was made \"by [[Marks and Spencer]] out of Woolworth.\"<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 p. 208-209\">Shore, C. (Capt), ''With British Snipers to the Reich'', Paladin Press (1988), p. 208-209</ref> British and Commonwealth forces in the early years of the war often extensively test-fired their weapons in training to weed out bad examples; a last-minute issue of newly manufactured Stens prior to going into action was not always welcomed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe MK II and MK III Stens were regarded by many soldiers as very temperamental, and could [[accidental discharge|accidentally discharge]] if dropped or even laid on the ground whilst the gun was cocked.<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 p. 208-209\"/> Others would fire full-automatic when placed on 'single', or fire single shots when placed on 'automatic'.<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 p. 208-209\"/> This was particularly true of early Stens using [[bronze]] bolts, where the sear projection underneath the bolt could wear down more easily than ones made of [[Case-hardening|case-hardened]] steel.\n\nStens could jam at inopportune moments. One of the more notable instances of this was the assassination of [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] [[Reinhard Heydrich]] on 27 May 1942, when a Czechoslovak soldier \u2013 Warrant Officer [[Jozef Gab\u010d\u00edk]] \u2013 fired his Sten point blank at Heydrich, only to have it misfire. His comrade [[Jan Kubi\u0161]] then hastily tossed a grenade, which mortally wounded Heydrich.<ref name=\"Willbanks, James H. 2004 p. 91\"/> There are other accounts of the Sten's unreliability, some of them true, some exaggerated and some which are [[apocryphal]].

In addition to regular British and Commonwealth military service, Stens were air-dropped in quantity to [[Resistance movement|resistance]] fighters and partisans throughout occupied Europe.

It was slowly withdrawn from British Army service in the 1960s and replaced by the [[Sterling SMG]]; Canada also phased out Sten, replacing it with the [[C1 SMG]].\n\nThe Sten was one of the few weapons that the [[Israel|State of Israel]] could produce domestically during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. Even before the declaration of the State of Israel, the [[Yishuv]] had been producing Stens for the [[Haganah]]; after the declaration, Israel continued making Stens for [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] use. The opposing side also used (mostly British-made) Stens, particularly the irregular and semi-regular [[Arab Liberation Army]].<ref name=\"I\">{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Benny |authorlink=Benny Morris |title=1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-300-12696-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/1948historyoffir00morr }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s [[List of British weapon L numbers|\"L numbering\"]] came into use in the [[British Army]] for weapons\u2014Stens were then known as L50 (Mk II), L51 (Mk III) and L52 (Mk V).\n\nOne of the last times the Sten was used in combat during British service was with the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] during the [[Border Campaign (IRA)|IRA border campaign]] of 1956\u20131962. In foreign service, the Sten was used in combat at least as recently as the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].\n\nIn 1971 various marks of Stens were used by guerilla fighters during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].\n\nA number of [[suppressor|suppressed]] Stens were in limited use by the US [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] during the [[Vietnam war]], including c. 1971, by the [[United States Army Rangers]].<ref name=\"SSs\">{{cite web |url=http://25thaviation.org/history/id908.htm |title=The Vietnam Experience LRRP 1966-1972 |publisher=25thaviation.org |date= |accessdate=9 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, Indian prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]] was [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassinated]] by two of her bodyguards, [[Satwant Singh|one]] of whom fired the entire magazine (30 bullets) of his Sten at point-blank range, of which 27 hit her.\n\nIn the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]], both nationalists and communists used the Sten.

Stens in Finnish service saw limited usage by conscripts (notably [[combat swimmer]]s) and were mostly stockpiled for use in a future mobilization.\n\nDuring the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] movement in 1994 some Zapatista soldiers were armed with Sten guns.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oppenheimer |first=Andr\u00e9s |author-link=Andr\u00e9s Oppenheimer |date=8 February 1994 |title=Deep in the heart of Mayan Mexico, a revolution that's out of this world |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=348&dat=19940802&id=fBMwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CzMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5838,267677 |newspaper=[[Rome News-Tribune]] |location=[[Rome, Georgia|Rome, Georgia, USA]] |accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

London: [[Her Majesty's Stationery Office|His Majesty's Stationery Office]]. Some sources give J.J.Turpin rather than Harold</ref>\nOver four million Stens in various versions were made in the 1940s.\n\n==History==\nThe Sten emerged while Britain was engaged in the [[Battle of Britain]], facing invasion by Germany. The army was forced to replace weapons lost during the evacuation from [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]] while expanding at the same time. Prior to 1941 (and even later) the British were purchasing all the [[Thompson submachine gun]]s they could from the United States, but these did not meet demand. American entry into the war at the end of 1941 placed an even bigger demand on the facilities making Thompsons. In order to rapidly equip a sufficient fighting force to counter the Axis threat, the [[Royal Small Arms Factory]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], was commissioned to produce an alternative.\n\nThe credited designers were Major R. V. Shepherd, [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], Inspector of Armaments in the [[Ministry of Supply (UK)|Ministry of Supply]] Design Department at The [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]], (later Assistant Chief Superintendent at the Armaments Design Department) and Mr. Harold John Turpin, Senior [[technical drawing|Draughtsman]] of the Design Department of the [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] (RSAF), Enfield. Shepherd had been recalled to service after having retired and spending some time at the Birmingham Small Arms Company ([[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]]).\n\nThe Sten shared design features, such as its side-mounted magazine configuration, with the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Lanchester submachine gun]], which was a copy of the German [[MP 18|MP28]]. In terms of manufacture, the Lanchester was entirely different, being made of high-quality materials with pre-war fit and finish, in stark contrast to the Sten's austere execution. The Lanchester and Sten magazines were even interchangeable (though the Lanchester's magazine was longer with a 50-round capacity, compared to the Sten's 32-round capacity).\n\nThe Sten used simple stamped metal components and minor welding, which required minimal machining and manufacturing. Much of the production could be performed by small workshops, with the firearms assembled at the Enfield site. Over the period of manufacture the Sten design was further simplified: the most basic model, the Mark III, could be produced from five man-hours of work. Some of the cheapest versions were made from only 47 different parts. It was distinctive for its bare appearance (just a pipe with a metal loop for a stock), and its horizontal magazine. The Mark I was a more finely finished weapon with a wooden foregrip and handle; later versions were generally more spartan, although the final version, the Mark V, which was produced after the threat of invasion had died down, was produced to a higher standard.\n\nThe Sten has been described by [[Max Hastings]] as: \"highly unreliable, prone to jamming, and inaccurate beyond 30 metres. It was unsuitable for guerrilla operations in open country because it encouraged waste of ammunition. But it was easy and cheap to produce, a gun was said to cost fifteen shillings (three quarters of a pound), and was supplied to the (French) Resistance in huge quantities\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hastings |authorlink=Max Hastings |first=Max |title=Das Reich: The March of the 2nd SS Panzer Division through France, June 1944 |edition=2 |origyear=1981 |year=2013 |publisher=Zenith Press |location=Minneapolis, USA |isbn=978-0-7603-4491-0 |page=237}}</ref>\n\nThe Sten underwent various design improvements over the course of the war. For example, the Mark 4 cocking handle and corresponding hole drilled in the receiver were created to lock the bolt in the closed position to reduce the likelihood of accidental discharges inherent in the design. Most changes to the production process were more subtle, designed to give greater ease of manufacture and increased reliability. Build quality ranged from quite good (Canadian production) to poor (early British production.) Sten guns of late 1942 and beyond were, in general, highly effective weapons, though complaints of accidental discharge continued throughout the war.\n\nThe Sten was replaced by the [[Sterling submachine gun]] from 1953 and was gradually withdrawn from British service in the 1960s. The other Commonwealth nations made or adopted their own replacements.\n\n==Design==\nThe Sten was a [[Blowback (firearms)|blowback-operated]] submachine gun firing from an [[open bolt]] with a fixed firing pin on the face of the bolt. This means the bolt remains to the rear when the weapon is cocked, and on pulling the trigger the bolt moves forward under spring pressure, stripping the round from the magazine, chambering it and firing the weapon all in the same movement. There is no breech locking mechanism, the rearward movement of the bolt caused by the recoil impulse is arrested only by the mainspring and the bolt's inertia. The basic operating principles were similar to those of the German [[MP40]], Russian [[PPSh-41]], US [[M3 submachine gun]] and numerous other designs. These shared similar attributes and faults; they were simple and cheap to manufacture, and put an automatic weapon into the hands of soldiers, greatly increasing the short-range firepower of the infantry, especially when the main infantry weapon was a [[bolt-action rifle]] capable of only around 15 rounds per minute and not suited for short-range combat. However, the open-bolt firing mechanism, short barrel, and use of pistol ammunition severely restricted accuracy, with an effective range of around 100m.\n\nStoppages could occur for a variety of reasons: some as a result of poor maintenance, while others were particular to the Sten. Carbon buildup on the face of the breech<ref>Carbine, Machine, STEN 9mm Mk II, ''General Instructions'', (February 1942) [http://ferret-afv.org/manuals/sten_mk_2_users_manual.pdf Manual]: Heavy carbon buildup could prevent the firing pin from detonating the primer.</ref> or debris in the bolt raceway could cause a failure to fire, while a dirty chamber could cause a failure to feed.<ref name=\"Carbine, Machine 1942\">Carbine, Machine, STEN 9mm Mk II, ''General Instructions'', (February 1942)</ref> Firing the Sten by grasping the magazine with the supporting hand tended to wear the magazine catch, altering the angle of feed and causing a failure to feed \u2013 the correct method of holding the weapon was as with a rifle, the left hand cradling the fore piece, as per the picture of [[Winston Churchill]] firing one below.\n\nAdditional problems stemmed from the Sten's magazine, which was a direct copy of the one used in the German MP-38, originally in order to facilitate the use of German 9&nbsp;mm magazines.<ref>Dunlap, Roy F., ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 80</ref> Unfortunately, this decision necessarily incorporated the Erma magazine's faults in the process. The magazine had two columns of 9&nbsp;mm cartridges in a staggered arrangement, merging at the top to form a single column. While other staggered magazines, such as the Thompson, fed from both the left and right side alternately (double-column, double feed), the Sten magazine, like the MP38, required the cartridges to gradually merge at the top of the magazine to form a single column (double column, single feed). As a consequence, any dirt or foreign matter in this taper area could cause feed [[Firearm malfunction|malfunctions]]. Additionally, the walls of the magazine lip had to endure the full stresses of the rounds being pushed in by the spring. This, along with rough handling could result in deformation of the magazine lips (which required a precise 8\u00b0 feed angle to operate), resulting in misfeeding and a failure to fire.\n\nModern 9&nbsp;mm magazines, such as those used by the [[Sterling SMG]], are curved and feed both sides to avoid this problem. If a Sten failed to feed due to jammed cartridges in the magazine, standard practice to clear it was as follows: remove magazine from Sten, tap the base of the magazine against the knee, re-insert magazine in Sten, then recocking the weapon and firing again as normal.<ref name=\"Carbine, Machine 1942\" /> To facilitate easier loading when attempting to push the cartridges down to insert the next one, a magazine filler tool was developed and formed part of the weapon's kit.\n\nThe slot on the side of the body where the cocking knob ran was also a target of criticism, as the long opening could allow foreign objects to enter. On the other hand, a beneficial side-effect of the Sten's [[minimalist]] design was that it would fire without any lubrication.<ref name=\"Carbine, Machine 1942\"/> This proved useful in desert environments such as the [[Western Desert Campaign]], where lubricating oil retained dust and sand.\n\nThe open bolt design combined with cheap manufacture and rudimentary safety devices also meant the weapon was prone to accidental discharges, which proved hazardous. A simple safety could be engaged while the bolt was in the rearwards (cocked) position. However, if a Sten with a loaded magazine, with the bolt in the closed position, was dropped or the butt was knocked against the ground, the bolt could move far enough rearward to pick up a round (but not far enough to be engaged by the trigger mechanism) and the spring pressure could be enough to chamber and fire the round. The Mk 4 cocking handle was designed to prevent this by enabling the bolt to be locked in its forward position, thereby immobilising it. Wear and manufacturing tolerances could render these safety devices ineffective.\n\n==Variants==\nSten guns were produced in several basic marks (though the Mk I saw limited service, and the Mk IV was never issued), and nearly half of the total produced were Mark II versions. Approximately 4.5 million Stens were produced during the second world war.\n\n===Mark I===\nThe first ever Mk I Sten gun (number 'T-40/1' indicating its originator Harold Turpin, the year 1940 and the serial number \"1\") was handmade by Turpin at the Philco Radio works at [[Perivale]], [[Middlesex]] during December 1940/January 1941. This particular weapon is held by the historical weapons collection of the [[British Army]]'s Infantry and [[Small Arms School Corps]] in [[Warminster]], [[Wiltshire]].<ref>{{cite web |author=D Cuthbertson |url=http://infantry-weapons.org/smg_lmgs.htm |title=infantry-weapons.org |publisher=infantry-weapons.org |accessdate=9 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522121134/http://infantry-weapons.org/smg_lmgs.htm |archivedate=22 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe first model had a conical [[flash hider]] and fine finish. It had a wooden foregrip and forward handle (sometimes this was made of steel), as well for a section of the stock. The stock was a small tube outline, rather like the Mark II Canadian. One unique feature was that the front pistol grip could be rotated forward to make the firearm easier to stow. The barrel sleeve extended all the way to the end, where it met the flash hider. Along the top of the tube surrounding the barrel was a line of small holes and its sights were configured somewhat differently. About 100,000 were made before production switched to the Mark II. Sten Mk I's in German possession were designated MP 748(e), the 'e' standing for ''englisch''.\n\n===Mark I*===\nThis was the first simplification of the Mk I. The foregrip, the wooden furniture and the flash hider were removed for production expediency.<ref>{{cite book |last=Skennerton |first=Ian\n|title=British Small Arms of World War 2: The Complete Reference Guide to Weapons, Codes and Contracts, 1936-1946. |publisher=Greenhill Books |date=September 1988 |page=32 |isbn=978-0-949749-09-3}}</ref>\n\n===Mark II===\nThe Mark II was the most common variant, with two million units produced. It was a much rougher weapon than the Mk I. The flash eliminator and the folding handle (the grip) of the Mk I were omitted. A removable barrel was now provided which projected {{convert|3|in|mm}} beyond the barrel sleeve. Also, a special catch allowed the magazine to be slid partly out of the magazine housing and the housing rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (from the operator's perspective), together covering the ejection opening and allowing the weapon and magazine both to lie flat on its side.[[File:Winston Churchill As Prime Minister 1940-45 H10688.jpg|thumb|[[Winston Churchill]] with a Sten Mk II in [[Shoeburyness]] on 13 June 1941.]] The barrel sleeve was shorter and rather than having small holes on the top, it had three sets of three holes equally spaced on the shroud. To allow a soldier to hold a Sten by the hot barrel sleeve with the supporting hand, an insulating lace-on leather sleeve guard was sometimes issued.<ref>The barrel sleeve was generally considered the proper place for the supporting hand, as holding the weapon by its magazine could sometimes initiate a feed malfunction. However, the metal barrel sleeve heated rapidly after only a few bursts.</ref> Sten Mk II's in German possession were designated MP 749(e), the \"e\" signifying \"englisch\". Some Mk IIs were fitted with a wooden stock as this part was desirable and interchangeable with the Mk V. Also, the [[Wimmersperg Spz-kr|Spz-kr assault rifle]] uses the receiver and components from the Sten Mk II.\n\nRegular Mark II:\n* Overall length: {{convert|762|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Barrel length: {{convert|197|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Weight: {{convert|3.2|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n\n===Mark II (Canadian)===\nDuring [[World War II]] a version of the Sten gun was produced at the Long Branch Arsenal in [[Long Branch, Toronto|Long Branch, Ontario]] now part of [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]. This was very similar to the regular Mark II, with a different stock ('skeleton' type instead of strut type) and improved quality of manufacture. It was first used in combat in the [[Dieppe Raid]] in 1942.\n\nThe Mark II is made in China with a copy known as the M38.<ref name=\"SA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=4312|title=Stens of the World: Part I|author=|date=|website=Small Arms Defense Journal}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sten factory 1942.jpg|thumb|Worker posing with a Sten Mk II in the factory on 26 May 1942.]]\n[[File:Warszawskie, Krak\u00f3w, Poland - panoramio (162).jpg|thumb|A Sten Mk II held in the [[Armia Krajowa Museum in Krak\u00f3w|Polish Home Army Museum]], Krak\u00f3w, Poland.]]\nMark II:\n* Overall length: {{convert|896|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Barrel length: {{convert|198|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Weight: {{convert|3.8|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n\n===Mark III===\nThis simple design was the next most commonly produced after the Mark II. A result of the manufacturer [[Lines Bros Ltd]] stating it could build a modified design that was quicker and cheaper to build than the Mk II, it was a simplification of the Mk I made both in Canada and the UK. Lines Bros Ltd was the largest manufacturer. The biggest difference from the Mark II was the unification of the receiver, ejection port, and barrel shroud that now extended farther up the barrel. The barrel was fixed and the body was welded shut along the centre of the top. Captured Sten Mk IIIs in German possession were designated MP 750(e).\n\n===Mark V===\n[[File:British paratroopers in Oosterbeek.jpg|thumb|right|British paratroopers in [[Oosterbeek]] during [[Operation Market Garden]] armed with the Sten Mk V.]]\nIntroduced in 1944, the Mk V was essentially a better-quality, more elaborate version of the Mk 2. Changes included a wooden pistol grip, a vertical wooden fore grip, a wooden stock, and a bayonet mount. There was a No4 Lee\u2013Enfield foresight and the weapon was of better quality manufacture and finish than the Mk2 and Mk3. The Sten [[bandolier]] issued to paratroopers held seven full magazines.\n\nAnother variant of the Mk V had a swivel stock and rear sight mirror intended for firing around corners in urban warfare, similar to the [[Krummlauf]] developed by the Germans for the [[StG 44]].\n\n===Mark VI===\nSee suppressed models.\n* Overall length: {{convert|908|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Barrel length: {{convert|198|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n* Weight: {{convert|4.5|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n\n===Suppressed models===\n[[File:Smg sten MK IIS 01.jpg|thumb|Sten Mk IIS ([[suppressor|suppressed]])]]\n[[File:Smg sten Mk VI.jpg|thumb|Sten Mk VIS ([[suppressor|suppressed]])]]\n\nMk IIS and Mk VI models incorporated an integral [[suppressor]] (\"silencer\") and had a lower muzzle velocity than the others due to a ported barrel intended to reduce velocity to below the speed of sound; {{convert| 305|m/s|0|abbr=on}}. The suppressor heated up rapidly when the weapon was fired, and a canvas cover was laced around the suppressor for some protection for the firer's supporting hand.<ref>Wolfgang Michel: ''Britische Schalld\u00e4mpferwaffen 1939-1945: Entwicklung, Technik, Wirkung''. {{ISBN|978-3-8370-2149-3}}</ref>\n\n====Mk IIS====\nThe Mk IIS was, as the name suggests, a suppressed version of the Mk II. Captured examples of the Sten Mk IIS in German service were designated MP 751(e).\n\n====Mk VI====\nThe Mk VI (or '6') was a suppressed version of the Mk V. The Mk VI was the heaviest version due to the added weight of the suppressor, as well as using a wooden pistol grip and wooden stock.\n\nThe suppressed models were produced at the request of the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) for use on clandestine operations in occupied Europe, starting with the Mk IIS in 1943. Owing to their tendency to overheat, they were fired in short bursts or single shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://firearms.96.lt/pages/Silencedsten2.html|title=Silencedsten|author=|date=|work=96.lt}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to its use in the European Theatre, the Mk IIS saw service with clandestine units in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA) such as the [[Services Reconnaissance Department]] and SOE's [[Force 136]] on operations against Imperial Japanese forces. The Sten Mk IIS was used by the [[Operation Jaywick]] party during their raid into Japanese-occupied [[Singapore]] Harbour.\n\nThe Sten Mk IIS also saw service with the Australian Special Air Service (SAS) in Vietnam.\n\n===Experimental models===\n====Mark II (wooden butt model)====\nThis was a standard Sten Mk.II submachine gun with a wooden butt attached in place of the wireframe steel butt used with Mk.IIs. This wooden butt model was never put into service; it is likely that this was due to the cost of producing it.\n\n====Mark II (Rosciszewski model)====\nThis was a Sten Mk.II modified by Antoni Rosciszewski of Small Arms Ltd. The magazine was mechanically operated by the breech block movement. The trigger was split into two sections, with the upper part of the trigger offering full-auto fire and a lower part offering single shots. It was very complex in design and never fielded.\n\n====Mark II (pistol grip model)====\nThis was a Sten Mk.II with a wireframe pistol grip, intended for use with paratroopers. It was compact but predictably uncomfortable to fire.\n\n====Model T42====\nThis was a Sten Mk.II modified with a 5-inch barrel and folding stock, as well as a conventional pistol grip and redesigned trigger guard. It was dubbed the \"T42\" in prototype phases, but never entered service.\n\n====Mark III (wooden model)====\nThis was a Sten Mk.III with a \"Lanchester\" type wooden body and butt, and bayonet fittings. Sling swivels were also added. It never entered service due to the costs associated with producing it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====Mark III (wooden model II)====\nThis was a Sten Mk.III entirely encased in a wooden body, with the only external metal parts being the trigger, barrel, magazine and cocking handle. The trigger and pistol grip were in line with the magazine. The reasons for its creation are  likely an experiment into increasing the comfort and handling of the weapon in freezing temperatures.\n\n====Mark IV====\nThe [http://world.guns.ru/userfiles/images/smg/smg27/sten_mkIV.jpg Mark IV] was a smaller version which did not progress beyond the prototype stage. It was near pistol-sized and it had a different configuration with a conical flash hider, a rear pistol grip, a very light stock and a much shorter barrel.\n\n====Rofsten====\nDeveloped at the Royal Ordnance Factory at Fazakerley (ROF), the Rofsten was an odd Sten prototype with a redesigned magazine feed, ergonomic pistol grip, selector switch and cocking system. The weapon was cocked by pulling the small ring above the stock. A large flash eliminator was fixed onto the barrel, and a No.5 bayonet could be fixed. It was made to a very high quality standard and had an increased rate of fire (around 900 rounds per minute).\nThe Rofsten was made in 1944 as a single prototype and ROF wanted to submit it to trials the next year. Despite better quality there were numerous reliability problems due to the much higher rate of fire. The budget cuts prevented the modifications and this version never got beyond the prototype stage.\n\n===Foreign-built variants and post 1945 derivatives===\n====Argentine Sten====\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 38.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Modelo C.4 Sten gun.]]\nSten MkIIs were licence-copied in Argentina by [[Hispano-Argentina|Pistola Hispano Argentino]] and can be recognised with a wooden handguard in front of the trigger group.

Guzm\u00e1n, Las Armas Modernas de Infanter\u00eda, Abril de 1953.</ref> Another variant came with a pistol grip section based on the [[Ballester\u2013Molina|Ballester\u2013Molina .45 pistol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonasdecarvalho/albums/72157626242408185|title=Museo de armas de la Naci\u00f3n (Buenos Aires), 2011|author=|date=2011-01-21|work=flickr.com}}</ref>\n\n====Israeli Stens====\nCopies of the Sten Mk II and Sten Mk V were clandestinely manufactured in Tel Aviv and on various [[kibbutz]]im in 1945-48 for use with [[Haganah]] and other Jewish paramilitary groups.<ref name=\"SA\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30030075|title=Sten Mk 2 type submachine-gun [Jewish underground]|website=Imperial War Museums}}</ref>\n\n====French Sten====\nThe French \"Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne\" R5 Sten, manufactured by the motorbike and aeroplane engine manufacturer [[Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne]] (SNECMA), came with a forward pistol grip and distinctive wooden stock, although its greatest improvement was a sliding bolt safety, added to secure the bolt in its forward position.\n\nAnother variant made by MAC (Manufacture d\u2019armes de Ch\u00e2tellerault), were made and tested shortly after WWII. One variant had an unusual stock shape that proved detrimental to the firer's aim. Internally it was basically a Sten gun but had two triggers for semi/full auto, a grip safety and a foregrip that used MP40 magazines. Another had a folding stock with a folding magazine insert. The trigger mechanism was complicated and unusual. Neither of these prototypes had any kind of success and MAC closed its doors not long after their conception. The French were not short of SMGs after the war; they had some 3,750 Thompsons and Stens, as well as MAS 38s.\n\n====Norwegian Sten====\nIn German-occupied Norway the resistance, under the leadership of [[Bror With]], created a large number of Sten guns from scratch, mainly to equip members of the underground army ''[[Milorg]]''. In his autobiography, Norwegian resistance fighter [[Max Manus]] frequently mentions the Sten<ref>Manus, Max, ''Part I, Det vil helst g\u00e5 godt'' (It'd best be all right); ''Part II, Det blir alvor'' (It gets serious), Familieforlaget (1946), {{ISBN|978-82-8214-043-0}}</ref> as one of the weapons his groups of commandos and resistance fighters used effectively against German troops.\n\n====Danish Sten====\nSeveral groups in the Danish resistance movement manufactured Sten guns for their own use. [[BOPA]] produced around 200 in a bicycle repair shop on Gammel K\u00f8ge landevej (Old K\u00f8ge road), south of Copenhagen. [[Holger Danske (resistance group)|Holger Danske]] produced about 150 in workshops in Copenhagen, while employees of the construction company [[MT H\u00f8jgaard|Monberg & Thorsen]] built approximately 200\u2013300 in what is now the municipality of [[Gladsaxe]] (a suburb of Copenhagen) for use by Holger Danske and others. The resistance groups 'Frit Danmark' and 'Ringen' also built significant numbers of Stens.\n\n====Polish Sten====\n{{see also|B\u0142yskawica submachine gun}}\n[[File:B\u0142yskawica and other insurgent weapons.jpg|thumb|right|B\u0142yskawica and Polish Sten on display in the [[Warsaw Uprising Museum]]]]\nThe Polish resistance was provided with numerous Stens of various models by the SOE and the [[Cichociemni]]. Between 1942 and 1944, approximately 11,000 Sten Mk IIs were delivered to the ''[[Armia Krajowa]]''. Due to the simplicity of design, local production of Sten variants was started in at least 23 underground workshops in Poland. Some of them produced copies of Mark IIs, while others produced the so-called ''Polski Sten'' and ''[[KIS (weapon)|KIS]]''. The Polski Stens made in Warsaw under the command of [[Ryszard Bia\u0142ostocki]] were built from a number of \"legal\" elements made in official factories or acquired through other means. The main body of the machine pistol was made from hydraulic cylinders produced for hospital equipment. All the machine pistols were marked in English to disguise their origin. Stens' barrels were also used for SMGs produced in Poland under the name [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]].\n\n====Belgian Sten MkII====\n[[File:Belgian Sten Gun .jpg|thumb|upright|Details of magazine well stamping on Belgian Sten]]\n\nA little known version of the MkII Sten was built in Belgium by ''l'arsenale militare belga'' (the Belgian military arsenal).  The magazine well was stamped AsArm (the manufacturer),  ABL (for Arm\u00e9e Belge Belgisch Leger), the Belgian Royal Crown and a serial number of typically five figure with no letter prefix.  It is believed the Belgian built Mk II Stens remained in ABL service until the early 1980s, particularly with helicopter-borne forces.  Some of the weapons had a \"Parkerised\" finish.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====Ger\u00e4t Potsdam====\nIn late 1944, the [[Mauser]] works in Germany secretly started manufacturing copies of the Mk II Sten. These weapons were intended to duplicate the British original as closely as possible, including the markings. The series was referred to as the ''Ger\u00e4t Potsdam'' (Potsdam Device){{sfn|Smith|1969|p=429}} and approximately 28,000 weapons were made \u2013 even though the Germans had ample stocks of captured original Stens available.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====German MP 3008====\n[[File:MP 3008 Sub Machine Gun.jpg|right|275px|thumb|MP 3008 copy]]\nLate in the war Germany was seeking a cheap version of the [[MP40]] machine pistol for the ''[[Volkssturm]]''. For that purpose a modified Sten was designed by [[Mauser]] and named the [[MP 3008]].{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=429}} The main difference was the magazine attached below the weapon. Altogether, roughly 10,000 were produced in early 1945, just before the end of [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====[[Austen_submachine_gun|Austen]] submachine gun====\nThe '''Mark I Austen''' (from \"'''Au'''stralian '''Sten'''\") was a 9mm Australian submachine gun derived from the British Sten gun developed during the [[Second World War]] by the [[Lithgow Small Arms Factory]]. It externally resembled the Sten but had twin pistol grips and folding stock resembling those of the German [[MP40]].<ref name=\"Smith198\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Joseph E.|title=Small Arms of the World|edition =11|location=Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|publisher= The Stackpole Company|year=1969|ref=harv}}</ref> A Mk 2 version was also produced which was of different appearance and which made more use of die-cast components.{{sfn|Smith|1969|p=200}} 20,000 Austens were made during the war and the Austen was replaced by the [[F1 submachine gun]] in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Smith198\"/>\n\n====Imperia submachine gun====\nAfter the Second World War the Belgian Army was mainly equipped with a mixture of British and American submachine guns. The army, wanting to replace them with a modern and preferably native design, tested various designs with the [[Vigneron submachine gun|Vigneron M2]] and licence-produced [[Uzi|FN Uzi]] being selected. However, the Imperia was an improved Sten with a fire selector and retractable stock.\n\n====Sputter Gun====\nA short-lived American invention developed in the 1980s, the [[Sputter Gun]] was designed to circumvent [[National Firearms Act|the law]] that defined a [[machine gun]] as something that fired multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. The Sputter Gun had no trigger, but fired continuously after loading and the pulling back of its bolt, firing until it ran out of ammunition. The gun was very short lived as the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] quickly reclassified it.\n\n====Halcon ML-57====\nThe [[Halcon ML-57]] was a simpler derivative of the Sten gun of Argentine origin that was fed from a vertically inserted magazine.\n\n====International Ordnance MP2====\nDuring the 1970s-1980s, International Ordnance of San Antonio, Texas, United States released the MP2 machine pistol. It was intended as a more compact, simpler derivative of the British Sten gun to be used in urban guerrilla actions, to be manufactured cheaply and/or in less-than-well-equipped workshops and distributed to \"friendly\" undercover forces. Much like the [[FP-45 Liberator]] pistol of World War II, it could be discarded during an escape with no substantial loss for the force's arsenal. The MP2 is a blowback-operated weapon that fires from an open bolt with an extremely high rate of fire.\n\n====Cellini Dunn SM-9====\nThe [[SM-9]] is a machine pistol of Guatemalan origin and manufactured by Cellini-Dunn IMG, Military Research Corp and Wildfire Munitions as the SM-90. It is blowback operated, firing from an open bolt and can use magazines from Ingram [[MAC-10]] submachine guns inserted into a similar foregrip that can be rotated 45 and 90 degrees for left/right handed operators. The layout of the receiver is somewhat simpler than that of a Sten with its internal components light in weight enabling a very high rate of fire of 1200rpm. Its forward pistol grip can hold a spare magazine as well as handling the weapon when firing.\n\n====Pleter 91====\nThe [[Pleter 91 submachine gun|Pleter submachine gun]] was created in 1991 when the breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in the midst of emerging war left the newly formed Republic of Croatia with small number of military firearms. Since the [[embargo]] prevented the Croatian military from legally buying them on open market (so they were mostly obtained on the world black market, but with significantly higher price and sometimes of questionable quality), to fulfill the immediate need for arms, they tried to resort on quick and simple locally made designs.\n\nDespite having a vertical magazine well (designed to accept 32-round double-feed direct copy of [[UZI]] magazine, rather than original single-feed Sten-type magazine), analogies with the Sten include a striking resemblance in the barrel assembly and in the bolt and recoil spring. In addition, this gun also fires from an open bolt, and is further simplified by removing fire mode selector or any safety.\n\n====SaskSten====\nSMG International in Canada manufactured reproductions of the Sten in six variants.{{When|date=June 2016}} They made copies of the Sten's Mk 1*, Mk II and Mk III, a \"New Zealand Sten\" (a Mk II/III Sten hybrid, with sights and a fixed magazine housing similar to the Mk III), then branched out into \"hypothetical\" Sten-guns with a \"Rotary Magazine Sten\" (a Mk II Sten with a drum magazine attached below the weapon and wooden horizontal forward grip on the left side of the weapon) and the \"FRT Gun\" (a long barrel Sten with a wooden or Mk 1* type butt stock, a drum magazine attached below the weapon and sliding ramp rear sights). These last two being obviously not Sten reproductions, especially if they included a drum magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smginternational.net/Products/FireArms/Sten/ProdFrtGunStenSuomi.html |title=SMG International Sten SaskSten FRT Gun |date=29 November 2010 |work=archive.org |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129115125/http://www.smginternational.net/Products/FireArms/Sten/ProdFrtGunStenSuomi.html |archivedate=29 November 2010 }}</ref>  The \"Rotary Magazine Sten\" is a vertically fed Sten which uses a modified Sten bolt, which can use either PPSh drum magazines or stick magazines. The FRT gun is essentially a Suomi that uses a Sten trigger mechanism.  All SaskSten guns fire from an open bolt.<ref>Mick Boon</ref>\n\n==Service==\nThe Sten, especially the Mark II, tended to attract affection and loathing in equal measure. Its peculiar appearance when compared to other firearms of the era, combined with sometimes questionable reliability made it unpopular with some front-line troops.<ref>Weeks, John, ''World War II Small Arms'', Galahad Books (1979), {{ISBN|0-88365-403-2}}, p. 84</ref> It gained nicknames such as \"Plumber's Nightmare\", \"Plumber's Abortion\", or \"Stench Gun\". The Sten's advantage was its ease of mass-production manufacture in a time of shortage during a major conflict.\n\nMade by a variety of manufacturers, often with subcontracted parts, some early Sten guns were made poorly and/or not made to specification, and could malfunction in operation, sometimes in combat.<ref name=\"Willbanks, James H. 2004 p. 91\">Willbanks, James H., ''Machine Guns: An Illustrated History of Their Impact'', ABC-CLIO Press (2004), {{ISBN|1-85109-480-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85109-480-6}}, p. 91</ref> The double-column, single-feed magazine copied from the German MP28 was never completely satisfactory, and hasty manufacturing processes often exacerbated misfeed problems inherent in the design. A common statement heard from British forces at the time was that the Sten was made \"by [[Marks and Spencer]] out of Woolworth.\"<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 p. 208-209\">Shore, C. (Capt), ''With British Snipers to the Reich'', Paladin Press (1988), p. 208-209</ref> British and Commonwealth forces in the early years of the war often extensively test-fired their weapons in training to weed out bad examples; a last-minute issue of newly manufactured Stens prior to going into action was not always welcomed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe MK II and MK III Stens were regarded by many soldiers as very temperamental, and could [[accidental discharge|accidentally discharge]] if dropped or even laid on the ground whilst the gun was cocked.<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 p. 208-209\"/> Others would fire full-automatic when placed on 'single', or fire single shots when placed on 'automatic'.<ref name=\"Shore, C. 1988 p. 208-209\"/> This was particularly true of early Stens using [[bronze]] bolts, where the sear projection underneath the bolt could wear down more easily than ones made of [[Case-hardening|case-hardened]] steel.\n\nStens could jam at inopportune moments. One of the more notable instances of this was the assassination of [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] [[Reinhard Heydrich]] on 27 May 1942, when a Czechoslovak soldier \u2013 Warrant Officer [[Jozef Gab\u010d\u00edk]] \u2013 fired his Sten point blank at Heydrich, only to have it misfire. His comrade [[Jan Kubi\u0161]] then hastily tossed a grenade, which mortally wounded Heydrich.<ref name=\"Willbanks, James H. 2004 p. 91\"/> There are other accounts of the Sten's unreliability, some of them true, some exaggerated and some which are [[apocryphal]].

In addition to regular British and Commonwealth military service, Stens were air-dropped in quantity to [[Resistance movement|resistance]] fighters and partisans throughout occupied Europe. Due to their slim profile and ease of disassembly/reassembly, they were good for concealment and [[guerrilla warfare]]. Wrapping the barrel in wet rags would  delay undesirable overheating of the barrel.<ref name=\"Dear, I.\">Dear, I. ''Sabotage and Subversion: The SOE and OSS at War'', Arms and Armour (1996) p. 137\u2013155</ref> Guerrilla fighters in Europe became adept at repairing, modifying and eventually scratch-building clones of the Sten (over 2,000 Stens and about 500 of the similar [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica SMGs]] were manufactured in occupied Poland).\n\n[[File:American officer and French partisan crouch behind an auto during a street fight in a French city. - NARA - 531322.tif|thumb|Staged photograph: A [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] armed with Sten Mk II SMG, France, 1944.]]\nCanadian infantry battalions in northwest Europe retained spare Sten guns for special missions and the Canadian Army reported a surplus of the weapons in 1944.\nThe Sten saw use even after the economic crunch of [[World War II]], replacing the Royal Navy's [[Lanchester SMG|Lanchester]] submachine guns into the 1960s, and was used in the [[Korean War]], including specialist versions for [[British Commando]]s. It was slowly withdrawn from British Army service in the 1960s and replaced by the [[Sterling SMG]]; Canada also phased out Sten, replacing it with the [[C1 SMG]].\n\nThe Sten was one of the few weapons that the [[Israel|State of Israel]] could produce domestically during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. Even before the declaration of the State of Israel, the [[Yishuv]] had been producing Stens for the [[Haganah]]; after the declaration, Israel continued making Stens for [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] use. The opposing side also used (mostly British-made) Stens, particularly the irregular and semi-regular [[Arab Liberation Army]].<ref name=\"I\">{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Benny |authorlink=Benny Morris |title=1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-300-12696-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/1948historyoffir00morr }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s [[List of British weapon L numbers|\"L numbering\"]] came into use in the [[British Army]] for weapons\u2014Stens were then known as L50 (Mk II), L51 (Mk III) and L52 (Mk V).\n\nOne of the last times the Sten was used in combat during British service was with the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] during the [[Border Campaign (IRA)|IRA border campaign]] of 1956\u20131962. In foreign service, the Sten was used in combat at least as recently as the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].\n\nIn 1971 various marks of Stens were used by guerilla fighters during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].\n\nA number of [[suppressor|suppressed]] Stens were in limited use by the US [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] during the [[Vietnam war]], including c. 1971, by the [[United States Army Rangers]].<ref name=\"SSs\">{{cite web |url=http://25thaviation.org/history/id908.htm |title=The Vietnam Experience LRRP 1966-1972 |publisher=25thaviation.org |date= |accessdate=9 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, Indian prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]] was [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassinated]] by two of her bodyguards, [[Satwant Singh|one]] of whom fired the entire magazine (30 bullets) of his Sten at point-blank range, of which 27 hit her.\n\nIn the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]], both nationalists and communists used the Sten. Some Stens were converted by the communists to 7.62\u00d725mm<ref name=\"SA\"/> by using the magazine housing from a [[PPS submachine gun|PPS]] to accept curved PPS magazines. British, Canadian, and Chinese Stens were seen in the hands of the communists during the Korean and Vietnam Wars.<ref name=\"SA\"/>\n\nThe [[Finnish Defence Forces|Finnish Army]] acquired moderate numbers of Stens in the late 1950s, mainly Mk.
