The city is located some {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northeast of [[Baghdad]], on the [[Diyala River]]. In 2003 it had an estimated population of some 467,900 people.\n \nBaqubah served as a [[Stopover|way station]] between Baghdad and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] on the medieval [[Khorasan Road]]. During the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], it was known for its date and fruit orchards, irrigated by the [[Nahrawan Canal]]. Situated on the main road and rail routes between Baghdad and Iran it is a centre of trade for agricultural produce. It is now known as the centre of Iraq's commercial orange groves.\n\n==Lingering legacy of [[Baath Party]] and [[Saddam Hussein]]==\nAlong with the city of [[Fallujah]], Baqubah is glaring for holding on to the monuments and mosques named after some of the most hated and crime-implicated officers of the [[Baath Party]] and their murderess acts. For example, still today, a large mosque named after [[Adnan Khairallah]] is found in the city. There is also an [[Izzat Ibrahim]] mosque in Baqubah (and another one in its satellite town of [[Buhriz]]), named likewise after a high officer of Saddam Hussein, who resurface in 2014 to become one of the founders of [[ISIS]] terrorists. To add insult to injury, Baqubah also host a mosque named the Anfal mosque, brazenly commemorating the code name [[Anfal Campaign]] used for the mass killing of the [[Kurds]] under the supervision of Adnan Khairallah.  These like other [[Baath Party]] related names and entities, are thorns in the side of the Iraqi [[Shia]] and [[Kurds]] who lost so many lives to the abuses of the [[Baath Party]], [[Saddam Hussein]] and military/security figures like Adnan Khairallah and Izzat Ibrahim.\n\n==Demography and ethnography==\nDemographic composition of Baqubah has been a shifting phenomenon since the independence of Iraq. Under [[Saddam Hussein]] rule, the Shia population of the city\u2014[[Persians]], [[Faili Kurds]] and [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkomans]] were deported to Iran, allowing the city to gain a near-totality in Sunni Arab composition. Consequently, the city served as a springboard for violence against the Shias in Baghdad and others, from 2003\u20132008 (see below for chronological detail). Then in 2014, it became a seat for the [[ISIS]] terrorists, raining violence against the [[Shia]] population once again. Following these events, the Iraqi Shia militias such as the [[Kata'ib Hezbollah]], have exacted revenge on the Sunni population of the city and the countryside around it alike. A stream of Shia settlers are arriving (or being directed to) settle in Baqubah and the neighborhood, in order to avoid a future repeat of the same by the Sunni majority. Both the western and eastern halves of the city straddling the [[Diyala River]] have now obtained large and grow Shia minorities, with the eastern half outpacing the other in this respect.\n\n==History==\nBaqubah's name originates from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] words \"Bet\" (house) and \"Yaqub\" (Jacob) and means \"Jacob's house\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baqubah.htm|title=Ba?qubah [Baqubah]|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=May 10, 2016}}</ref> The city was used as a refugee camp for [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] refugees fleeing the [[Assyrian Genocide]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ba'qubah|publisher=Global Security|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baqubah.htm|accessdate=2009-09-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902223538/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baqubah.htm|archivedate=September 2, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> A refugee camp was set up outside the city, which accommodated between 40,000 and 50,000 refugees.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Baqubah Refugee Camp: An Account of Work on Behalf of the Persecuted Assyrian Christians|publisher=Georgias Press |last=Austin |first=H.

Although the main road heading east to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] from [[Baghdad]] bypassed Baqubah during this period, passing instead through the city of Jisr Nahrawan, it was Baqubah and not Jisr Nahrawan that was the capital of the Upper Nahrawan district.<ref>Le Strange (1905), p.59</ref>\n\nHowever, the succeeding [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] sultans neglected to [[dredging|dredge]] the Nahrawan canal or otherwise maintain it, and by the time of [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] in the early 1200s, the canal had completely silted up and the lands it had once watered had gone out of cultivation.<ref>Le Strange (1905), pp.59\u201360</ref> By the 14th century, [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] wrote that Jisr Nahrawan was in ruins, and the road to Khorasan now passed through Baqubah instead. Baqubah was the main town in the ''Tar\u00eeq-i-Khur\u00e2s\u00e2n'' district, and it was surrounded by fertile orchards that produced large crops of [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s and [[pomelo]]s.<ref>Le Strange (1905), p.61</ref>\n\nIn Yaqut's time, Baqubah was a flourishing town, with several public baths and mosques, as well as a market. The land around Baqubah was densely covered in irrigated orchards, whose dates and lemons were proverbial for their excellence. <ref>Adams (1965), p.94-96</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\nIn the early 1800s, Baqubah was surrounded by date palm groves, as well as orchards producing lemons, pomegranates, and other fruits.<ref>Adams (1965), p.94-96</ref> In 1820, Baqubah is described as being home to 2,000 people, of whom almost half were [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]]. It had a [[Bazaar|bazaar]] and two small mosques.<ref>Buckingham, J.S. (1830). 1:15. ''Travels in Assyria, Media, and Persia'. 2 volumes. London.'</ref>\n\nIn the early 1820s, though, the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] army of [[Mohammad Ali Mirza]], governor of [[Kermanshah]], occupied Baqubah and destroyed much of it. A decade later, it was still in ruins. By 1845, the bazaar and one of the mosques were functioning again, and local agriculture was flourishing. By the early 1870s, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] civil administration had managed to restore stability to the region, and Baqubah became increasingly prosperous.<ref>Adams (1965), p.94-96</ref> Around the turn of the century, one European traveler described its connections to emerging networks of world commerce:\n\n{{Quote|text=The heart of the town is formed by a small bazaar with many fruits and vegetables, American coffee, Indian tea, French sugar and English textiles, in addition to the usual native products. But the bazaar is surrounded by a wide district of expansive gardens with characteristic gate-cottages, and at the eastern exit from the town there is a large and handsome [[caravansary]] that is full of Shi'ite pilgrims almost throughout the year.<ref>Herzfeld, E.

Elements from 3 BDE / 1 ID including (but not limited to) 2nd and 4th Platoon / A Co / TF 2\u20132 IN / 3 BDE / 1 ID, 3rd platoon A Co TF 2\u201363 AR / 3 BDE / 1 ID and TF 1\u20136 FA / 3 BDE / 1 ID engage enemy forces for approximately three days straight. Fighting peaked during the daylight hours and tapered off to a stop during nighttime. On the second day of fighting (June 18, 2004) an element consisting of 2nd Platoon / A Co / TF 2\u20132 IN / 3 BDE / 1 ID, 3rd Platoon / A Co / TF 2\u201363 AR / 3 BDE / 1 ID, and TF 1\u20136 FA / 3 BDE / 1 ID are credited with killing 26 enemy combatants. The commander of 3 BDE / 1 ID, COL Dana J. H. Pittard alerted the governor of Diyala province that if fighting continued a fourth day (on the 20th of June 2004) that a Brigade-sized operation would be conducted to clear the suburb of Burhiz in a house-to-house fashion (similar in execution but smaller in scope to the later conducted Operation Phantom Fury in which Falujah was cleared of enemy personnel in November 2004). Respective units were alerted and a final draft of the operation had been disseminated to all participants when the fighting stopped. Much of the fighting that took place between the June 17 and 19 could be characterized by lightly armed squad-sized or smaller enemy elements conducting uncoordinated frontal assaults on American strong-points and heavy armored vehicles. The enemy primarily attacked the western side of the American position. Occasional 60mm mortar fire was directed on American forces by insurgent forces, however the effect of the fire was negligible and only served to be harassing as it wasn't coordinated in any fashion with other enemy assaults.\n* June 24, 2004: Insurgents establish a series of blocking positions and strong points along the major routes of travel through the city prior to 0500 local time. An American Mechanized Infantry Platoon consisting of four Bradley Fighting Vehicles (BFV) and its complement of dismounted Infantry conducting a routine patrol just before sunrise comes under direct fire while passing the first identified enemy position located in the northwest corner of the city. The platoon pushes through the fire and continues south, reaches a second enemy strong point identified vicinity the civic center adjacent to the Mufrak traffic circle where it is fired on again. The platoon continued east towards the bridge spanning the Diyala river located roughly in the center of the city. Upon reaching the eastern side of the city, the platoon comes under fire again from a third enemy strong point located vicinity the stadium and university campus located on the far eastern side of the city. The patrol, after passing through this position, reaches American operated Forward Operating Base (FOB) Gabe. Shortly thereafter, a second patrol launched from FOB Warhorse (located a few kilometres to the northwest of Baqubah) is launched to assess the viability of the enemy positions. This unit (4th platoon / A Company / TF 2\u20132 / 3 BDE / 1 ID) led by 1LT Gregory followed the same route as the first patrol that passed through the city and was attacked at the same locations. In response to the operating in semi-permanent defensive positions, the city was effectively divided into two sectors with the Diyala river serving as the dividing point. TF 2\u201363 AR / 3 BDE / 1 ID was given responsibility to clear enemy personnel on the western side of the city and TF 1\u20136 FA / 3 BDE / 1 ID was given responsibility to clear the eastern side of the city. Each of the respective battalions launched a company-sized element into their respective sectors. TF 1\u20136 FA, primarily operating with HMMWVs, received attachments from TF 2\u20132 IN / 3 BDE / 1 ID and TF 2\u201363 AR / 3 BDE / 1 ID in the form of a BFV platoon and a Tank Platoon. Prior to 0800 local time two 500 [[Pound (mass)|pound]] bombs were dropped on readily identified enemy positions by the airforce. One bomb was dropped on the stadium located in the eastern side of the city and a second bomb was dropped directly south across the street on an enemy position that was identified in vicinity of a university campus located there. It is believed that a third bomb may have been dropped vicinity of the civic center located on the eastern side of the Mufrak traffic circle. Fighting peaked at about 0900-1000 local time and all skirmishes were over before sunset that evening. A large amount of drug paraphernalia and enemy weapons was recovered at the enemy strong points.\n* November 15, 2004: While US and coalition forces battle insurgents in [[Fallujah]], small cells of insurgents take advantage of the situation and conduct coordinated attacks throughout and around the city after the [[Ramadan]] holiday, taking over the Buhriz and Muffrek Police stations and resulting in the dropping of two 500 pound bombs by the US Air Force. Early in the morning, just after sunrise, enemy personnel attempted to destroy one of  the two major bridges crossing the Diyala River. On the northern-most bridge bombs were placed on the second and fourth \"stringers\" supporting the span and detonated. An insufficient amount of explosives was detonated on the bridge and the bridge remained standing (although weakened). Within the matter of a day or two US Army Engineers completed a temporary patch on the bridge which allowed the bridge to safely support the weight of American tanks on its span. Immediately following the blast, American forces were spun up and swept the city, fearing that this was a smaller part of a larger enemy operation attempting to canalize American forces through possible enemy strongpoints in the city center. Such an enemy operation never materialized.\n* June 7, 2006: A U.S. airstrike kills [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the former leader of [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]], near Baqubah, northeast of Baghdad.\n* June 26, 2006: At least 25 people are killed in a [[bicycle bomb]]ing in the city, according to police.\n* October 3, 2006: In a string of deadly attacks, gunmen open fire on a [[Shia]] family fleeing the city, killing five of them.

The third explosion attacked the city's main hospital, where the victims of the first two attacks were being treated.\n* June 14, 2011: A team of six gunmen and suicide bombers dressed in police uniforms attacked Diyala provincial council's offices in the center of Baqubah. The assault began about 9:20&nbsp;a.m. with a suicide car bomb attack at the gates of the Diyala provincial council's headquarters. As police officers and Iraq Security Forces (advised by US Army Special Forces) rushed to the scene, other militants attacked a second checkpoint, one detonating a suicide vest and the others spraying guards and civilians with gunfire. Four civilians and three police officers reported killed. Five of the attackers were also killed, and one was captured.\n\n===Operation Arrowhead Ripper===\n{{main|Operation Arrowhead Ripper}}\n\nOn June 19, 2007, U.S. forces launched a large-scale operation against Iraqi militants in Baquba.

capital of Iraq's [[Diyala Governorate]]. The city is located some {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northeast of [[Baghdad]], on the [[Diyala River]]. In 2003 it had an estimated population of some 467,900 people.\n \nBaqubah served as a [[Stopover|way station]] between Baghdad and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] on the medieval [[Khorasan Road]]. During the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], it was known for its date and fruit orchards, irrigated by the [[Nahrawan Canal]]. Situated on the main road and rail routes between Baghdad and Iran it is a centre of trade for agricultural produce. It is now known as the centre of Iraq's commercial orange groves.\n\n==Lingering legacy of [[Baath Party]] and [[Saddam Hussein]]==\nAlong with the city of [[Fallujah]], Baqubah is glaring for holding on to the monuments and mosques named after some of the most hated and crime-implicated officers of the [[Baath Party]] and their murderess acts. For example, still today, a large mosque named after [[Adnan Khairallah]] is found in the city. There is also an [[Izzat Ibrahim]] mosque in Baqubah (and another one in its satellite town of [[Buhriz]]), named likewise after a high officer of Saddam Hussein, who resurface in 2014 to become one of the founders of [[ISIS]] terrorists. To add insult to injury, Baqubah also host a mosque named the Anfal mosque, brazenly commemorating the code name [[Anfal Campaign]] used for the mass killing of the [[Kurds]] under the supervision of Adnan Khairallah.  These like other [[Baath Party]] related names and entities, are thorns in the side of the Iraqi [[Shia]] and [[Kurds]] who lost so many lives to the abuses of the [[Baath Party]], [[Saddam Hussein]] and military/security figures like Adnan Khairallah and Izzat Ibrahim.\n\n==Demography and ethnography==\nDemographic composition of Baqubah has been a shifting phenomenon since the independence of Iraq. Under [[Saddam Hussein]] rule, the Shia population of the city\u2014[[Persians]], [[Faili Kurds]] and [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkomans]] were deported to Iran, allowing the city to gain a near-totality in Sunni Arab composition. Consequently, the city served as a springboard for violence against the Shias in Baghdad and others, from 2003\u20132008 (see below for chronological detail). Then in 2014, it became a seat for the [[ISIS]] terrorists, raining violence against the [[Shia]] population once again. Following these events, the Iraqi Shia militias such as the [[Kata'ib Hezbollah]], have exacted revenge on the Sunni population of the city and the countryside around it alike. A stream of Shia settlers are arriving (or being directed to) settle in Baqubah and the neighborhood, in order to avoid a future repeat of the same by the Sunni majority. Both the western and eastern halves of the city straddling the [[Diyala River]] have now obtained large and grow Shia minorities, with the eastern half outpacing the other in this respect.\n\n==History==\nBaqubah's name originates from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] words \"Bet\" (house) and \"Yaqub\" (Jacob) and means \"Jacob's house\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baqubah.htm|title=Ba?qubah [Baqubah]|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=May 10, 2016}}</ref> The city was used as a refugee camp for [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] refugees fleeing the [[Assyrian Genocide]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ba'qubah|publisher=Global Security|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baqubah.htm|accessdate=2009-09-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902223538/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/baqubah.htm|archivedate=September 2, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> A refugee camp was set up outside the city, which accommodated between 40,000 and 50,000 refugees.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Baqubah Refugee Camp: An Account of Work on Behalf of the Persecuted Assyrian Christians|publisher=Georgias Press |last=Austin |first=H.

Although the main road heading east to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] from [[Baghdad]] bypassed Baqubah during this period, passing instead through the city of Jisr Nahrawan, it was Baqubah and not Jisr Nahrawan that was the capital of the Upper Nahrawan district.<ref>Le Strange (1905), p.59</ref>\n\nHowever, the succeeding [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] sultans neglected to [[dredging|dredge]] the Nahrawan canal or otherwise maintain it, and by the time of [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] in the early 1200s, the canal had completely silted up and the lands it had once watered had gone out of cultivation.<ref>Le Strange (1905), pp.59\u201360</ref> By the 14th century, [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] wrote that Jisr Nahrawan was in ruins, and the road to Khorasan now passed through Baqubah instead. Baqubah was the main town in the ''Tar\u00eeq-i-Khur\u00e2s\u00e2n'' district, and it was surrounded by fertile orchards that produced large crops of [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s and [[pomelo]]s.<ref>Le Strange (1905), p.61</ref>\n\nIn Yaqut's time, Baqubah was a flourishing town, with several public baths and mosques, as well as a market. The land around Baqubah was densely covered in irrigated orchards, whose dates and lemons were proverbial for their excellence. <ref>Adams (1965), p.94-96</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\nIn the early 1800s, Baqubah was surrounded by date palm groves, as well as orchards producing lemons, pomegranates, and other fruits.<ref>Adams (1965), p.94-96</ref> In 1820, Baqubah is described as being home to 2,000 people, of whom almost half were [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]]. It had a [[Bazaar|bazaar]] and two small mosques.<ref>Buckingham, J.S. (1830). 1:15. ''Travels in Assyria, Media, and Persia'. 2 volumes. London.'</ref>\n\nIn the early 1820s, though, the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] army of [[Mohammad Ali Mirza]], governor of [[Kermanshah]], occupied Baqubah and destroyed much of it. A decade later, it was still in ruins. By 1845, the bazaar and one of the mosques were functioning again, and local agriculture was flourishing. By the early 1870s, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] civil administration had managed to restore stability to the region, and Baqubah became increasingly prosperous.<ref>Adams (1965), p.94-96</ref> Around the turn of the century, one European traveler described its connections to emerging networks of world commerce:\n\n{{Quote|text=The heart of the town is formed by a small bazaar with many fruits and vegetables, American coffee, Indian tea, French sugar and English textiles, in addition to the usual native products. But the bazaar is surrounded by a wide district of expansive gardens with characteristic gate-cottages, and at the eastern exit from the town there is a large and handsome [[caravansary]] that is full of Shi'ite pilgrims almost throughout the year.<ref>Herzfeld, E. (1907) p. 50. \"Eine Reise durch Luristan, Arabistan, und Fars\".

It was the site of the heaviest fighting during the June 24, 2004, insurgent offensive. [[Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad]], led by [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], took responsibility for the attacks.\n\nIn a setback for insurgents, Iraqi and U.S. officials confirmed on June 8, 2006, that Zarqawi had been killed in an airstrike and subsequent raid {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Baquba.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5058304.stm|title=Zarqawi killed in Iraq air raid|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=May 10, 2016}}</ref> During late 2006, however, Baqubah and much of Diyala Governorate were reported to have come under Sunni insurgent control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onthescene.msnbc.com/baghdad/2006/12/reporting_under.html|title=Reporting under al-Qaida control|publisher=|accessdate=May 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119055306/http://onthescene.msnbc.com/baghdad/2006/12/reporting_under.html|archive-date=January 19, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>  On January 3, 2007 the previous Iraqi government in Baquba was reported to have fallen, leaving the city in the hands of insurgents fighting against the American led coalition in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].\n\nIn January 2007, it was reported that Sunni insurgents were able to kidnap the mayor and blow up his office, despite promises from American and Iraqi military officials that the situation in the city was \"reassuring and under control\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article2183852.ece |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202127/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article2183852.ece |archivedate=July 8, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> The city at its peak had over 460,000 residents, but a February 2007 report labeled the city a \"ghost town\" as residents either fled criminal and sectarian violence or remained in hiding at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/02/15/btsc.damon.baquba/index.html|title=Lawlessness turns Baquba into ghost town|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn August 10, 2015 a suicide car bombing near Baqubah killed 30 and wounded 40 people.

Elements from 3 BDE / 1 ID including (but not limited to) 2nd and 4th Platoon / A Co / TF 2\u20132 IN / 3 BDE / 1 ID, 3rd platoon A Co TF 2\u201363 AR / 3 BDE / 1 ID and TF 1\u20136 FA / 3 BDE / 1 ID engage enemy forces for approximately three days straight. Fighting peaked during the daylight hours and tapered off to a stop during nighttime. On the second day of fighting (June 18, 2004) an element consisting of 2nd Platoon / A Co / TF 2\u20132 IN / 3 BDE / 1 ID, 3rd Platoon / A Co / TF 2\u201363 AR / 3 BDE / 1 ID, and TF 1\u20136 FA / 3 BDE / 1 ID are credited with killing 26 enemy combatants. The commander of 3 BDE / 1 ID, COL Dana J. H. Pittard alerted the governor of Diyala province that if fighting continued a fourth day (on the 20th of June 2004) that a Brigade-sized operation would be conducted to clear the suburb of Burhiz in a house-to-house fashion (similar in execution but smaller in scope to the later conducted Operation Phantom Fury in which Falujah was cleared of enemy personnel in November 2004). Respective units were alerted and a final draft of the operation had been disseminated to all participants when the fighting stopped. Much of the fighting that took place between the June 17 and 19 could be characterized by lightly armed squad-sized or smaller enemy elements conducting uncoordinated frontal assaults on American strong-points and heavy armored vehicles. The enemy primarily attacked the western side of the American position. Occasional 60mm mortar fire was directed on American forces by insurgent forces, however the effect of the fire was negligible and only served to be harassing as it wasn\u2019t coordinated in any fashion with other enemy assaults.\n* June 24, 2004: Insurgents establish a series of blocking positions and strong points along the major routes of travel through the city prior to 0500 local time. An American Mechanized Infantry Platoon consisting of four Bradley Fighting Vehicles (BFV) and its complement of dismounted Infantry conducting a routine patrol just before sunrise comes under direct fire while passing the first identified enemy position located in the northwest corner of the city. The platoon pushes through the fire and continues south, reaches a second enemy strong point identified vicinity the civic center adjacent to the Mufrak traffic circle where it is fired on again. The platoon continued east towards the bridge spanning the Diyala river located roughly in the center of the city. Upon reaching the eastern side of the city, the platoon comes under fire again from a third enemy strong point located vicinity the stadium and university campus located on the far eastern side of the city. The patrol, after passing through this position, reaches American operated Forward Operating Base (FOB) Gabe. Shortly thereafter, a second patrol launched from FOB Warhorse (located a few kilometres to the northwest of Baqubah) is launched to assess the viability of the enemy positions. This unit (4th platoon / A Company / TF 2\u20132 / 3 BDE / 1 ID) led by 1LT Gregory followed the same route as the first patrol that passed through the city and was attacked at the same locations. In response to the operating in semi-permanent defensive positions, the city was effectively divided into two sectors with the Diyala river serving as the dividing point. TF 2\u201363 AR / 3 BDE / 1 ID was given responsibility to clear enemy personnel on the western side of the city and TF 1\u20136 FA / 3 BDE / 1 ID was given responsibility to clear the eastern side of the city. Each of the respective battalions launched a company-sized element into their respective sectors. TF 1\u20136 FA, primarily operating with HMMWVs, received attachments from TF 2\u20132 IN / 3 BDE / 1 ID and TF 2\u201363 AR / 3 BDE / 1 ID in the form of a BFV platoon and a Tank Platoon. Prior to 0800 local time two 500 [[Pound (mass)|pound]] bombs were dropped on readily identified enemy positions by the airforce. One bomb was dropped on the stadium located in the eastern side of the city and a second bomb was dropped directly south across the street on an enemy position that was identified in vicinity of a university campus located there. It is believed that a third bomb may have been dropped vicinity of the civic center located on the eastern side of the Mufrak traffic circle. Fighting peaked at about 0900-1000 local time and all skirmishes were over before sunset that evening. A large amount of drug paraphernalia and enemy weapons was recovered at the enemy strong points.\n* November 15, 2004: While US and coalition forces battle insurgents in [[Fallujah]], small cells of insurgents take advantage of the situation and conduct coordinated attacks throughout and around the city after the [[Ramadan]] holiday, taking over the Buhriz and Muffrek Police stations and resulting in the dropping of two 500 pound bombs by the US Air Force. Early in the morning, just after sunrise, enemy personnel attempted to destroy one of  the two major bridges crossing the Diyala River. On the northern-most bridge bombs were placed on the second and fourth \"stringers\" supporting the span and detonated. An insufficient amount of explosives was detonated on the bridge and the bridge remained standing (although weakened). Within the matter of a day or two US Army Engineers completed a temporary patch on the bridge which allowed the bridge to safely support the weight of American tanks on its span. Immediately following the blast, American forces were spun up and swept the city, fearing that this was a smaller part of a larger enemy operation attempting to canalize American forces through possible enemy strongpoints in the city center. Such an enemy operation never materialized.\n* June 7, 2006: A U.S. airstrike kills [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the former leader of [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]], near Baqubah, northeast of Baghdad.\n* June 26, 2006: At least 25 people are killed in a [[bicycle bomb]]ing in the city, according to police.\n* October 3, 2006: In a string of deadly attacks, gunmen open fire on a [[Shia]] family fleeing the city, killing five of them.

As police officers and Iraq Security Forces (advised by US Army Special Forces) rushed to the scene, other militants attacked a second checkpoint, one detonating a suicide vest and the others spraying guards and civilians with gunfire. Four civilians and three police officers reported killed. Five of the attackers were also killed, and one was captured.\n\n===Operation Arrowhead Ripper===\n{{main|Operation Arrowhead Ripper}}\n\nOn June 19, 2007, U.S. forces launched a large-scale operation against Iraqi militants in Baquba.

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and [[funk rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career.

Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]].

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and [[funk rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would recall later that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]] and [[funk rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=1 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using [[Flanging|flangers]] and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel\" using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages.

The two species include: ''Xylocopa darwinii'', found in the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]],  {{convert|604|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[South America]], with the mainland of [[Ecuador]] as the closest land mass; and ''Xylocopa clarionenis'', found on [[Clari\u00f3n Island]] in the [[Revillagigedo Islands]], {{convert|700|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the coast of Mexico.  ''X. clarionenis'' is thought to be most closely related to ''Xylocopa varipuncta''.<ref name=\"Hurd1958\" />\n\n==Life cycle==\nEntomologist Julian R. Yates III of the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] describes the life cycle of ''X. sonorina'' in Hawaii:\n<blockquote>Having located a suitable piece of wood, the female bee begins to excavate a single tunnel in preparation for egg laying. Because of our tropical climate, egg laying by female carpenter bees occurs year-round although it may decline during the winter months, when the weather is worse. Before laying eggs, the female collects pollen and deposits it, in the form of a ball, in the tunnel at a point furthest from the entrance. She lays a single egg on the pollen ball and seals both in a chamber with wood shavings. She may lay several eggs, each on its own pollen ball and inside its own sealed chamber, in a series within the tunnel. The eggs hatch in two to three days. The larvae develop in approximately two weeks. The prepupal (nonfeeding larvae) and pupal stages take about three to four weeks to reach adulthood. Teneral (adult shortly after emergence, when it is not entirely hardened or not of the mature color) females are fed by the mother. They are capable of buzzing in about a week, and of flight in approximately two to three weeks. A single female in a tunnel may be joined later by her offspring or other bees. Only one female will collect pollen, prepare cells, and lay eggs, however. Other females perform guard and nest-cleaning duties.<ref name=\"UH-IPMP\">{{cite web| last = Yates II| first = Julian R.| title = ''Xylocopa sonorina'' (Smith)| work = Urban Knowledge Master| publisher = University of Hawaii Integrated Pest Management Program| date = Dec 1992| url = http://www.extento.hawaii.edu/Kbase/urban/site/structural/Carpbee.htm | accessdate = 2009-05-04}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Xylocopa wailea maui hawaii.jpg|thumb|''X. sonorina'' in a field of Chinese violet (''Asystasia gangetica'')]]\nThe foraging behavior of ''X. sonorina'' involves a quick series of movements between flowers.

In tropical climates, females will lay eggs all year, with interruptions due to cold weather.  After collecting pollen and preparing tunneled chambers out of wood, a single female will deposit eggs on [[pollen ball]]s within the chamber and seal it.  The eggs will hatch two to three days later, with larvae maturing in two weeks, and prepupal and pupal stages lasting 3\u20134 weeks.  New adults will begin buzzing a week later and flying in two to three more weeks.\n\n''X. sonorina'' is distinguished from other species of the genus by differences in their genitalic morphology.

It is not known when ''X. sonorina'' was introduced to the [[Hawaiian Islands]], but sometime around 1874, British entomologist [[Frederick Smith (entomologist)|Frederick Smith]] identified it as a new species.  ''X. sonorina'' is currently found on all of the main Hawaiian Islands and in the [[Mariana Islands]]. In [[tropical agriculture]], ''X. sonorina'' has been used as a [[List of crop plants pollinated by bees|pollinator]] of ''[[Passiflora edulis]]'', a species of [[passion fruit]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFrederick Smith, Assistant in the Zoological Department of the British Museum and member of the council of the [[Entomological Society of London]], first identified ''X. sonorina'' in 1874.<ref name=\"Smith1874\">[[Frederick Smith (entomologist)|Smith, Frederick]] (1874) X.

Hurd Jr., it is unknown when and how ''X. sonorina'' managed to reach the Hawaiian Islands.  Located in the [[Pacific Ocean]], more than {{convert|2000|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} away from the closest landfall in North America, Hawaii's great distance from the Americas is thought to have been too large for natural [[biological dispersal]] to succeed.  Hurd suggests that it is likely humans aided ''X. sonorina'' in its arrival to Hawaii.<ref name=\"Hurd1958\" />  Today, the species can be found on all of the main [[Hawaiian Islands]].<ref name=\"Scott-2000\" />  Following the colonization of Hawaii, ''X. sonorina'' was [[Adventive species|introduced]] into the Marianas Islands, China, Japan, and the United States.<ref name=\"Hurd1958\" />  The species has also been reported in [[Midway Atoll]], [[Java]], [[New Guinea]], and the [[Philippines]].<ref name=\"UH-IPMP\" />\n\nHurd observes that in recent history, only ''two'' species in the genus ''[[Xylocopa]]'' have successfully colonized Pacific archipelagos east of the Americas through natural biological dispersal or with human help; This is out of a total of more than 150 identified species in North and South America, 70 of which can be found in Brazil alone.  The two species include: ''Xylocopa darwinii'', found in the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]],  {{convert|604|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[South America]], with the mainland of [[Ecuador]] as the closest land mass; and ''Xylocopa clarionenis'', found on [[Clari\u00f3n Island]] in the [[Revillagigedo Islands]], {{convert|700|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the coast of Mexico.  ''X. clarionenis'' is thought to be most closely related to ''Xylocopa varipuncta''.<ref name=\"Hurd1958\" />\n\n==Life cycle==\nEntomologist Julian R. Yates III of the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] describes the life cycle of ''X. sonorina'' in Hawaii:\n<blockquote>Having located a suitable piece of wood, the female bee begins to excavate a single tunnel in preparation for egg laying. Because of our tropical climate, egg laying by female carpenter bees occurs year-round although it may decline during the winter months, when the weather is worse. Before laying eggs, the female collects pollen and deposits it, in the form of a ball, in the tunnel at a point furthest from the entrance. She lays a single egg on the pollen ball and seals both in a chamber with wood shavings. She may lay several eggs, each on its own pollen ball and inside its own sealed chamber, in a series within the tunnel. The eggs hatch in two to three days. The larvae develop in approximately two weeks. The prepupal (nonfeeding larvae) and pupal stages take about three to four weeks to reach adulthood. Teneral (adult shortly after emergence, when it is not entirely hardened or not of the mature color) females are fed by the mother. They are capable of buzzing in about a week, and of flight in approximately two to three weeks. A single female in a tunnel may be joined later by her offspring or other bees. Only one female will collect pollen, prepare cells, and lay eggs, however. Other females perform guard and nest-cleaning duties.<ref name=\"UH-IPMP\">{{cite web| last = Yates II| first = Julian R.| title = ''Xylocopa sonorina'' (Smith)| work = Urban Knowledge Master| publisher = University of Hawaii Integrated Pest Management Program| date = Dec 1992| url = http://www.extento.hawaii.edu/Kbase/urban/site/structural/Carpbee.htm | accessdate = 2009-05-04}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Xylocopa wailea maui hawaii.jpg|thumb|''X. sonorina'' in a field of Chinese violet (''Asystasia gangetica'')]]\nThe foraging behavior of ''X. sonorina'' involves a quick series of movements between flowers.  In a 1996 study using ''[[Asystasia gangetica]]'' (Chinese violet), ''X. sonorina'' visited 16 flowers per minute and spent an average of 1.5 seconds at each flower, usually flying towards the flower from the front, landing on the petals, and moving to the bottom of the [[Petal#Corolla|corolla]].<ref name=\"Villalobos-1996\">{{cite journal| last = Villalobos| first = Ethel M.|author2=Todd E.

and '''Qingyuan''', is a [[prefecture-level city]] in central [[Hebei]] province, approximately  {{convert|150|km}} southwest of [[Beijing]]. At the 2010 census, Baoding City had 11,194,372 inhabitants out of which 2,176,857 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of 3 urban districts and Qingyuan and Mancheng counties largely being conurbated, on {{convert|1,840|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name = \"Geo Background\"/> Baoding is among 13 Chinese cities with a population of over 10 million, ranking seventh.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u6700\u65b0\u4e2d\u56fd\u57ce\u5e02\u4eba\u53e3\u6570\u91cf\u6392\u540d\uff08\u6839\u636e2010\u5e74\u7b2c\u516d\u6b21\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\uff09|url=http://www.elivecity.cn/html/yijuyanjiu/yijuyanjiu1/645.html|publisher=www.elivecity.cn|year=2012|accessdate=2014-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBaoding is a city with a history dating back to the [[Western Han Dynasty]]. It was destroyed by the [[Mongol]]s in the 13th century, but after the Mongols established the [[Yuan Dynasty]], it was rebuilt. It acquired the name \"Baoding\" during the [[Yuan dynasty]] \u2014 the name is roughly interpreted as \"protecting the capital\", referring to the city's proximity to [[Beijing]]. Baoding served for many years as the capital of [[Zhili Province|Zhili]], and was a significant centre of culture in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and early [[Qing Dynasty]]. During the [[Boxer rebellion]], Boxer rebels killed a Turk, two Swiss, and an Italian in Baoding.\n\nIn August 1, 1949, the people's Government of Hebei province was established, Baoding was the capital of the province, and the city of Baoding was a provincial municipality. In August 9, the administrative inspector's office of the Baoding district was established, and it was established as the administrative inspector's office of the county district.\n\nIn May 1958, the capital of Hebei was moved to Tianjin.\n\nIn January 1966, the provincial capital was moved from Tianjin to Baoding.\n\nIn February 1968, the provincial capital moved to Shijiazhuang.\n\nIn December 1994, the Baoding area merged with Baoding to become a provincial city.\n\nIn April 2017, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council announced the decision to transform Baoding's [[Xiong County|Xiong]], [[Rongcheng County|Rongcheng]], and [[Anxin County|Anxin]] counties into [[Xiong'an New Area]], a new development area of national significance, with a focus on innovation, sustainability and quality of life, following the success of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and Shanghai's Pudong New Area.\n\n==Geography==\nBaoding is located in the west-central portion of Hebei province and lies on the [[North China Plain]], with the [[Taihang Mountains]] to the west. Bordering prefecture-level cities in the province are [[Zhangjiakou]] to the north, [[Langfang]] and [[Cangzhou]] to the east, and Shijiazhuang and [[Hengshui]] to the south. Baoding also borders Beijing to the northeast and [[Shanxi]] to the west.\n\nElevations in Baoding's administrative area decrease from northwest to southeast. The western parts are dominated by mountains and hills that are generally more than {{convert|1000|m}} tall; this area includes parts of Laishui, Yi, Mancheng, Shunping, Tang and Fuping Counties as well as the entirety of Laiyuan County, occupying 30.6% of the prefecture's area.<ref name = \"Geo Background\"/> The highest peak is [[Mount Waitou]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u6b6a\u5934\u5c71}}), with an elevation of {{convert|2286|m}}.<ref name = \"Geo Background\"/> Moving southeast from this area, one encounters low-lying mountains and hills, taking up 18.9% of the prefecture's area.<ref name = \"Geo Background\"/> Further to the east lies generally flat terrain of {{convert|30|to|100|m|ft|sigfig=2}} elevation. Here the primary rivers are the [[Juma River (China)|Juma]], [[Yishui River|Yishui]] ({{lang|zh|\u6613\u6c34}}), [[Cao River|Cao]] ({{lang|zh|\u6f15\u6cb3}}), [[Longquan River|Longquan]] ({{lang|zh|\u9f99\u6cc9\u6cb3}}), [[Tang River|Tang]] ({{lang|zh|\u5510\u6cb3}}), and [[Sha River]]s. [[Baiyangdian Lake]], the largest natural lake in northern China, can be found nearby.\n\n===Climate===\nBaoding has a continental, [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dwa''),<ref>Peel, M.

ISSN 1027-5606.</ref> characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, very dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature and lack of rainfall. The annual rainfall, about 60% of which falls in July and August alone, is highly variable and not reliable. In the city itself, this amount has averaged to a meagre {{convert|513|mm|1}} per annum. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|\u22123.2|\u00b0C|1}} in January to {{convert|26.8|\u00b0C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|12.9|\u00b0C|1}}. There are 2,500 to 2,900 hours of bright sunshine annually, and the frost-free period lasts 165\u2212210 days.\n\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y\n|location = Baoding (1971\u22122000)\n|Jan high C =  2.5\n|Feb high C =  5.8\n|Mar high C = 12.6\n|Apr high C = 21.3\n|May high C = 27.0\n|Jun high C = 31.7\n|Jul high C = 31.7\n|Aug high C = 30.1\n|Sep high C = 26.5\n|Oct high C = 20.0\n|Nov high C = 10.8\n|Dec high C =  4.1\n|Jan mean C = -3.2\n|Feb mean C = -0.1\n|Mar mean C =  6.6\n|Apr mean C =  14.9\n|May mean C = 20.6\n|Jun mean C = 25.4\n|Jul mean C =  26.8\n|Aug mean C = 25.3\n|Sep mean C = 20.6\n|Oct mean C = 13.6\n|Nov mean C = 5.1\n|Dec mean C = -1.2\n|year mean C = 12.9\n|Jan low C = \u22127.7\n|Feb low C = \u22124.7\n|Mar low C =  1.3\n|Apr low C =  8.8\n|May low C = 14.5\n|Jun low C = 19.6\n|Jul low C = 22.6\n|Aug low C = 21.4\n|Sep low C = 15.7\n|Oct low C =  8.7\n|Nov low C =  0.8\n|Dec low C = \u22125.2\n|year high C= 18.7 |year low C=  8.0\n|year high F= 65.6 |year low F= 46.4\n|Jan record high C = 14.9\n|Feb record high C = 23.1\n|Mar record high C = 26.7\n|Apr record high C = 33.8\n|May record high C = 37.8\n|Jun record high C = 41.6\n|Jul record high C = 41.6\n|Aug record high C = 37.7\n|Sep record high C = 34.3\n|Oct record high C = 31.0\n|Nov record high C = 23.5\n|Dec record high C = 17.1\n|Jan record low C = \u221219.6\n|Feb record low C = \u221215.7\n|Mar record low C = \u221214.8\n|Apr record low C = \u22123.2\n|May record low C =  5.5\n|Jun record low C =  10.7\n|Jul record low C =   13.4\n|Aug record low C =  12.6\n|Sep record low C =  5.7\n|Oct record low C = \u22122.3\n|Nov record low C = \u221211.6\n|Dec record low C = \u221217.9\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm =   2.0\n|Feb precipitation mm =   4.8\n|Mar precipitation mm =   8.0\n|Apr precipitation mm =  17.1\n|May precipitation mm =  32.6\n|Jun precipitation mm =  64.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 172.2\n|Aug precipitation mm = 133.7\n|Sep precipitation mm =  43.1\n|Oct precipitation mm =  21.4\n|Nov precipitation mm =  10.5\n|Dec precipitation mm =   3.1\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days =  1.6\n|Feb precipitation days =  2.0\n|Mar precipitation days =  3.1\n|Apr precipitation days =  4.2\n|May precipitation days =  5.7\n|Jun precipitation days =  7.7\n|Jul precipitation days = 11.7\n|Aug precipitation days = 11.3\n|Sep precipitation days =  6.9\n|Oct precipitation days =  4.9\n|Nov precipitation days =  3.3\n|Dec precipitation days =  1.6\n|year precipitation days =64.0\n|source 1 = [http://www.weather.com.cn/cityintro/101090201.shtml?

Tianwei Wind Power Technology is one of the three main plants in Baoding that produces wind turbine generators. It wheeled out its first 20 turbines in 2008, and it will produce 150 units in 2009 and another 500 in 2010.

The village of Quantou is located on an island in [[Lake Baiyangdian]].\n\nThe city's streets follow a rough grid pattern, although this is less obvious in the older part of the city. The traditional main street of old Baoding is Yuhua Road, running from the city's centre to its eastern edge \u2014 most of Baoding's historic buildings are located in this area, along with some of its larger shopping centres. Other major streets include Dongfeng Road and Chaoyang Avenue.

At the 2010 census, Baoding City had 11,194,372 inhabitants out of which 2,176,857 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of 3 urban districts and Qingyuan and Mancheng counties largely being conurbated, on {{convert|1,840|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name = \"Geo Background\"/> Baoding is among 13 Chinese cities with a population of over 10 million, ranking seventh.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u6700\u65b0\u4e2d\u56fd\u57ce\u5e02\u4eba\u53e3\u6570\u91cf\u6392\u540d\uff08\u6839\u636e2010\u5e74\u7b2c\u516d\u6b21\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\uff09|url=http://www.elivecity.cn/html/yijuyanjiu/yijuyanjiu1/645.html|publisher=www.elivecity.cn|year=2012|accessdate=2014-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBaoding is a city with a history dating back to the [[Western Han Dynasty]]. It was destroyed by the [[Mongol]]s in the 13th century, but after the Mongols established the [[Yuan Dynasty]], it was rebuilt. It acquired the name \"Baoding\" during the [[Yuan dynasty]] \u2014 the name is roughly interpreted as \"protecting the capital\", referring to the city's proximity to [[Beijing]]. Baoding served for many years as the capital of [[Zhili Province|Zhili]], and was a significant centre of culture in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and early [[Qing Dynasty]]. During the [[Boxer rebellion]], Boxer rebels killed a Turk, two Swiss, and an Italian in Baoding.\n\nIn August 1, 1949, the people's Government of Hebei province was established, Baoding was the capital of the province, and the city of Baoding was a provincial municipality. In August 9, the administrative inspector's office of the Baoding district was established, and it was established as the administrative inspector's office of the county district.\n\nIn May 1958, the capital of Hebei was moved to Tianjin.\n\nIn January 1966, the provincial capital was moved from Tianjin to Baoding.\n\nIn February 1968, the provincial capital moved to Shijiazhuang.\n\nIn December 1994, the Baoding area merged with Baoding to become a provincial city.\n\nIn April 2017, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council announced the decision to transform Baoding's [[Xiong County|Xiong]], [[Rongcheng County|Rongcheng]], and [[Anxin County|Anxin]] counties into [[Xiong'an New Area]], a new development area of national significance, with a focus on innovation, sustainability and quality of life, following the success of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and Shanghai\u2019s Pudong New Area.\n\n==Geography==\nBaoding is located in the west-central portion of Hebei province and lies on the [[North China Plain]], with the [[Taihang Mountains]] to the west. Bordering prefecture-level cities in the province are [[Zhangjiakou]] to the north, [[Langfang]] and [[Cangzhou]] to the east, and Shijiazhuang and [[Hengshui]] to the south. Baoding also borders Beijing to the northeast and [[Shanxi]] to the west.\n\nElevations in Baoding's administrative area decrease from northwest to southeast. The western parts are dominated by mountains and hills that are generally more than {{convert|1000|m}} tall; this area includes parts of Laishui, Yi, Mancheng, Shunping, Tang and Fuping Counties as well as the entirety of Laiyuan County, occupying 30.6% of the prefecture's area.<ref name = \"Geo Background\"/> The highest peak is [[Mount Waitou]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u6b6a\u5934\u5c71}}), with an elevation of {{convert|2286|m}}.<ref name = \"Geo Background\"/> Moving southeast from this area, one encounters low-lying mountains and hills, taking up 18.9% of the prefecture's area.<ref name = \"Geo Background\"/> Further to the east lies generally flat terrain of {{convert|30|to|100|m|ft|sigfig=2}} elevation. Here the primary rivers are the [[Juma River (China)|Juma]], [[Yishui River|Yishui]] ({{lang|zh|\u6613\u6c34}}), [[Cao River|Cao]] ({{lang|zh|\u6f15\u6cb3}}), [[Longquan River|Longquan]] ({{lang|zh|\u9f99\u6cc9\u6cb3}}), [[Tang River|Tang]] ({{lang|zh|\u5510\u6cb3}}), and [[Sha River]]s. [[Baiyangdian Lake]], the largest natural lake in northern China, can be found nearby.\n\n===Climate===\nBaoding has a continental, [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dwa''),<ref>Peel, M.

ISSN 1027-5606.</ref> characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, very dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature and lack of rainfall. The annual rainfall, about 60% of which falls in July and August alone, is highly variable and not reliable. In the city itself, this amount has averaged to a meagre {{convert|513|mm|1}} per annum. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|\u22123.2|\u00b0C|1}} in January to {{convert|26.8|\u00b0C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|12.9|\u00b0C|1}}. There are 2,500 to 2,900 hours of bright sunshine annually, and the frost-free period lasts 165\u2212210 days.\n\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y\n|location = Baoding (1971\u22122000)\n|Jan high C =  2.5\n|Feb high C =  5.8\n|Mar high C = 12.6\n|Apr high C = 21.3\n|May high C = 27.0\n|Jun high C = 31.7\n|Jul high C = 31.7\n|Aug high C = 30.1\n|Sep high C = 26.5\n|Oct high C = 20.0\n|Nov high C = 10.8\n|Dec high C =  4.1\n|Jan mean C = -3.2\n|Feb mean C = -0.1\n|Mar mean C =  6.6\n|Apr mean C =  14.9\n|May mean C = 20.6\n|Jun mean C = 25.4\n|Jul mean C =  26.8\n|Aug mean C = 25.3\n|Sep mean C = 20.6\n|Oct mean C = 13.6\n|Nov mean C = 5.1\n|Dec mean C = -1.2\n|year mean C = 12.9\n|Jan low C = \u22127.7\n|Feb low C = \u22124.7\n|Mar low C =  1.3\n|Apr low C =  8.8\n|May low C = 14.5\n|Jun low C = 19.6\n|Jul low C = 22.6\n|Aug low C = 21.4\n|Sep low C = 15.7\n|Oct low C =  8.7\n|Nov low C =  0.8\n|Dec low C = \u22125.2\n|year high C= 18.7 |year low C=  8.0\n|year high F= 65.6 |year low F= 46.4\n|Jan record high C = 14.9\n|Feb record high C = 23.1\n|Mar record high C = 26.7\n|Apr record high C = 33.8\n|May record high C = 37.8\n|Jun record high C = 41.6\n|Jul record high C = 41.6\n|Aug record high C = 37.7\n|Sep record high C = 34.3\n|Oct record high C = 31.0\n|Nov record high C = 23.5\n|Dec record high C = 17.1\n|Jan record low C = \u221219.6\n|Feb record low C = \u221215.7\n|Mar record low C = \u221214.8\n|Apr record low C = \u22123.2\n|May record low C =  5.5\n|Jun record low C =  10.7\n|Jul record low C =   13.4\n|Aug record low C =  12.6\n|Sep record low C =  5.7\n|Oct record low C = \u22122.3\n|Nov record low C = \u221211.6\n|Dec record low C = \u221217.9\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm =   2.0\n|Feb precipitation mm =   4.8\n|Mar precipitation mm =   8.0\n|Apr precipitation mm =  17.1\n|May precipitation mm =  32.6\n|Jun precipitation mm =  64.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 172.2\n|Aug precipitation mm = 133.7\n|Sep precipitation mm =  43.1\n|Oct precipitation mm =  21.4\n|Nov precipitation mm =  10.5\n|Dec precipitation mm =   3.1\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days =  1.6\n|Feb precipitation days =  2.0\n|Mar precipitation days =  3.1\n|Apr precipitation days =  4.2\n|May precipitation days =  5.7\n|Jun precipitation days =  7.7\n|Jul precipitation days = 11.7\n|Aug precipitation days = 11.3\n|Sep precipitation days =  6.9\n|Oct precipitation days =  4.9\n|Nov precipitation days =  3.3\n|Dec precipitation days =  1.6\n|year precipitation days =64.0\n|source 1 = [http://www.weather.com.cn/cityintro/101090201.shtml?

The village of Quantou is located on an island in [[Lake Baiyangdian]].\n\nThe city's streets follow a rough grid pattern, although this is less obvious in the older part of the city. The traditional main street of old Baoding is Yuhua Road, running from the city's centre to its eastern edge \u2014 most of Baoding's historic buildings are located in this area, along with some of its larger shopping centres. Other major streets include Dongfeng Road and Chaoyang Avenue. There is a [[ring road]] around the city.\n\nBaoding is home to [[Hebei University]], [[North China Electric Power University]] with other 3 universities and 12 colleges.\n\n===Historic sites===\n[[File:BaodingLotusPond.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Baoding's ancient lotus gardens]]\nBaoding contains a number of notable historic sites.

It was established as a [[French Congo|French]] outpost in 1889 and named after its location on the northern bank of the [[Ubangi River]] ({{lang-fr|Oubangui}}); the Ubangi itself was named from the [[Bobangi language|Bobangi]] word for the \"rapids\" located beside the settlement,<ref>Room, Adrian.

The majority of the population of the Central African Republic lives in the western parts of the country, in Bangui and the surrounding area.\n\nThe city forms an autonomous commune (''commune autonome'') of the Central African Republic which is surrounded by the [[Ombella-M'Poko]] prefecture. With an area of {{Convert|67|km2}}, the commune is the smallest high-level administrative division in the country, but the highest in terms of population. The city consists of eight urban districts (''[[arrondissements]]''), 16 groups (''groupements'') and 205 neighbourhoods (''quartiers''). As the capital of the Central African Republic, Bangui acts as an administrative, trade, and commercial centre. It is served by the [[Bangui M'Poko International Airport]]. The National Assembly, government buildings, banks, foreign enterprises and embassies, hospitals, hotels, main markets and the Ngaragba Central Prison are all located here. Bangui manufactures [[textiles]], food products, [[beer]], [[shoes]] and [[soap]]. Its [[Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (Bangui)|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bangui]]. The city is also home to the [[University of Bangui]], inaugurated in 1970.\n\nBangui has been the scene of intense rebel activity and destruction during decades of political upheaval, including the recent [[Central African Republic Civil War (2012\u20132014)#Fall of Bangui|rebellion]]. As a result of political unrest, the city was named in 1996 as one of the most dangerous in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Bangui}}\n[[File:Bangui 1912.jpg|thumb|300px|A street scene in Bangui, 1912.]]\n[[Archaeology|Archaeological studies]] in and around Bangui have yielded at least 26 ancient [[Iron Age]] sites that contain many [[Metallurgy|metallurgical tools and object]]s, illuminating the pre-European history of the city and surrounding area.<ref name=\"unesco\">{{cite web|url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/4005/|title= Les sites pal\u00e9o-m\u00e9tallurgiques de Bangui |publisher= UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref> The archaeological sites were added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on 11 April 2006 in the Cultural category.<ref name=\"unesco\" /> The site closest to Bangui is Pendere-Sengue, {{Convert|800|m}} from Independence Avenue, where archaeologists and conservation agencies have carried out studies.

Its territory was organized first into the territory of the Upper Ubangi (''{{lang|fr|Haut-Oubangui}}'') and then as the separate colony of [[Ubangi-Shari]].{{Sfn|Haggett|2002|p=2329}} The initial capitals of these areas were at [[les Abiras]] and [[Fort de Possel]] further upstream, but the rapids at Bangui blocked them from direct communication along the river and caused the settlement there to grow in importance until, in 1906, it was chosen as the new headquarters for the French administration. Bangui retained its importance as a military and administrative centre when the colony was folded into [[French Equatorial Africa]] and under both [[Vichy France|Vichy]] and [[Free France|Free French]] control during [[World War II]]. The French operated a [[Radio|radio transmitter]] in Bangui, which was described in 1932 as \"the most remote radio station in Africa\".<ref name=\"Magazines1932\">{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YeIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA535|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=October 1932|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=535|issn=0032-4558}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Soldiers of the Forces Fran\u00e7aises Libres near Bangui.jpg|thumb|left|A local woman together with soldiers of the [[Forces Fran\u00e7aises Libres]] near Bangui in 1940.]]\nThe colony of [[Ubangi-Shari]] received its autonomy in 1958 as the [[Central African Republic]] and this became independent from France in 1960. In 1970, President [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa]] inaugurated the [[University of Bangui]].{{Sfn|Titley|1997|p=69}} He established the national airline Air Centrafrique the following year and ordered the construction of two new luxury [[hotel]]s in Bangui. With tensions mounting between Bangui and [[Paris]] as a result of Bokassa's uncontrollable expenditures, western [[bank]]s refused to lend him any more money.{{Sfn|Titley|1997|p=69}} Relations with the French worsened still further in April 1974, when Brigette Miroux's body was discovered in a hotel room in Bangui. It was reported in the French media that she had been Bokassa's mistress and that he was responsible for her murder.{{Sfn|Titley|1997|p=69}} As a result, Bokassa banned imports of French [[newspaper]]s and assumed control of the [[Agence France-Presse]] office in Bangui.{{Sfn|Titley|1997|p=69}} By 1975, Bangui had a population of 300,723.<ref name=\"CP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Centralafrica.html|title=Central Africa|publisher=Citypopulation.de|accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1981, widespread violence took place in Bangui following elections, after [[Operation Caban]] led the French to drop Bokassa (who had begun to call himself [[Emperor Bokassa I]]), and replaced him with [[David Dacko]]. Opponents of the President met in Bangui and were forced to flee the country. After returning voluntarily to Bangui in the autumn of 1986,{{Sfn|Shillington|2004|p=407}} Bokassa went on trial. Initially faced with the death penalty, in February 1988 he was instead sentenced to life imprisonment.{{Sfn|Shillington|2004|p=407}} His successor was General [[Andr\u00e9 Kolingba]], army chief of staff of Decko's army, who took over control from the local French military on 1 September 1981 under the pretext that the country was heading towards civil war. Although he attempted to combat corruption and control the national economy, he was unable to achieve his reforms. By the middle of the 1980s the country's economic situation had deteriorated as 80% of the revenue went towards meeting the salaries of the staff.{{Sfn|Shillington|2004|pp=406-407}} Under pressure from France and other western countries, Kolingba restored democracy in the country in 1991 with a multiparty government but elections could be held only three years later in August 1994. During the elections, [[Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9]] was elected to the post of president. Since he was from northern CAR, the southern group of Kolingba started a rebellion during 1996.{{Sfn|Shillington|2004|pp=406-407}}\n\nIn May 1996, about 200 soldiers of the Central African Republic mutinied in Bangui, demanding salary increases and the abdication of Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9.<ref name=Institute>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inadev.org/profile_-_central_african_republic.htm|title=Profile Central African Republic|accessdate=10 January 2014|publisher=Institute for African Development}}</ref> In the aftermath, the renegades plundered and killed more than 50 people.<ref name=Institute/> Following this, the French troops stationed in the country suppressed the rebellion and restored the dictatorial power. After being elected, President Patass\u00e9 announced a national unity government in early 1997. The Patass\u00e9 government, the opposition parties, and religious groups signed the [[Bangui Agreements]] in January 1997 which were a series of measures designed to reconcile competing political factions, reform and strengthen the economy.{{sfn|McKenna|2011|p=37}} The same year, the rebel troops refused a military base in Bangui and in June a new revolt broke out.\n\nIn view of frequent political unrest the city was named in 1996 as one of the most dangerous cities in the world.{{Sfn|Doeden|2009|=16}} On 25 October 2002, several towns in the country and later Bangui itself were attacked by the forces of General [[Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9]], backed with international support.<ref name=\"Yearbook of the United Nations\">{{cite book|title=Yearbook of the United Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yp2sSGFOXAgC&pg=PA145|year=2004|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-100904-0|page=145}}</ref> Boziz\u00e9 refused to accept an arrest warrant and \"defected with about a hundred troops, engaged in street battles in the northern neighborhoods of Bangui (traditionally supporting Patass\u00e9)\" and went north.{{Sfn|Villal\u00f3n|VonDoepp|2005|p=146}} Boziz\u00e9 went into exile in [[Chad]]{{Sfn|Villal\u00f3n|VonDoepp|2005|p=146}} but his troops returned to Bangui and fighting continued.

Patass\u00e9, who was returning from Niger after attending a conference, was not permitted to land in Bangui and he took asylum in [[Togo]], and Boziz\u00e9 seized power and suspended the constitution.

The Bangui resident community includes diamond traders from western Africa and Chad, traders from many African countries, and refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria.<ref name=Republic/>\n\nThe official languages of the country are [[French language|French]] and [[Sango]]; the latter (originally a language from the Ubangi River region) is spoken by 90% of the population.

Sango was simplified by Christian missionaries and is widely used to this day.<ref name=Republic/>\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Trading methods in Bangui Market.jpg|thumb|right|Local traders]]\nBangui serves as an administrative, trade, and commercial centre. During the Second World War the country became wealthier as exports of rubber, cotton, coffee, uranium and diamonds increased.{{Sfn|Eyoh|Zeleza|2002|p=45}} After the war, the employment of local people in mainstream administration led to the development of the country's infrastructure, which increased trade while slowing the national movement for independence.{{Sfn|Eyoh|Zeleza|2002|p=45}}\n\nDuring David Dacko's presidency from 1960 to 1966, there was a significant increase in the production of [[diamond]]s.{{sfn|Law|2011|p=7}} This occurred when the monopoly of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a [[diamond cutting]] factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. But by the end of his five-year tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.{{sfn|Law|2011|p=7}}\nConcurrently, Bangui also became the key centre for social and cultural activity in the region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment of the people and severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.{{Sfn|Eyoh|Zeleza|2002|p=45}}\n\nBangui received its first bank in 1946 when a branch of the [[Bank of West Africa (BAO)|Bank of West Africa]] was established there.

It was established as a [[French Congo|French]] outpost in 1889 and named after its location on the northern bank of the [[Ubangi River]] ({{lang-fr|Oubangui}}); the Ubangi itself was named from the [[Bobangi language|Bobangi]] word for the \"rapids\" located beside the settlement,<ref>Room, Adrian.

The majority of the population of the Central African Republic lives in the western parts of the country, in Bangui and the surrounding area.\n\nThe city forms an autonomous commune (''commune autonome'') of the Central African Republic which is surrounded by the [[Ombella-M'Poko]] prefecture. With an area of {{Convert|67|km2}}, the commune is the smallest high-level administrative division in the country, but the highest in terms of population. The city consists of eight urban districts (''[[arrondissements]]''), 16 groups (''groupements'') and 205 neighbourhoods (''quartiers''). As the capital of the Central African Republic, Bangui acts as an administrative, trade, and commercial centre. It is served by the [[Bangui M'Poko International Airport]]. The National Assembly, government buildings, banks, foreign enterprises and embassies, hospitals, hotels, main markets and the Ngaragba Central Prison are all located here. Bangui manufactures [[textiles]], food products, [[beer]], [[shoes]] and [[soap]]. Its [[Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (Bangui)|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bangui]]. The city is also home to the [[University of Bangui]], inaugurated in 1970.\n\nBangui has been the scene of intense rebel activity and destruction during decades of political upheaval, including the recent [[Central African Republic Civil War (2012\u20132014)#Fall of Bangui|rebellion]].

Bangui retained its importance as a military and administrative centre when the colony was folded into [[French Equatorial Africa]] and under both [[Vichy France|Vichy]] and [[Free France|Free French]] control during [[World War II]].

In 1970, President [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa]] inaugurated the [[University of Bangui]].{{Sfn|Titley|1997|p=69}} He established the national airline Air Centrafrique the following year and ordered the construction of two new luxury [[hotel]]s in Bangui.

It was reported in the French media that she had been Bokassa's mistress and that he was responsible for her murder.{{Sfn|Titley|1997|p=69}} As a result, Bokassa banned imports of French [[newspaper]]s and assumed control of the [[Agence France-Presse]] office in Bangui.{{Sfn|Titley|1997|p=69}} By 1975, Bangui had a population of 300,723.<ref name=\"CP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Centralafrica.html|title=Central Africa|publisher=Citypopulation.de|accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1981, widespread violence took place in Bangui following elections, after [[Operation Caban]] led the French to drop Bokassa (who had begun to call himself [[Emperor Bokassa I]]), and replaced him with [[David Dacko]]. Opponents of the President met in Bangui and were forced to flee the country. After returning voluntarily to Bangui in the autumn of 1986,{{Sfn|Shillington|2004|p=407}} Bokassa went on trial. Initially faced with the death penalty, in February 1988 he was instead sentenced to life imprisonment.{{Sfn|Shillington|2004|p=407}} His successor was General [[Andr\u00e9 Kolingba]], army chief of staff of Decko\u2019s army, who took over control from the local French military on 1 September 1981 under the pretext that the country was heading towards civil war. Although he attempted to combat corruption and control the national economy, he was unable to achieve his reforms. By the middle of the 1980s the country\u2019s economic situation had deteriorated as 80% of the revenue went towards meeting the salaries of the staff.{{Sfn|Shillington|2004|pp=406-407}} Under pressure from France and other western countries, Kolingba restored democracy in the country in 1991 with a multiparty government but elections could be held only three years later in August 1994. During the elections, [[Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9]] was elected to the post of president.

They usually live in groups of up to 7 to 80 individuals. Within these groups, there is distinct social hierarchy evidenced by grooming behaviors and gender relationships.\n\nGreen monkeys are known to communicate both verbally and non-verbally. They have distinct calls which they use to warn others in the group of predators, and even have specific calls for specific predators. Body language, such as the display of brightly colored genitalia is also used to communicate danger, but can also be used as a way of establishing dominance. It has also been documented that green monkeys may use facial expressions to express their emotional state.<ref>Matthew Keller, [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Chlorocebus_sabaeus.html], \"Animal Diversity Web\", 3/26/12</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\nGreen monkeys live in a polygynous society, revolving around the alpha males. The alpha males have control over social interactions and mating between other males and females in the group.\n\nThese monkeys are seasonal breeders, breeding during the April to June months (October and November in the Nyes area North West of Thies), during which rainfall is the heaviest. It is during these rainy seasons that fruit is most abundant, so it is speculated that green monkeys schedule their breeding around this time, when resources are most abundant. They breed about once a year, with males reaching sexual maturity in five years, females in two. Despite infant mortality being fairly high, at roughly 57%, green monkeys are known to be heavily invested in their offspring, with mothers taking care of their young for about a year before letting them venture out as individual adults.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode = packed heights = 150px>\nChlorocebus perspective.jpg|Skull of male\nGreen monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) with baby.jpg|Female with baby, [[The Gambia]]\nGreen monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) male.jpg|Male, [[Senegal]]\nGreen monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus).jpg|Young adult, [[The Gambia]]\nGreen monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) male rear.jpg|Rear of male, [[Senegal]]\nChlorocebus sabaeus 0024.jpg|Adult\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chlorocebus sabaeus|Green monkey}}\n* {{UCSC genomes|chlSab2}}\n\n{{C.Cercopithecinae nav}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q857996}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:monkey, green}}\n[[Category:Chlorocebus|green monkey]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Barbados]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Cape Verde]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1758|green monkey]]\n[[Category:Mammals of the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Mammals of West Africa]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Species of mammal}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| name = Green monkey<ref name=MSW3>{{MSW3 Groves|pages=158\u2013159|id=12100514}}</ref>\n| image = Gambia06Bijilo0015 (5421078756).jpg\n| image_caption = Female with juvenile, [[Gambia]]\n| status = LC\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref name=iucn>{{Cite iucn | author = Kingdon, J. | author2 = Gippoliti, S. | last-author-amp = yes | title = ''Chlorocebus sabaeus'' | volume = 2008 | page = e.T136265A4267012 | date = 2008 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2008.RLTS.T136265A4267012.en }}</ref>\n| genus = Chlorocebus\n| species = sabaeus\n| authority = ([[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]])\n| range_map = Chlorocebus sabaeus distribution.svg\n| range_map_caption = Geographic range\n}}\n\nThe '''green monkey''' (''Chlorocebus sabaeus''), also known as the '''sabaeus monkey''' or the '''callithrix monkey''',<ref name= Kingdon>{{cite book |last=Kingdon |first=J. |year=1997 |title=The Kingdon Guide to African Mammals |publisher=Academic Press Limited |location=London |isbn=0-12-408355-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/kingdonfieldguid00jona }}{{page needed|date=February 2015}}</ref> is an [[Old World monkey]] with golden-green fur and pale hands and feet.<ref name=cawthon/> The tip of the tail is golden yellow as are the backs of the thighs and cheek whiskers.<ref name=cawthon/> It does not have a distinguishing band of fur on the brow, like other ''[[Chlorocebus]]'' species, and males have a pale blue scrotum.<ref name=cawthon>{{cite web |author=Cawthon Lang, K.

They usually live in groups of up to 7 to 80 individuals. Within these groups, there is distinct social hierarchy evidenced by grooming behaviors and gender relationships.\n\nGreen monkeys are known to communicate both verbally and non-verbally. They have distinct calls which they use to warn others in the group of predators, and even have specific calls for specific predators. Body language, such as the display of brightly colored genitalia is also used to communicate danger, but can also be used as a way of establishing dominance. It has also been documented that green monkeys may use facial expressions to express their emotional state.<ref>Matthew Keller, [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Chlorocebus_sabaeus.html], \"Animal Diversity Web\", 3/26/12</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\nGreen monkeys live in a polygynous society, revolving around the alpha males. The alpha males have control over social interactions and mating between other males and females in the group.\n\nThese monkeys are seasonal breeders, breeding during the April to June months (October and November in the Nyes area North West of Thies), during which rainfall is the heaviest. It is during these rainy seasons that fruit is most abundant, so it is speculated that green monkeys schedule their breeding around this time, when resources are most abundant. They breed about once a year, with males reaching sexual maturity in five years, females in two. Despite infant mortality being fairly high, at roughly 57%, green monkeys are known to be heavily invested in their offspring, with mothers taking care of their young for about a year before letting them venture out as individual adults.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode = packed heights = 150px>\nChlorocebus perspective.jpg|Skull of male\nGreen monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) with baby.jpg|Female with baby, [[The Gambia]]\nGreen monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) male.jpg|Male, [[Senegal]]\nGreen monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus).jpg|Young adult, [[The Gambia]]\nGreen monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) male rear.jpg|Rear of male, [[Senegal]]\nChlorocebus sabaeus 0024.jpg|Adult\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chlorocebus sabaeus|Green monkey}}\n* {{UCSC genomes|chlSab2}}\n\n{{C.Cercopithecinae nav}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q857996}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:monkey, green}}\n[[Category:Chlorocebus|green monkey]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Barbados]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Cape Verde]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1758|green monkey]]\n[[Category:Mammals of the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Mammals of West Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Nihiltres", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHabitat and distribution:Fixed ISBN error (actually an ISSN)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_monkey"}
