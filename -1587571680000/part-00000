Both are private, Catholic academic institutions within the Metropolitan Manila area. The Ateneo men's varsity team is known as the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]], women's varsity team as the [[Ateneo Lady Eagles volleyball team|Ateneo Lady Eagles]], and high school team as the Ateneo Blue Eaglets. The De La Salle men's varsity team is known as the [[De La Salle Green Archers]], women's varsity team as the [[DLSU Lady Spikers|DLSU Lady Archers/Spikers]], and high school team as the [[DLSZ Junior Archers]].\n\n==History==\nDe La Salle and Ateneo were both co-founders of the pre-war NCAA but actively compete in the UAAP. The historied rivalry began when Ateneo lost to De La Salle in a hotly contested championship basketball game during the 16th NCAA Season (1939\u201340). Basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hard fought but was not yet tagged by the local sportswriters as the recognized rivalry. The more popular collegiate sports rivalries was between Ateneo versus San Beda, and De La Salle versus Letran. The rivalry between De La Salle vs Ateneo then was mostly based on their academic performance, debate, social status, prestige and school pride. When Ateneo and De La Salle transferred to the UAAP in 1978 and 1986 respectively, they continued their fierce battles and innate animosity against each other on and off court. The sports press showed interest and wrote about the school rivalry that always caught the attention of sports loving fans. The basketball games between De La Salle and Ateneo are the most anticipated battles in every UAAP season year after year. A Green Archer versus Blue Eagle fray would always draw huge, loyal crowds of fanatical students, school faculty and officials, notable and influential alumni, actors and actresses, musicians, business tycoons, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators, congressmen, justices of the Supreme Court, former Presidents of the Philippines, and several notable people of great influence in Philippine society. Several Ambassadors of the United States of America would gamely attend and watch a De La Salle vs Ateneo basketball game year after year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://humblebola.com/the-rewind-the-past-present-and-future-of-ateneo-la-salle/|title=THE REWIND: THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF ATENEO-LA SALLE|work=Humblebola|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/a-brief-history-of-the-ateneo-la-salle-rivalry-a1993-20170911-lfrm2|title=A Brief History of the Ateneo vs De La Salle rivalry|work=Esquire|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref> The rivalry started out with the men's basketball games and has since expanded to other sports, particularly in women's volleyball where both teams fought head-to-head in the UAAP Finals for six consecutive times from 2012 to 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.ph/volleyball/uaap-volleyball/1057045/defining-the-2010s-lady-spikers-dynastic-rule-in-the-uaap/|title=Defining the 2010s: Lady Spikers\u2019 dynastic rule in the UAAP|work=Fox Sports|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref> Both universities have also extended their rivalry beyond sports and have gone into their various fields of academic achievements, accomplishments, expertise and contributions to the upliftment of the Philippines.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1925, basketball games between Ateneo and De La Salle were played at an open basketball court at the Padre Faura, Ermita campus of UP and in 1926 at the Nozaleda Park (now called Agrifina Circle which is part of Luneta Park). The venue later moved to the covered courts of the US Army's 31st Infantry Gym and UST Gym.<ref>Suva GT: NCAA 25th Anniversary Souvenir Program, San Juan, Rizal: JCP Publishing, 1949</ref> The games then moved to the pre-war Rizal Memorial Coliseum to accommodate bigger crowds, and at one point, the venues included the Ateneo Loyola Center, the Cuneta Astrodome, the PhilSports Arena. Currently, the Smart Araneta Coliseum and the SM Mall of Asia Arena are the present main venues for their sold out games. Both the De La Salle and Ateneo games have an ever increasing loyal fan base that provides very high TV ratings that increases the commercial value of the UAAP brand year after year.\n\n==Head-to-head records by sport==\n\n===Seniors' division===\nPresently, the [[De La Salle Green Archers]] have more collegiate championships compared to the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]] in the NCAA<ref name=\"Championships\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org.ph/|title=\u2013 Championships|access-date=August 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605063046/http://www.ncaa.org.ph/|archive-date=June 5, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and UAAP combined in both men's and women's divisions.

The Blue Eagles won the men's basketball title over La Salle in 1958, 1988, 2002, 2008, and 2017 whereas the Green Archers prevailed in 1939, 1974, 2001, and 2016.\n\nIn the juniors' division, the De La Salle Junior Archers defeated the top-seeded Ateneo Blue Eaglets in 2007. In 2009, the Eaglets defeated the top-seeded Junior Archers.\n\n===Collegiate titles of national scope===\nIn terms of collegiate titles of national scope, Ateneo leads with five titles to La Salle's three. Ateneo won the Collegiate Champions League (CCL) title in 2007, and won back to back titles in the Philippine Collegiate Championship League (PCCL) in the 2009 and 2010 seasons, as well as in the 2018 and 2019 seasons. La Salle won the Philippine Intercollegiate Championship in 1988 and the Philippine Collegiate Championship in 2008 and 2013 against Ateneo and the SWU Cobras, respectively.<ref>https://goarchers.com/11802/green-archers-are-national-champions-defeats-swu-in-pccl-finals/</ref>\n\nAteneo won the 2007 Collegiate Champions League title against the [[University of the Visayas]] Green Lancers, 71\u201354. The [[Collegiate Champions League]] (CCL), was then reformatted and became the [[Philippine Collegiate Championship League]] (PCCL). It is currently the national collegiate basketball championship tournament, sanctioned by the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]], the country's official basketball federation. College teams from all over the country participate in the tournament. The tournament also has a Sweet 16 similar to the United States' NCAA Basketball Tournament during \"March Madness.\"\n\nThe Green Archers won the 2008 PCCL title. La Salle defeated the second-seeded NCAA champion [[San Beda Red Lions]] and arranged a finals meeting with the top-seeded UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles, who defeated the [[Letran Knights]] in the Final Four. In the championship match, the [[De La Salle Green Archers]] prevailed over the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]], 71\u201362.\n\nIn the 2009 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the FEU Tamaraws in three games to clinch their second national title, whereas the Green Archers were eliminated by the Letran Knights in their first game in the round of 16. In the 2010 season, the Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in three games to clinch their third and back-to-back national titles, while the Green Archers settled for 3rd-place beating the UC Webmasters despite having 4 players injured and only 10 players intact in the line-up.\n\nIn the 2013 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Green Archers defeated the South Western University Cobras, via sweep to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2008 and winning their second title in the tournament.\n\nIn the 2018 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the University of Visayas Green Lancers, 95\u201371 to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2010 and winning their fourth title in the tournament. In the 2019 season, the Blue Eagles defeated the San Beda Red Lions 57\u201346 to win their fifth title in the PCCL.<ref>https://sports.inquirer.net/388783/ateneo-repeats-as-pccl-champion-smothers-san-beda</ref>\n\n===Championship streaks===\nAteneo was 3-peat NCAA champion from 1931 through 1933, and its record of 14 collegiate titles remained unsurpassed by any school in the NCAA until 2003. They currently hold the distinction of having the longest UAAP basketball title streak in the Final Four era after winning five straight times from 2008 to 2012. In 2019, Ateneo achieved another 3-peat and became the first team in the UAAP Final Four era to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16\u20130) in the [[UAAP Season 82]] men's basketball tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/20/19/sweep-16-ateneo-wins-uaap-82-title-in-historic-fashion|title=Sweep 16!

The Ateneo Blue Eagles still have the most number of double titles in NCAA history, with four double championships, including the NCAA's second back-to-back double championships in 1975 and 1976 (the first was accomplished by the University of the Philippines in 1925 and 1926).\n\nAteneo holds the distinction of being the only double 3-peat champion in the senior and junior levels whether in the NCAA or UAAP, from 2008 to 2010, and has posted two 4-peats and three back-to-back title streaks in the UAAP juniors' division.\n\nLa Salle does not have any such streaks in the NCAA, but won back-to-back titles once in 1989 and 1990, and also posted a rare 4-peat in UAAP men's basketball from [[UAAP Season 61|1998]] to [[UAAP Season 64|2001]]. La Salle accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA (1939) and UAAP (2007).\n\nThe Lady Archers also achieved a 4-peat of their own from 1999 to 2002 which was the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era, until the NU Lady Bulldogs achieved their fifth consecutive championship in 2018.\n\nLa Salle holds the distinction of being the first and only school to be 3-peat UAAP basketball champions in both men's and women's divisions in the same period, from 1999 to 2001. In 2013, La Salle were champions in both divisions again in the [[UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments]].\n\n===NCAA===\nIn 1939, La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship. A legend states that the rivalry reputedly started that year when after La Salle defeated Ateneo, then the defending champions, La Salle students threw fried chicken outside the gates of the old Ateneo campus in [[Manila]].<ref name=\"guidon\">{{cite news |url=http://www.theguidon.com/?get=2004100204 |title=Tradition continues: The Eagle and The Archer |accessdate=2008-07-29 |author=Eric C.

Another finals meeting of both schools took place in 1974 with La Salle prevailing over Ateneo in the championship.

La Salle won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals, capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the UAAP Finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped of the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a Finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. In 2012, the two teams met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school. Ateneo failed to enter the Final Four in 2013 while La Salle won the title for the first time since 2007. Both teams failed to enter the Finals in 2014. In 2015, both teams failed once again to enter the Finals with La Salle missing the Final Four for the first time since 2011, while Ateneo made it to the semifinals but lost to the eventual champions FEU Tamaraws, who also ousted La Salle in their last game (a game in which La Salle needed to win to stay in contention and force a knockout match) for the last Final Four slot in which enabled the erstwhile defending champions NU Bulldogs to grab the #4 position in the playoffs. In 2016 both teams met in the Finals for the first time since 2008 with both schools taking the Top 2 spots at the end of the elimination rounds and having the twice to beat advantage, with La Salle outlasting Adamson in one game, while Ateneo used their twice to beat advantage to take out the defending champions FEU Tamaraws in a hard-fought series with Ateneo winning the second game in an overtime thriller in which both teams did not score more than five points in the extra period. In the Finals the Green Archers swept the Blue Eagles to win their 9th title and break the tie among them for the number of UAAP titles. In 2017, both Ateneo and La Salle met once again in the Finals and the first back-to-back Ateneo\u2013La Salle Finals series since 2002 with Ateneo winning this time in 3 full games that ended their 5-year title drought and dethroning La Salle in the process.\n\n'''2001 Finals: La Salle 4-peat'''<br />\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

La Salle would win in three games to deny FEU which had defeated Ateneo a season before, a back-to-back championship run.\n\nIn 2005, three teams, La Salle, Ateneo and UE, were all tied for second place. La Salle won the tiebreaker with a superior point differential on games played by the three teams, causing Ateneo and UE to play for the right to face La Salle with the twice-to-win ''disadvantage'' in which the Eagles won.

With these conditions, the first Ateneo\u2013La Salle game came at the heels of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]]'s death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66\u201363, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard Sam Marata shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007.  In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4\u20139, the Blue Eagles went on a 10\u20130 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74\u201357.\n\n2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.\n\nIn 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU Green Archers failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo Blue Eagles were the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the Finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in Gee Abanilla. The two schools met thrice that season- twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, Manny Pangilinan, announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, sweeping UST in the Finals.\n\n'''2013: The End of an Era for Ateneo'''\n\nUpon the departure of Norman Black, [[Bo Perasol|Dolreich \"Bo\" Perasol]], a former member of the [[UP Fighting Maroons|University of the Philippines men's basketball team]] and a seasoned [[Philippine Basketball Association]] head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward Chris Newsome.\n\nOver at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach Juno Sauler as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013\u20132014 UAAP season was Allan Caidic, who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards Jason Perkins and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, Mac Tallo, Fonzo Gotladera and Papot Paredes.\n\nFor the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round. During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena last July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard Almond Vosotros and center Arnold Van Opstal, defeated the Blue Eagles, 82\u201373, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season. The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum last September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66\u201364, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.\n\nToward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling. The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games. Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one-game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board. The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the [[UST Growling Tigers]].\n\nAteneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74\u201382, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.\n\nLa Salle, after a disastrous 3\u20134 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10\u20134, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the [[NU Bulldogs]] and the [[FEU Tamaraws]]. Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced the UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since [[UAAP Season 71]]. During the finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the [[UAAP Season 76]] men's basketball championship title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/124063/la-salle-beats-ust-in-overtime-for-uaap-title|title= La Salle rallies past UST in OT to win UAAP title|work=Inquirer|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''2016 Finals: Mayhem'''\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

The Green Archers finished the elimination round as the top seed with a 13\u20131 record with Ateneo coming in second with a 10\u20134 win-loss record. The only loss of the Green Archers came at the hands of their archivals, the Ateneo Blue Eagles during the second to the last game of the elimination round.

And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When [[La Salle Green Hills]] used to be the juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the [[Ateneo de Manila University#High School|Ateneo High School]] and the [[La Salle Green Hills#High School|LSGH High School]] are all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school [[De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School]], the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.\n\nIn juniors' basketball, Ateneo has 11 NCAA titles and 19 UAAP titles, for a total of 30, whereas La Salle has 6 NCAA titles and 2 UAAP titles, for 8 in total.\n\nLa Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Junior Championship. Ateneo High School and [[De La Salle Santiago Zobel School]] (DLSZ) met twice in the UAAP juniors' basketball finals; in [[UAAP Season 70|2007]] in which DLSZ won in two games dethroning the Eaglets in the process, and in [[UAAP Season 72|2009]] in which the Blue Eaglets won the best-of-three series, 2\u20131.  In addition, the Junior Archers were not able to defend their [[UAAP Season 68|2005 championship]] due to their suspension along with their seniors' counterparts.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jasmine |last=Payo |title=La Salle, Ateneo split UAAP juniors, women trophies |url=http://archive.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1&story_id=91544 |publisher=The [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=September 30, 2007 |accessdate=2009-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727152700/http://archive.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1 |archivedate=July 27, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Philippine University Games===\nAteneo has won the basketball crown of the Unigames 3 times (2008, 2009, and 2011).

However, the admission was made months after learning about the ineligibility. The UAAP Board forfeited their 2004\u201305 championship title and had to return their trophy. As a result, FEU was awarded the men's basketball championship for the 2004\u20132005 season. De La Salle team standings from 2003\u20132005 were revoked and De La Salle was suspended in the 2006\u201307 season from all UAAP events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/sports/view_article.php?article_id=33829|title=UAAP declares Tamaraws 2004 cage champions}}</ref>\n\n==Volleyball==\n\n=== Overall ===\n\nIn terms of total collegiate and high school volleyball titles won in the NCAA and UAAP, La Salle leads with 42 championships compared to Ateneo's 15 championships. In the seniors' division, La Salle leads Ateneo 18\u20139. La Salle was 4-peat NCAA men's champions from Seasons 53 to 56. The Green Spikers were also UAAP men's champions in Seasons 64 and 66. The Lady Spikers were the first NCAA women's champions in volleyball when the tournament was introduced in NCAA Season 51 (1975\u201376) and have 11 UAAP titles. They are thrice 3-peat UAAP women's champions (2004\u20132006, 2011\u20132013, and 2016\u20132018), and hold the distinction of having appeared in the Finals for ten consecutive times from UAAP Seasons 71 to 80 (2009\u20132018) which is the longest streak in the Final Four era of the UAAP.\n\nAteneo won the double (men's and women's) volleyball championship in NCAA Season 52 (1976\u201377), won its first UAAP volleyball championship in Season 76, and won the double UAAP volleyball championship in Season 77. The Lady Eagles were back-to-back UAAP women's champions in Seasons 76 and 77, and won their third title in Season 81. The Lady Eagles hold the distinction of being first team in the UAAP Final Four era to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16\u20130) in the [[UAAP Season 77]] women's volleyball tournament. The Blue Eagles were 3-peat UAAP  men's champions from Seasons 77 to 79 (2015\u20132017), and were also able to achieve a perfect season in the [[UAAP Season 79]] men's volleyball tournament.\n\nThe Ateneo Lady Eagles and the De La Salle Lady Spikers have met in the championships of the UAAP for six (6) consecutive times from Seasons 74 to 79 (2012\u20132017). The Lady Eagles won the women's volleyball title over La Salle in 2014 and 2015 whereas the Lady Spikers prevailed in 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017.\n\nIn the juniors' division, La Salle has 24 championships while Ateneo has 6 (Ateneo does not have a girls' team in the juniors' division). The Blue Eaglet Spikers won championship titles in NCAA Seasons 43, 45, and 48, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 50 to 52. The De La Salle Junior Spikers won 7 championship titles under their membership stint in the NCAA which included a 4-peat championship streak along with the Green Spikers from Seasons 53 to 56. In the UAAP, they were 6-peat champions in the boys' division from Seasons 57 to 62, and have also won the title in Season 66. The Junior Lady Spikers were 5-peat champions from UAAP Seasons 57 to 61, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 73 to 75. They also won additional titles in UAAP Seasons 65 and 81.\n\n=== UAAP Season 74 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the first time in UAAP history, Ateneo and La Salle met each other at the [[UAAP Season 74 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 74 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, consistently ranked second throughout much of the elimination round, defeated the third-seeded (and [[UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments|previous season's]] runner-up) [[UST Growling Tigers|UST Tigresses]] in the semifinals, and entered the finals for the first time since Ateneo De Manila University's 1978 admission into the UAAP.\n\nThe De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the Ateneo Lady Eagles in three games to win their 7th UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Game One of the Finals was won by Ateneo in four sets but Games Two and Three of the series were won by La Salle, with the DLSU Lady Spikers beating the Ateneo Lady Spikers in four sets during Game Two and in three sets during Game Three. [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] of La Salle was named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while then-graduating La Salle team captain [[Cha Cruz|Charleen Cruz]] was named as Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second consecutive season.<ref>https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/02/29/12/la-salle-blasts-ateneo-retain-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/249851/la-salle-crushes-ateneo-to-repeat-as-uaap-women-s-volleyball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 75 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nAteneo and La Salle faced each other once again during the [[UAAP Season 75 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 75 women's volleyball finals]] after the De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the [[NU Bulldogs|NU Lady Bulldogs]] and the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the [[Adamson Falcons|Adamson Lady Falcons]] during the Final Four matches that were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] on February 23, 2013.\n\nThe UAAP Season 75 women's volleyball finals was the league's first volleyball finals series to be played at the Smart Araneta Coliseum and the Mall of Asia Arena. Game One of the Ateneo-La Salle finals was played before a crowd of 17,342 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on March 2, 2013. The Lady Spikers posed a comeback win over the Lady Eagles in five sets, 20\u201325, 17\u201325, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 15\u20136.\n\nPrior to Game Two of the finals, held at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] on March 6, 2013, team captain [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] and teammate [[Victonara Galang]] were named co-Most Valuable Players (MVPs) of the Season. With the game attended by 18,779 paying patrons, La Salle swept Ateneo in Game Two, 25\u201323, 25\u201320, 25\u201316, to finish the series in two games and win their third consecutive (and 8th overall) UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Then-graduating La Salle player [[Michele Gumabao]] was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/298005/sports/campussports/uaap-dlsu-defeats-ateneo-for-the-women-s-volleyball-crown-completes-3-peat</ref><ref>https://www.philstar.com/sports/2013/03/06/916692/la-salle-blazes-way-uaap-womens-volleyball-three-peat</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 76 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the third time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 76 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, under new head coach Anusorn \"Tai\" Bundit, were able to reach the finals after winning knockout matches against fourth-seeded Adamson Lady Falcons and then second-seeded, twice-to-beat NU Lady Bulldogs under the stepladder format.\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 5, 2014, was won by Ateneo in four sets, 17\u201325, 25\u201323, 25\u201313, 25\u201320. Three days later, on March 8, 2014, La Salle bounced back in Game Two and defeated Ateneo in four sets, 25\u201314, 25\u201320, 19\u201325, 26\u201324. The first two games of the Finals were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].\n\nThe venue of the remaining games of the Finals shifted from the Smart Araneta Coliseum to the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. In Game Three, which was held on March 12, 2014, Ateneo defeated La Salle in five sets in front of the 18,095-strong crowd, 25\u201321, 25\u201323, 18\u201325, 16\u201325, 17\u201315, to force a winner-take-all title match on March 15, 2014. As a result, the UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series became the league's longest championship series in any sport, and the first to last up to four games (in a best-of-five finals series format with a 1\u20130 advantage for any team). In Game Four, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers, 25\u201323, 26\u201324, 25\u201321, to deny La Salle's second overall four-peat championship bid and win their first UAAP women's volleyball championship title at the Mall of Asia Arena after a 21,314-strong audience.\n\nAteneo's team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, and became the first UAAP athlete to win at least 4 awards in a single season (including awards for the Season's Best Scorer and Best Server categories).<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/53094-ateneo-upsets-de-la-salle-wins-first-uaap-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/353812/united-they-fly-how-the-admu-lady-eagles-became-uaap-vball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 77 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fourth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 77 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 77 women's volleyball finals]]. For the first time in UAAP history, the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the De La Salle Lady Spikers twice during the elimination rounds, and entered the finals with the thrice-to-beat advantage after amassing a 14\u20130 eliminations sweeps record. On the other hand, the second-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered their first defeat from a non-Ateneo team in the tournament (since UST Tigresses' shocking five-set season-opening win against DLSU in Season 75) during Game One against the third-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in the semifinals (in straight sets), but recovered in Game Two in four sets at the expense of then La Salle's Team Captain Victonara Galang's post-season injury (which sidelined her from playing for Season 77 Finals).\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 11, 2015 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in front of 18,363 fans, was won by Ateneo in straight sets, 25\u201318, 25\u201319, 25\u201319. Three days later, on March 14, 2015, watched by 20,705 fans at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]], Ateneo swept La Salle again in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201317, 25\u201323, becoming the league's first ever overall volleyball varsity team to achieve a 16\u20130 perfect season (eliminations round up to the championship series) record and defeated La Salle for the second consecutive season to win the UAAP Season 77 volleyball championship title. Ateneo team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while [[Amy Ahomiro]] won the award as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/452461/uaap-ateneo-shuts-out-la-salle-for-perfect-season-wins-second-straight-women-s-volleyball-title/story/?ref=related_stories</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/admu/86845-ateneo-sweeps-season-repeat-uaap-volleyball-champion</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 78 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fifth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 78 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of the eliminations, the eventually second-seeded DLSU Lady Spikers swept the season's top-seeded ADMU Lady Eagles in three straight sets to deny them a sweep of the elimination round and revert the tournament to a [[UAAP Final Four|Regular Final Four]] format for the first time since Season 75. In the second round, however, Ateneo recovered in a five-set comeback win to seal their top-seed position. After the eliminations, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the [[UP Fighting Maroons|UP Lady Maroons]] during their comeback Final Four appearance after 13 years in three straight sets (the first non-DLSU team to defeat them as UAAP women's volleyball champions) in the semifinals in a return trip to the finals for fifth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the De La Salle Lady Spikers recovered from a shocking five-set loss in Game 1 of their Final Four match-up against the third-seeded [[FEU Tamaraws|FEU Lady Tamaraws]] to sweep their opponents in do-or-die Game 2 and book their eighth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nThe UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals became the first championship series since the DLSU\u2013FEU match-up in [[UAAP Season 71 volleyball tournaments|Season 71]] to last up to three games under such tournament division (in a best-of-three finals series format). Game One of the Finals, which was held on April 23, 2016 and watched by 19,921 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, was won by La Salle in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 25\u201321. Four days later, on April 27, 2016, Ateneo posed a come-from-behind win against La Salle in Game Two in five sets, 18\u201325, 26\u201328, 25\u201317, 25\u201316, 15\u201311, in front of the 20,541-strong crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena to force a winner-take-all match on April 30, 2016. La Salle, however, recovered in four sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201321, 25\u201316, 25\u201316 in Game Three to deny Ateneo's three-peat championship bid and win their ninth overall UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and first since Season 75) in front of a record 22,858-strong crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n\nGraduating Ateneo Lady Eagles' team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] earned her third straight Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, becoming the first UAAP women's volleyball athlete to earn three consecutive MVP awards since Monica Aleta from FEU from Seasons 63 to 65. Meanwhile, [[Kim Kianna Dy]] of the De La Salle Lady Spikers was hailed as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2016/04/30/la-salle-ateneo-uaap-volleyball-championship.html</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/131321-ateneo-la-salle-volleyball-game-3-finals-recap-2016-season-78</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the sixth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 79 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 79 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of eliminations, the defending champions (and eventually second-seeded) De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered a shock straight sets loss to the UP Lady Maroons but recovered in the second round of eliminations against the same team with another straight sets victory. Meanwhile, the Ateneo Lady Eagles suffered losses only to the NU Lady Bulldogs twice in the elimination rounds but swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the elimination rounds to secure the top seed for this season (marking the most recent time that Ateneo won against La Salle in any of their match-ups in UAAP women's volleyball as of the [[UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournaments|current season]]). In the semifinal round, the De La Salle Lady Spikers won over the third-seeded UST Tigresses during the latter's comeback Final Four appearance after 5 years in four sets to book their (Final Four era) league-record ninth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles also won against the fourth-seeded FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets to book their sixth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nGame One of the Finals was held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 2, 2017 in front of 13,468 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers recorded their first victory against Ateneo Lady Eagles during this game for this season in four sets, 21\u201325, 29\u201327, 25\u201322 and 25\u201320. Game Two of the Finals was held again at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 6, 2017 in front of 20,860 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers won against Ateneo Lady Eagles in five sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201314, 18\u201325, 25\u201318 and 15\u201310, to finish the series in two games and earn their second consecutive (and tenth overall) UAAP women's volleyball title. La Salle's [[Mary Joy Baron]] and [[Desiree Cheng]] were named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, respectively.<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/169078-lady-spikers-win-back-to-back-titles-sweep-ateneo</ref><ref>https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/uaap-season-79-womens-volleyball-la-salle-reigns-for-10th-time-vanquishes-ateneo/84567</ref>\n\nSeason 79 would eventually be the last of the string of six consecutive Ateneo\u2013La Salle match-ups in the UAAP women's volleyball finals since Season 74, after the Lady Eagles were booted out from finals contention in [[UAAP Season 80 volleyball tournaments|Season 80]] as the third-seeded team by that season's hosting school and second-seeded team FEU Lady Tamaraws to face the top-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers in the latter's tenth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance in 2018, and the first all-green (DLSU\u2013FEU) UAAP women's volleyball finals match-up since Season 71.\n\nLa Salle went on to sweep FEU in the finals to win their 11th UAAP women's volleyball title (and their third three-peat championship streak) in 2018,<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/201607-dlsu-lady-spikers-winner-feu-tamaraws-season-80-finals-game-2</ref> but was dethroned by UST in their Final Four match-up [[UAAP Season 81 volleyball tournaments|the following year]], ending their third overall bid for four straight championships and 10 consecutive years of appearance in the UAAP Finals, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles won the same year's Final Four match-up against FEU to pose their return to the finals after missing the cut in the previous year.

[[Joel Banal]], Ateneo's head coach from 2002 to [[UAAP Season 66|2003]], used to have nightmares about La Salle's dreaded [[Full-court press|press]], and considers the 2002 championship as his greatest accomplishment, after which Ateneo alums would pay for his restaurant bills. Moreover, Ateneo alumni installed the playing floor on the [[2000 NBA All-Star Game]] to the [[Moro Lorenzo Sports Center]], while [[ICTSI]] shipping magnate Billionaire [[Enrique K.

The historied rivalry began when Ateneo lost to De La Salle in a hotly contested championship basketball game during the 16th NCAA Season (1939\u201340). Basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hard fought but was not yet tagged by the local sportswriters as the recognized rivalry. The more popular collegiate sports rivalries was between Ateneo versus San Beda, and De La Salle versus Letran. The rivalry between De La Salle vs Ateneo then was mostly based on their academic performance, debate, social status, prestige and school pride. When Ateneo and De La Salle transferred to the UAAP in 1978 and 1986 respectively, they continued their fierce battles and innate animosity against each other on and off court. The sports press showed interest and wrote about the school rivalry that always caught the attention of sports loving fans. The basketball games between De La Salle and Ateneo are the most anticipated battles in every UAAP season year after year. A Green Archer versus Blue Eagle fray would always draw huge, loyal crowds of fanatical students, school faculty and officials, notable and influential alumni, actors and actresses, musicians, business tycoons, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators, congressmen, justices of the Supreme Court, former Presidents of the Philippines, and several notable people of great influence in Philippine society. Several Ambassadors of the United States of America would gamely attend and watch a De La Salle vs Ateneo basketball game year after year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://humblebola.com/the-rewind-the-past-present-and-future-of-ateneo-la-salle/|title=THE REWIND: THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF ATENEO-LA SALLE|work=Humblebola|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/a-brief-history-of-the-ateneo-la-salle-rivalry-a1993-20170911-lfrm2|title=A Brief History of the Ateneo vs De La Salle rivalry|work=Esquire|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref> The rivalry started out with the men's basketball games and has since expanded to other sports, particularly in women's volleyball where both teams fought head-to-head in the UAAP Finals for six consecutive times from 2012 to 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.ph/volleyball/uaap-volleyball/1057045/defining-the-2010s-lady-spikers-dynastic-rule-in-the-uaap/|title=Defining the 2010s: Lady Spikers\u2019 dynastic rule in the UAAP|work=Fox Sports|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref> Both universities have also extended their rivalry beyond sports and have gone into their various fields of academic achievements, accomplishments, expertise and contributions to the upliftment of the Philippines.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1925, basketball games between Ateneo and De La Salle were played at an open basketball court at the Padre Faura, Ermita campus of UP and in 1926 at the Nozaleda Park (now called Agrifina Circle which is part of Luneta Park).

La Salle accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA (1939) and UAAP (2007).\n\nThe Lady Archers also achieved a 4-peat of their own from 1999 to 2002 which was the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era, until the NU Lady Bulldogs achieved their fifth consecutive championship in 2018.\n\nLa Salle holds the distinction of being the first and only school to be 3-peat UAAP basketball champions in both men's and women's divisions in the same period, from 1999 to 2001.

La Salle won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals, capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the UAAP Finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped of the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a Finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. In 2012, the two teams met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school. Ateneo failed to enter the Final Four in 2013 while La Salle won the title for the first time since 2007. Both teams failed to enter the Finals in 2014. In 2015, both teams failed once again to enter the Finals with La Salle missing the Final Four for the first time since 2011, while Ateneo made it to the semifinals but lost to the eventual champions FEU Tamaraws, who also ousted La Salle in their last game (a game in which La Salle needed to win to stay in contention and force a knockout match) for the last Final Four slot in which enabled the erstwhile defending champions NU Bulldogs to grab the #4 position in the playoffs. In 2016 both teams met in the Finals for the first time since 2008 with both schools taking the Top 2 spots at the end of the elimination rounds and having the twice to beat advantage, with La Salle outlasting Adamson in one game, while Ateneo used their twice to beat advantage to take out the defending champions FEU Tamaraws in a hard-fought series with Ateneo winning the second game in an overtime thriller in which both teams did not score more than five points in the extra period. In the Finals the Green Archers swept the Blue Eagles to win their 9th title and break the tie among them for the number of UAAP titles. In 2017, both Ateneo and La Salle met once again in the Finals and the first back-to-back Ateneo\u2013La Salle Finals series since 2002 with Ateneo winning this time in 3 full games that ended their 5-year title drought and dethroning La Salle in the process.\n\n'''2001 Finals: La Salle 4-peat'''<br />\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

In 2003, La Salle forced No. 1 seed Ateneo into a rubber match after a 76\u201372 overtime win, with the game being halted after a brawl erupted between the two teams. With Ateneo's [[LA Tenorio]] and La Salle's [[Ryan Ara\u00f1a]] suspended for the deciding game, Ateneo eliminated La Salle from Finals contention in the deciding game with a 74\u201368 triumph.\n\nIn [[UAAP Season 67|2004]], La Salle and Ateneo finished the elimination round tied for second place, so a playoff game was played to determine which team gets the twice-to-beat advantage. La Salle won the game, and ended Ateneo's season in the semifinals, to face FEU in the Finals. La Salle would win in three games to deny FEU which had defeated Ateneo a season before, a back-to-back championship run.\n\nIn 2005, three teams, La Salle, Ateneo and UE, were all tied for second place. La Salle won the tiebreaker with a superior point differential on games played by the three teams, causing Ateneo and UE to play for the right to face La Salle with the twice-to-win ''disadvantage'' in which the Eagles won. However, La Salle defeated Ateneo in the semifinals to clinch another Finals appearance against FEU.\n\n'''2006: La Salle Suspension'''\n\nAfter FEU swept La Salle in the 2005 championship series, La Salle admitted it fielded two ineligible players from 2003 to 2005, albeit it claimed not to be aware of their ineligibility which caused them to return the 2005 runner-up trophy and the 2004 championship trophy they won against FEU (The league would later award FEU the trophy). The league suspended La Salle in [[UAAP Season 69|2006]] for a year due to negligence, with all of their games during that period also forfeited.

Prior to this, Ateneo won the two elimination round games against La Salle.\n\nUnlike earlier match-ups where the team with the advantage won the first game, Ateneo won the first game, with [[Chris Tiu]] playing pivotal roles in crunch time where he scored the winning lay-up with 7.3 seconds remaining to force a deciding game.<ref name=\"GMANews.tv\">{{cite news|title=UAAP: Eagles upset Archers, 65\u201364, to force 1 more game |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/62225/UAAP-Eagles-upset-Archers-65-64-to-force-1-more-game |publisher=GMANews.tv |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2009-06-05 }}</ref> In their fifth meeting of the season, [[Pocholo Villanueva]] scored a three-pointer to add La Salle's lead to nine with less than three minutes in the game left.

With these conditions, the first Ateneo\u2013La Salle game came at the heels of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]]'s death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66\u201363, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard Sam Marata shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007.  In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4\u20139, the Blue Eagles went on a 10\u20130 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74\u201357.\n\n2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.\n\nIn 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU Green Archers failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo Blue Eagles were the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the Finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in Gee Abanilla. The two schools met thrice that season- twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, Manny Pangilinan, announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, sweeping UST in the Finals.\n\n'''2013: The End of an Era for Ateneo'''\n\nUpon the departure of Norman Black, [[Bo Perasol|Dolreich \"Bo\" Perasol]], a former member of the [[UP Fighting Maroons|University of the Philippines men's basketball team]] and a seasoned [[Philippine Basketball Association]] head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward Chris Newsome.\n\nOver at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach Juno Sauler as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013\u20132014 UAAP season was Allan Caidic, who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards Jason Perkins and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, Mac Tallo, Fonzo Gotladera and Papot Paredes.\n\nFor the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round. During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena last July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard Almond Vosotros and center Arnold Van Opstal, defeated the Blue Eagles, 82\u201373, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season. The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum last September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66\u201364, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.\n\nToward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling. The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games. Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one-game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board. The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the [[UST Growling Tigers]].\n\nAteneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74\u201382, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.\n\nLa Salle, after a disastrous 3\u20134 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10\u20134, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the [[NU Bulldogs]] and the [[FEU Tamaraws]]. Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced the UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since [[UAAP Season 71]]. During the finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the [[UAAP Season 76]] men's basketball championship title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/124063/la-salle-beats-ust-in-overtime-for-uaap-title|title= La Salle rallies past UST in OT to win UAAP title|work=Inquirer|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''2016 Finals: Mayhem'''\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When [[La Salle Green Hills]] used to be the juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the [[Ateneo de Manila University#High School|Ateneo High School]] and the [[La Salle Green Hills#High School|LSGH High School]] are all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school [[De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School]], the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.\n\nIn juniors' basketball, Ateneo has 11 NCAA titles and 19 UAAP titles, for a total of 30, whereas La Salle has 6 NCAA titles and 2 UAAP titles, for 8 in total.\n\nLa Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Junior Championship. Ateneo High School and [[De La Salle Santiago Zobel School]] (DLSZ) met twice in the UAAP juniors' basketball finals; in [[UAAP Season 70|2007]] in which DLSZ won in two games dethroning the Eaglets in the process, and in [[UAAP Season 72|2009]] in which the Blue Eaglets won the best-of-three series, 2\u20131.

The Blue Eagles were 3-peat UAAP  men's champions from Seasons 77 to 79 (2015\u20132017), and were also able to achieve a perfect season in the [[UAAP Season 79]] men's volleyball tournament.\n\nThe Ateneo Lady Eagles and the De La Salle Lady Spikers have met in the championships of the UAAP for six (6) consecutive times from Seasons 74 to 79 (2012\u20132017). The Lady Eagles won the women's volleyball title over La Salle in 2014 and 2015 whereas the Lady Spikers prevailed in 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017.\n\nIn the juniors' division, La Salle has 24 championships while Ateneo has 6 (Ateneo does not have a girls' team in the juniors' division). The Blue Eaglet Spikers won championship titles in NCAA Seasons 43, 45, and 48, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 50 to 52. The De La Salle Junior Spikers won 7 championship titles under their membership stint in the NCAA which included a 4-peat championship streak along with the Green Spikers from Seasons 53 to 56. In the UAAP, they were 6-peat champions in the boys' division from Seasons 57 to 62, and have also won the title in Season 66. The Junior Lady Spikers were 5-peat champions from UAAP Seasons 57 to 61, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 73 to 75. They also won additional titles in UAAP Seasons 65 and 81.\n\n=== UAAP Season 74 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the first time in UAAP history, Ateneo and La Salle met each other at the [[UAAP Season 74 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 74 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, consistently ranked second throughout much of the elimination round, defeated the third-seeded (and [[UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments|previous season's]] runner-up) [[UST Growling Tigers|UST Tigresses]] in the semifinals, and entered the finals for the first time since Ateneo De Manila University's 1978 admission into the UAAP.\n\nThe De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the Ateneo Lady Eagles in three games to win their 7th UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Game One of the Finals was won by Ateneo in four sets but Games Two and Three of the series were won by La Salle, with the DLSU Lady Spikers beating the Ateneo Lady Spikers in four sets during Game Two and in three sets during Game Three. [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] of La Salle was named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while then-graduating La Salle team captain [[Cha Cruz|Charleen Cruz]] was named as Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second consecutive season.<ref>https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/02/29/12/la-salle-blasts-ateneo-retain-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/249851/la-salle-crushes-ateneo-to-repeat-as-uaap-women-s-volleyball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 75 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nAteneo and La Salle faced each other once again during the [[UAAP Season 75 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 75 women's volleyball finals]] after the De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the [[NU Bulldogs|NU Lady Bulldogs]] and the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the [[Adamson Falcons|Adamson Lady Falcons]] during the Final Four matches that were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] on February 23, 2013.\n\nThe UAAP Season 75 women's volleyball finals was the league's first volleyball finals series to be played at the Smart Araneta Coliseum and the Mall of Asia Arena. Game One of the Ateneo-La Salle finals was played before a crowd of 17,342 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on March 2, 2013. The Lady Spikers posed a comeback win over the Lady Eagles in five sets, 20\u201325, 17\u201325, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 15\u20136.\n\nPrior to Game Two of the finals, held at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] on March 6, 2013, team captain [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] and teammate [[Victonara Galang]] were named co-Most Valuable Players (MVPs) of the Season. With the game attended by 18,779 paying patrons, La Salle swept Ateneo in Game Two, 25\u201323, 25\u201320, 25\u201316, to finish the series in two games and win their third consecutive (and 8th overall) UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Then-graduating La Salle player [[Michele Gumabao]] was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/298005/sports/campussports/uaap-dlsu-defeats-ateneo-for-the-women-s-volleyball-crown-completes-3-peat</ref><ref>https://www.philstar.com/sports/2013/03/06/916692/la-salle-blazes-way-uaap-womens-volleyball-three-peat</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 76 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the third time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 76 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, under new head coach Anusorn \"Tai\" Bundit, were able to reach the finals after winning knockout matches against fourth-seeded Adamson Lady Falcons and then second-seeded, twice-to-beat NU Lady Bulldogs under the stepladder format.\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 5, 2014, was won by Ateneo in four sets, 17\u201325, 25\u201323, 25\u201313, 25\u201320. Three days later, on March 8, 2014, La Salle bounced back in Game Two and defeated Ateneo in four sets, 25\u201314, 25\u201320, 19\u201325, 26\u201324. The first two games of the Finals were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].\n\nThe venue of the remaining games of the Finals shifted from the Smart Araneta Coliseum to the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. In Game Three, which was held on March 12, 2014, Ateneo defeated La Salle in five sets in front of the 18,095-strong crowd, 25\u201321, 25\u201323, 18\u201325, 16\u201325, 17\u201315, to force a winner-take-all title match on March 15, 2014. As a result, the UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series became the league's longest championship series in any sport, and the first to last up to four games (in a best-of-five finals series format with a 1\u20130 advantage for any team). In Game Four, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers, 25\u201323, 26\u201324, 25\u201321, to deny La Salle's second overall four-peat championship bid and win their first UAAP women's volleyball championship title at the Mall of Asia Arena after a 21,314-strong audience.\n\nAteneo's team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, and became the first UAAP athlete to win at least 4 awards in a single season (including awards for the Season's Best Scorer and Best Server categories).<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/53094-ateneo-upsets-de-la-salle-wins-first-uaap-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/353812/united-they-fly-how-the-admu-lady-eagles-became-uaap-vball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 77 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fourth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 77 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 77 women's volleyball finals]]. For the first time in UAAP history, the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the De La Salle Lady Spikers twice during the elimination rounds, and entered the finals with the thrice-to-beat advantage after amassing a 14\u20130 eliminations sweeps record. On the other hand, the second-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered their first defeat from a non-Ateneo team in the tournament (since UST Tigresses' shocking five-set season-opening win against DLSU in Season 75) during Game One against the third-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in the semifinals (in straight sets), but recovered in Game Two in four sets at the expense of then La Salle's Team Captain Victonara Galang's post-season injury (which sidelined her from playing for Season 77 Finals).\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 11, 2015 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in front of 18,363 fans, was won by Ateneo in straight sets, 25\u201318, 25\u201319, 25\u201319. Three days later, on March 14, 2015, watched by 20,705 fans at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]], Ateneo swept La Salle again in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201317, 25\u201323, becoming the league's first ever overall volleyball varsity team to achieve a 16\u20130 perfect season (eliminations round up to the championship series) record and defeated La Salle for the second consecutive season to win the UAAP Season 77 volleyball championship title. Ateneo team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while [[Amy Ahomiro]] won the award as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/452461/uaap-ateneo-shuts-out-la-salle-for-perfect-season-wins-second-straight-women-s-volleyball-title/story/?ref=related_stories</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/admu/86845-ateneo-sweeps-season-repeat-uaap-volleyball-champion</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 78 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fifth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 78 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of the eliminations, the eventually second-seeded DLSU Lady Spikers swept the season's top-seeded ADMU Lady Eagles in three straight sets to deny them a sweep of the elimination round and revert the tournament to a [[UAAP Final Four|Regular Final Four]] format for the first time since Season 75. In the second round, however, Ateneo recovered in a five-set comeback win to seal their top-seed position. After the eliminations, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the [[UP Fighting Maroons|UP Lady Maroons]] during their comeback Final Four appearance after 13 years in three straight sets (the first non-DLSU team to defeat them as UAAP women's volleyball champions) in the semifinals in a return trip to the finals for fifth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the De La Salle Lady Spikers recovered from a shocking five-set loss in Game 1 of their Final Four match-up against the third-seeded [[FEU Tamaraws|FEU Lady Tamaraws]] to sweep their opponents in do-or-die Game 2 and book their eighth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nThe UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals became the first championship series since the DLSU\u2013FEU match-up in [[UAAP Season 71 volleyball tournaments|Season 71]] to last up to three games under such tournament division (in a best-of-three finals series format). Game One of the Finals, which was held on April 23, 2016 and watched by 19,921 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, was won by La Salle in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 25\u201321. Four days later, on April 27, 2016, Ateneo posed a come-from-behind win against La Salle in Game Two in five sets, 18\u201325, 26\u201328, 25\u201317, 25\u201316, 15\u201311, in front of the 20,541-strong crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena to force a winner-take-all match on April 30, 2016. La Salle, however, recovered in four sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201321, 25\u201316, 25\u201316 in Game Three to deny Ateneo's three-peat championship bid and win their ninth overall UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and first since Season 75) in front of a record 22,858-strong crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n\nGraduating Ateneo Lady Eagles' team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] earned her third straight Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, becoming the first UAAP women's volleyball athlete to earn three consecutive MVP awards since Monica Aleta from FEU from Seasons 63 to 65. Meanwhile, [[Kim Kianna Dy]] of the De La Salle Lady Spikers was hailed as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2016/04/30/la-salle-ateneo-uaap-volleyball-championship.html</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/131321-ateneo-la-salle-volleyball-game-3-finals-recap-2016-season-78</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the sixth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 79 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 79 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of eliminations, the defending champions (and eventually second-seeded) De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered a shock straight sets loss to the UP Lady Maroons but recovered in the second round of eliminations against the same team with another straight sets victory. Meanwhile, the Ateneo Lady Eagles suffered losses only to the NU Lady Bulldogs twice in the elimination rounds but swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the elimination rounds to secure the top seed for this season (marking the most recent time that Ateneo won against La Salle in any of their match-ups in UAAP women's volleyball as of the [[UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournaments|current season]]). In the semifinal round, the De La Salle Lady Spikers won over the third-seeded UST Tigresses during the latter's comeback Final Four appearance after 5 years in four sets to book their (Final Four era) league-record ninth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles also won against the fourth-seeded FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets to book their sixth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nGame One of the Finals was held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 2, 2017 in front of 13,468 fans.

La Salle's [[Mary Joy Baron]] and [[Desiree Cheng]] were named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, respectively.<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/169078-lady-spikers-win-back-to-back-titles-sweep-ateneo</ref><ref>https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/uaap-season-79-womens-volleyball-la-salle-reigns-for-10th-time-vanquishes-ateneo/84567</ref>\n\nSeason 79 would eventually be the last of the string of six consecutive Ateneo\u2013La Salle match-ups in the UAAP women's volleyball finals since Season 74, after the Lady Eagles were booted out from finals contention in [[UAAP Season 80 volleyball tournaments|Season 80]] as the third-seeded team by that season's hosting school and second-seeded team FEU Lady Tamaraws to face the top-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers in the latter's tenth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance in 2018, and the first all-green (DLSU\u2013FEU) UAAP women's volleyball finals match-up since Season 71.\n\nLa Salle went on to sweep FEU in the finals to win their 11th UAAP women's volleyball title (and their third three-peat championship streak) in 2018,<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/201607-dlsu-lady-spikers-winner-feu-tamaraws-season-80-finals-game-2</ref> but was dethroned by UST in their Final Four match-up [[UAAP Season 81 volleyball tournaments|the following year]], ending their third overall bid for four straight championships and 10 consecutive years of appearance in the UAAP Finals, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles won the same year's Final Four match-up against FEU to pose their return to the finals after missing the cut in the previous year. The Lady Eagles went on to win the finals series against UST, 2\u20131, in the first ever Ateneo\u2013UST UAAP women's volleyball finals showdown to claim their third women's volleyball title.<ref>https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2019/05/18/uaap-season-81-finals-lady-eagles-reclaim-throne-56887</ref>\n\n==Women's volleyball tournament results==\n\nThe rivalry began in [[UAAP Season 74]] when both teams met in the Finals for the first time.

[[Joel Banal]], Ateneo's head coach from 2002 to [[UAAP Season 66|2003]], used to have nightmares about La Salle's dreaded [[Full-court press|press]], and considers the 2002 championship as his greatest accomplishment, after which Ateneo alums would pay for his restaurant bills. Moreover, Ateneo alumni installed the playing floor on the [[2000 NBA All-Star Game]] to the [[Moro Lorenzo Sports Center]], while [[ICTSI]] shipping magnate Billionaire [[Enrique K. Razon|Enrique Razon, Jr.]] donated US$1 million to refurbish La Salle's sporting facilities at the [[Enrique M.
