The village that formed around the trading post was called Hoffman's. The middle Kuskokwim Valley was seeing and influx of gold prospectors at that time and Hoffman's became an important supply and trade center. George Hoffman would soon relocated to [[Georgetown, Alaska|Georgetown]], and the name of the village was changed to Napaimute. In [[Yup'ik language]], the word Napaimute translates to \"forest people\". The first territorial school along the Kuskokwim River was built in 1920 at Napaimute. By 1930, the US census was reporting a Napaimute population of 111, however, the population then began to decline, and by 1969, the village's last permanent resident had left the village. With the passage of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] in 1971, a village corporation called Napaimute Limited was formed and in 1975, one of its members established permanent residency at the village. the village council was able to receive federal recognition as an [[Alaska Native Tribe]] in 1994, which enabled it to start receiving funding from the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. Current efforts to revitalize the community are evident by the set up of a sawmill in 2001, tribal operations in 2002, and an airport feasibility study launched in 2004.\n\n==Geography==\nGeorgetown is located at {{coord|61|32|N|158|40|W|region:US_type:city}} on the north bank of the upper [[Kuskokwim River]] 28 miles east of [[Aniak, Alaska|Aniak]] in the Kilbuck-Kuskokwim mountains.

This statement provoked an uproar, and Musharraf later denied having made it.<ref name=\"South Asia Tribune\" />\n\nThe statement was made in the light of the fact that another rape victim, Dr Shazia Khalid, had left Pakistan, was living in Canada, and had spoken out against official attitudes to rape in Pakistan. Musharraf said of her: \"It is the easiest way of doing it. Every second person now wants to come up and get all the [pause] because there is so much of finances. Dr. Shazia, I don't know.

He worked for the [[primate bishop|primacy]] of Canterbury over the bishops of [[archbishop of York|York]] and [[Catholic Church in Wales|Wales]] but, though at his death he appeared to have been successful, [[Pope Paschal&nbsp;II]] later reversed himself and restored York's independence.\n\n{{anchor|History|Life}}\n==Biography== <!--linked-->\n[[File:Maison StAnselme 2.JPG|thumb|left|205px|{{nowrap|A French plaque commemorating}} the supposed birthplace of Anselm in [[Aosta]].

[[R. W.

However, in 1094, the [[Medieval Wales|Welsh]] had begun to recover their lands from the [[Marcher Lords]] and William's 1095 invasion had accomplished little; two larger forays were made in 1097 against [[Cadwgan ap Bleddyn|Cadwgan]] in [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] and [[Gruffudd ap Cynan|Gruffudd]] in [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]].

The council prohibited marriage, [[concubinage]], and drunkenness to all those in holy orders,{{sfnp|Partner|1973|pp=467\u2013475, 468}} condemned [[sodomy]]{{sfnp|Boswell|1980|p=215}} and [[simony]],{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} and regulated [[vestments|clerical dress]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} Anselm also obtained a resolution against the [[Slavery in the British Isles|British slave trade]].{{sfnp|Crawley|1910}} Henry supported Anselm's reforms and his authority over the English church, but continued to assert his own authority over Anselm. Upon their return, the three bishops he had dispatched on his second delegation to the pope claimed\u2014in defiance of Paschal's sealed letter to Anselm, his public acts, and the testimony of the two monks who had accompanied them\u2014that the pontiff had been receptive to Henry's counsel and secretly approved of Anselm's submission to the crown.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA489 489\u201391]}} In 1103, then, Anselm consented to journey himself to Rome, along with the king's envoy [[William Warelwast]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=71}} Anselm supposedly travelled in order to argue the king's case for a dispensation{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 74]}} but, in response to this third mission, Paschal fully excommunicated the bishops who had accepted investment from Henry, though sparing the king himself.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}\n\n====Second exile====\nAfter this ruling, Anselm received a letter forbidding his return and withdrew to Lyon to await Paschal's response.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} On 26 March 1105, Paschal again excommunicated prelates who had accepted investment from Henry and the advisors responsible, this time including [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], Henry's chief advisor.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=74}} He further finally threatened Henry with the same;{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|pp=19\u201320}} in April, Anselm sent messages to the king directly{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA496 496\u201397]}} and through his sister [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]] expressing his own willingness to excommunicate Henry.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} This was probably a negotiation tactic{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=75}} but it came at a critical period in Henry's reign{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} and it worked: a meeting was arranged and a compromise concluded at [[L'Aigle]] on 22 July 1105.

Henry was forced to make further concessions. He restored to Canterbury all the churches that had been seized by William or during Anselm's exile, promising that nothing more would be taken from them and even providing Anselm with a security payment.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Henry had initially taxed married clergy and, when their situation had been outlawed, had made up the lost revenue by controversially extending the tax over all churchmen.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=297}} He now agreed that any prelate who had paid this would be exempt from taxation for three years.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} These compromises on Henry's part strengthened the rights of the Church against the king.

Divine justice demands restitution for sin but human beings are incapable of providing it, as all the actions of men are already obligated to the furtherance of God's glory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=83}} Further, God's infinite justice demands infinite restitution for the impairment of his infinite dignity.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=\u00a74.3}} The enormity of the offence led Anselm to reject personal acts of atonement, even [[Peter Damian]]'s [[flagellants|flagellation]], as inadequate{{sfnp|Fulton|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7NEzHGR24wwC&pg=PA176 176]}} and ultimately vain.{{sfnp|Fulton|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7NEzHGR24wwC&pg=PA178 178]}} Instead, full recompense could only be made by God, which His infinite mercy inclines Him to provide.

Earlier theologians had held that it was transmitted from generation to generation by the sinful nature of [[sexual intercourse|sex]]. As in his earlier works, Anselm instead held that [[Adam]]'s sin was borne by his descendants through the change in human nature which occurred during the Fall.

[[Humbert the White-Handed]], [[Count of Maurienne]], so distinguished himself that he was granted a [[county of Aosta|new county]] carved out of the secular holdings of the less helpful [[bishop of Aosta]]. Humbert's son [[Otto I, Count of Savoy|Otto]] was subsequently permitted to inherit the extensive [[March of Susa]] through his wife [[Adelaide of Susa|Adelaide]] in preference to her uncle's families, who had supported the effort to establish an independent [[Kingdom of Italy (HRE)|Kingdom of Italy]] under [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine]]. Otto and Adelaide's unified lands then controlled the most important passes in the [[western Alps]] and formed the [[county of Savoy]] whose [[House of Savoy|dynasty]] would later rule the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|kingdoms of Sardinia]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].\n\nRecords during this period are scanty, but both sides of Anselm's immediate family appear to have been dispossessed by these decisions{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://archive.org/details/lifeandtimessta01ansegoog/page/n34 1\u20134]}} in favour of their extended relations.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=8}} His father Gundulph{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=91}} or Gundulf{{sfnp|Robson|1996}} was a [[Lombards|Lombard]] noble,{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA73 73]}} probably one of Adelaide's [[Arduinici]] uncles or cousins;{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://archive.org/details/lifeandtimessta01ansegoog/page/n34 1]}} his mother Ermenberga was almost certainly the granddaughter of [[Conrad the Peaceful]], related both to the Anselmid bishops of Aosta and to the heirs of [[Henry II (HRE)|Henry&nbsp;II]] who had been passed over in favour of Conrad.{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://archive.org/details/lifeandtimessta01ansegoog/page/n34 1]}} The marriage was thus probably arranged for political reasons but was incapable of resisting Conrad's decrees after his successful annexation of Burgundy on 1 August 1034.{{sfnp|Rule|1883|p=[https://archive.org/details/lifeandtimessta01ansegoog/page/n18 2]}} ([[Burchard, bishop of Aosta|Bishop Burchard]] subsequently revolted against imperial control but was defeated; he was ultimately [[translation (bishop)|translated]] to [[diocese of Lyon|Lyon]].)

Henry invited Anselm to return, pledging in his letter to submit himself to the archbishop's counsel.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=63}} The cleric's support of Robert would have caused great trouble but Anselm returned before establishing any other terms than those offered by Henry.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lxf-LvQvvwIC&pg=PA291 291]}} Once in England, Anselm was ordered by Henry to do homage for his Canterbury estates{{sfnp|Hollister|1983|p=120}} and to receive his investiture by [[episcopal ring|ring]] and [[crozier]] anew.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=67}} Despite having done so under William, the bishop now refused to violate [[canon law]]. Henry for his part refused to relinquish a right possessed by his predecessors and even sent an embassy to [[Pope&nbsp;Paschal&nbsp;II]] to present his case.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} Paschal reaffirmed Urban's bans to that mission and the one that followed it.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}\n\nMeanwhile, Anselm publicly supported Henry against the claims and threatened invasion of his brother [[Robert Curthose]]. Anselm wooed wavering barons to the king's cause, emphasizing the religious nature of their oaths and duty of loyalty;{{sfnp|Hollister|2003|pp=137\u2013138}} he supported the deposition of [[Ranulf Flambard]], the disloyal new [[bishop of Durham]];{{sfnp|Hollister|2003|pp=135\u2013136}} and he threatened Robert with excommunication.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} The lack of popular support greeting his invasion near [[Portsmouth]] compelled Robert to accept the [[Treaty of Alton]] instead, renouncing his claims for an annual payment of 3000&nbsp;[[mark (currency)|marks]].\n\nAnselm held a council at [[Lambeth Palace]] which found that Henry's beloved [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]] had not technically become a [[nun]] and was thus eligible to wed and become queen.{{sfnp|Hollister|2003|pp=128\u2013129}} On [[Michaelmas]] in 1102, Anselm was finally able to convene a [[Council of London in 1102|general church council at London]], establishing the [[Gregorian Reform]] within England. The council prohibited marriage, [[concubinage]], and drunkenness to all those in holy orders,{{sfnp|Partner|1973|pp=467\u2013475, 468}} condemned [[sodomy]]{{sfnp|Boswell|1980|p=215}} and [[simony]],{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} and regulated [[vestments|clerical dress]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} Anselm also obtained a resolution against the [[Slavery in the British Isles|British slave trade]].{{sfnp|Crawley|1910}} Henry supported Anselm's reforms and his authority over the English church, but continued to assert his own authority over Anselm. Upon their return, the three bishops he had dispatched on his second delegation to the pope claimed\u2014in defiance of Paschal's sealed letter to Anselm, his public acts, and the testimony of the two monks who had accompanied them\u2014that the pontiff had been receptive to Henry's counsel and secretly approved of Anselm's submission to the crown.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA489 489\u201391]}} In 1103, then, Anselm consented to journey himself to Rome, along with the king's envoy [[William Warelwast]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=71}} Anselm supposedly travelled in order to argue the king's case for a dispensation{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 74]}} but, in response to this third mission, Paschal fully excommunicated the bishops who had accepted investment from Henry, though sparing the king himself.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}\n\n====Second exile====\nAfter this ruling, Anselm received a letter forbidding his return and withdrew to Lyon to await Paschal's response.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} On 26 March 1105, Paschal again excommunicated prelates who had accepted investment from Henry and the advisors responsible, this time including [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], Henry's chief advisor.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=74}} He further finally threatened Henry with the same;{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|pp=19\u201320}} in April, Anselm sent messages to the king directly{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA496 496\u201397]}} and through his sister [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]] expressing his own willingness to excommunicate Henry.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} This was probably a negotiation tactic{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=75}} but it came at a critical period in Henry's reign{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} and it worked: a meeting was arranged and a compromise concluded at [[L'Aigle]] on 22 July 1105. Henry would forsake lay investiture if Anselm obtained Paschal's permission for clerics to do homage for their lands;{{sfnp|Vaughn|1978|p=367}}{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=76}} Henry's bishops'{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} and counselors' excommunications were to be lifted provided they advise him to obey the papacy (Anselm performed this act on his own authority and latter had to answer for it to Paschal);{{sfnp|Vaughn|1978|p=367}} the revenues of Canterbury would be returned to the archbishop; and priests would no longer be permitted to marry.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=76}} Anselm insisted on the agreement's ratification by the pope before he would consent to return to England, but wrote to Paschal in favour of the deal, arguing that Henry's forsaking of lay investiture was a greater victory than the matter of homage.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=77}} On 23 March 1106, Paschal wrote Anselm accepting the terms established at L'Aigle, although both clerics saw this as a temporary compromise and intended to continue pressing for reforms,{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA497 497\u201398]}} including the ending of homage to lay authorities.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|pp=296\u2013297}}\n\nEven after this, Anselm refused to return to England.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=80}} Henry travelled to [[Le Bec-Hellouin|Bec]] and met with him on 15 August 1106. Henry was forced to make further concessions. He restored to Canterbury all the churches that had been seized by William or during Anselm's exile, promising that nothing more would be taken from them and even providing Anselm with a security payment.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Henry had initially taxed married clergy and, when their situation had been outlawed, had made up the lost revenue by controversially extending the tax over all churchmen.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=297}} He now agreed that any prelate who had paid this would be exempt from taxation for three years.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} These compromises on Henry's part strengthened the rights of the Church against the king.

Of note are [[Paul's Epistles]] to the ''Thessalonians'' and to [[Philippi]], which is often considered the first contact of Christianity with Europe.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12007b.htm Philippi]: ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' \"Philippi was the first European town in which St. Paul preached the Faith.

According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: \"St. Paul preached successfully at Corinth, where he lived in the house of [[Aquila and Priscilla]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|18:1}}), where [[Silas]] and [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] soon joined him. After his departure he was replaced by [[Apollos|Apollo]], who had been sent from Ephesus by Priscilla. The Apostle visited Corinth at least once more.

According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: Paul \"came to Athens from [[Berea (Bible)|Ber\u0153a of Macedonia]], coming probably by water and landing in the [[Piraeus|Peir\u00e6evs]], the harbour of Athens. This was about the year 53. Having arrived at Athens, he at once sent for Silas and Timotheos who had remained behind in Ber\u0153a. While awaiting the coming of these he tarried in Athens, viewing the [[Idolatry and Christianity|idolatrous]] city, and frequenting the [[synagogue]]; for there were already [[History of the Jews in Greece|Jews in Athens]]. ... It seems that a Christian community was rapidly formed, although for a considerable time it did not possess a numerous membership. The commoner tradition names the [[Dionysius the Areopagite|Areopagite]] as the first head and [[Bishop of Athens#Roman Period|bishop of the Christian Athenians]]. Another tradition, however, gives this honour to [[Hierotheos the Thesmothete]]. The successors of the first bishop were not all Athenians by lineage. They are catalogued as Narkissos, Publius, and [[Quadratus of Athens|Quadratus]]. Narkissos is stated to have come from Palestine, and [[Saint Publius|Publius from Malta]]. In some lists Narkissos is omitted. Quadratus is revered for having contributed to early Christian literature by writing an [[Christian apologetics|apology]], which he addressed to the Emperor [[Hadrian]]. This was on the occasion of Hadrian's visit to Athens. [[Aristides of Athens|Aristeides]] dedicated an apology to the emperor Hadrian around CE 134. [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]] also wrote an apology.

The spread of Christianity among the [[Thracians]] and the emergence of centers of Christianity like [[Serdica]] (present day [[Sofia]]), [[History of Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] (present day [[Plovdiv]]) and [[Silistra|Durostorum]] was likely to have begun with these early [[Apostolic Age|Apostolic missions]].<ref>[http://orthodoxhistory.info/orthodox-churches/bulgarian-orthodoxy/early-christianity-in-bulgarian-lands/#_ftn12]</ref> The [[Monastery of Saint Athanasius|first Christian monastery]] in Europe was founded in Thrace in 344 by [[Saint Athanasius]] near modern-day [[Chirpan]], [[Bulgaria]], following the [[Council of Serdica]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bnr.bg/radiobulgaria/post/100844993/chirpanskiat-manastir-svatanasii-nai-starata-obitel-v-evropa|title=The Saint Athanasius Monastery of Chirpan, the oldest cloister in Europe|publisher=Bulgarian National Radio|language=Bulgarian|date=22 June 2017|accessdate=30 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Libya===\n{{See also|Christianity in Libya}}\n[[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] and the surrounding region of [[Cyrenaica#Christianity|Cyrenaica]] or the North African \"[[Pentapolis]]\", south of the Mediterranean from Greece, the northeastern part of modern [[Libya]], was a Greek colony in North Africa later converted to a Roman province.

According to  tradition, [[Saint Publius|Publius]], the Roman Governor of Malta at the time of Saint Paul's shipwreck, became the first ''Bishop of Malta'' following his conversion to Christianity.  After ruling the Maltese Church for thirty-one years, Publius was transferred to the See of [[Athens]] in 90 AD, where he was martyred in 125 AD.

It is certain that in 303, when Sts. [[Justa and Rufina]], the potters, suffered martyrdom for refusing to adore the idol Salambo, there was a Bishop of Seville, Sabinus, who assisted at the [[Council of Illiberis]] (287). Before that time Marcellus had been bishop, as appears from a catalogue of the ancient prelates of Seville preserved in the 'Codex Emilianensis', a manuscript of the year 1000, now in the [[Escorial]]. When [[Peace of the Church|Constantine brought peace to the Church]] [313] Evodius was Bishop of Seville; he set himself to rebuild the ruined churches, among them he appears to have built the church of San Vicente, perhaps the first cathedral of Seville.\"  Early Christianity also spread from the [[Iberian peninsula]] south across the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] into Roman [[Mauretania Tingitana]], of note is [[Marcellus of Tangier]] who was martyred in 298.\n\n===Roman Britain===\n{{see also|History of the Church of England#Roman and Sub-Roman Christianity in the British Isles}}\nChristianity reached [[Roman Britain]] by the third century of the Christian era, the first recorded martyrs in Britain being [[Saint Alban|St. Alban]] of [[Verulamium]] and [[Julius and Aaron]] of [[Caerleon]], during the reign of [[Diocletian]] (284\u2013305).

Celebrated as an important centre of Greco-Syrian culture, Edessa was also noted for its Jewish community, with [[proselytes]] in the royal family. Strategically located on the main trade routes of the [[Fertile Crescent]], it was easily accessible from [[Antioch]], where the mission to the Gentiles was inaugurated. When early Christians were scattered abroad because of persecution, some found refuge at Edessa. Thus the Edessan church traced its origin to the apostolic age (which may account for its rapid growth), and [[Christianity]] even became the state religion for a time.\n\nThe Church of the East had its inception at a very early date in the buffer zone between the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and Roman Empires in Upper Mesopotamia, known as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. The vicissitudes of its later growth were rooted in its minority status in a situation of international tension. The rulers of the [[Parthian Empire]] (250 BC \u2013 AD 226) were on the whole tolerant in spirit, and with the older faiths of Babylonia and Assyria in a state of decay, the time was ripe for a new and vital faith. The rulers of the Second Persian empire (226\u2013640) also followed a policy of religious toleration to begin with, though later they gave Christians the same status as a subject race. However, these rulers also encouraged the revival of the ancient Persian dualistic faith of [[Zoroastrianism]] and established it as the state religion, with the result that the Christians were increasingly subjected to repressive measures. Nevertheless, it was not until Christianity became the state religion in the West (380) that enmity toward Rome was focused on the Eastern Christians. After the Muslim conquest in the 7th century, the caliphate tolerated other faiths but forbade proselytism and subjected Christians to heavy taxation.\n\nThe missionary [[Addai]] evangelized [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]) about the middle of the 2nd century. An ancient legend recorded by [[Eusebius]] (AD 260\u2013340) and also found in the ''Doctrine of Addai'' (c. AD 400) (from information in the royal archives of Edessa) describes how King [[Abgar V of Edessa]] communicated to Jesus, requesting he come and heal him, to which appeal he received a reply. It is said that after the resurrection, the [[Apostle Thomas|Thomas]] sent Addai (or Thaddaeus), to the king, with the result that the city was won to the Christian faith. In this mission he was accompanied by a disciple, Mari, and the two are regarded as co-founders of the church, according to the ''[[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]]'' (c. AD 200), which is still the normal liturgy of the Assyrian church. The ''[[Doctrine of Addai]]'' further states that Thomas was regarded as an apostle of the church in Edessa.{{ref|AFM}}{{ref|AFM}}\n\nAddai, who became the first bishop of Edessa, was succeeded by [[Mar Aggai|Aggai]], then by Palut, who was ordained about 200 by [[Serapion of Antioch]]. Thence came to us in the 2nd century the famous ''[[Peshitta]]'', or Syriac translation of the Old Testament; also [[Tatian]]'s ''[[Diatessaron]]'', which was compiled about 172 and in common use until St. [[Rabbula]], Bishop of Edessa (412\u2013435), forbade its use. This arrangement of the four [[Canonical gospels]] as a continuous narrative, whose original language may have been Syriac, Greek, or even Latin, circulated widely in Syriac-speaking Churches.<ref>Cross, F. L., ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Diatessaron''</ref>\n\nA Christian council was held at Edessa as early as 197.<ref>[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', V, 23</ref> In 201 the city was devastated by a great flood, and the Christian church was destroyed.<ref>''Chronicon Edessenum'', ad. an. 201</ref> In 232, the Syriac Acts were written supposedly on the event of the relics of the Apostle [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]] being handed to the church in Edessa.

In the meanwhile Christian priests from Edessa had evangelized Eastern Mesopotamia and [[Iran|Persia]], and established the first Churches in the kingdom of the [[Sasanian dynasty|Sasanian]]s.<ref>[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v5f5/v5f5a018.html Christianity]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica''</ref> Atill\u00e2ti\u00e2, Bishop of Edessa, assisted at the First Council of Nicaea (325).\n\n===Persia and Central Asia===\nBy the latter half of the 2nd century, Christianity had spread east throughout [[Medes|Media]], Persia, [[Parthia]], and [[Bactria]]. The twenty bishops and many presbyters were more of the order of itinerant missionaries, passing from place to place as Paul did and supplying their needs with such occupations as merchant or craftsman. By AD 280 the metropolis of Seleucia assumed the title of \"Catholicos\" and in A.D. 424 a council of the church at Seleucia elected the first patriarch to have jurisdiction over the whole church of the East. The seat of the Patriarchate was fixed at [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]], since this was an important point on the East-West trade routes which extended both to India and China, Java and Japan. Thus the shift of ecclesiastical authority was away from Edessa, which in A.D. 216 had become tributary to Rome. the establishment of an independent patriarchate with nine subordinate metropoli contributed to a more favourable attitude by the Persian government, which no longer had to fear an ecclesiastical alliance with the common enemy, Rome.\n\nBy the time that Edessa was incorporated into the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] in 258, the city of [[Arbil|Arbela]], situated on the [[Tigris]] in what is now [[Iraq]], had taken on more and more the role that Edessa had played in the early years, as a centre from which Christianity spread to the rest of the Persian Empire.<ref name=CofE>[http://www.oxuscom.com/Church_of_the_East.pdf Mark Dickens: The Church of the East]</ref>\n\n[[Bardaisan]], writing about 196, speaks of Christians throughout [[Medea|Media]], [[Parthia]] and [[Bactria]] (modern-day [[Afghanistan]])<ref>\"We are Christians by the one name of the Messiah. As regards our customs our brethren abstain from everything that is contrary to their profession.... Parthian Christians do not take two wives.... Our Bactrian sisters do not practice promiscuity with strangers. Persians do not take their daughters to wife. Medes do not desert their dying relations or bury them alive. Christians in Edessa do not kill their wives or sisters who commit fornication but keep them apart and commit them to the judgement of God. Christians in Hatra do not stone thieves\" (quoted in [http://www.oxuscom.com/Church_of_the_East.pdf Mark Dickens: The Church of the East]).</ref> and, according to [[Tertullian]] (c. 160\u2013230), there were already a number of bishoprics within the Persian Empire by 220.<ref name=CofE/> By 315, the bishop of [[Seleucia]]&ndash;[[Ctesiphon]] had assumed the title \"[[Catholicos]]\".<ref name=CofE/> By this time, neither Edessa nor Arbela was the centre of the Church of the East anymore; ecclesiastical authority had moved east to the heart of the Persian Empire.<ref name=CofE/> The twin cities of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, well-situated on the main trade routes between East and West, became, in the words of John Stewart, \"a magnificent centre for the missionary church that was entering on its great task of carrying the gospel to the far east\".<ref>John Stewart, Nestorian Missionary Enterprise (Edinburgh: T & T Clark, 1928)</ref>\n\nWhen Constantine converted to Christianity, and the Roman Empire which was previously violently anti-Christian became pro-Christian, the Persian Empire, suspecting a new \"enemy within\", became violently anti-Christian. Within a few years, [[Shapur II]] (309\u2013379) inaugurated a twenty-year-long persecution of the church with the murder of Mar Shimun, the Catholicos of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, five bishops and 100 priests on Good Friday, 344, after the Patriarch refused to collect a double tax from the Christians to help the Persian war effort against Rome.<ref name=CofE/> See also [[Christianity in Iran]].\n\n===Arabian Peninsula===\n{{see also|Ghassanids|Lakhmids}}\nTo understand the penetration of the [[Arabian peninsula]] by the Christian gospel, it is helpful to distinguish between the [[Bedouin]] nomads of the interior, who were chiefly herdsmen and unreceptive to foreign control, and the inhabitants of the settled communities of the coastal areas and oases, who were either middlemen traders or farmers and were receptive to influences from abroad. Christianity apparently gained its strongest foothold in the ancient center of Semitic civilization in South-west Arabia or [[Yemen]], (sometimes known as Seba or [[Sheba]], whose queen visited [[Solomon]]). Because of geographic proximity, acculturation with [[Ethiopia]] was always strong, and the royal family traces its ancestry to this queen.\n\nThe presence of Arabians at Pentecost and Paul's three-year sojourn in Arabia suggest a very early gospel witness. A 4th-century church history, states that the apostle [[Bartholomew]] preached in Arabia and that [[Himyarites]] were among his converts. The Al-[[Jubail Church]] in what is now [[Saudi Arabia]] was built in the 4th century. Arabia's close relations with [[Ethiopia]] give significance to the conversion of [[Ethiopian eunuch|the treasurer]] to the queen of Ethiopia, not to mention the tradition that the Apostle Matthew was assigned to this land.{{ref|AFM}} [[Eusebius]] says that \"one [[Pantaenus|Pantaneous]] (c. A.D. 190) was sent from [[Alexandria]] as a missionary to the nations of the East\", including southwest Arabia, on his way to India.{{ref|AFM}}\n\n===Nubia===\nChristianity arrived early in [[Nubia]]. In the [[New Testament]] of the [[Christian Bible]], [[Ethiopian eunuch|a treasury official]] of \"Candace, queen of the Ethiopians\" returning from a trip to [[Jerusalem]] was [[baptism|baptised]] by [[Philip the Evangelist]]:\n\n: Then the Angel of the Lord said to Philip, Start out and go south to the road that leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert. And he arose and went: And behold, a [[Ethiopian eunuch|man of Ethiopia]], an [[Eunuch]] of great authority under Candace, Queen of E-thi-o'pi-ans, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship.<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|8:26\u201327|131}}</ref>\n\nEthiopia at that time meant any upper Nile region. [[Kandake|Candace]] was the name and perhaps, title for the [[Mero\u00eb]] or [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushite]] queens.\n\nIn the fourth century, bishop [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] of [[Alexandria]] consecrated  Marcus as bishop of [[Philae]] before his death in 373, showing that [[Christianity]] had permanently penetrated the region. [[John of Ephesus]] records that a [[Monophysite]] priest named Julian converted the king and his nobles of Nobatia around 545 and another kingdom of Alodia converted around 569. By the 7th century [[Makuria]] expanded becoming the dominant power in the region so strong enough to halt the southern expansion of [[Islam]] after the [[Arabs]] had taken Egypt.  After several failed invasions the new rulers agreed to a treaty with Dongola allowing for peaceful coexistence and trade.  This treaty held for six hundred years allowing Arab traders introducing Islam to Nubia and it gradually supplanted [[Christianity]].  The last record of a bishop is at [[Qasr Ibrim]] in 1372.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Christianity in the 1st century]]\n* [[Christianity in the 2nd century]]\n* [[Christianity in the 3rd century]]\n* [[Early Christian art and architecture]]\n* [[Early Christianity]]\n* [[History of Christianity]]\n* [[History of early Christianity]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[James D.G.

This was about the year 53. Having arrived at Athens, he at once sent for Silas and Timotheos who had remained behind in Ber\u0153a. While awaiting the coming of these he tarried in Athens, viewing the [[Idolatry and Christianity|idolatrous]] city, and frequenting the [[synagogue]]; for there were already [[History of the Jews in Greece|Jews in Athens]]. ... It seems that a Christian community was rapidly formed, although for a considerable time it did not possess a numerous membership. The commoner tradition names the [[Dionysius the Areopagite|Areopagite]] as the first head and [[Bishop of Athens#Roman Period|bishop of the Christian Athenians]]. Another tradition, however, gives this honour to [[Hierotheos the Thesmothete]]. The successors of the first bishop were not all Athenians by lineage. They are catalogued as Narkissos, Publius, and [[Quadratus of Athens|Quadratus]]. Narkissos is stated to have come from Palestine, and [[Saint Publius|Publius from Malta]]. In some lists Narkissos is omitted. Quadratus is revered for having contributed to early Christian literature by writing an [[Christian apologetics|apology]], which he addressed to the Emperor [[Hadrian]]. This was on the occasion of Hadrian's visit to Athens. [[Aristides of Athens|Aristeides]] dedicated an apology to the emperor Hadrian around CE 134. [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]] also wrote an apology.

Major cities are [[Arles]], [[Avignon]], [[Vienne, Is\u00e8re|Vienne]], [[Lyon]], and [[Marseille]] (the oldest city in France). The [[Persecution in Lyon]] occurred in 177. The Apostolic Father [[Irenaeus]] from [[Smyrna]] of [[#Anatolia|Anatolia]] was [[Bishop of Lyon]] near the end of the 2nd century and he claimed [[Saint Pothinus]] was his predecessor.

[[Hermagoras of Aquileia]] is believed to be its first bishop. The [[Aquileian Rite]] is associated with Aquileia.\n\n====Milan====\n{{See also|Bishop of Milan}}\nIt is believed that the Church of [[Milan]] in northwest Italy was founded by the apostle [[Barnabas]] in the 1st century. [[Gervasius and Protasius]] and others were martyred there. It has long maintained its own rite known as the [[Ambrosian Rite]] attributed to [[Ambrose]] (born c. 330) who was bishop in 374\u2013397 and one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century.

AD 60. Paul had been allowed passage from [[#Caesarea|Caesarea Maritima]] to Rome by [[Porcius Festus]], [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] of [[Iudaea Province]], to stand trial before the Emperor. Many traditions are associated with this episode, and [[Rabat, Malta#Catacombs|catacombs in Rabat]] testify to an Early Christian community on the islands. According to  tradition, [[Saint Publius|Publius]], the Roman Governor of Malta at the time of Saint Paul's shipwreck, became the first ''Bishop of Malta'' following his conversion to Christianity.  After ruling the Maltese Church for thirty-one years, Publius was transferred to the See of [[Athens]] in 90 AD, where he was martyred in 125 AD.  There is scant information about the continuity of Christianity in Malta in subsequent years, although tradition has it that there was a continuous line of bishops from the days of St. Paul to the time of Emperor Constantine.\n\n===Salona===\n{{See also|Religion in Croatia}}\n\n[[Salona]], the capital of the [[Roman province of Dalmatia]] on the eastern shore of the [[Adriatic Sea]], was an early center of Christianity and today is a ruin in modern [[Croatia]]. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia it was where: \"...[[Titus (biblical)|Titus]] the pupil of St. Paul preached, where the followers of Jesus Christ first shed their blood as martyrs, and where beautiful examples of basilicas and other early Christian sculpture have been discovered.\" According to the Catholic Encyclopedia article on Dalmatia: \"Salona became the centre from which Christianity spread. In Pannonia [[Andronicus of Pannonia|St. Andronicus]] founded the See of [[Syrmium]] (Mitrovica) and later those of [[Siscia]] and Mursia.

St. [[Jerome]] was born in [[Stridon|Strido]], a city on the border of Pannonia and Dalmatia.\"\n\n===Seville===\n{{see also|Bishop of Seville}}\n\n[[Seville]] was the capital of [[Hispania Baetica]] or the Roman province of southern Spain. According to the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': \"...the origin of the diocese goes back to Apostolic times, or at least to the first century of our era. St. Gerontius, Bishop of Italica (about four miles from Hispalis or Seville), preached in Baetica in Apostolic times, and without doubt must have left a pastor of its own to Seville. It is certain that in 303, when Sts. [[Justa and Rufina]], the potters, suffered martyrdom for refusing to adore the idol Salambo, there was a Bishop of Seville, Sabinus, who assisted at the [[Council of Illiberis]] (287). Before that time Marcellus had been bishop, as appears from a catalogue of the ancient prelates of Seville preserved in the 'Codex Emilianensis', a manuscript of the year 1000, now in the [[Escorial]]. When [[Peace of the Church|Constantine brought peace to the Church]] [313] Evodius was Bishop of Seville; he set himself to rebuild the ruined churches, among them he appears to have built the church of San Vicente, perhaps the first cathedral of Seville.\"  Early Christianity also spread from the [[Iberian peninsula]] south across the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] into Roman [[Mauretania Tingitana]], of note is [[Marcellus of Tangier]] who was martyred in 298.\n\n===Roman Britain===\n{{see also|History of the Church of England#Roman and Sub-Roman Christianity in the British Isles}}\nChristianity reached [[Roman Britain]] by the third century of the Christian era, the first recorded martyrs in Britain being [[Saint Alban|St. Alban]] of [[Verulamium]] and [[Julius and Aaron]] of [[Caerleon]], during the reign of [[Diocletian]] (284\u2013305). [[Gildas]] dated the faith's arrival to the latter part of the reign of [[Tiberius]], although stories connecting it with [[Joseph of Arimathea#Britain|Joseph of Arimathea]], [[Lucius of Britain|Lucius]], or [[Fagan (saint)|Fagan]] are now generally considered [[pious forgeries]].

Celebrated as an important centre of Greco-Syrian culture, Edessa was also noted for its Jewish community, with [[proselytes]] in the royal family. Strategically located on the main trade routes of the [[Fertile Crescent]], it was easily accessible from [[Antioch]], where the mission to the Gentiles was inaugurated. When early Christians were scattered abroad because of persecution, some found refuge at Edessa. Thus the Edessan church traced its origin to the apostolic age (which may account for its rapid growth), and [[Christianity]] even became the state religion for a time.\n\nThe Church of the East had its inception at a very early date in the buffer zone between the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and Roman Empires in Upper Mesopotamia, known as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. The vicissitudes of its later growth were rooted in its minority status in a situation of international tension. The rulers of the [[Parthian Empire]] (250 BC \u2013 AD 226) were on the whole tolerant in spirit, and with the older faiths of Babylonia and Assyria in a state of decay, the time was ripe for a new and vital faith. The rulers of the Second Persian empire (226\u2013640) also followed a policy of religious toleration to begin with, though later they gave Christians the same status as a subject race. However, these rulers also encouraged the revival of the ancient Persian dualistic faith of [[Zoroastrianism]] and established it as the state religion, with the result that the Christians were increasingly subjected to repressive measures. Nevertheless, it was not until Christianity became the state religion in the West (380) that enmity toward Rome was focused on the Eastern Christians. After the Muslim conquest in the 7th century, the caliphate tolerated other faiths but forbade proselytism and subjected Christians to heavy taxation.\n\nThe missionary [[Addai]] evangelized [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]) about the middle of the 2nd century. An ancient legend recorded by [[Eusebius]] (AD 260\u2013340) and also found in the ''Doctrine of Addai'' (c. AD 400) (from information in the royal archives of Edessa) describes how King [[Abgar V of Edessa]] communicated to Jesus, requesting he come and heal him, to which appeal he received a reply. It is said that after the resurrection, the [[Apostle Thomas|Thomas]] sent Addai (or Thaddaeus), to the king, with the result that the city was won to the Christian faith. In this mission he was accompanied by a disciple, Mari, and the two are regarded as co-founders of the church, according to the ''[[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]]'' (c. AD 200), which is still the normal liturgy of the Assyrian church. The ''[[Doctrine of Addai]]'' further states that Thomas was regarded as an apostle of the church in Edessa.{{ref|AFM}}{{ref|AFM}}\n\nAddai, who became the first bishop of Edessa, was succeeded by [[Mar Aggai|Aggai]], then by Palut, who was ordained about 200 by [[Serapion of Antioch]]. Thence came to us in the 2nd century the famous ''[[Peshitta]]'', or Syriac translation of the Old Testament; also [[Tatian]]'s ''[[Diatessaron]]'', which was compiled about 172 and in common use until St. [[Rabbula]], Bishop of Edessa (412\u2013435), forbade its use. This arrangement of the four [[Canonical gospels]] as a continuous narrative, whose original language may have been Syriac, Greek, or even Latin, circulated widely in Syriac-speaking Churches.<ref>Cross, F.

In the meanwhile Christian priests from Edessa had evangelized Eastern Mesopotamia and [[Iran|Persia]], and established the first Churches in the kingdom of the [[Sasanian dynasty|Sasanian]]s.<ref>[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v5f5/v5f5a018.html Christianity]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica''</ref> Atill\u00e2ti\u00e2, Bishop of Edessa, assisted at the First Council of Nicaea (325).\n\n===Persia and Central Asia===\nBy the latter half of the 2nd century, Christianity had spread east throughout [[Medes|Media]], Persia, [[Parthia]], and [[Bactria]]. The twenty bishops and many presbyters were more of the order of itinerant missionaries, passing from place to place as Paul did and supplying their needs with such occupations as merchant or craftsman. By AD 280 the metropolis of Seleucia assumed the title of \"Catholicos\" and in A.D. 424 a council of the church at Seleucia elected the first patriarch to have jurisdiction over the whole church of the East. The seat of the Patriarchate was fixed at [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]], since this was an important point on the East-West trade routes which extended both to India and China, Java and Japan. Thus the shift of ecclesiastical authority was away from Edessa, which in A.D. 216 had become tributary to Rome. the establishment of an independent patriarchate with nine subordinate metropoli contributed to a more favourable attitude by the Persian government, which no longer had to fear an ecclesiastical alliance with the common enemy, Rome.\n\nBy the time that Edessa was incorporated into the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] in 258, the city of [[Arbil|Arbela]], situated on the [[Tigris]] in what is now [[Iraq]], had taken on more and more the role that Edessa had played in the early years, as a centre from which Christianity spread to the rest of the Persian Empire.<ref name=CofE>[http://www.oxuscom.com/Church_of_the_East.pdf Mark Dickens: The Church of the East]</ref>\n\n[[Bardaisan]], writing about 196, speaks of Christians throughout [[Medea|Media]], [[Parthia]] and [[Bactria]] (modern-day [[Afghanistan]])<ref>\"We are Christians by the one name of the Messiah. As regards our customs our brethren abstain from everything that is contrary to their profession.... Parthian Christians do not take two wives.... Our Bactrian sisters do not practice promiscuity with strangers. Persians do not take their daughters to wife. Medes do not desert their dying relations or bury them alive. Christians in Edessa do not kill their wives or sisters who commit fornication but keep them apart and commit them to the judgement of God. Christians in Hatra do not stone thieves\" (quoted in [http://www.oxuscom.com/Church_of_the_East.pdf Mark Dickens: The Church of the East]).</ref> and, according to [[Tertullian]] (c. 160\u2013230), there were already a number of bishoprics within the Persian Empire by 220.<ref name=CofE/> By 315, the bishop of [[Seleucia]]&ndash;[[Ctesiphon]] had assumed the title \"[[Catholicos]]\".<ref name=CofE/> By this time, neither Edessa nor Arbela was the centre of the Church of the East anymore; ecclesiastical authority had moved east to the heart of the Persian Empire.<ref name=CofE/> The twin cities of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, well-situated on the main trade routes between East and West, became, in the words of John Stewart, \"a magnificent centre for the missionary church that was entering on its great task of carrying the gospel to the far east\".<ref>John Stewart, Nestorian Missionary Enterprise (Edinburgh: T & T Clark, 1928)</ref>\n\nWhen Constantine converted to Christianity, and the Roman Empire which was previously violently anti-Christian became pro-Christian, the Persian Empire, suspecting a new \"enemy within\", became violently anti-Christian. Within a few years, [[Shapur II]] (309\u2013379) inaugurated a twenty-year-long persecution of the church with the murder of Mar Shimun, the Catholicos of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, five bishops and 100 priests on Good Friday, 344, after the Patriarch refused to collect a double tax from the Christians to help the Persian war effort against Rome.<ref name=CofE/> See also [[Christianity in Iran]].\n\n===Arabian Peninsula===\n{{see also|Ghassanids|Lakhmids}}\nTo understand the penetration of the [[Arabian peninsula]] by the Christian gospel, it is helpful to distinguish between the [[Bedouin]] nomads of the interior, who were chiefly herdsmen and unreceptive to foreign control, and the inhabitants of the settled communities of the coastal areas and oases, who were either middlemen traders or farmers and were receptive to influences from abroad. Christianity apparently gained its strongest foothold in the ancient center of Semitic civilization in South-west Arabia or [[Yemen]], (sometimes known as Seba or [[Sheba]], whose queen visited [[Solomon]]). Because of geographic proximity, acculturation with [[Ethiopia]] was always strong, and the royal family traces its ancestry to this queen.\n\nThe presence of Arabians at Pentecost and Paul's three-year sojourn in Arabia suggest a very early gospel witness. A 4th-century church history, states that the apostle [[Bartholomew]] preached in Arabia and that [[Himyarites]] were among his converts. The Al-[[Jubail Church]] in what is now [[Saudi Arabia]] was built in the 4th century. Arabia's close relations with [[Ethiopia]] give significance to the conversion of [[Ethiopian eunuch|the treasurer]] to the queen of Ethiopia, not to mention the tradition that the Apostle Matthew was assigned to this land.{{ref|AFM}} [[Eusebius]] says that \"one [[Pantaenus|Pantaneous]] (c. A.D. 190) was sent from [[Alexandria]] as a missionary to the nations of the East\", including southwest Arabia, on his way to India.{{ref|AFM}}\n\n===Nubia===\nChristianity arrived early in [[Nubia]]. In the [[New Testament]] of the [[Christian Bible]], [[Ethiopian eunuch|a treasury official]] of \"Candace, queen of the Ethiopians\" returning from a trip to [[Jerusalem]] was [[baptism|baptised]] by [[Philip the Evangelist]]:\n\n: Then the Angel of the Lord said to Philip, Start out and go south to the road that leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert. And he arose and went: And behold, a [[Ethiopian eunuch|man of Ethiopia]], an [[Eunuch]] of great authority under Candace, Queen of E-thi-o'pi-ans, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship.<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|8:26\u201327|131}}</ref>\n\nEthiopia at that time meant any upper Nile region. [[Kandake|Candace]] was the name and perhaps, title for the [[Mero\u00eb]] or [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushite]] queens.\n\nIn the fourth century, bishop [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] of [[Alexandria]] consecrated  Marcus as bishop of [[Philae]] before his death in 373, showing that [[Christianity]] had permanently penetrated the region. [[John of Ephesus]] records that a [[Monophysite]] priest named Julian converted the king and his nobles of Nobatia around 545 and another kingdom of Alodia converted around 569. By the 7th century [[Makuria]] expanded becoming the dominant power in the region so strong enough to halt the southern expansion of [[Islam]] after the [[Arabs]] had taken Egypt.  After several failed invasions the new rulers agreed to a treaty with Dongola allowing for peaceful coexistence and trade.  This treaty held for six hundred years allowing Arab traders introducing Islam to Nubia and it gradually supplanted [[Christianity]].  The last record of a bishop is at [[Qasr Ibrim]] in 1372.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Christianity in the 1st century]]\n* [[Christianity in the 2nd century]]\n* [[Christianity in the 3rd century]]\n* [[Early Christian art and architecture]]\n* [[Early Christianity]]\n* [[History of Christianity]]\n* [[History of early Christianity]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[James D.G.
