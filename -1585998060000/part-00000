In a rain-soaked race it was the Chenard-Walcker team and the Bentley that set the pace, chased by the smaller 2-litre Bignan. The Bentley was delayed by stones smashing a headlight and puncturing the fuel tank, and in the end the Chenard-Walckers of [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9onard]] / [[Andr\u00e9 Lagache]] and Christian Dauvergne / Raoul Bachmann had a comfortable 1\u20132 victory.\n\nHowever, there was no official victory for them as this event was the first part of three consecutive annual races, for the [[Rudge-Whitworth]] Triennial Cup, where the ultimate winner would be the manufacturer whose best car exceeded their nominated target distance by the greatest margin. So it was the small 1.1-litre [[Salmson]] of Desvaux/Casse that took the lead in that competition. It had completed 98 laps, 46 over its 52-lap target.\n\nThe race was also an excellent exhibition of machine endurance and reliability. Thirty cars finished the event, a number not equalled at Le Mans again until [[1993 24 Hours of Le Mans|1993]].\n[[Image:1923Lemans.JPG|thumb|1923 programme cover]]\n[[File:Chenard & Walcker Sport.jpg|thumb|1923 Chenard-Walcker 3-Litre]]\n\n==Regulations==\nThe final regulations for the event were not completed by Charles Faroux and the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) until February 1923.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref><ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.38-9\">Spurring 2011, p.38-9</ref> All cars had to be standard 4-seater production models, except those under 1100cc which could be 2-seaters where at least thirty cars had been built.<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.30\">Laban 2001, p.30</ref> The vehicle had to carry 60kg lead ballast for each passenger space aside from the driver. A maximum of two drivers were allowed (but not riding together), and they alone could replenish the fluids (petrol, oil and water), although there was no minimum distance between refills as in later years. The fuel was to be supplied by the ACO.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.19\">Clausager 1982, p.19</ref> Engines had to be turned off at pit-stops, and only re-started with an onboard starter.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.30\">Laban 2001, p.30</ref>\n\nAll cars had to have standard touring equipment, such as wheel wings, hood (if a convertible), running boards, headlights, a rear-view mirror and \u2018warning devices\u2019 (horn).<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.18\">Clausager 1982, p.18</ref> None of the entered cars had window-wipers.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.43\">Spurring 2011, p.43</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\">Clarke 1998, p.11-3: Autocar Jun1 1923</ref><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.38\">Laban 2001, p.38</ref>\n\nThere was an ''hors course'' rule such that every car had to meet a certain ratio of their minimum distance at the 6, 12, and 18-hour marks or face disqualification.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.30\">Laban 2001, p.30</ref> The ratios were 80%, 85% and 90% respectively.

So, in effect, there was no prize for the individual race win.\nCuriously, the weekend chosen for the event was also when the French moved to \"summer time\" so clocks were moved forward an hour at 11&nbsp;pm, therefore the race started at 4&nbsp;pm Saturday but finished at 5&nbsp;pm on Sunday.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref>\n\n==Track==\n[[File:Circuit de la Sarthe Le Mans 1921-1928.png|thumb|350px|Le Mans in 1923]]\nAutomobile racing was well established in the [[Sarthe]] region, with races since 1906 with the very first [[French Grand Prix]]. The post-war circuit had hosted a number of races since 1920 and was {{Convert|17.26|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length. From the outskirts of [[Le Mans]] city, it ran on the main road southwards to the village of [[Mulsanne]] and back. The start/finish line was two-thirds of the back on the return leg on land rented for the event.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.33\">Spurring 2011, p.33</ref> The ''dep\u00f4ts'' (pits) consisted of wooden counters with canvas-roofed areas behind for each car. A race-control tower and two 44m wooden grandstands were built opposite the pits. A footbridge sponsored by Meyrel was built just after the start-line.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref> The track was very narrow in places, including the country roads from Mulsanne to Arnage and from the start-line to Pontlieue hairpin\n\nFor the spectators\u2019 comfort and entertainment through the event, caf\u00e9s and a dancefloor with jazz-band were set up behind the stands. There was also an area for people to use radios to pick up classical music broadcast from the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris. Generators provided power for the public address system and lighting around the spectator area, and a long scoreboard was manually maintained giving the cars\u2019 positions and laps completed and target distance.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref>\n\nAlthough most of the track was fenced from the spectators, the roads were not tar-sealed. Roading engineers were employed before the race to apply a temporary mixture of gravel, dirt and tar to the road surface. Acetylene floodlights from the army were set up at the tight corners of Pontlieue, Mulsanne and Arnage.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref>\n\n==Entries==\nFor this first endurance trial there were 37 entries, all submitted by the manufacturers rather than individual drivers.\nOnly the 2-car [[Avions Voisin]] team were late scratchings.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.43\">Spurring 2011, p.43</ref><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.37\">Laban 2001, p.37</ref> With the cars all painted in their [[List of international auto racing colours|national racing colours]], there was a predominance of French blue cars except for a single green Bentley from Great Britain and two Belgian Excelsiors in yellow.

Success in racing and sales to the Belgian royal family established the company. The 1922 Adex C had a straight-six engine putting out 130&nbsp;bhp and could reach 145&nbsp;kp/h (90&nbsp;mph), however its hefty weight impeded its acceleration rate. It had perhaps the first [[anti-roll bar]] suspension running on Belgian [[Englebert (tyre manufacturer)|Englebert]] tyres. Works drivers, Belgians Nicolas Caerels and Andr\u00e9 Dills, were pre-war veteran riding mechanics from Grand Prix and [[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.60-1\">Spurring 2011, p.60-1</ref>\n\nLa [[Lorraine-Dietrich]] had been founded as a locomotive manufacturer in 1884 in [[Alsace-Lorraine]], moving to automobiles in 1896 entering the early inter-city road-races. At war's-end the factories but soon resumed car production. The B3-6 appeared in 1922 with a straight-6 engine and 3-speed gearbox and three body-style variants were sent to Le Mans under competition director Maurice Leroux.

The DE raced at Le Mans was a 1-off special of the current popular production model fitted with its engine modified to carry an overhead-valve cylinder head. It was raced by new works driver Paul Torchy and test driver Belbeu.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.71-2\">Spurring 2011, p.71-2</ref>\n\n[[File:La Chenard et Walcker num\u00e9ro 10 de Bachmann et Dauvergne, deuxi\u00e8me des 24 Heures du Mans 1923.jpg|thumb|The #10 Chenard-Walcker of Dauvergne and Bachmann]][[Chenard-Walcker]] was a major Parisian automotive company, established in 1899 and one of the city's biggest suppliers of taxis. They had a close relationship with coachbuilding company [[FAR (Tracteurs FAR)|FAR]] who built their bodywork, led by [[Andr\u00e9 Lagache]] and Raymond Glaszmann (both keen racers). Lucien Chenard, son of the founder, had set up a works racing team in 1921 with the company test-driver [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9onard]]. Active in post-war racing they sent a trio of cars with the latest Torp\u00e9do bodystyle from FAR. Two had the new U3 3-litre engine that put out 90&nbsp;bhp, driven by L\u00e9onard with Lagache, and Glaszmann with [[Fernand Bachmann]]. The third car, with a less powerful U2 engine was run by Bachmann's brother Raoul with veteran Christian Dauvergne.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref> They were supported by a well-drilled pit crew to assist the drivers.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.48-9\">Spurring 2011, p.48-9</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\"/>\n\n[[Image:1923 Bentley 3-Litre tourer (31693952192).jpg|thumb|left|1923 Bentley 3-Litre tourer]]The sole British entry was a privately-owned [[Bentley]] with a small support team from the factory. [[W. O. Bentley]] had founded his own company straight after the war in January 1919 and regularly raced his [[Bentley 3 Litre|3-litre Sports]]. [[John Duff]] was Bentley's new London agent, who had set almost 40 international records at [[Brooklands]]. He had then broken both ankles there at the end of 1922 when he crashed, going over its banking. Duff's was the first entry received by the ACO for the race.<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.37\">Laban 2001, p.37</ref> Bentley was not convinced, but released his test driver [[Frank Clement (racing driver)|Frank Clement]] as co-driver. Duff drove the car to [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] then Clement took it to Le Mans, with two Bentley mechanics, their luggage and tools in the back seats. Unlike most other of the leading teams, the Bentley only had rear drum brakes.<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\">Clarke 1998, p.8-9: Autocar Jun1 1923</ref> It ran special long-endurance tyres, designed by Lionel Rapson, convincing Duff he could get away without the weight of carrying a spare wheel.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.56-8\">Spurring 2011, p.56-8</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\"/>\n\nThe biggest entry came from [[Rolland-Pilain]], who presented four cars. The innovative company from [[Tours]] was founded in 1905. \u00c9mile Pilain filed patents for a hydraulic braking system and a [[Sleeve valve]] engine. The four cars were all different. There was the B22 with a Torp\u00e9do open-top body and an R Berline saloon. Both had pushrod engines, and hydraulic front brakes with Dunlop tyres. The smaller RP models (Torp\u00e9do and Berline variants) had 1.9-litre side-valve engines, cable-brakes on the rear and Michelin tyres.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.73-4\">Spurring 2011, p.73-4</ref>\n\n[[File:Deux Bugatti (\u00e0 G), 29 Max de Pourtal\u00e8s- Sosth\u00e8ne de La Rochefoucault (10e) et 28 Ren\u00e9 Marie-Louis Pichard, et (\u00e0 D) la Montier Special 19 de Charles Montier et Albert Ouriou.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: The #29 Bugatti of de Pourtal\u00e8s and de la Rochefoucauld; the #28 Bugatti of Pichard and Marie; and the #19 Montier-Ford Special of Montier and Ouriou]][[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] had a major automotive plant at [[Bordeaux]] producing around {{nowrap|20,000}} cars per year by 1923. [[Charles Montier]] was Ford's agent in France<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.28\">Clausager 1982, p.28</ref> and a skilled engineer who specialised in building high-performance specials. His Le Mans entry was based on the abundant [[Ford Model T]] with his own engine design and sturdier mechanical parts. Racing his own car, he also added two rear seats hanging over the back of the rear axle to comply with the ACO regulations.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.76-7\">Spurring 2011, p.76-7</ref>\n\n[[Brasier]] had a strong racing heritage in the pre-war inter-city races, winning the last two [[Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)|Gordon Bennett Cups]] in 1904 and 1905. The brand-new TB4 model had a 2062cc engine, 4-speed gearbox and Rudge wheels.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.66-7\">Spurring 2011, p.66-7</ref> In contrast, Marius [[Berliet]] had little racing experience and saw Le mans as a good opportunity to raise his company profile. His Lyon-based factory had made huge numbers of trucks during the war. Two of the new VH model were at Le Mans, with 2617cc engines, 4-speed gearboxes, and again, Rudge wire-wheels.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.68-9\">Spurring 2011, p.68-9</ref>\n\n[[Corre La Licorne]] had grown from the company originally founded by former professional cyclist [[Jean-Marie Corre]]. Its cars had raced with moderate success before the war. Two models arrived for the race. The popular B7 tourer with a 2-litre [[Ballot (automobile)|Ballot]] engine and the new V14 with smaller 1.4-litre [[S.C.A.P.|SCAP]] engine.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.80-1\">Spurring 2011, p.80-1</ref> In a similar fashion, [[Vinot-Deguingand]] had started building bicycles in 1898 before moving onto ''voiturettes'' and then automobiles, raced for the Parisian company by the brothers L\u00e9on and Lucien Molon. One of the new BP models, with an 1847cc engine, was brought to Le Mans, again to be driven by the Molon brothers.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.82-3\">Spurring 2011, p.82-3</ref>\n\nJacques Bignan was a Parisian engineer who expanded and founded his own [[Bignan (automobile)|automobile company]] in 1918. It was initially subcontracted by Automobiles Gr\u00e9goire to build cars for British importer [[Malcolm Campbell]]. Two of their successful 11CV cars were entered, one with a special [[Desmodromic valve]] engine developed by French race-driver [[Albert Guyot]] and engineer N\u00e9morin Causan. The complex valve-system gave the 2-litre engine 75&nbsp;bhp instead of 70&nbsp;bhp but had a far better acceleration curve. It was driven by Paul Gros and Baron de Tornaco.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.53-5\">Spurring 2011, p.53-5</ref>\n\n[[Georges Irat]] was a decorated French pilot from the war who moved from being a foreign-car importer in Paris to setting up his own company in 1921 with Maurice Gaultier, an engine designer from Delage. Two of the latest Torp\u00e9do-bodied versions of their Type A were entered. The 1995cc engine put out about 50&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.78\">Spurring 2011, p.78</ref>\n\n[[Salmson]] had been formed in 1890 as a pump and compressor-manufacturer. After being one of the earliest makers of air engines (in 1908), it had been an important French aircraft manufacturer during the war. In 1919, it converted its Paris factories to car and [[cyclecar]] production. The works racing team, formed in 1921, had been dominant in the small-engine classes led by former fighter pilot [[Robert Benoist]]. Lucien Desvaux, Benoist and Georges Casse had just finished 1\u20132\u20133 at the single-driver 24-hour Bol d\u2019Or cyclecar race the weekend before Le Mans. Two VAL-3 ''voiturettes'' were entered for Desvaux / Casse and the other regular team driver Luis Ramon Bueno, who drove with Maurice Benoist (Robert's brother).<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.50-52\">Spurring 2011, p.50-2</ref>\n\n[[Bugatti]] was still a small company, yet to achieve its great fame. Recently relocated back to [[Molsheim]] when the [[Alsace]] was ceded to France after the war, [[Ettore Bugatti]] was still only producing small touring cars. The two [[Bugatti Type 13#Type 22|T22 \"Brescia Bugattis\"]] were privately owned, fitted with the new 1495cc engine capable of 95&nbsp;kp/h (50&nbsp;mph). However the cars were heavy and further stymied by the 180kg of required passenger-ballast to be carried for a 4-seat car.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.83-4\">Spurring 2011, p.83-4</ref>\n\nSARA was a new Parisian company, only formed a year earlier to build cars based around the pioneering new pressurised [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooling system]] of August Tisserant. The new ATS 2-seater model had the only French 4-cylinder air-cooled engine, and produced 30&nbsp;bhp and two cars were entered. French financier and company co-owner Fran\u00e7ois Piazzoli drove a lightened version without running boards.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.69-70\">Spurring 2011, p.69-70</ref> [[Amilcar]] was another new Parisian company formed in 1921 producing small-engined cars and cyclecars. Their CC model won Europe's first 24-hour event at the 1922 Bol d\u2019Or,<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.36\">Laban 2001, p.36</ref> beating Salmson. An entry to Le Mans was filed at the behest of privateer owners Maurice Boutmy and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Marcandanti to race the new CV model. The 1004cc engine produced just 18&nbsp;bhp. But as a 2-seater it was also given the smallest target distance of just 48 laps.\n\n==Practice==\nWith no official practice session, some teams (including La Lorraine, Chenard-Walcker and Bignan) arrived earlier in the week before Friday scrutineering to learn the track.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.46-8\">Spurring 2011, p.46-8</ref>\nFor the standing start, the cars were lined up on the front straight two-by-two with engines off. Pictures show them in numerical order,<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.40-1\">Spurring 2011, p.40-1</ref><ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.43\">Spurring 2011, p.43</ref><ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.69-70\">Spurring 2011, p.69-70</ref> although the \"Autocar\" review of the time says it was in the order their entries were received by the ACO.<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\"/>\n\nSalmson's race engineer \u00c9mile Petit was furious when he arrived at the track to find company director Andr\u00e9 Lombard had changed the cars\u2019 electrics to a new supplier.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.50-52\">Spurring 2011, p.50-2</ref>\n\n==Race==\n===Start===\nIn an inauspicious omen, the early summertime start of the first 24 Hours of Le Mans at 4&nbsp;pm began just after a hailstorm, in cold rain and wind. The honour to drop the flag to start the race fell to ''Monsieur'' Carp\u00e9, the ACO chief timekeeper.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.42\">Spurring 2011, p.42</ref> The big Belgian Excelsiors were overtaken from the start by Robert Bloch's Lorraine-Dietrich. What was supposed to be an \"endurance trial\" soon became a race along the narrow country roads.\n[[Image:LeMans 1923.jpg|thumb|Start of the race]]\n\nIt was perhaps surprising then that throughout the rain that lasted the first four hours,<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\"/><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.38\">Laban 2001, p.38</ref> there were no major incidents. It was soon apparent that the quickest cars were the Chenard-Walcker team, the Bentley, one of the Excelsiors, and one of the 2-litre Bignans.<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\"/> The first pitstops for fuel and driver-changes did not start until after 7&nbsp;pm. The 38-year-old Lagache and veteran Dauvergne bought their Chenard-Walckers in with a good lead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.48-9\">Spurring 2011, p.48-9</ref> The Belgian-driven Excelsior gradually lost time with its sluggish acceleration rate.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.60-1\">Spurring 2011, p.60-1</ref> After a brief respite the rain and wind returned making for very difficult night-driving, especially as most cars chose not to run with their hoods up, as it compromised top speed and fuel economy.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.43\">Spurring 2011, p.43</ref> Most drivers were not wearing goggles despite the rain and all the mud-splatter coming off the cars ahead of them.<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\"/>\n\n===Night===\nThe roads were soon getting muddy and rutted. A number of cars had headlamp failures as water got into their acetylene and electrical systems, particularly the two SARAs. Indeed, the lights went out on the Piazzali/Marandet SARA just as it was cornering. Running off the road, it was too badly damaged to continue, becoming the first retirement in the history of the Le Mans 24 Hours.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.71\">Spurring 2011, p.71</ref> Convoys would form as those cars followed ones with functioning lights. The Chenard drivers were equipped with hand-operated acetylene spotlamps to help with their main lights.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.48-9\">Spurring 2011, p.48-9</ref>\n\nDuring the night a stone struck Ren\u00e9 Marie's Bugatti and punctured the fuel tank. The car came to a halt near Arnage and Marie walked the 5km back to the pits. The officials had not anticipated this circumstance in their regulations that fuel could only be added in the pits, as it was accidental rather than a miscalculation. They agreed he would be allowed to carry two fuel tanks back to the car to get it going again. He got back to the pits, made the repairs and was able to continue the race.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.83-4\">Spurring 2011, p.83-4</ref>\n[[Image: Tableau d'affichage nocturne des 24 heures du Mans 1923.jpg|thumb|400px|Scoreboard and pit at night]]\n\nJust before midnight the Bentley was delayed by an errant stone smashing a headlamp. Not thinking to bring a spare, the team was sportingly offered one by the Chenard team. But the time needed to fit the lamp was deemed too long and the car continued with just the one.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.58-9\">Spurring 2011, p.58-9</ref> Later in the night, the Bentley had a very near miss avoiding Paul Gros\u2019 Bignan that had burst a tyre approaching Mulsanne corner. Both cars braked hard and swerved onto the grass, ending up only inches apart.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.53-5\">Spurring 2011, p.53-5</ref><ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.56-8\">Spurring 2011, p.56-8</ref> Another incident occurred when the French-driven Excelsior went off the road into a sand-trap, taking an hour to dig it out, relatively undamaged.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.60-1\">Spurring 2011, p.60-1</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\"/>\n\nAt the half-way point, at 5&nbsp;am, the Chenard-Walcker of L\u00e9onard/Lagache had a two-lap lead over the Bentley (assisted by their car's better brakes<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.48-9\">Spurring 2011, p.48-9</ref>) and the other two Chenards and the Bignan. The rain finally eased off as dawn came.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.45\">Spurring 2011, p.45</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\"/>\n\n===Morning===\nSuperior pitwork by their well-drilled team got all three Chenard-Walckers a three-lap lead over the Bentley in the early morning. But as the roads gradually dried out, the Bentley was able to put in quicker lap-times. Lagache and L\u00e9onard in turn picked up their pace setting new lap records, even though Duff was able to get one of the laps back.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.45\">Spurring 2011, p.45</ref>\n\nThen just before midday the Bentley came to a stop at Arnage, after another stone had hit it. Like the Bugatti, the fuel tank had been punctured and the petrol had drained out. Clement walked back to the pits, and using the Bugatti precedent earlier, was allowed to use a ''gendarme's'' bicycle with two fuel tanks over his shoulder to refill the Bentley enough to get it back to the pits (and return the bicycle).<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.58-9\">Spurring 2011, p.58-9</ref><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.39\">Laban 2001, p.39</ref>\n\n===Finish and post-race===\nIt took two and a half hours to get the Bentley back and repaired with a cork in the hole.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.58-9\">Spurring 2011, p.58-9</ref> He then went out and set the fastest lap of the race in the drying conditions. However, the Chenard-Walckers could not be caught and eased off to score a decisive 1\u20132 victory on distance. Third was the Bignan of Gros/de Tornaco comfortably winning the 2-litre category by 8 laps from its team-mate. But there was a bad incident after the end of the race. Paul Gros left his Bignan and was crossing the circuit to shake the hand of a friend, when he was struck by the car of second-place Raoul Bachmann. Bachmann's was the last car to complete the final lap and when he arrived the finish line was already full of cars and spectators. He braked hard and swerved, and fortunately Gros only suffered a broken arm and bruises.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.45\">Spurring 2011, p.45</ref><ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.53-5\">Spurring 2011, p.53-5</ref>\n\nFourth equal on distance, having all completed 91 laps were the Bentley, the lead Excelsior driven by the Belgians Caerels and Dills, and the second Bignan of de Marne and Martin.\n\nThe Chenard-Walcker of L\u00e9onard and Lagache is often cited as the inaugural winner of the Le Mans 24 Hours, which it was on distance. However, the regulations stipulated it was merely the first of three annual races with the winner<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.28\">Clausager 1982, p.28</ref> being the one who exceeded their minimum stipulated by the greatest ratio. In fact, the leader at this first stage of the event (and awarded the Coupe Interim) was the 1.1-litre Salmson of Desvaux and Casse that finished 12th but had exceeded its target distance by 46 laps.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.50-52\">Spurring 2011, p.50-2</ref>\n\nIt was a remarkable testament to the endurance of the cars that, despite some having time-consuming engine issues, only 3 cars were not running at the end. Indeed, the 90% finish ratio was the best for many years and it was not until 1993 that as many as 30 cars finished a Le Mans. Despite the weather, it was a record distance for a 24-hour race.<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\"/> The Bentley went through on one set of its Rapson tyres,<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.58-9\">Spurring 2011, p.58-9</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\"/> as did the Berliet,<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.68-9\">Spurring 2011, p.68-9</ref> and the smaller Corre-La Licorne was the only tourer to drive with its hood up for the race's duration.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.80-1\">Spurring 2011, p.80-1</ref>\n\nThe Rolland-Pillain team caused the scorekeepers some confusion on the Sunday. Firstly, the target laps required that was set on the scoreboard was transposed between the bigger- and smaller-engined cars and then the scorers may have confused the two open-top cars and credited laps by Marinier/Robin to Delalande/Marguenat. Or the bigger-engine cars in the team were assigned the lower numbers by mistake. Despite issues with leaks from the hydraulic brake system, all four cars reached their target distances.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.75\">Spurring 2011, p.75</ref> Similarly, the leading Bugatti apparently covered an impossible number of laps on Sunday afternoon (to complete 40 laps in the same time as the leader only managed 32), credited for laps at the expense of the delayed Pichard/Marie team car.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.83-4\">Spurring 2011, p.83-4</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.24h-en-piste.com/Galeries/Article_044_ENG.html|title=24h du Mans \u2013 The 1923 ranking, revised and corrected|website=www.24h-en-piste.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThe Georges-Irat team had requested the ACO to monitor their fuel consumption through the race, and officials came back with figures of 32.7 mpg (8.65 litres/100km) for their best-finishing car.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.78\">Spurring 2011, p.78</ref> By contrast, the SARA that covered the least distance in the 24 hours had an economy of 47 mpg (6.0 litres/100km).<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.71\">Spurring 2011, p.71</ref> Excelsior were not convinced they could win the Coupe Rudge-Whitworth and did not return, however they had further success in their local endurance race, the [[Spa 24 Hours]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.62\">Spurring 2011, p.62</ref> Delage also would not return for over a decade, choosing instead to concentrate on a new Grand Prix racing team.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.71-2\">Spurring 2011, p.71-2</ref>\n\nAfter the major argument at Salmson before the race, Lombard left the company and the successful race-team was disbanded at the end of the year.

In a rain-soaked race it was the Chenard-Walcker team and the Bentley that set the pace, chased by the smaller 2-litre Bignan. The Bentley was delayed by stones smashing a headlight and puncturing the fuel tank, and in the end the Chenard-Walckers of [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9onard]] / [[Andr\u00e9 Lagache]] and Christian Dauvergne / Raoul Bachmann had a comfortable 1\u20132 victory.\n\nHowever, there was no official victory for them as this event was the first part of three consecutive annual races, for the [[Rudge-Whitworth]] Triennial Cup, where the ultimate winner would be the manufacturer whose best car exceeded their nominated target distance by the greatest margin. So it was the small 1.1-litre [[Salmson]] of Desvaux/Casse that took the lead in that competition. It had completed 98 laps, 46 over its 52-lap target.\n\nThe race was also an excellent exhibition of machine endurance and reliability. Thirty cars finished the event, a number not equalled at Le Mans again until [[1993 24 Hours of Le Mans|1993]].\n[[Image:1923Lemans.JPG|thumb|1923 programme cover]]\n[[File:Chenard & Walcker Sport.jpg|thumb|1923 Chenard-Walcker 3-Litre]]\n\n==Regulations==\nThe final regulations for the event were not completed by Charles Faroux and the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) until February 1923.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref><ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.38-9\">Spurring 2011, p.38-9</ref> All cars had to be standard 4-seater production models, except those under 1100cc which could be 2-seaters where at least thirty cars had been built.<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.30\">Laban 2001, p.30</ref> The vehicle had to carry 60kg lead ballast for each passenger space aside from the driver. A maximum of two drivers were allowed (but not riding together), and they alone could replenish the fluids (petrol, oil and water), although there was no minimum distance between refills as in later years. The fuel was to be supplied by the ACO.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.19\">Clausager 1982, p.19</ref> Engines had to be turned off at pit-stops, and only re-started with an onboard starter.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.30\">Laban 2001, p.30</ref>\n\nAll cars had to have standard touring equipment, such as wheel wings, hood (if a convertible), running boards, headlights, a rear-view mirror and \u2018warning devices\u2019 (horn).<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.18\">Clausager 1982, p.18</ref> None of the entered cars had window-wipers.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.43\">Spurring 2011, p.43</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\">Clarke 1998, p.11-3: Autocar Jun1 1923</ref><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.38\">Laban 2001, p.38</ref>\n\nThere was an ''hors course'' rule such that every car had to meet a certain ratio of their minimum distance at the 6, 12, and 18-hour marks or face disqualification.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.30\">Laban 2001, p.30</ref> The ratios were 80%, 85% and 90% respectively.

So, in effect, there was no prize for the individual race win.\nCuriously, the weekend chosen for the event was also when the French moved to \"summer time\" so clocks were moved forward an hour at 11&nbsp;pm, therefore the race started at 4&nbsp;pm Saturday but finished at 5&nbsp;pm on Sunday.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref>\n\n==Track==\n[[File:Circuit de la Sarthe Le Mans 1921-1928.png|thumb|350px|Le Mans in 1923]]\nAutomobile racing was well established in the [[Sarthe]] region, with races since 1906 with the very first [[French Grand Prix]]. The post-war circuit had hosted a number of races since 1920 and was {{Convert|17.26|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length. From the outskirts of [[Le Mans]] city, it ran on the main road southwards to the village of [[Mulsanne]] and back. The start/finish line was two-thirds of the back on the return leg on land rented for the event.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.33\">Spurring 2011, p.33</ref> The ''dep\u00f4ts'' (pits) consisted of wooden counters with canvas-roofed areas behind for each car. A race-control tower and two 44m wooden grandstands were built opposite the pits. A footbridge sponsored by Meyrel was built just after the start-line.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref> The track was very narrow in places, including the country roads from Mulsanne to Arnage and from the start-line to Pontlieue hairpin\n\nFor the spectators\u2019 comfort and entertainment through the event, caf\u00e9s and a dancefloor with jazz-band were set up behind the stands. There was also an area for people to use radios to pick up classical music broadcast from the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris. Generators provided power for the public address system and lighting around the spectator area, and a long scoreboard was manually maintained giving the cars\u2019 positions and laps completed and target distance.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref>\n\nAlthough most of the track was fenced from the spectators, the roads were not tar-sealed. Roading engineers were employed before the race to apply a temporary mixture of gravel, dirt and tar to the road surface. Acetylene floodlights from the army were set up at the tight corners of Pontlieue, Mulsanne and Arnage.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref>\n\n==Entries==\nFor this first endurance trial there were 37 entries, all submitted by the manufacturers rather than individual drivers.\nOnly the 2-car [[Avions Voisin]] team were late scratchings.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.43\">Spurring 2011, p.43</ref><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.37\">Laban 2001, p.37</ref> With the cars all painted in their [[List of international auto racing colours|national racing colours]], there was a predominance of French blue cars except for a single green Bentley from Great Britain and two Belgian Excelsiors in yellow. The cars were assigned their numbers in the order of their engine size. Many of the car models were co-identified with the French CV-system of [[Tax horsepower#France|automotive horsepower tax]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! Category\n!

Success in racing and sales to the Belgian royal family established the company. The 1922 Adex C had a straight-six engine putting out 130&nbsp;bhp and could reach 145&nbsp;kp/h (90&nbsp;mph), however its hefty weight impeded its acceleration rate. It had perhaps the first [[anti-roll bar]] suspension running on Belgian [[Englebert (tyre manufacturer)|Englebert]] tyres. Works drivers, Belgians Nicolas Caerels and Andr\u00e9 Dills, were pre-war veteran riding mechanics from Grand Prix and [[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.60-1\">Spurring 2011, p.60-1</ref>\n\nLa [[Lorraine-Dietrich]] had been founded as a locomotive manufacturer in 1884 in [[Alsace-Lorraine]], moving to automobiles in 1896 entering the early inter-city road-races. At war's-end the factories but soon resumed car production. The B3-6 appeared in 1922 with a straight-6 engine and 3-speed gearbox and three body-style variants were sent to Le Mans under competition director Maurice Leroux. The fastest was the lightened Torp\u00e9do bodystyle, capable of almost 145&nbsp;kp/h (90&nbsp;mph).<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.62-4\">Spurring 2011, p.62-4</ref>\n\n[[Delage]] was another famous French car company with a strong pre-war motor-racing pedigree already, including winning the [[1914 Indianapolis 500]], and quickly resumed racing after the war with its big 5- and 6-litre racing cars. The DE raced at Le Mans was a 1-off special of the current popular production model fitted with its engine modified to carry an overhead-valve cylinder head. It was raced by new works driver Paul Torchy and test driver Belbeu.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.71-2\">Spurring 2011, p.71-2</ref>\n\n[[File:La Chenard et Walcker num\u00e9ro 10 de Bachmann et Dauvergne, deuxi\u00e8me des 24 Heures du Mans 1923.jpg|thumb|The #10 Chenard-Walcker of Dauvergne and Bachmann]][[Chenard-Walcker]] was a major Parisian automotive company, established in 1899 and one of the city's biggest suppliers of taxis. They had a close relationship with coachbuilding company [[FAR (Tracteurs FAR)|FAR]] who built their bodywork, led by [[Andr\u00e9 Lagache]] and Raymond Glaszmann (both keen racers). Lucien Chenard, son of the founder, had set up a works racing team in 1921 with the company test-driver [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9onard]]. Active in post-war racing they sent a trio of cars with the latest Torp\u00e9do bodystyle from FAR. Two had the new U3 3-litre engine that put out 90&nbsp;bhp, driven by L\u00e9onard with Lagache, and Glaszmann with [[Fernand Bachmann]]. The third car, with a less powerful U2 engine was run by Bachmann's brother Raoul with veteran Christian Dauvergne.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.44-5\">Spurring 2011, p.44-5</ref> They were supported by a well-drilled pit crew to assist the drivers.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.48-9\">Spurring 2011, p.48-9</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\"/>\n\n[[Image:1923 Bentley 3-Litre tourer (31693952192).jpg|thumb|left|1923 Bentley 3-Litre tourer]]The sole British entry was a privately-owned [[Bentley]] with a small support team from the factory. [[W. O. Bentley]] had founded his own company straight after the war in January 1919 and regularly raced his [[Bentley 3 Litre|3-litre Sports]]. [[John Duff]] was Bentley's new London agent, who had set almost 40 international records at [[Brooklands]]. He had then broken both ankles there at the end of 1922 when he crashed, going over its banking. Duff's was the first entry received by the ACO for the race.<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.37\">Laban 2001, p.37</ref> Bentley was not convinced, but released his test driver [[Frank Clement (racing driver)|Frank Clement]] as co-driver. Duff drove the car to [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] then Clement took it to Le Mans, with two Bentley mechanics, their luggage and tools in the back seats. Unlike most other of the leading teams, the Bentley only had rear drum brakes.<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\">Clarke 1998, p.8-9: Autocar Jun1 1923</ref> It ran special long-endurance tyres, designed by Lionel Rapson, convincing Duff he could get away without the weight of carrying a spare wheel.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.56-8\">Spurring 2011, p.56-8</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\"/>\n\nThe biggest entry came from [[Rolland-Pilain]], who presented four cars. The innovative company from [[Tours]] was founded in 1905. \u00c9mile Pilain filed patents for a hydraulic braking system and a [[Sleeve valve]] engine. The four cars were all different. There was the B22 with a Torp\u00e9do open-top body and an R Berline saloon. Both had pushrod engines, and hydraulic front brakes with Dunlop tyres. The smaller RP models (Torp\u00e9do and Berline variants) had 1.9-litre side-valve engines, cable-brakes on the rear and Michelin tyres.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.73-4\">Spurring 2011, p.73-4</ref>\n\n[[File:Deux Bugatti (\u00e0 G), 29 Max de Pourtal\u00e8s- Sosth\u00e8ne de La Rochefoucault (10e) et 28 Ren\u00e9 Marie-Louis Pichard, et (\u00e0 D) la Montier Special 19 de Charles Montier et Albert Ouriou.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: The #29 Bugatti of de Pourtal\u00e8s and de la Rochefoucauld; the #28 Bugatti of Pichard and Marie; and the #19 Montier-Ford Special of Montier and Ouriou]][[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] had a major automotive plant at [[Bordeaux]] producing around {{nowrap|20 000}} cars per year by 1923. [[Charles Montier]] was Ford's agent in France<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.28\">Clausager 1982, p.28</ref> and a skilled engineer who specialised in building high-performance specials. His Le Mans entry was based on the abundant [[Ford Model T]] with his own engine design and sturdier mechanical parts. Racing his own car, he also added two rear seats hanging over the back of the rear axle to comply with the ACO regulations.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.76-7\">Spurring 2011, p.76-7</ref>\n\n[[Brasier]] had a strong racing heritage in the pre-war inter-city races, winning the last two [[Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)|Gordon Bennett Cups]] in 1904 and 1905. The brand-new TB4 model had a 2062cc engine, 4-speed gearbox and Rudge wheels.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.66-7\">Spurring 2011, p.66-7</ref> In contrast, Marius [[Berliet]] had little racing experience and saw Le mans as a good opportunity to raise his company profile. His Lyon-based factory had made huge numbers of trucks during the war. Two of the new VH model were at Le Mans, with 2617cc engines, 4-speed gearboxes, and again, Rudge wire-wheels.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.68-9\">Spurring 2011, p.68-9</ref>\n\n[[Corre La Licorne]] had grown from the company originally founded by former professional cyclist [[Jean-Marie Corre]]. Its cars had raced with moderate success before the war. Two models arrived for the race. The popular B7 tourer with a 2-litre [[Ballot (automobile)|Ballot]] engine and the new V14 with smaller 1.4-litre [[S.C.A.P.|SCAP]] engine.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.80-1\">Spurring 2011, p.80-1</ref> In a similar fashion, [[Vinot-Deguingand]] had started building bicycles in 1898 before moving onto ''voiturettes'' and then automobiles, raced for the Parisian company by the brothers L\u00e9on and Lucien Molon. One of the new BP models, with an 1847cc engine, was brought to Le Mans, again to be driven by the Molon brothers.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.82-3\">Spurring 2011, p.82-3</ref>\n\nJacques Bignan was a Parisian engineer who expanded and founded his own [[Bignan (automobile)|automobile company]] in 1918. It was initially subcontracted by Automobiles Gr\u00e9goire to build cars for British importer [[Malcolm Campbell]]. Two of their successful 11CV cars were entered, one with a special [[Desmodromic valve]] engine developed by French race-driver [[Albert Guyot]] and engineer N\u00e9morin Causan. The complex valve-system gave the 2-litre engine 75&nbsp;bhp instead of 70&nbsp;bhp but had a far better acceleration curve. It was driven by Paul Gros and Baron de Tornaco.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.53-5\">Spurring 2011, p.53-5</ref>\n\n[[Georges Irat]] was a decorated French pilot from the war who moved from being a foreign-car importer in Paris to setting up his own company in 1921 with Maurice Gaultier, an engine designer from Delage. Two of the latest Torp\u00e9do-bodied versions of their Type A were entered. The 1995cc engine put out about 50&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.78\">Spurring 2011, p.78</ref>\n\n[[Salmson]] had been formed in 1890 as a pump and compressor-manufacturer. After being one of the earliest makers of air engines (in 1908), it had been an important French aircraft manufacturer during the war. In 1919, it converted its Paris factories to car and [[cyclecar]] production. The works racing team, formed in 1921, had been dominant in the small-engine classes led by former fighter pilot [[Robert Benoist]]. Lucien Desvaux, Benoist and Georges Casse had just finished 1\u20132\u20133 at the single-driver 24-hour Bol d\u2019Or cyclecar race the weekend before Le Mans. Two VAL-3 ''voiturettes'' were entered for Desvaux / Casse and the other regular team driver Luis Ramon Bueno, who drove with Maurice Benoist (Robert's brother).<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.50-52\">Spurring 2011, p.50-2</ref>\n\n[[Bugatti]] was still a small company, yet to achieve its great fame. Recently relocated back to [[Molsheim]] when the [[Alsace]] was ceded to France after the war, [[Ettore Bugatti]] was still only producing small touring cars. The two [[Bugatti Type 13#Type 22|T22 \"Brescia Bugattis\"]] were privately owned, fitted with the new 1495cc engine capable of 95&nbsp;kp/h (50&nbsp;mph). However the cars were heavy and further stymied by the 180kg of required passenger-ballast to be carried for a 4-seat car.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.83-4\">Spurring 2011, p.83-4</ref>\n\nSARA was a new Parisian company, only formed a year earlier to build cars based around the pioneering new pressurised [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooling system]] of August Tisserant. The new ATS 2-seater model had the only French 4-cylinder air-cooled engine, and produced 30&nbsp;bhp and two cars were entered. French financier and company co-owner Fran\u00e7ois Piazzoli drove a lightened version without running boards.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.69-70\">Spurring 2011, p.69-70</ref> [[Amilcar]] was another new Parisian company formed in 1921 producing small-engined cars and cyclecars. Their CC model won Europe's first 24-hour event at the 1922 Bol d\u2019Or,<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.36\">Laban 2001, p.36</ref> beating Salmson. An entry to Le Mans was filed at the behest of privateer owners Maurice Boutmy and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Marcandanti to race the new CV model. The 1004cc engine produced just 18&nbsp;bhp. But as a 2-seater it was also given the smallest target distance of just 48 laps.\n\n==Practice==\nWith no official practice session, some teams (including La Lorraine, Chenard-Walcker and Bignan) arrived earlier in the week before Friday scrutineering to learn the track.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.46-8\">Spurring 2011, p.46-8</ref>\nFor the standing start, the cars were lined up on the front straight two-by-two with engines off. Pictures show them in numerical order,<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.40-1\">Spurring 2011, p.40-1</ref><ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.43\">Spurring 2011, p.43</ref><ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.69-70\">Spurring 2011, p.69-70</ref> although the \"Autocar\" review of the time says it was in the order their entries were received by the ACO.<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\"/>\n\nSalmson's race engineer \u00c9mile Petit was furious when he arrived at the track to find company director Andr\u00e9 Lombard had changed the cars\u2019 electrics to a new supplier.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.50-52\">Spurring 2011, p.50-2</ref>\n\n==Race==\n===Start===\nIn an inauspicious omen, the early summertime start of the first 24 Hours of Le Mans at 4&nbsp;pm began just after a hailstorm, in cold rain and wind. The honour to drop the flag to start the race fell to ''Monsieur'' Carp\u00e9, the ACO chief timekeeper.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.42\">Spurring 2011, p.42</ref> The big Belgian Excelsiors were overtaken from the start by Robert Bloch's Lorraine-Dietrich. What was supposed to be an \"endurance trial\" soon became a race along the narrow country roads.\n[[Image:LeMans 1923.jpg|thumb|Start of the race]]\n\nIt was perhaps surprising then that throughout the rain that lasted the first four hours,<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\"/><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.38\">Laban 2001, p.38</ref> there were no major incidents. It was soon apparent that the quickest cars were the Chenard-Walcker team, the Bentley, one of the Excelsiors, and one of the 2-litre Bignans.<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\"/> The first pitstops for fuel and driver-changes did not start until after 7&nbsp;pm. The 38-year-old Lagache and veteran Dauvergne bought their Chenard-Walckers in with a good lead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.48-9\">Spurring 2011, p.48-9</ref> The Belgian-driven Excelsior gradually lost time with its sluggish acceleration rate.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.60-1\">Spurring 2011, p.60-1</ref> After a brief respite the rain and wind returned making for very difficult night-driving, especially as most cars chose not to run with their hoods up, as it compromised top speed and fuel economy.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.43\">Spurring 2011, p.43</ref> Most drivers were not wearing goggles despite the rain and all the mud-splatter coming off the cars ahead of them.<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\"/>\n\n===Night===\nThe roads were soon getting muddy and rutted. A number of cars had headlamp failures as water got into their acetylene and electrical systems, particularly the two SARAs. Indeed, the lights went out on the Piazzali/Marandet SARA just as it was cornering. Running off the road, it was too badly damaged to continue, becoming the first retirement in the history of the Le Mans 24 Hours.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.71\">Spurring 2011, p.71</ref> Convoys would form as those cars followed ones with functioning lights. The Chenard drivers were equipped with hand-operated acetylene spotlamps to help with their main lights.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.48-9\">Spurring 2011, p.48-9</ref>\n\nDuring the night a stone struck Ren\u00e9 Marie's Bugatti and punctured the fuel tank. The car came to a halt near Arnage and Marie walked the 5km back to the pits. The officials had not anticipated this circumstance in their regulations that fuel could only be added in the pits, as it was accidental rather than a miscalculation. They agreed he would be allowed to carry two fuel tanks back to the car to get it going again. He got back to the pits, made the repairs and was able to continue the race.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.83-4\">Spurring 2011, p.83-4</ref>\n[[Image: Tableau d'affichage nocturne des 24 heures du Mans 1923.jpg|thumb|400px|Scoreboard and pit at night]]\n\nJust before midnight the Bentley was delayed by an errant stone smashing a headlamp. Not thinking to bring a spare, the team was sportingly offered one by the Chenard team. But the time needed to fit the lamp was deemed too long and the car continued with just the one.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.58-9\">Spurring 2011, p.58-9</ref> Later in the night, the Bentley had a very near miss avoiding Paul Gros\u2019 Bignan that had burst a tyre approaching Mulsanne corner. Both cars braked hard and swerved onto the grass, ending up only inches apart.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.53-5\">Spurring 2011, p.53-5</ref><ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.56-8\">Spurring 2011, p.56-8</ref> Another incident occurred when the French-driven Excelsior went off the road into a sand-trap, taking an hour to dig it out, relatively undamaged.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.60-1\">Spurring 2011, p.60-1</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\"/>\n\nAt the half-way point, at 5&nbsp;am, the Chenard-Walcker of L\u00e9onard/Lagache had a two-lap lead over the Bentley (assisted by their car's better brakes<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.48-9\">Spurring 2011, p.48-9</ref>) and the other two Chenards and the Bignan. The rain finally eased off as dawn came.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.45\">Spurring 2011, p.45</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\"/>\n\n===Morning===\nSuperior pitwork by their well-drilled team got all three Chenard-Walckers a three-lap lead over the Bentley in the early morning. But as the roads gradually dried out, the Bentley was able to put in quicker lap-times. Lagache and L\u00e9onard in turn picked up their pace setting new lap records, even though Duff was able to get one of the laps back.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.45\">Spurring 2011, p.45</ref>\n\nThen just before midday the Bentley came to a stop at Arnage, after another stone had hit it. Like the Bugatti, the fuel tank had been punctured and the petrol had drained out. Clement walked back to the pits, and using the Bugatti precedent earlier, was allowed to use a ''gendarme's'' bicycle with two fuel tanks over his shoulder to refill the Bentley enough to get it back to the pits (and return the bicycle).<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.58-9\">Spurring 2011, p.58-9</ref><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.39\">Laban 2001, p.39</ref>\n\n===Finish and post-race===\nIt took two and a half hours to get the Bentley back and repaired with a cork in the hole.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.58-9\">Spurring 2011, p.58-9</ref> He then went out and set the fastest lap of the race in the drying conditions. However, the Chenard-Walckers could not be caught and eased off to score a decisive 1\u20132 victory on distance. Third was the Bignan of Gros/de Tornaco comfortably winning the 2-litre category by 8 laps from its team-mate. But there was a bad incident after the end of the race. Paul Gros left his Bignan and was crossing the circuit to shake the hand of a friend, when he was struck by the car of second-place Raoul Bachmann. Bachmann's was the last car to complete the final lap and when he arrived the finish line was already full of cars and spectators. He braked hard and swerved, and fortunately Gros only suffered a broken arm and bruises.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.45\">Spurring 2011, p.45</ref><ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.53-5\">Spurring 2011, p.53-5</ref>\n\nFourth equal on distance, having all completed 91 laps were the Bentley, the lead Excelsior driven by the Belgians Caerels and Dills, and the second Bignan of de Marne and Martin.\n\nThe Chenard-Walcker of L\u00e9onard and Lagache is often cited as the inaugural winner of the Le Mans 24 Hours, which it was on distance. However, the regulations stipulated it was merely the first of three annual races with the winner<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.28\">Clausager 1982, p.28</ref> being the one who exceeded their minimum stipulated by the greatest ratio. In fact, the leader at this first stage of the event (and awarded the Coupe Interim) was the 1.1-litre Salmson of Desvaux and Casse that finished 12th but had exceeded its target distance by 46 laps.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.50-52\">Spurring 2011, p.50-2</ref>\n\nIt was a remarkable testament to the endurance of the cars that, despite some having time-consuming engine issues, only 3 cars were not running at the end. Indeed, the 90% finish ratio was the best for many years and it was not until 1993 that as many as 30 cars finished a Le Mans. Despite the weather, it was a record distance for a 24-hour race.<ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\"/> The Bentley went through on one set of its Rapson tyres,<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.58-9\">Spurring 2011, p.58-9</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.8-9\"/> as did the Berliet,<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.68-9\">Spurring 2011, p.68-9</ref> and the smaller Corre-La Licorne was the only tourer to drive with its hood up for the race's duration.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.80-1\">Spurring 2011, p.80-1</ref>\n\nThe Rolland-Pillain team caused the scorekeepers some confusion on the Sunday. Firstly, the target laps required that was set on the scoreboard was transposed between the bigger- and smaller-engined cars and then the scorers may have confused the two open-top cars and credited laps by Marinier/Robin to Delalande/Marguenat. Or the bigger-engine cars in the team were assigned the lower numbers by mistake. Despite issues with leaks from the hydraulic brake system, all four cars reached their target distances.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.75\">Spurring 2011, p.75</ref> Similarly, the leading Bugatti apparently covered an impossible number of laps on Sunday afternoon (to complete 40 laps in the same time as the leader only managed 32), credited for laps at the expense of the delayed Pichard/Marie team car.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.83-4\">Spurring 2011, p.83-4</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.24h-en-piste.com/Galeries/Article_044_ENG.html|title=24h du Mans \u2013 The 1923 ranking, revised and corrected|website=www.24h-en-piste.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThe Georges-Irat team had requested the ACO to monitor their fuel consumption through the race, and officials came back with figures of 32.7 mpg (8.65 litres/100km) for their best-finishing car.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.78\">Spurring 2011, p.78</ref> By contrast, the SARA that covered the least distance in the 24 hours had an economy of 47 mpg (6.0 litres/100km).<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.71\">Spurring 2011, p.71</ref> Excelsior were not convinced they could win the Coupe Rudge-Whitworth and did not return, however they had further success in their local endurance race, the [[Spa 24 Hours]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.62\">Spurring 2011, p.62</ref> Delage also would not return for over a decade, choosing instead to concentrate on a new Grand Prix racing team.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.71-2\">Spurring 2011, p.71-2</ref>\n\nAfter the major argument at Salmson before the race, Lombard left the company and the successful race-team was disbanded at the end of the year. Although now well-placed to win the Triennial Cup, they would not return until 1926.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.50-52\">Spurring 2011, p.50-2</ref>\n\nRepusseau & Cie, French agents for the American [[Edward V. Hartford|Hartford Suspension Company]], had set up a dining area for the drivers and pit crews. They later reported that 150 gallons of onion soup, 50 chickens, 450 bottles of champagne (and an unspecified quanitiy of red and white wine) had been consumed over the weekend by the racing personnel.<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.48\">Spurring 2011, p.48</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1998, p.11-3\"/><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.39\">Laban 2001, p.39</ref>\n\n==Official results==\n=== Finishers===\nResults taken from Quentin Spurring's book, officially licensed by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest|ACO]]<ref name=\"Spurring 2015, p.2\">Spurring 2015, p.2</ref> Although there were no official engine classes, the highest finishers in unofficial categories aligned with the Index targets are in '''Bold''' text.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!

Rather it was a part of [[Baudh State|Boudh State]] ruled by Bhanj Kings. During the rule of Bira Bhanj there was a rift in between Bira Bhanj and his cousin, Sal Bhanj. The dissident Sal Banj left Boudh and proceeded to meet the Gajapati of Puri through the ages old Jagannath Sadak. While resting with his followers at Padmlatola Forest, the king of Nayagarh got the news and made alliance with Sal Bhanj and declared him the king of that area. Getting the news, Bir Bhanj of Boudh got angry and sent a troop to capture Sal Bhanj. But the troop of Boudh got defeated at the hands of Sal Bhanj and [[Nayagarh]] soldiers. As Sal Bhanj got ''Yasha'' (Fame), he named his kingdom as ''Yashpalla'' or ''Daspalla''. Other historians tell that king Sal Bhanj had only ''das'' (oriya for 10) ''Pallies'' (villages) so ''Daspalli'' got renamed as Daspalla. This incident took place in 1495. King Sal Bhanj ruled for 3 years only and then his son Naran Bhanj ascended the throne.\n\nBut records found at Boudh state reveal that Daspalla was formed by Naran Bhanj in 1498 during the reign of Siddya Bhanj. However, it is a fact that Daspalla was formed during the last part of 15th century being separated from Baudh.\n\nThe headquarters of Daspalla changed from Badmul to Gania, Gania to Madhyakhand, Madhyakhand to Puruna Daspalla. The ninth king of Daspalla Padmanav Bhanj, during hunting, saw a wonderful thing that a wild dove was hunting and defeating a Chhanchan (Bird of prey). So, he thought the place a heroic one and decided to change his capital to that place. At that time there was a Kandha chieftain named Kunj Malik. King Padmanav Bhanj defeated Kunj Malik and started his capital here but after the name of Kunja Malik the capital got named as ''Kunjabanagarh''.<ref>[http://www.lankapodiyatra.com/ History] Retrieved 9 October 2017.</ref>\n\nGuri Charan Deo Bhanj was crowned ruler in 1803.

It was written by [[Chris Chibnall]], and directed by [[Jamie Magnus Stone]]. It is the second of a two-part story; the previous episode, \"[[Ascension of the Cybermen]]\", aired on 23 February.\n\nThe episode stars [[Jodie Whittaker]] as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]], alongside [[Bradley Walsh]], [[Tosin Cole]], and [[Mandip Gill]] as her [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]]s, Graham O'Brien, Ryan Sinclair and Yasmin Khan, respectively. The episode also stars [[Sacha Dhawan]] as [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].\n\nThe episode was watched by 4.69 million viewers, and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Master persuades the Doctor to join him on [[Gallifrey]], where he forces her to enter [[the Matrix (Doctor Who)|the Matrix]]. He shows her the secret history of Gallifrey and its native Shobogans. Tecteun, a space explorer, found a \"timeless child\" with infinite capacity to [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]]. She adopted the child and studied her, successfully grafting her regeneration capacity into the Shobogans, transforming them into Time Lords; they chose to limit a Time Lord's regenerations to twelve. The Master reveals that the Doctor is the \"timeless child\". Tecteun and the child were inducted into a clandestine organisation called the Division, the details of which were redacted from the Matrix. The Doctor's memories were subsequently erased, prior to the childhood she remembers; only snippets remain, masked as the story of the Irish policeman Brendan. \n\nWith the Doctor trapped in the Matrix, the Master lures Ashad to Gallifrey and shrinks him with his tissue compression eliminator, taking the Cyberium. With its knowledge and the bodies of the Time Lords he had killed on his arrival to Gallifrey, the Master creates a race of infinitely-regenerating Cybermen, aiming to use them to take over the universe. In the Matrix, a vision of the Ruth Doctor gives the Doctor a means to escape by overloading the Matrix with all of her memories from her past regenerations.\n\nOn board the Cyber-carrier, Bescot is killed, while Yaz and Graham successfully hide from the invading Cybermen in empty Cyber-armor. They subsequently save the lives of Ryan, Ethan, and Ko Sharmus from Cybermen forces sent to the planet by Ashad. The group gather and agree to go through the portal to Gallifrey.\n\nThe Doctor regroups with her companions, and discovers Ashad's minaturised body contains a \"Death Particle\" capable of destroying all organic life on a planet. The Doctor and her friends blow up the Cyber-carrier, destroying Ashad's army in the process and foiling his plot to rebuild the Cyber-Empire. Finding unused TARDISes, she programs one to take her allies home. The Doctor takes one of Ko Sharmus' explosives to set off the particle. She is unable to trigger it when goaded by the Master, but Ko Sharmus appears and takes it, as penance for failing to suitably hide the Cyberium. The Doctor escapes in another TARDIS as the explosion consumes Gallifrey.\n\nThe Doctor's allies arrive on contemporary Earth in their TARDIS. The Doctor lands the other TARDIS near her own, but as she prepares to take off, she is arrested by the [[Judoon]] and teleported to a prison located inside an asteroid.\n\n===Continuity===\nAs the Doctor broadcasts her memories to escape the Matrix, the show uses numerous scenes from both the new series and the old, featuring each Doctor, several companions, and villains. Notably the flashback includes ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'', a [[Fourth Doctor]] serial. In that story, while the Doctor and Morbius are hooked to a machine during a battle of wits, the machine briefly flashed up the former regenerations of the Doctor and several additional faces, then implied to be previous versions of the Doctor (in actuality, faces of some of the production crew). ''The Brain of Morbius'' producer Philip Hinchcliffe (who also played one of said faces) had said that was the implication of that scene then, but as they wrote in the twelve-regeneration limit, it became difficult to write that in future episodes and eventually became considered that these were in fact faces of Morbius. This scene from ''The Brain of Morbius'' is shown during the Doctor's flashback in this episode, finally identifying these as the faces of incarnations of the Timeless Child.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-03-01/doctor-who-more-doctors-morbius/ | title = Doctor Who\u2019s big reveal just solved a 44-year-old mystery | first = Morgan | last=  Jeffrey | date = 1 March 2020 | accessdate = 1 March 2020 | work = [[Radio Times]] }}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\"The Timeless Children\" was written by [[Chris Chibnall]].<ref name=\"ChibnallEpisodes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/doctor-who/69159/doctor-who-series-12-will-start-and-end-with-two-parters|title=Doctor Who Series 12 will start and end with two-parters|date=27 December 2019|website=Denofgeek|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DWM 548\">{{cite web |url=https://cultbox.co.uk/general/doctor-who-magazine-reveals-titles-of-two-part-series-finale |title=Doctor Who Magazine reveals titles of two-part series finale |last=Laford |first=Andrew |publisher=Cultbox |date=6 February 2020 |accessdate=6 February 2020 }}</ref> Further episode details were announced in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' #548 in early February 2020.<ref name=\"DWM 548\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n[[Julie Graham]] was cast as Ravio in the episode.<ref name=\"DWM 548\" /> [[Ian McElhinney]] and [[Steve Toussaint]] were announced as guest stars in the two-part finale, \"Ascension of the Cybermen\" / \"The Timeless Children\"; however, Toussaint did not appear in this episode after his character was killed in the events of \"Ascension of the Cybermen\".<ref name=\"Toussaint\">{{cite web|url= https://cultbox.co.uk/news/ian-mcelhinney-and-steve-toussaint-to-guest-star-in-doctor-who-series-finale|title=Doctor Who Series 12: Ian McElhinney and Steve Toussaint to star in Doctor Who|date= 6 February 2020|website=CultBox|accessdate= 8 February 2020}}</ref> Jo Martin reprises her role from \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\" as a regeneration of the Doctor.\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Jamie Magnus Stone]] directed the fifth block of the ninth and tenth episodes.<ref name=\"Directors\">{{cite web|url=http://cultbox.co.uk/news/doctor-who-series-12-new-directors-discovered|title=Doctor Who Series 12: new directors discovered|date=20 May 2019|website=CultBox}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcast and reception ==\n{{TV ratings\n| aggregatenosort = y\n| aggregate1 = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (Tomatometer)\n| aggregate1score = 71%<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/doctor_who/s12/e10|title=Doctor Who - Season 12 Episode 10|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n| aggregate2 = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (Average Score)\n| aggregate2score = 6.33/10<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\" />\n| rev1 = [[The A.V.

She adopted the child and studied her, successfully grafting her regeneration capacity into the Shobogans, transforming them into Time Lords; they chose to limit a Time Lord's regenerations to twelve. The Master reveals that the Doctor is the \"timeless child\". Tecteun and the child were inducted into a clandestine organisation called the Division, the details of which were redacted from the Matrix. The Doctor's memories were subsequently erased, prior to the childhood she remembers; only snippets remain, masked as the story of the Irish policeman Brendan. \n\nWith the Doctor trapped in the Matrix, the Master lures Ashad to Gallifrey and shrinks him with his tissue compression eliminator, taking the Cyberium. With its knowledge and the bodies of the Time Lords he had killed on his arrival to Gallifrey, the Master creates a race of infinitely-regenerating Cybermen, aiming to use them to take over the universe. In the Matrix, a vision of the Ruth Doctor gives the Doctor a means to escape by overloading the Matrix with all of her memories from her past regenerations.\n\nOn board the Cyber-carrier, Bescot is killed, while Yaz and Graham successfully hide from the invading Cybermen in empty Cyber-armor. They subsequently save the lives of Ryan, Ethan, and Ko Sharmus from Cybermen forces sent to the planet by Ashad. The group gather and agree to go through the portal to Gallifrey.\n\nThe Doctor regroups with her companions, and discovers Ashad's minaturised body contains a \"Death Particle\" capable of destroying all organic life on a planet. The Doctor and her friends blow up the Cyber-carrier, destroying Ashad's army in the process and foiling his plot to rebuild the Cyber-Empire. Finding unused TARDISes, she programs one to take her allies home. The Doctor takes one of Ko Sharmus' explosives to set off the particle. She is unable to trigger it when goaded by the Master, but Ko Sharmus appears and takes it, as penance for failing to suitably hide the Cyberium. The Doctor escapes in another TARDIS as the explosion consumes Gallifrey.\n\nThe Doctor's allies arrive on contemporary Earth in their TARDIS. The Doctor lands the other TARDIS near her own, but as she prepares to take off, she is arrested by the [[Judoon]] and teleported to a prison located inside an asteroid.\n\n===Continuity===\nAs the Doctor broadcast her memories to escape the Matrix, the show uses numerous scenes from both the new series and the old, featuring each Doctor, several companions, and villains. Notably the flashback includes ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'', a [[Fourth Doctor]] serial. In that story, while the Doctor and Morbius are hooked to a machine during a battle of wits, the machine briefly flashed up the former regenerations of the Doctor and several additional faces, then implied to be previous versions of the Doctor (in actuality, faces of some of the production crew). ''The Brain of Morbius'' producer Philip Hinchcliffe (who also played one of said faces) had said that was the implication of that scene then, but as they wrote in the twelve-regeneration limit, it became difficult to write that in future episodes and eventually became considered that these were in fact faces of Morbius. This scene from ''The Brain of Morbius'' is shown during the Doctor's flashback in this episode, finally identifying these as the faces of incarnations of the Timeless Child.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-03-01/doctor-who-more-doctors-morbius/ | title = Doctor Who\u2019s big reveal just solved a 44-year-old mystery | first = Morgan | last=  Jeffrey | date = 1 March 2020 | accessdate = 1 March 2020 | work = [[Radio Times]] }}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\"The Timeless Children\" was written by [[Chris Chibnall]].<ref name=\"ChibnallEpisodes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/doctor-who/69159/doctor-who-series-12-will-start-and-end-with-two-parters|title=Doctor Who Series 12 will start and end with two-parters|date=27 December 2019|website=Denofgeek|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DWM 548\">{{cite web |url=https://cultbox.co.uk/general/doctor-who-magazine-reveals-titles-of-two-part-series-finale |title=Doctor Who Magazine reveals titles of two-part series finale |last=Laford |first=Andrew |publisher=Cultbox |date=6 February 2020 |accessdate=6 February 2020 }}</ref> Further episode details were announced in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' #548 in early February 2020.<ref name=\"DWM 548\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n[[Julie Graham]] was cast as Ravio in the episode.<ref name=\"DWM 548\" /> [[Ian McElhinney]] and [[Steve Toussaint]] were announced as guest stars in the two-part finale, \"Ascension of the Cybermen\" / \"The Timeless Children\"; however, Toussaint did not appear in this episode after his character was killed in the events of \"Ascension of the Cybermen\".<ref name=\"Toussaint\">{{cite web|url= https://cultbox.co.uk/news/ian-mcelhinney-and-steve-toussaint-to-guest-star-in-doctor-who-series-finale|title=Doctor Who Series 12: Ian McElhinney and Steve Toussaint to star in Doctor Who|date= 6 February 2020|website=CultBox|accessdate= 8 February 2020}}</ref> Jo Martin reprises her role from \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\" as a regeneration of the Doctor.\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Jamie Magnus Stone]] directed the fifth block of the ninth and tenth episodes.<ref name=\"Directors\">{{cite web|url=http://cultbox.co.uk/news/doctor-who-series-12-new-directors-discovered|title=Doctor Who Series 12: new directors discovered|date=20 May 2019|website=CultBox}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcast and reception ==\n{{TV ratings\n| aggregatenosort = y\n| aggregate1 = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (Tomatometer)\n| aggregate1score = 71%<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/doctor_who/s12/e10|title=Doctor Who - Season 12 Episode 10|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n| aggregate2 = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (Average Score)\n| aggregate2score = 6.33/10<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\" />\n| rev1 = [[The A.V.

{"title_page": "Sports nutrition", "text_new": "[[File:Sport balls.svg|thumb|Nutrition is important in all sports]]\n'''Sports nutrition''' is the study and practice of [[nutrition]] and [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] with regards to improving anyone's athletic performance. Nutrition is an important part of many sports training regimens, being popular in strength sports (such as [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] and [[bodybuilding]]) and endurance sports (e.g. [[cycling]], [[running]], [[Human swimming|swimming]], [[rowing]]). Sports nutrition focuses its studies on the type, as well as the quantity of fluids and food taken by an athlete. In addition, it deals with the consumption of nutrients such as [[vitamins]], [[minerals]], [[Dietary supplement|supplements]] and [[Organic compound|organic]] substances that include [[carbohydrates]], [[proteins]] and [[fat]]s.\n\n==Factors influencing nutritional requirements==\nDiffering conditions and objectives suggest the need for athletes to ensure that their sports nutritional approach is appropriate for their situation. Factors that may affect an athlete's nutritional needs include type of activity (aerobic vs. anaerobic), gender, weight, height, body mass index, workout or activity stage (pre-workout, intro-workout, recovery), and time of day (e.g. some nutrients are utilized by the body more effectively during sleep than while awake).Most culprits that get in the way of performance are fatigue, injury and soreness. A proper diet will reduce these disturbances in performance. The key to a proper diet is to get a variety of food, and to consume all the macro-nutrients, vitamins, and minerals needed. According to Eblere's article (2008), it is ideal to choose raw foods, for example unprocessed foods such as oranges instead of orange juice. Eating foods that are natural means the athlete is getting the most nutritional value out of the food. When foods are processed, the nutritional value is normally reduced.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Eberle, S. G| title = Endurance sports nutrition | journal = Fitness Magazine | volume = 24| issue = 6| pages = 25}}</ref>\n\n=== Gender ===\nThere are obvious physical differences between male and female anatomy, while physiology is the same for the most part, how they metabolize nutrients will vary. Men have less total body fat but tend to carry most of their fat in the [[adipose tissue]] of their abdominal region. Adipose tissue is indirectly mediated by androgen receptors in muscle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Navarro|first=Guadalupe|last2=Allard|first2=Camille|last3=Xu|first3=Weiwei|last4=Mauvais-Jarvis|first4=Franck|date=April 2015|title=The role of androgens in metabolism, obesity and diabetes in males and females|journal=Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)|volume=23|issue=4|pages=713\u2013719|doi=10.1002/oby.21033|issn=1930-7381|pmc=4380643|pmid=25755205}}</ref> On the other hand, women have more total body fat that is carried in the [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous layer]] of their hip region.

This type of exercise occurs in physical activity such as power sprints, strength resistances and quick explosive movement where the muscles are being used for power and speed, with short-time energy use. After this type of exercise, there is a need to refill [[glycogen]] storage sites in the body (the long simple sugar chains in the body that store energy), although they are not likely fully depleted.\n\nTo compensate for this glycogen reduction, athletes will often take in large amounts of carbohydrates, immediately following their exercise. Typically, high-glycemic-index carbohydrates are preferred for their ability to rapidly raise blood glucose levels. For the purpose of protein synthesis, protein or individual [[amino acids]] are ingested as well. [[Branched-chain amino acid]]s are important since they are most responsible for the synthesis of protein. According to Lemon et al. (1995) female endurance runners have the hardest time getting enough protein in their diet. Endurance athletes in general need more protein in their diet than the sedentary person. Research has shown that endurance athletes are recommended to have 1.2 to 1.4 g of protein per kg of body weight in order to repair damaged tissue. If the athlete consumes too few calories for the body's needs, lean tissue will be broken down for energy and repair. Protein deficiency can cause many problems such as early and extreme fatigue, particularly long recovery, and poor wound healing. Complete proteins such as [[meat]], [[Egg as food|eggs]], and [[soy]] provide the athlete with all essential amino acids for synthesizing new tissues. However, vegetarian and vegan athletes frequently combine [[legumes]] with a [[whole grain]] to provide the body with a complete protein across the day's food intake.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jurek|first=Scott|title=Eat and Run|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London}}</ref> A popular combination being rice and beans.<ref>\n{{cite journal | author = Lemon P. | title = Do athletes need more dietary protein and amino acids? | journal = International Journal of Sports Nutrition | volume = 5| pages = 39\u201361 | pmid = 7550257 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1123/ijsn.5.s1.s39 }}</ref>\n\nSpada's research on endurance sports nutrition (2000) and where the types of carbohydrates come from will be explained. He advises for carbohydrates to be unprocessed and/or whole grains for optimal performance while training. These carbohydrates offer the most fuel, nutritional value, and satiety. Fruits and vegetables contribute important carbohydrate foundation for an athlete's diet. They provide vitamins and minerals that are lost through exercise and later needed to be replenished. Both fruits and vegetables improve healing, aid in recovery, and reduce risks of cancer, high blood pressure, and constipation. Vegetables offer a little more nutritional value than fruits for the amount of calories, therefore an athlete should strive to eat more vegetables than fruits. Dark-colored vegetables usually have more nutritional value than pale colored ones. A general rule is the darker the color the more nutrient dense it is. Like all foods, it is very important to have a variety. To get the most nutritional value out of fruits and vegetables it is important to eat them in their natural, unprocessed form without [[Food fortification|added nutrients]] or sugar.<ref>\n{{cite journal| author= Spada R. | title = Endurance sports nutrition | journal = Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness| volume = 40| issue = 4 | pages = 381\u2013382\n}}</ref>\n\nOften in the continuation of this anaerobic exercise, the product from this metabolic mechanism builds up in what is called [[lactic acid fermentation]]. Lactate is produced more quickly than it is being removed and it serves to regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup> cells on where it's needed. During intense exercise when oxygen is not being used, a high amount of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is produced and pH levels fall causing [[acidosis]] or more specifically [[lactic acidosis]]. Lactic acid build up can be treated by staying well-hydrated throughout and especially after the workout, having an efficient [[cool down]] routine and good post-workout stretching.<ref name=\"Delamere, Nicholas 2009\">Delamere, Nicholas, and Claudia Stanescu. \"Muscle Energetics.\" Physiology 201. University of Arizona, Tucson. 25, 27, 29 Mar. 2009.</ref>\n\nIntense activity can cause significant and permanent damage to bodily tissues. In order to repair, [[vitamin E]] and other [[antioxidants]] are needed to protect muscle damage. Oxidation damage and muscle tissue breakdown happens during endurance running so athletes need to eat foods high in protein in order to repair these muscle tissues. It is important for female endurance runners to consume proper nutrients in their diet that will repair, fuel, and minimize fatigue and injury. To keep a female runner's body performing at its best, the ten nutrients need to be included in their diets.{{which|date=March 2020}}<ref>\n{{cite journal | author = Rokitzki L. | title = Alpha-tocopherol supplementation in racing cyclist during extreme endurance training| journal = International Journal of Sports Nutrition | volume = 4| issue= 3| pages = 253\u201364| doi = 10.1123/ijsn.4.3.253| pmid = 7987360| year = 1994}}</ref>\n\n=== Aerobic Exercise ===\nAerobic exercise is also known as cardio because it is a form of cardiovascular conditioning. This includes exercises such as running, cycling, swimming and rowing. Athletes involved in aerobic exercise are typically looking to increase their [[endurance]]. These athletes are training their slow twitch muscle fibers to be better at taking in oxygen and getting it to their muscles. This is done by two mechanisms, [[glycolysis]] and [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic respiration]].\u00a0 Slow twitch muscles are smaller in diameter and are slow to contract. These fibers don\u2019t store much glycogen, instead they use [[lipid]]s and [[amino acid]]s to generate energy. With a high concentration of myoglobin that stores oxygen, the slow twitch muscle fibers have plenty of oxygen to function properly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2018|isbn=978-1-259-27772-6|location=New York, NY|pages=307\u2013395}}</ref> These factors help make slow twitch muscle fibers fatigue resistant so athletes can have endurance in their sport. There are many options for supplements that athletes can take to assist with endurance like [[glycerol]] and [[guarana]].\n\n==Supplements==\nDietary supplements contain one or more dietary ingredients (including vitamins; minerals; amino acids; herbs or other botanicals; and other substances) or their constituents is intended to be taken by mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid.<ref>\"Background Information: Dietary Supplements \u2014 Health Professional Fact Sheet.\" U.S National Library of Medicine.

Common supplements to increase an athlete's energy include: Caffeine, Guarana, Vitamin B12, and Asian ginseng.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/prevention-15/vitamins/energy-boosting-supplements|title=Energy Boosters: Can Supplements and Vitamins Help?|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref> Guarana is another supplement that athletes take to enhance their athletic ability, it is frequently used for weight loss and as an energy supplement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-935-guarana.aspx?activeingredientid=935|title=GUARANA: Uses, Side Effects, Interactions and Warnings - WebMD|website=www.webmd.com|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref>\n\n[[Caffeine]], a common energy supplement, can be found in many different forms such as pills, tablets or capsules, and can also be found in common foods, such as coffee and tea. A 2009 study from the [[University of Texas]] reports that caffeinated energy drinks decrease sporting performance. They found that after drinking an energy drink, 83% of participants improved their physical activity parameters by an average of 4.7%. This was attributed to the effects of caffeine, sucrose and Vitamin B in the drink - however scientific consensus does not support the efficacy of using Vitamin B as a performance enhancer. To explain the performance improvement the writers report an increase in blood levels of [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[beta-Endorphin]]. The adenosine receptor antagonism of caffeine accounts for the first two,<ref>[[Caffeine#Pharmacodynamics]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}} while the latter is accounted for by the [[Neurobiological effects of physical exercise]].<ref>\"Improved Cycling Time-Trial Performance After Ingestion of a Caffeine Energy Drink.\" International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism 19 (February 2009): 61-78.</ref>\n\n[[Caffeine]] has been around since the 1900s and became popularly used in the 1970s when its power of masking fatigue became highly recognized.<ref name=\"ApplegateElizabeth2\">Applegate, Elizabeth A., and Louis E.

American Society for Nutritional Sciences. 1 Apr. 2009 <jn.nutrition.org>.</ref> Similarly, the caffeine found in energy drinks and coffee shows an increased reaction performance and feelings of energy, focus and alertness in quickness and reaction anaerobic power tests. In other words, consuming an energy drink or any drink with caffeine increases short time/rapid exercise performance (like short full-speed sprints and heavy power weight lifting).<ref>Hoffman, Jay R., Jie Kang, Nicholas A.

BioMed Central Ltd. 25 Mar. 2009</ref> Caffeine is chemically similar to adenosine, a type of sugar that helps in the regulation of important body processes, including the firing of neurotransmitters. Caffeine takes the place of adenosine in your brain, attaching itself to the same neural receptors affected by adenosine, and causing your neurons to fire more rapidly, hence caffeine's stimulating effects.<ref>\"The Side Effects of Caffeine / Nutrition / Healthy Eating.\" The Side Effects of Caffeine / Nutrition / Healthy Eating. N.p., n.d. Web. 07 Nov. 2016.</ref>\n\nCarbohydrates are also a very common form of energy supplements, as all sugars are carbohydrates. Products like [[Gatorade]] and Powerade are formulated with simple sugars such as sucrose and dextrose. Carbohydrates are necessary as they maintain blood glucose levels and restore muscle glycogen levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/717046_2|title=Nutrition and Athletic Performance|author=Nancy R.

The main use for athletes to take dietary proteins are for hormones, oxygen transport, cellular repair, enzymes and conversion to fuel.<ref name=\":0\">Wilson, Lawrence, Dr. \"THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTEIN.\" THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTEIN. N.p., Dec. 2015. Web. 05 Nov. 2016.</ref> The intake of protein is a part of the nutrient requirements for the normal athlete and is an important component of exercise training. In addition, it aids in performance and recovery. Dietary protein intake for well-trained athletes should occur before, during and after physical activity as it is advantageous in gaining muscle mass and strength.<ref>Campbell, Bill, Richard B. Kreider, Tim Ziegenfuss, Paul La Bounty, Mike Roberts, Darren Burke, Jamie Landis, Hector Lopez, and Jose Antonio. \"International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: protein and exercise.\" Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 4 (2007).

Traditionally, sports drinks such as Gatorade and Powerade, are consumed during and after exercise because they effectively rehydrate the body by refueling the body with minerals and electrolytes. Electrolytes regulate the body's nerve and muscle function, blood pH, blood pressure, and the rebuilding of damaged tissue.<ref>Nordqvist, Christian. \"What Are Electrolytes? What Causes Electrolyte Imbalance?\" Medical News Today. MediLexicon International, 24 May 2016. Web. 07 Nov. 2016.</ref> These types of drink are commonly made of glucose and sucrose in water and has been seen to improve the football players' performance.<ref name=\"ApplegateElizabeth2\"/>\n\nA substitute for sports drinks is milk, which contains many electrolytes, nutrients and other elements that help to make it an effective post-exercise beverage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/457026-does-milk-contain-electrolytes/|title=Does Milk Contain Electrolytes?|last=Busch|first=Sandi|work=LIVESTRONG.COM|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref> It is true that milk helps replace fluids and electrolytes lost after the athlete has worked out. A recovery drink is supposed to replenish the sugar lost, and help recover the muscles to be able to workout at full intensity by the next time they workout.  When compared to plain water or sports drinks, research supported by the Dairy and Nutrition Council suggests that chocolate milk is more effective at replacing fluids lost through sweat and maintaining normal body fluid levels. Athletes drinking chocolate milk following exercise-induced dehydration had fluid levels about 2 percent higher (on initial body mass) than those using other post-exercise recovery beverages. These results allowed for prolonged performance, especially in repeated bouts of exercise or training.<ref>Stager, Joel M., et al. \"Chocolate Milk as a Post-Exercise Recovery Aid.\" International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism. 2006.<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7103747_Chocolate_Milk_as_a_Post-Exercise_Recovery_Aid>.</ref>\n\n=== Performance-enhancing supplements ===\nIn the extreme case of performance-enhancing supplements, athletes, particularly bodybuilders may choose to use illegal substances such as [[anabolic steroids]]. These compounds which are related to the hormone testosterone, can quickly build mass and strength, but have many adverse effects such as high blood pressure and negative gender specific effects. [[Blood doping]], another illegal [[ergogenic]], was discovered in the 1940s when it was used by World War II pilots.<ref name=\"ApplegateElizabeth2\"/> Blood doping also known as blood transfusions, increases oxygen delivery to exercising tissues and has been demonstrated to improve performance in endurance sports, such as long-distance cycling.<ref name=\"Jenkinson, David M. 20082\">Jenkinson, David M., DO, and Allison J.

This type of exercise occurs in physical activity such as power sprints, strength resistances and quick explosive movement where the muscles are being used for power and speed, with short-time energy use. After this type of exercise, there is a need to refill [[glycogen]] storage sites in the body (the long simple sugar chains in the body that store energy), although they are not likely fully depleted.\n\nTo compensate for this glycogen reduction, athletes will often take in large amounts of carbohydrates, immediately following their exercise. Typically, high-glycemic-index carbohydrates are preferred for their ability to rapidly raise blood glucose levels. For the purpose of protein synthesis, protein or individual [[amino acids]] are ingested as well. [[Branched-chain amino acid]]s are important since they are most responsible for the synthesis of protein. According to Lemon et al. (1995) female endurance runners have the hardest time getting enough protein in their diet. Endurance athletes in general need more protein in their diet than the sedentary person. Research has shown that endurance athletes are recommended to have 1.2 to 1.4 g of protein per kg of body weight in order to repair damaged tissue. If the athlete consumes too few calories for the body's needs, lean tissue will be broken down for energy and repair. Protein deficiency can cause many problems such as early and extreme fatigue, particularly long recovery, and poor wound healing. Complete proteins such as [[meat]], [[eggs]], and [[soy]] provide the athlete with all essential amino acids for synthesizing new tissues. However, vegetarian and vegan athletes frequently combine [[legumes]] with a [[whole grain]] to provide the body with a complete protein across the day's food intake.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jurek|first=Scott|title=Eat and Run|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London}}</ref> A popular combination being rice and beans.<ref>\n{{cite journal | author = Lemon P. | title = Do athletes need more dietary protein and amino acids? | journal = International Journal of Sports Nutrition | volume = 5| pages = 39\u201361 | pmid = 7550257 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1123/ijsn.5.s1.s39 }}</ref>\n\nSpada's research on endurance sports nutrition (2000) and where the types of carbohydrates come from will be explained. He advises for carbohydrates to be unprocessed and/or whole grains for optimal performance while training. These carbohydrates offer the most fuel, nutritional value, and satiety. Fruits and vegetables contribute important carbohydrate foundation for an athlete's diet. They provide vitamins and minerals that are lost through exercise and later needed to be replenished. Both fruits and vegetables improve healing, aid in recovery, and reduce risks of cancer, high blood pressure, and constipation. Vegetables offer a little more nutritional value than fruits for the amount of calories, therefore an athlete should strive to eat more vegetables than fruits. Dark-colored vegetables usually have more nutritional value than pale colored ones. A general rule is the darker the color the more nutrient dense it is. Like all foods, it is very important to have a variety. To get the most nutritional value out of fruits and vegetables it is important to eat them in their natural, unprocessed form without [[Food fortification|added nutrients]] or sugar.<ref>\n{{cite journal| author= Spada R. | title = Endurance sports nutrition | journal = Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness| volume = 40| issue = 4 | pages = 381\u2013382\n}}</ref>\n\nOften in the continuation of this anaerobic exercise, the product from this metabolic mechanism builds up in what is called [[lactic acid fermentation]]. Lactate is produced more quickly than it is being removed and it serves to regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup> cells on where it's needed. During intense exercise when oxygen is not being used, a high amount of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is produced and pH levels fall causing [[acidosis]] or more specifically [[lactic acidosis]]. Lactic acid build up can be treated by staying well-hydrated throughout and especially after the workout, having an efficient [[cool down]] routine and good post-workout stretching.<ref name=\"Delamere, Nicholas 2009\">Delamere, Nicholas, and Claudia Stanescu. \"Muscle Energetics.\" Physiology 201.

In order to repair, [[vitamin E]] and other [[antioxidants]] are needed to protect muscle damage. Oxidation damage and muscle tissue breakdown happens during endurance running so athletes need to eat foods high in protein in order to repair these muscle tissues. It is important for female endurance runners to consume proper nutrients in their diet that will repair, fuel, and minimize fatigue and injury. To keep a female runner's body performing at its best, the ten nutrients need to be included in their diets.{{which|date=March 2020}}<ref>\n{{cite journal | author = Rokitzki L. | title = Alpha-tocopherol supplementation in racing cyclist during extreme endurance training| journal = International Journal of Sports Nutrition | volume = 4| issue= 3| pages = 253\u201364| doi = 10.1123/ijsn.4.3.253| pmid = 7987360| year = 1994}}</ref>\n\n=== Aerobic Exercise ===\nAerobic exercise is also known as cardio because it is a form of cardiovascular conditioning. This includes exercises such as running, cycling, swimming and rowing. Athletes involved in aerobic exercise are typically looking to increase their [[endurance]]. These athletes are training their slow twitch muscle fibers to be better at taking in oxygen and getting it to their muscles. This is done by two mechanisms, [[glycolysis]] and [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic respiration]].\u00a0 Slow twitch muscles are smaller in diameter and are slow to contract. These fibers don\u2019t store much glycogen, instead they use [[lipid]]s and [[amino acid]]s to generate energy. With a high concentration of myoglobin that stores oxygen, the slow twitch muscle fibers have plenty of oxygen to function properly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2018|isbn=978-1-259-27772-6|location=New York, NY|pages=307\u2013395}}</ref> These factors help make slow twitch muscle fibers fatigue resistant so athletes can have endurance in their sport. There are many options for supplements that athletes can take to assist with endurance like [[glycerol]] and [[guarana]].\n\n==Supplements==\nDietary supplements contain one or more dietary ingredients (including vitamins; minerals; amino acids; herbs or other botanicals; and other substances) or their constituents is intended to be taken by mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid.<ref>\"Background Information: Dietary Supplements \u2014 Health Professional Fact Sheet.\" U.S National Library of Medicine.

Common supplements to increase an athlete's energy include: Caffeine, Guarana, Vitamin B12, and Asian ginseng.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/prevention-15/vitamins/energy-boosting-supplements|title=Energy Boosters: Can Supplements and Vitamins Help?|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref> Guarana is another supplement that athletes take to enhance their athletic ability, it is frequently used for weight loss and as an energy supplement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-935-guarana.aspx?activeingredientid=935|title=GUARANA: Uses, Side Effects, Interactions and Warnings - WebMD|website=www.webmd.com|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref>\n\n[[Caffeine]], a common energy supplement, can be found in many different forms such as pills, tablets or capsules, and can also be found in common foods, such as coffee and tea. A 2009 study from the [[University of Texas]] reports that caffeinated energy drinks decrease sporting performance. They found that after drinking an energy drink, 83% of participants improved their physical activity parameters by an average of 4.7%. This was attributed to the effects of caffeine, sucrose and Vitamin B in the drink - however scientific consensus does not support the efficacy of using Vitamin B as a performance enhancer. To explain the performance improvement the writers report an increase in blood levels of [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[beta-Endorphin]]. The adenosine receptor antagonism of caffeine accounts for the first two,<ref>[[Caffeine#Pharmacodynamics]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}} while the latter is accounted for by the [[Neurobiological effects of physical exercise]].<ref>\"Improved Cycling Time-Trial Performance After Ingestion of a Caffeine Energy Drink.\" International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism 19 (February 2009): 61-78.</ref>\n\n[[Caffeine]] has been around since the 1900s and became popularly used in the 1970s when its power of masking fatigue became highly recognized.<ref name=\"ApplegateElizabeth2\">Applegate, Elizabeth A., and Louis E.

In other words, consuming an energy drink or any drink with caffeine increases short time/rapid exercise performance (like short full-speed sprints and heavy power weight lifting).<ref>Hoffman, Jay R., Jie Kang, Nicholas A.

Caffeine takes the place of adenosine in your brain, attaching itself to the same neural receptors affected by adenosine, and causing your neurons to fire more rapidly, hence caffeine's stimulating effects.<ref>\"The Side Effects of Caffeine / Nutrition / Healthy Eating.\" The Side Effects of Caffeine / Nutrition / Healthy Eating.

Traditionally, sports drinks such as Gatorade and Powerade, are consumed during and after exercise because they effectively rehydrate the body by refueling the body with minerals and electrolytes. Electrolytes regulate the body's nerve and muscle function, blood pH, blood pressure, and the rebuilding of damaged tissue.<ref>Nordqvist, Christian. \"What Are Electrolytes? What Causes Electrolyte Imbalance?\" Medical News Today. MediLexicon International, 24 May 2016. Web. 07 Nov. 2016.</ref> These types of drink are commonly made of glucose and sucrose in water and has been seen to improve the football players' performance.<ref name=\"ApplegateElizabeth2\"/>\n\nA substitute for sports drinks is milk, which contains many electrolytes, nutrients and other elements that help to make it an effective post-exercise beverage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/457026-does-milk-contain-electrolytes/|title=Does Milk Contain Electrolytes?|last=Busch|first=Sandi|work=LIVESTRONG.COM|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref> It is true that milk helps replace fluids and electrolytes lost after the athlete has worked out. A recovery drink is supposed to replenish the sugar lost, and help recover the muscles to be able to workout at full intensity by the next time they workout.  When compared to plain water or sports drinks, research supported by the Dairy and Nutrition Council suggests that chocolate milk is more effective at replacing fluids lost through sweat and maintaining normal body fluid levels. Athletes drinking chocolate milk following exercise-induced dehydration had fluid levels about 2 percent higher (on initial body mass) than those using other post-exercise recovery beverages. These results allowed for prolonged performance, especially in repeated bouts of exercise or training.<ref>Stager, Joel M., et al. \"Chocolate Milk as a Post-Exercise Recovery Aid.\" International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism. 2006.<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7103747_Chocolate_Milk_as_a_Post-Exercise_Recovery_Aid>.</ref>\n\n=== Performance-enhancing supplements ===\nIn the extreme case of performance-enhancing supplements, athletes, particularly bodybuilders may choose to use illegal substances such as [[anabolic steroids]]. These compounds which are related to the hormone testosterone, can quickly build mass and strength, but have many adverse effects such as high blood pressure and negative gender specific effects. [[Blood doping]], another illegal [[ergogenic]], was discovered in the 1940s when it was used by World War II pilots.<ref name=\"ApplegateElizabeth2\"/> Blood doping also known as blood transfusions, increases oxygen delivery to exercising tissues and has been demonstrated to improve performance in endurance sports, such as long-distance cycling.<ref name=\"Jenkinson, David M. 20082\">Jenkinson, David M., DO, and Allison J.
