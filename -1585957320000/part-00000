The title track of Bowie's [[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|third album]], it was released in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK. The song has been covered by a number of other artists, notably by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], who had a UK No. 3 hit with her version in 1974; by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], whose 1993 performance of the song for the television program ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' introduced it to a new audience; and by [[Midge Ure]], whose 1982 cover of the song was featured in the 2015 video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' because the game itself features the song's main theme of doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\nThe song was reworked by Bowie, featuring atmospheric synths, a new bassline, techno-style drums and a notably darker mood, for performances in concerts from 1995 to 1997, including the [[1995 MTV Europe Music Awards]]. Bowie later returned to playing the original version in the 2000s.\n\n==Recording==\nThe backing track for \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London on 4 May 1970, along with other album track \"Running Gun Blues\". At this point, the track was recorded under the working title \"Saviour Machine\" and did not contain the title phrase.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=191\u2013192}} According to producer [[Tony Visconti]], Bowie recorded his vocal on 22 May at [[Advision Studios]], the final day of mixing for the album which, when traveling to Advision, Bowie had intended to name ''Metrobolist'', an homage to [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=193}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=316}} Bowie's last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, who recalled in 1977: \"This was the beginning of [Bowie's] new style of writing \u2013 'I can't be bothered until I have to'. When it was finished, on the last day of the last mix, I remember telling David, 'I've had it, I can't work like this anymore \u2013 I'm through...David was very disappointed.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=193\u2013194}} This frustration was mostly due in part to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions: he was mostly in charge of budget and production, as well as maintaining Bowie's interest in the project. Bowie later told [[BBC Radio 1]]'s Stuart Grundy in 1976: \"It was a nightmare, that album. I hated the actual process of making it.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=210}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe person in the song has an encounter with a kind of [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], as suggested in the second chorus where \"I never lost control\" is replaced with \"We never lost control\".<ref>{{Cite book| contribution = Future Legends: David Bowie and Science Fiction| last = King| first = Maureen| editor-last = Morrison| editor-first = Michael A.| title = Trajectories of the Fantastic: Selected Essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts| publisher = Greenwood| year = 1997| location = Westport, CT| page = 131 }}</ref> Beyond this, the episode is unexplained: as James E. Perone wrote,\n\n{{quote|Bowie encounters the title character, but it is not clear just what the phrase means, or exactly who this man is.&nbsp;... The main thing that the song does is to paint \u2013 however elusively \u2013 the title character as another example of the societal outcasts who populate the album.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Perone| first = James E.| title = The Words and Music of David Bowie| publisher = Praeger| year = 2007| location = Westport, Connecticut| pages = 15\u201316}}</ref>}}\n\nIn common with a number of tracks on the album, the song's themes have been compared to the [[Horror fiction|horror]]-[[fantasy]] works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=38}} The lyrics are also cited as reflecting Bowie's concerns with splintered or multiple personalities, and are believed to have been partially inspired by the poem \"[[Antigonish (poem)|Antigonish]]\" by [[William Hughes Mearns]]:{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=100}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"The Man Who Sold the World\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/the-man-who-sold-the-world-mt0052219335 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|Last night I saw upon the stair\nA little man who wasn't there\nHe wasn't there again today\nOh, how I wish he'd go away...}}\n\nIn the [[BBC Radio 1]] special programme ''ChangesNowBowie'', broadcast on 8 January 1997, Bowie was interviewed by Mary Anne Hobbs and was asked about the song. He commented: \"I guess I wrote it because there was a part of myself that I was looking for. Maybe now that I feel more comfortable with the way that I live my life and my mental state (laughs) and my spiritual state whatever, maybe I feel there's some kind of unity now. That song for me always exemplified kind of how you feel when you're young, when you know that there's a piece of yourself that you haven't really put together yet.

He was \u00fcbercool at the time and I just wanted to be led by him. I loved everything he did. I didn't think 'The Man Who Sold the World' was the greatest song for my voice, but it was such a strong song in itself. I had no idea what it was about. In the studio Bowie kept telling me to smoke more cigarettes, to give my voice a certain quality.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=228}} Bowie produced the Lulu recording of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" with [[Mick Ronson]] during the July 1973 ''[[Pin Ups]]'' sessions and also contributed guitar, [[saxophone]] and backing vocals.

The title track of Bowie's [[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|third album]], it was released in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK. The song has been covered by a number of other artists, notably by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], who had a UK No. 3 hit with her version in 1974; by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], whose 1993 performance of the song for the television program ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' introduced it to a new audience; and by [[Midge Ure]], whose 1982 cover of the song was featured in the 2015 video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' because the game itself features the song's main theme of doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\nThe song was reworked by Bowie, featuring atmospheric synths, a new bassline, techno-style drums and a notably darker mood, for performances in concerts from 1995 to 1997, including the [[1995 MTV Europe Music Awards]]. Bowie later returned to playing the original version in the 2000s.\n\n==Recording==\nThe backing track for \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London on 4 May 1970, along with other album track \"Running Gun Blues\". At this point, the track was recorded under the working title \"Saviour Machine\" and did not contain the title phrase.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=191\u2013192}} According to producer [[Tony Visconti]], Bowie recorded his vocal on 22 May at [[Advision Studios]], the final day of mixing for the album which, when traveling to Advision, Bowie had intended to name ''Metrobolist'', an homage to [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=193}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=316}} Bowie's last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, who recalled in 1977: \"This was the beginning of [Bowie's] new style of writing \u2013 'I can't be bothered until I have to'. When it was finished, on the last day of the last mix, I remember telling David, 'I've had it, I can't work like this anymore \u2013 I'm through...David was very disappointed.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=193\u2013194}} This frustration was mostly due in part to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions: he was mostly in charge of budget and production, as well as maintaining Bowie's interest in the project. Bowie later told [[BBC Radio 1]]'s Stuart Grundy in 1976: \"It was a nightmare, that album. I hated the actual process of making it.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=210}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe person in the song has an encounter with a kind of [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], as suggested in the second chorus where \"I never lost control\" is replaced with \"We never lost control\".<ref>{{Cite book| contribution = Future Legends: David Bowie and Science Fiction| last = King| first = Maureen| editor-last = Morrison| editor-first = Michael A.| title = Trajectories of the Fantastic: Selected Essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts| publisher = Greenwood| year = 1997| location = Westport, CT| page = 131 }}</ref> Beyond this, the episode is unexplained: as James E. Perone wrote,\n\n{{quote|Bowie encounters the title character, but it is not clear just what the phrase means, or exactly who this man is.&nbsp;... The main thing that the song does is to paint \u2013 however elusively \u2013 the title character as another example of the societal outcasts who populate the album.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Perone| first = James E.| title = The Words and Music of David Bowie| publisher = Praeger| year = 2007| location = Westport, Connecticut| pages = 15\u201316}}</ref>}}\n\nIn common with a number of tracks on the album, the song's themes have been compared to the [[Horror fiction|horror]]-[[fantasy]] works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=38}} The lyrics are also cited as reflecting Bowie's concerns with splintered or multiple personalities, and are believed to have been partially inspired by the poem \"[[Antigonish (poem)|Antigonish]]\" by [[William Hughes Mearns]]:{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=100}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"The Man Who Sold the World\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/the-man-who-sold-the-world-mt0052219335 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|Last night I saw upon the stair\nA little man who wasn't there\nHe wasn't there again today\nOh, how I wish he'd go away...}}\n\nIn the [[BBC Radio 1]] special programme ''ChangesNowBowie'', broadcast on 8 January 1997, Bowie was interviewed by Mary Anne Hobbs and was asked about the song. He commented: \"I guess I wrote it because there was a part of myself that I was looking for. Maybe now that I feel more comfortable with the way that I live my life and my mental state (laughs) and my spiritual state whatever, maybe I feel there's some kind of unity now. That song for me always exemplified kind of how you feel when you're young, when you know that there's a piece of yourself that you haven't really put together yet. You have this great searching, this great need to find out who you really are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |title=ChangesNowBowie Transcript \u2013 Radio 1 |first=Grant |last=Wallace |date=27 June 1999 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902074027/http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |archive-date=2 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Other releases by Bowie==\n*\"The Man Who Sold the World\" appeared as the B-side on the American single release of the song  \"[[Space Oddity]]\" (1973 rerelease) and British single \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" (1973).<ref name=\"1973 US single liner notes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Space Oddity\"''|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1973|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=US|type=Single liner notes|id=74-0876}}</ref><ref name=\"1973 UK single liner notes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Life on Mars?\"''|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1973|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=Single liner notes|id=RCA 2316}}</ref> It also appears on various Bowie compilations such as ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound + Vision]]'' (1989), ''[[The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974]]'' (1997), ''[[Best of Bowie]]'' (2002), ''[[The Platinum Collection (David Bowie album)|The Platinum Collection]]'' (2006), ''[[Nothing Has Changed]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bowie Legacy]]'' (2016).\n*On 15 December 1979, Bowie recorded the song for a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' broadcast, with [[Klaus Nomi]] and [[Joey Arias]].

Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]'', using [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] assets from those games. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note. Unlike the ''Guitar Hero'' series, by default there is no penalty for missing notes, aside from breaking a combo, making it impossible to fail a song, although there is an option to enable this. The game also contains a mode which emulates the gameplay of ''[[Guitar Hero Live]]'', which is notably different from other games in the series, as well as support for drum-based charts.\n\n''Clone Hero'' has the ability to play community-made songs, called \"charts\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|title=The spirit of Guitar Hero lives on in a bizarre community-made clone|last=Stubbs|first=Mike|date=2018-05-01|website=Eurogamer|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403231817/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|archive-date=2020-04-03|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|title=Guitar Heroes never die, they just start playing Clone Hero|last=Neilan|first=Dan|date=August 10, 2018|website=AV Club|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403231952/https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|archive-date=2020-04-03|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> However, unlike games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, these songs do not need to be original compositions, and can instead be any audio file a member of the community wishes to turn into a playable chart.

It is hosted by former newsreader  [[Richard Morecroft]], co-hosted by [[David Astle]] and [[Lily Serna]]. Although it is based on the [[France|French]] game show ''[[Des chiffres et des lettres]]'', its structure is similar to the UK version of the show, ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'' - with the titular difference being used to avoid confusion with the Australian music program ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]''.\n\nThe series began airing on 2 August 2010. On 22 June 2012 SBS announced its decision to \"rest\" the show and the final episode aired on 27 June 2012.<ref>[http://www.sbs.com.au/shows/lettersandnumbers Letters and Numbers on SBS]</ref> Repeat episodes are still shown on SBS.\n\n==Gameplay==\nTwo contestants compete against each other in a series of nine rounds, split into three sections.  The first two sections consist of two letters rounds followed by a numbers round; the third section consists of a letters round, a numbers round, and the conundrum round. After the first commercial break, Astle would present a story on the origins of particular words and phrases.\n\nThe winner of the game returns in the next show to face a new opponent; a player who wins six times is forced to retire, becoming a retired champion, in which case two new contestants will play the next game. Retired champions with the highest cumulative score may return for a special tournament at the end of each series. Every contestant also wins a ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]] 5th Edition'', signed by the presenters.\n\n===Letters round===\nOne contestant chooses how many vowels and consonants they would like to make up nine randomly chosen letters. There must be at least three vowels and four consonants. The contestants then have thirty seconds to find the longest word that they can make out of these letters. Any word which appears in the ''Macquarie Dictionary'' is allowable, as well as some inflections. The contestant with the longest word is awarded one point for each letter in the word, but nine-letter words count double (thus scoring 18 points). If both contestants find words of equal length then each is awarded points. Proper nouns are not qualified during the Letters rounds.\n\n===Numbers round===\nOne contestant chooses how many \"small\" and \"large\" numbers they would like to make up six randomly chosen numbers.  Small numbers are between 1 and 10 inclusive, and large numbers are 25, 50, 75, or 100.  All large numbers will be different, so at most four large numbers may be chosen. The contestants have to use [[arithmetic]] on some or all of those numbers to get as close as possible to a randomly generated three-digit target number within the thirty second time limit.  Fractions are not allowed\u2014only integers may be used at any stage of the calculation.\n\nFor numbers selections, they are to be straightforward. The numbers are always placed in a fixed order (going Right to Left - Small numbers are placed first, then the large ones).\n\nPoints are awarded for the closest solution, and again both contestants score if the solutions are equally close, which can be in opposite directions to each other. 10 points are given for an exact answer, 7 points for a non-exact solution up to 5 from the target, and 5 points for a solution between 6 and 10 from the target. If neither contestant can get within 10, no points are awarded.\n\nAll combinations of large and small numbers have informal names: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Informal Name !! Large Numbers !! Small Numbers\n|-\n| Ratpack|| Zero || Six\n|-\n| Classroom Mix|| One|| Five\n|-\n| Family Mix|| Two|| Four\n|-\n| Even Stevens/Perfect Match|| Three || Three\n|-\n| Heavyweight|| Four || Two\n|}\n\n===Conundrum round===\nA nine-letter [[anagram]] made up of two smaller words is given to the contestants who must unscramble the word within the time limit of thirty seconds. The first person to buzz in and correctly identify the word wins 10 points. If a contestant answers incorrectly then they may not guess again and the other contestant has the remaining time to attempt to find the answer. If neither contestant buzzes in with a correct answer during the time limit then no points are awarded. If the scores are tied after the conundrum, tie-breaker conundrums are used until the match is decided.\n\n===Word Mix===\nBefore the commercial break, the audience is given a \"Word Mix\"\u2014an 8 letter anagram similar to the conundrum, but accompanied by a verbal clue. At the end of the break when the show returns, the anagram is revealed. This does not count towards the scores of the contestants. This is referred to as a 'Teatime Teaser' on the UK version.\n\n==List of series==\nAt the end of each series, the eight best contestants, those who have acquired the highest cumulative score over the series are invited back to compete in a series of finals. The winner of each series receives a trophy.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Series !! Start date !! End date !! No. of episodes !! Winner !! Score !! Runner-up !! Score\n|-\n| 1 || 2 August 2010 || 17 December 2010 || 100 || [[Andrew Fisher (Scrabble)|Andrew Fisher]] || 68 || Naween Fernando || 52\n|-\n| 2 || 20 December 2010 || 6 May 2011 || 100 || Tony Loui || 64 || Matthew Thomason || 51\n|-\n| 3 || 9 May 2011 || 21 October 2011 || 100 || Jacob Davey || 60 || Jeremy Schiftan || 49\n|-\n| 4 || 24 October 2011 || 9 March 2012 || 100 || Sam Gaffney || 55 || Alan Nash || 51\n|-\n| 5 || 12 March 2012 || 9 May 2012 || 43 || || || ||\n|-\n| Masters || 19 June 2012 || 27 June 2012 || 7 || Sam Gaffney || 46 || Matthew Thomason || 43\n|}\nFisher and Fernando from Series 1 have also been rivals outside of ''Letters and Numbers'' since the 1990s, having been involved in other mind-puzzle games at tournament level, most notably the Channel News Asia Scrabble Masters tournament held in Singapore in 1999. On that occasion Fernando prevailed in an epic encounter, winning $25,000 to Fisher's $10,000.\n\nAfter Series 5, the finals series from the first four series were repeated to prepare for the Masters series, which features all of the grand final winners and runners-up, except for Alan Nash, whom semi-finalist Toby Baldwin took his place.\n\n==Products==\nOn 1 December 2010, the Letters and Numbers puzzle book was published.

It is hosted by former newsreader  [[Richard Morecroft]], co-hosted by [[David Astle]] and [[Lily Serna]]. Although it is based on the [[France|French]] game show ''[[Des chiffres et des lettres]]'', its structure is similar to the UK version of the show, ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'' - with the titular difference being used to avoid confusion with the Australian music program ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]''.\n\nThe series began airing on 2 August 2010. On 22 June 2012 SBS announced its decision to \"rest\" the show and the final episode aired on 27 June 2012.<ref>[http://www.sbs.com.au/shows/lettersandnumbers Letters and Numbers on SBS]</ref> Repeat episodes are still shown on SBS.\n\n==Gameplay==\nTwo contestants compete against each other in a series of nine rounds, split into three sections.  The first two sections consist of two letters rounds followed by a numbers round; the third section consists of a letters round, a numbers round, and the conundrum round. After the first commercial break, Astle would present a story on the origins of particular words and phrases.\n\nThe winner of the game returns in the next show to face a new opponent; a player who wins six times is forced to retire, becoming a retired champion, in which case two new contestants will play the next game. Retired champions with the highest cumulative score may return for a special tournament at the end of each series. Every contestant also wins a ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]] 5th Edition'', signed by the presenters.\n\n===Letters round===\nOne contestant chooses how many vowels and consonants they would like to make up nine randomly chosen letters. There must be at least three vowels and four consonants. The contestants then have thirty seconds to find the longest word that they can make out of these letters. Any word which appears in the ''Macquarie Dictionary'' is allowable, as well as some inflections. The contestant with the longest word is awarded one point for each letter in the word, but nine-letter words count double (thus scoring 18 points). If both contestants find words of equal length then each is awarded points. Proper nouns are not qualified during the Letters rounds.\n\n===Numbers round===\nOne contestant chooses how many \"small\" and \"large\" numbers they would like to make up six randomly chosen numbers.  Small numbers are between 1 and 10 inclusive, and large numbers are 25, 50, 75, or 100.  All large numbers will be different, so at most four large numbers may be chosen. The contestants have to use [[arithmetic]] on some or all of those numbers to get as close as possible to a randomly generated three-digit target number within the thirty second time limit.  Fractions are not allowed\u2014only integers may be used at any stage of the calculation.\n\nFor numbers selections, they are to be straightforward. The numbers are always placed in a fixed order (going Right to Left - Small numbers are placed first, then the large ones).\n\nPoints are awarded for the closest solution, and again both contestants score if the solutions are equally close. 10 points are given for an exact answer, 7 points for a non-exact solution up to 5 from the target, and 5 points for a solution between 6 and 10 from the target. If neither contestant can get within 10, no points are awarded.\n\nAll combinations of large and small numbers have informal names: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Informal Name !! Large Numbers !! Small Numbers\n|-\n| Ratpack|| Zero || Six\n|-\n| Classroom Mix|| One|| Five\n|-\n| Family Mix|| Two|| Four\n|-\n| Even Stevens/Perfect Match|| Three || Three\n|-\n| Heavyweight|| Four || Two\n|}\n\n===Conundrum round===\nA nine-letter [[anagram]] made up of two smaller words is given to the contestants who must unscramble the word within the time limit of thirty seconds. The first person to buzz in and correctly identify the word wins 10 points. If a contestant answers incorrectly then they may not guess again and the other contestant has the remaining time to attempt to find the answer. If neither contestant buzzes in with a correct answer during the time limit then no points are awarded. If the scores are tied after the conundrum, tie-breaker conundrums are used until the match is decided.\n\n===Word Mix===\nBefore the commercial break, the audience is given a \"Word Mix\"\u2014an 8 letter anagram similar to the conundrum, but accompanied by a verbal clue. At the end of the break when the show returns, the anagram is revealed. This does not count towards the scores of the contestants. This is referred to as a 'Teatime Teaser' on the UK version.\n\n==List of series==\nAt the end of each series, the eight best contestants, those who have acquired the highest cumulative score over the series are invited back to compete in a series of finals. The winner of each series receives a trophy.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Series !! Start date !! End date !! No. of episodes !! Winner !! Score !! Runner-up !!

On that occasion Fernando prevailed in an epic encounter, winning $25,000 to Fisher's $10,000.\n\nAfter Series 5, the finals series from the first four series were repeated to prepare for the Masters series, which features all of the grand final winners and runners-up, except for Alan Nash, whom semi-finalist Toby Baldwin took his place.\n\n==Products==\nOn 1 December 2010, the Letters and Numbers puzzle book was published. Since then, eight volumes have been produced. The puzzles inside are transcribed from each episode of the show. On 1 May 2012, a spin-off puzzle book was released titled ''Lily's Number Puzzles'', which focused on numbers games.\n\nOn 4 July 2012, a DVD titled ''Letters and Numbers: The Masters'' was released, containing all seven episodes of the Masters series.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]''\n* [[Family Feud]]\n* [[The Chase Australia]]\n* [[Wheel of Fortune (Australian game show)]]\n* [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

After arriving, they find the previous owner of the home laying dead in his bed. Legal issues caused from his death prevent the family from settling into their home, forcing Naghi Mamouli and his family to live in his cousin Arastou's truck. During the time the Mamouli family live in the truck, they find themselves in strange and confusing events.\n\n===Paytakht Season 2 (2013)===\nNaghi goes to work one day and receives an assignment from his boss. Naghi must transport a newly made dome and two minarets to [[Qeshm Island]] in the south of Iran, to build a mosque there for the residents. He takes his family, his cousin Arastou, and a young woman named Miss Fadavi, who is an acquaintance of Naghi's boss. They all agree to take the dome and minarets to Qeshm in Arastou's truck. Miss Fadavi becomes a love interest for Arastou, resulting in many awkward but funny moments during the week long journey.\n\n===Paytakht Season 3 (2014)===\nArastou 'falls in love' with a young girl by the name of Miss Tehrani. He wants to hold his wedding at Naghi's home but the home is still under construction. Naghi lets him hold the wedding there anyway, and ignores his worker Mousa's request to build a pillar underneath the house to prevent it collapsing. On the night of the wedding, disaster strikes and the house collapses during the celebrations. Many people are injured and this ends Arastou's short lived marriage. These series of events result in Naghi losing his job and falling into depression. Naghi and Musa are forced to live in the home of his sister, Fahimeh. To give him a boost, Naghi decides to enter a national tournament in wrestling, his greatest passion. He loses badly to an elderly man by the name of Sohanpaz, causing his depression to become worse and becomes the laughingstock of [[Mazandaran]].\n\nDuring Naghi's cycle of depression, his cousin Arastou reveals to the family that he is engaged to a Chinese woman by the name of Cho Chung, or Raheleh after she converted to [[Islam]]. This centers the story around her, and how she travels all the way to [[Tehran]] in order to surprise Arastou, causing many troubles along the way. Although they have an argument after Arastou failed to tell her about his previous marriage, they are madly in love and plan to hold their wedding in [[Turkey]].\n\nIt is revealed that due to Sohanpaz becoming injured, Naghi is now the new contender for the international wrestling championship, to be held in [[Tehran]] in a matter of days. He rushes to the stadium to train and finds out he has to lose around 7 kilograms in order to compete in his weight class. Naghi shows determination that had not been seen from him in months. He loses the weight thanks to a very strict diet from his coach and qualifies for the tournament. Thanks to help of his family and friends, Naghi wins the championship finals, beating the [[United States]], [[Russia]], and [[China]] for 1st place.\n\n===Paytakht Season 4 (2015)===\nThe Mamouli family face a new set of challenges after Arastou's wife Cho Chung dies in the [[MH370]] plane crash. The season is set one year after the crash, however Arastou is still devastated and continues to mourn her death. Over the year, Arastou has grown out his beard and hair in mourning, alongside wearing black clothes. Naghi has done the same in support of his cousin. However, Naghi becomes tired of his appearance and urges Arastou to end his mourning, trim his beard, and begin to wear his colorful clothes once again.\n\nMeanwhile, Naghi's wife Homa becomes a city council member of Aliabad after winning a [[landslide election]]. Although Naghi is proud of her, he fears her work life may start to distance her from the family. He begins to despise the city council after Homa begins monitoring his behavior in order to prevent him from embarrassing her with his antics. Homa's position in the city council becomes a huge problem when Naghi begins to plan the construction of his sister Fahimeh's new home. After Naghi and Homa realize the new home is positioned in an illegal territory, they become opposed to each other. Naghi defies the law and continues to build the house for his sister, while Homa implores to them to stop construction as the home will soon be demolished by the city council. Many friends and family help to build the house over the course of many episodes.\n\nArastou is informed by the police that [[Malaysia Airlines]] will be paying a sum of $400,000 to him for the death of his wife. When he goes home, he tells no-one and is unhappy from the notion of profiting from the death of his wife. However, the news spreads quickly to Naghi, who is disappointed by the fact that he found out from his friend Rahmat rather than Arastou himself. Although Naghi is not interested in the money, he feels betrayed by Arastou since he was never told by him, causing small commotion.\n\nAfter all the controversy of Fahimeh's house, the city council finally finds out and sends a bulldozer to the house to demolish it. After much commotion with government officials, police, and a crowd of residents, Naghi pours gasoline on himself and points a lighter to himself, threatening to set himself on fire if his family is not left alone. This causes Homa to collapse and suffer a heart attack from the shock. Naghi drops everything and accompanies Homa to the hospital, where the fate of the house is left uncertain. The gasoline is revealed to be only water.

After arriving, they find the previous owner of the home laying dead in his bed. Legal issues caused from his death prevent the family from settling into their home, forcing Naghi Mamouli and his family to live in his cousin Arastou's truck. During the time the Mamouli family live in the truck, they find themselves in strange and confusing events.\n\n===Paytakht Season 2 (2013)===\nNaghi goes to work one day and receives an assignment from his boss. Naghi must transport a newly made dome and two minarets to [[Qeshm Island]] in the south of Iran, to build a mosque there for the residents. He takes his family, his cousin Arastou, and a young woman named Miss Fadavi, who is an acquaintance of Naghi's boss. They all agree to take the dome and minarets to Qeshm in Arastou's truck. Miss Fadavi becomes a love interest for Arastou, resulting in many awkward but funny moments during the week long journey.\n\n===Paytakht Season 3 (2014)===\nArastou 'falls in love' with a young girl by the name of Miss Tehrani. He wants to hold his wedding at Naghi's home but the home is still under construction. Naghi lets him hold the wedding there anyway, and ignores his worker Mousa's request to build a pillar underneath the house to prevent it collapsing. On the night of the wedding, disaster strikes and the house collapses during the celebrations. Many people are injured and this ends Arastou's short lived marriage. These series of events result in Naghi losing his job and falling into depression. Naghi and Musa are forced to live in the home of his sister, Fahimeh. To give him a boost, Naghi decides to enter a national tournament in wrestling, his greatest passion. He loses badly to an elderly man by the name of Sohanpaz, causing his depression to become worse and becomes the laughingstock of [[Mazandaran]].\n\nDuring Naghi's cycle of depression, his cousin Arastou reveals to the family that he is engaged to a Chinese woman by the name of Cho Chung, or Raheleh after she converted to [[Islam]]. This centers the story around her, and how she travels all the way to [[Tehran]] in order to surprise Arastou, causing many troubles along the way. Although they have an argument after Arastou failed to tell her about his previous marriage, they are madly in love and plan to hold their wedding in [[Turkey]].\n\nIt is revealed that due to Sohanpaz becoming injured, Naghi is now the new contender for the international wrestling championship, to be held in [[Tehran]] in a matter of days. He rushes to the stadium to train and finds out he has to lose around 7 kilograms in order to compete in his weight class. Naghi shows determination that had not been seen from him in months. He loses the weight thanks to a very strict diet from his coach and qualifies for the tournament. Thanks to help of his family and friends, Naghi wins the championship finals, beating the [[United States]], [[Russia]], and [[China]] for 1st place.\n\n===Paytakht Season 4 (2015)===\nThe Mamouli family face a new set of challenges after Arastou's wife Cho Chung dies in the [[MH370]] plane crash. The season is set one year after the crash, however Arastou is still devastated and continues to mourn her death. Over the year, Arastou has grown out his beard and hair in mourning, alongside wearing black clothes. Naghi has done the same in support of his cousin. However, Naghi becomes tired of his appearance and urges Arastou to end his mourning, trim his beard, and begin to wear his colorful clothes once again.\n\nMeanwhile, Naghi's wife Homa becomes a city council member of Aliabad after winning a [[landslide election]]. Although Naghi is proud of her, he fears her work life may start to distance her from the family. He begins to despise the city council after Homa begins monitoring his behavior in order to prevent him from embarrassing her with his antics. Homa's position in the city council becomes a huge problem when Naghi begins to plan the construction of his sister Fahimeh's new home. After Naghi and Homa realize the new home is positioned in an illegal territory, they become opposed to each other. Naghi defies the law and continues to build the house for his sister, while Homa implores to them to stop construction as the home will soon be demolished by the city council. Many friends and family help to build the house over the course of many episodes.\n\nArastou is informed by the police that [[Malaysia Airlines]] will be paying a sum of $400,000 to him for the death of his wife. When he goes home, he tells no-one and is unhappy from the notion of profiting from the death of his wife. However, the news spreads quickly to Naghi, who is disappointed by the fact that he found out from his friend Rahmat rather than Arastou himself. Although Naghi is not interested in the money, he feels betrayed by Arastou since he was never told by him, causing small commotion.\n\nAfter all the controversy of Fahimeh's house, the city council finally finds out and sends a bulldozer to the house to demolish it. After much commotion with government officials, police, and a crowd of residents, Naghi pours gasoline on himself and points a lighter to himself, threatening to set himself on fire if his family is not left alone. This causes Homa to collapse and suffer a heart attack from the shock. Naghi drops everything and accompanies Homa to the hospital, where the fate of the house is left uncertain.
