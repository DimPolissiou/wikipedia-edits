Part 2 of the Local Government Act sets out a classification scheme that gives each new municipality a designation. If the population is fewer than 2,500 people the new municipality is designated a ''village'', if between 2,500 and 5,000 a ''town'', and if greater than 5,000 a ''city''. If the new municipality has an area greater than {{convert|800|ha|acre|-2}} and an average population density of fewer than 5 persons per hectare then is it designated a ''district municipality''. The municipality must request change in designation but is not compelled to do so, despite population growth or loss - [[Greenwood, British Columbia|Greenwood]] has retained its city status, for example, rather than relinquishing it as other boomtowns of its era have done.

Part 2 of the Local Government Act sets out a classification scheme that gives each new municipality a designation. If the population is fewer than 2,500 people the new municipality is designated a ''village'', if between 2,500 and 5,000 a ''town'', and if greater than 5,000 a ''city''. If the new municipality has an area greater than {{convert|800|ha|acre|-2}} and an average population density of fewer than 5 persons per hectare then is it designated a ''district municipality''. The municipality must request change in designation but is not compelled to do so, despite population growth or loss - [[Greenwood, British Columbia|Greenwood]] has retained its city status, for example, rather than relinquishing it as other boomtowns of its era have done.

Salazar is best known for his performances in the [[New York City Marathon]] in the early 1980s and his 1982 [[Boston Marathon]] victory known as the \"Duel in the Sun.\" He held American track records of 13:11.93 for 5,000 m on July 6, 1982 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden and 27:25.61 for 10,000 m on June 26, 1982 in [[Oslo]], Norway.\n\nSalazar was the head coach of the [[Nike Oregon Project]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. He won the [[IAAF]] Coaching Achievement Award in 2013 during a ceremony hosted by the International Athletics Foundation in [[Monaco]].\n\nIn June 2015, Salazar was named in a joint [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' and [[ProPublica]] investigation into doping allegations.\n\nIn 2019 Salazar was banned for 4 years from athletics for [[#Doping investigations|doping offenses]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url= https://www.usada.org/sanction/aaa-panel-4-year-sanctions-alberto-salazar-jeffrey-brown/ |title =AAA Panel Imposes 4-Year Sanctions on Alberto Salazar and Dr. Jeffrey Brown for Multiple Anti-Doping Rule Violations |accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref> The Nike Oregon Project was shut down in the wake of the controversy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a29432537/after-salazar-ban-nike-shuts-down-oregon-project/|title=After Salazar Ban, Nike Shuts Down Oregon Project|last=Sgobba|first=Christa|date=2019-10-11|website=Runner's World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>  \n\nHe was further mired in controversy after the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' published a video [[op-ed]] from his former athlete [[Mary Cain (athlete)|Mary Cain]]. <ref>{{cite news|title=I was the fastest girl in the world until I joined Nike|first=Mary|last=Cain|work=New York Times|date=November 7, 2019|accessdate=November 7, 2019|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/opinion/nike-running-mary-cain.html}}</ref>\n\n==Running career==\n\n===High school===\nBorn in Cuba, Salazar grew up in [[Wayland, Massachusetts]]. His father Jose was a close friend of [[Fidel Castro]] and fellow [[Cuban revolution]]ary, who became an opponent of the Communist government and member of the [[anti-Castro]] movement.{{r|brant200404}} The younger Salazar was an outstanding high school runner who was state cross country champion in 1975. He trained w\u0131th the well known [[Greater Boston Track Club]] (whose members included the likes of [[Bill Rodgers (athlete)|Bill Rodgers]], Randy Thomas, and [[Greg Meyer]]) where he was given the nickname of \"the rookie\".\n\n===Collegiate===\nFrom Massachusetts he went to the [[University of Oregon]] where he won numerous All American honors, was a member of the 1977 NCAA cross country championship team, and won the individual NCAA cross country championship in 1978. Salazar won the 1978 NCAA national cross country championship in cold, snowy conditions, handing Track & Field News Athlete of the Year [[Henry Rono]] one of his few losses of the year. He finished 2nd to Rono in a memorable duel at the 1979 NCAA national cross country championships at [[Lehigh University]], in which Rono (28:19) and Salazar (28:28) ran the 3rd and 5th fastest 10,000 meter cross country times in NCAA championship history. Neither time has been matched in over three decades of NCAA cross country competition since then. After that, he finished third in the Olympic Trials 10,000 meter race in  28:10.42<ref name=\"runnersworld.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20835941/the-1980-u-s-track-field-trials/|title=The 1980 U.S. Track & Field Trials|date=October 1, 1980|website=Runner's World}}</ref> to make the 1980 Olympic team (which didn't compete in the Olympics in Moscow due to the U.S. boycott) and received one of 461 [[List of Congressional Gold Medal recipients|Congressional Gold Medal]]s created especially for the spurned athletes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caroccioli|first1=Tom|last2=Caroccioli|first2=Jerry|title=Boycott: Stolen Dreams of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=Highland Park, IL|isbn=978-0942257403|pages=243\u2013253}}</ref> He broke the American indoor 5,000 meter record in February 1981 at the [[Millrose Games]] in New York (his 13:22.6 beating the old AR by nearly 20 seconds as he finished second behind [[Suleiman Nyambui]], who broke the indoor world record with a 13:20.4). Salazar and Bill Rodgers had a legendary duel at the Gurnet Classic Beach Run in Duxbury during the 1970s.

He was on that week's cover of Sports Illustrated after the victory. In 1981, Salazar set an apparent world record at the [[New York City Marathon]] of 2:08:13, surpassing the 12-year-old mark of 2:08:33 set by Australian [[Derek Clayton]] in 1969 in Antwerp, Belgium. However, the course was found on re-measurement to be about 148 meters short of the 42.195 kilometre (26 miles, 385 yards) distance. This is equivalent to about 27 seconds.\n\nIn 1982 he won his first and only [[Boston Marathon]] after the famous \"Duel in the Sun\" with [[Dick Beardsley]].<ref name=sports-reference/> Salazar won the race in an exciting sprint finish and collapsed at the end before being taken to an emergency room and given six liters of saline solution intravenously because he had not drunk during the race.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brant|first=John|title=Duel In The Sun: Alberto Salazar, Dick Beardsley, and America's greatest marathon|publisher=Rodale|year=2006|pages=96|isbn=1-59486-262-1}}</ref> Salazar ended the year ranked #1 in the world in the marathon by [[Track & Field News]] magazine for his wins in Boston and New York, #1 in their North American Road Rankings for his American 10K road record win of 28:04 at the Orange Bowl 10K and his course record of 31:53 at the highly competitive Falmouth {{convert|7.1|mi|km|adj=on}} road race (his second win and course record there), #8 in the world (and #1 American with an AR of 13:11.93) in the 5,000 meters, and #2 in the world in the 10,000 meters, with three second-place finishes at Eugene (27:30.0), at Oslo in an American Record of 27:25.61, and at Paris (27:29.06).\n\nSalazar enjoyed success in cross country competition, earning several All American honors in collegiate and post-collegiate national championships. Salazar was also the U.S. national cross country champion in 1979. He fared well at the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]], finishing second in 1982 and fourth in 1983.  His silver medal in 1982 marks the last time an American male reached the podium in World Cross Country.\n\nIn addition to a fourth-place finish (only one second behind the top three placers) at the 1983 world cross country championships, Salazar twice broke the American 10&nbsp;km road record in 1983 with efforts of 28:02 and 28:01 at the Americas 10&nbsp;km and Continental Homes 10&nbsp;km respectively. He finished as the top ranker in Track & Field News magazine's North American Road Rankings for 1983. He was also the 10,000 meter national track champion in 1983, pulling away from [[Craig Virgin]] in the last straightaway at the U.S. championships in Indiana in June to win his second such title (the first coming in 1981). However, he finished last in the 10,000 meters at the World Track & Field Championships while suffering from bronchitis and was beaten for the first time in the marathon, finishing fifth at the Rotterdam marathon in April (2:10:08) and then fifth again at Fukuoka in December (2:09:21). (The latter time would have been the American Record for the next 17 years except that there was a problem in filing the paperwork with the authorities.)\n\nIn 1984, after a 2nd-place finish by Salazar in the 10,000 meters at the [[Mt. SAC Relays]] in 27:45.5, he finished 2nd at the men's Olympic marathon trials (2:11:44) to become a member of the United States' [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics - Men's Marathon|Olympic Marathon Team]], along with [[Pete Pfitzinger]] and John Tuttle.  He was considered a favorite to win or medal in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], but finished a disappointing 15th in 2:14:19 under the hot Los Angeles sun.\n\nSalazar's competitive decline is often attributed to the stress on his body from the famous \"Duel in the Sun\" with Beardsley.{{r|brant200404}} Salazar recounts falling into a \"more-is-better\" mindset which led him to reason that if 120 miles per week yielded a certain level of success, then {{convert|180|mi|km}} or even {{convert|200|mi|km}} would bring even better results. This intense and grueling regimen of such extremely long distances led to a breakdown of his immune system, and he found himself frequently sick, injured, and otherwise unable to continue training. The story of Salazar's 1982 win at the Boston Marathon and his subsequent competitive decline is told in ''[[Duel in the Sun (book)|Duel in the Sun]]'' by John Brant.\n\nAfter failing to make the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics - Men's Marathon|1988 Olympic Marathon Team]] Salazar opened a successful restaurant in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. Although only able to stagger through four or five miles per run, he remained obsessed with training; Brant wrote that \"He couldn't run, yet he couldn't stop running.\" Salazar unsuccessfully visited the Stanford Sleep Clinic and a cardiologist, had surgery, and trained in Kenya. In 1994 he said that \"For most of the last 10 years, I hated running. I hated it with a passion. I used to wish for a cataclysmic injury in which I would lose one of my legs. I know that sounds terrible, but if I had lost a leg, then I wouldn't have to torture myself anymore.\"{{r|brant200404}}\n\nA doctor diagnosed Salazar's running problems and [[exercise-induced asthma]] as largely due to the 1982 marathon, and successfully prescribed [[Prozac]] to improve his physical symptoms and depression. Salazar closed his restaurant, began training again at the age of 34, and in 1994 won the prestigious {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Comrades Marathon]]. He soon retired from competing, believing that he had nothing left to prove as a runner, and became a running coach.<ref name=\"brant200404\">{{cite news | url=http://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/duel-in-the-sun | title=Duel in the Sun | work=Runner's World | date=April 2004 | accessdate=April 10, 2015 | author=Brant, John | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916172517/http://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/duel-in-the-sun | archive-date=September 16, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Salazar stated that Prozac played a role in motivating him to succeed in professional running again; the actual effect of the drug on his performance remains controversial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Salazar's Drug Claim a Concern|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-07-03/sports/9407020194_1_prozac-side-effects-endocrine-system|work=Sun Sentinel}}</ref>\n\n==Post-competitive career==\nAfter his competition career, Salazar moved into coaching.

[[long-distance running|long-distance runner]] and a doping offender. Born in [[Cuba]], Salazar immigrated to the United States as a child with his family. They moved to [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]], [[Connecticut]] and then to [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], [[Massachusetts]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/salazar_alberto_1958_/#.WDWeZmMrLD4|title=Alberto Salazar (1958 - )|website=oregonencyclopedia.org}}</ref> where Salazar competed in track and field in high school. Salazar is best known for his performances in the [[New York City Marathon]] in the early 1980s and his 1982 [[Boston Marathon]] victory known as the \"Duel in the Sun.\" He held American track records of 13:11.93 for 5,000 m on July 6, 1982 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden and 27:25.61 for 10,000 m on June 26, 1982 in [[Oslo]], Norway.\n\nSalazar was the head coach of the [[Nike Oregon Project]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. He won the [[IAAF]] Coaching Achievement Award in 2013 during a ceremony hosted by the International Athletics Foundation in [[Monaco]].\n\nIn June 2015, Salazar was named in a joint [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' and [[ProPublica]] investigation into doping allegations.\n\nIn 2019 Salazar was banned for 4 years from athletics for [[#Doping investigations|doping offenses]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url= https://www.usada.org/sanction/aaa-panel-4-year-sanctions-alberto-salazar-jeffrey-brown/ |title =AAA Panel Imposes 4-Year Sanctions on Alberto Salazar and Dr. Jeffrey Brown for Multiple Anti-Doping Rule Violations |accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref> The Nike Oregon Project was shut down in the wake of the controversy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a29432537/after-salazar-ban-nike-shuts-down-oregon-project/|title=After Salazar Ban, Nike Shuts Down Oregon Project|last=Sgobba|first=Christa|date=2019-10-11|website=Runner's World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>  \n\nHe was further mired in controversy after the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' published a video [[op-ed]] from his former athlete [[Mary Cain (athlete)|Mary Cain]]. <ref>{{cite news|title=I was the fastest girl in the world until I joined Nike|first=Mary|last=Cain|work=New York Times|date=November 7, 2019|accessdate=November 7, 2019|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/opinion/nike-running-mary-cain.html}}</ref>\n\n==Running career==\n\n===High school===\nBorn in Cuba, Salazar grew up in [[Wayland, Massachusetts]]. His father Jose was a close friend of [[Fidel Castro]] and fellow [[Cuban revolution]]ary, who became an opponent of the Communist government and member of the [[anti-Castro]] movement.{{r|brant200404}} The younger Salazar was an outstanding high school runner who was state cross country champion in 1975. He trained w\u0131th the well known [[Greater Boston Track Club]] (whose members included the likes of [[Bill Rodgers (athlete)|Bill Rodgers]], Randy Thomas, and [[Greg Meyer]]) where he was given the nickname of \"the rookie\".\n\n===Collegiate===\nFrom Massachusetts he went to the [[University of Oregon]] where he won numerous All American honors, was a member of the 1977 NCAA cross country championship team, and won the individual NCAA cross country championship in 1978. Salazar won the 1978 NCAA national cross country championship in cold, snowy conditions, handing Track & Field News Athlete of the Year [[Henry Rono]] one of his few losses of the year. He finished 2nd to Rono in a memorable duel at the 1979 NCAA national cross country championships at [[Lehigh University]], in which Rono (28:19) and Salazar (28:28) ran the 3rd and 5th fastest 10,000 meter cross country times in NCAA championship history. Neither time has been matched in over three decades of NCAA cross country competition since then. After that, he finished third in the Olympic Trials 10,000 meter race in  28:10.42<ref name=\"runnersworld.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20835941/the-1980-u-s-track-field-trials/|title=The 1980 U.S. Track & Field Trials|date=October 1, 1980|website=Runner's World}}</ref> to make the 1980 Olympic team (which didn't compete in the Olympics in Moscow due to the U.S. boycott) and received one of 461 [[List of Congressional Gold Medal recipients|Congressional Gold Medal]]s created especially for the spurned athletes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caroccioli|first1=Tom|last2=Caroccioli|first2=Jerry|title=Boycott: Stolen Dreams of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=Highland Park, IL|isbn=978-0942257403|pages=243\u2013253}}</ref> He broke the American indoor 5,000 meter record in February 1981 at the [[Millrose Games]] in New York (his 13:22.6 beating the old AR by nearly 20 seconds as he finished second behind [[Suleiman Nyambui]], who broke the indoor world record with a 13:20.4). Salazar and Rodgers had a legendary duel at the Gurnet Classic Beach Run in Duxbury during the 1970s. At the 1978 [[Falmouth Road Race]] after fading to 10th place, he collapsed at the finish with a temperature of 107 degrees Fahrenheit (41.7&nbsp;\u00b0C) and was read his last rites prematurely.<ref name=\"si_4Sept1978\">{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Kenny|title=Even In A Crowd He Runs Alone|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=September 4, 1978|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1135819/1/index.htm|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"si_31Oct2007\">{{cite journal|last=Wolff|first=Alexander|title=No Finish Line|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=October 31, 2007|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1058763/index.htm|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Post-collegiate===\nFrom 1980 through 1982, Salazar won three consecutive [[New York City Marathon]]s.{{r|brant200404}} His first-ever marathon, the 1980 New York City race, resulted in a 2:09:41 win, at the time the fastest American debut and the second-fastest time recorded by a U.S. runner (behind Bill Rodgers' 2:09:27 at [[Boston Marathon|Boston]] in 1979). He was on that week's cover of Sports Illustrated after the victory. In 1981, Salazar set an apparent world record at the [[New York City Marathon]] of 2:08:13, surpassing the 12-year-old mark of 2:08:33 set by Australian [[Derek Clayton]] in 1969 in Antwerp, Belgium. However, the course was found on re-measurement to be about 148 meters short of the 42.195 kilometre (26 miles, 385 yards) distance. This is equivalent to about 27 seconds.\n\nIn 1982 he won his first and only [[Boston Marathon]] after the famous \"Duel in the Sun\" with [[Dick Beardsley]].<ref name=sports-reference/> Salazar won the race in an exciting sprint finish and collapsed at the end before being taken to an emergency room and given six liters of saline solution intravenously because he had not drunk during the race.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brant|first=John|title=Duel In The Sun: Alberto Salazar, Dick Beardsley, and America's greatest marathon|publisher=Rodale|year=2006|pages=96|isbn=1-59486-262-1}}</ref> Salazar ended the year ranked #1 in the world in the marathon by [[Track & Field News]] magazine for his wins in Boston and New York, #1 in their North American Road Rankings for his American 10K road record win of 28:04 at the Orange Bowl 10K and his course record of 31:53 at the highly competitive Falmouth {{convert|7.1|mi|km|adj=on}} road race (his second win and course record there), #8 in the world (and #1 American with an AR of 13:11.93) in the 5,000 meters, and #2 in the world in the 10,000 meters, with three second-place finishes at Eugene (27:30.0), at Oslo in an American Record of 27:25.61, and at Paris (27:29.06).\n\nSalazar enjoyed success in cross country competition, earning several All American honors in collegiate and post-collegiate national championships. Salazar was also the U.S. national cross country champion in 1979. He fared well at the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]], finishing second in 1982 and fourth in 1983.  His silver medal in 1982 marks the last time an American male reached the podium in World Cross Country.\n\nIn addition to a fourth-place finish (only one second behind the top three placers) at the 1983 world cross country championships, Salazar twice broke the American 10&nbsp;km road record in 1983 with efforts of 28:02 and 28:01 at the Americas 10&nbsp;km and Continental Homes 10&nbsp;km respectively. He finished as the top ranker in Track & Field News magazine's North American Road Rankings for 1983. He was also the 10,000 meter national track champion in 1983, pulling away from [[Craig Virgin]] in the last straightaway at the U.S. championships in Indiana in June to win his second such title (the first coming in 1981). However, he finished last in the 10,000 meters at the World Track & Field Championships while suffering from bronchitis and was beaten for the first time in the marathon, finishing fifth at the Rotterdam marathon in April (2:10:08) and then fifth again at Fukuoka in December (2:09:21). (The latter time would have been the American Record for the next 17 years except that there was a problem in filing the paperwork with the authorities.)\n\nIn 1984, after a 2nd-place finish by Salazar in the 10,000 meters at the [[Mt. SAC Relays]] in 27:45.5, he finished 2nd at the men's Olympic marathon trials (2:11:44) to become a member of the United States' [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics - Men's Marathon|Olympic Marathon Team]], along with [[Pete Pfitzinger]] and John Tuttle.  He was considered a favorite to win or medal in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], but finished a disappointing 15th in 2:14:19 under the hot Los Angeles sun.\n\nSalazar's competitive decline is often attributed to the stress on his body from the famous \"Duel in the Sun\" with Beardsley.{{r|brant200404}} Salazar recounts falling into a \"more-is-better\" mindset which led him to reason that if 120 miles per week yielded a certain level of success, then {{convert|180|mi|km}} or even {{convert|200|mi|km}} would bring even better results. This intense and grueling regimen of such extremely long distances led to a breakdown of his immune system, and he found himself frequently sick, injured, and otherwise unable to continue training. The story of Salazar's 1982 win at the Boston Marathon and his subsequent competitive decline is told in ''[[Duel in the Sun (book)|Duel in the Sun]]'' by John Brant.\n\nAfter failing to make the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics - Men's Marathon|1988 Olympic Marathon Team]] Salazar opened a successful restaurant in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. Although only able to stagger through four or five miles per run, he remained obsessed with training; Brant wrote that \"He couldn't run, yet he couldn't stop running.\" Salazar unsuccessfully visited the Stanford Sleep Clinic and a cardiologist, had surgery, and trained in Kenya. In 1994 he said that \"For most of the last 10 years, I hated running. I hated it with a passion. I used to wish for a cataclysmic injury in which I would lose one of my legs. I know that sounds terrible, but if I had lost a leg, then I wouldn't have to torture myself anymore.\"{{r|brant200404}}\n\nA doctor diagnosed Salazar's running problems and [[exercise-induced asthma]] as largely due to the 1982 marathon, and successfully prescribed [[Prozac]] to improve his physical symptoms and depression. Salazar closed his restaurant, began training again at the age of 34, and in 1994 won the prestigious {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Comrades Marathon]]. He soon retired from competing, believing that he had nothing left to prove as a runner, and became a running coach.<ref name=\"brant200404\">{{cite news | url=http://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/duel-in-the-sun | title=Duel in the Sun | work=Runner's World | date=April 2004 | accessdate=April 10, 2015 | author=Brant, John | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916172517/http://www.runnersworld.com/boston-marathon/duel-in-the-sun | archive-date=September 16, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Salazar stated that Prozac played a role in motivating him to succeed in professional running again; the actual effect of the drug on his performance remains controversial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Salazar's Drug Claim a Concern|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-07-03/sports/9407020194_1_prozac-side-effects-endocrine-system|work=Sun Sentinel}}</ref>\n\n==Post-competitive career==\nAfter his competition career, Salazar moved into coaching.

In August 2012 at the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics|London Summer Olympics]], two of Salazar's Olympic-caliber athletes, Mo Farah and Galen Rupp, finished 1st and 2nd respectively in the 10,000&nbsp;m; Farah also went on to win gold in the 5,000&nbsp;m, becoming the first British double Olympian in long distance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/athletics/9454036/Mo-Farahs-American-coach-Alberto-Salazar-on-how-he-helped-runner-step-up-to-win-10000m-gold-at-London-2012.html|title=Mo Farah's American coach Alberto Salazar on how he helped runner 'step up' to win 10,000m gold at London 2012|author=Simon Hart|publisher=  [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=August 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSalazar ran in the ING New York Marathon in 2006, at age 48, serving as a pacesetter for cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]], who was attempting his first marathon. Salazar was primarily responsible for guiding Armstrong for the first {{convert|10|mi|km}} of the race, while [[Joan Benoit Samuelson]] oversaw the next {{convert|10|mi|km}}, and [[Hicham El Guerrouj]] the final {{convert|6.2|mi|km}}. With their help, Armstrong met his goal of completing the race under three hours, finishing in 2:59:36.\n\nOn Saturday, June 30, 2007, Salazar experienced a serious \"heart event\" and was rushed to the hospital.<ref name=\"si_31Oct2007\" /> On Sunday, July 1 he was reported to be \"groggy\" by his family and remained listed in serious condition.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-06-30-3910860095_x.htm 3-time NYC marathon winner Salazar hospitalized with heart problem], [[USA Today]], June 30, 2007.</ref> On July 2, doctors upgraded his condition from \"serious\" to \"fair\".

He attributes this partially to the stress of coaching five Olympic-hopeful athletes. Afterwards, doctors adjusted his medications, but do not believe that there was any further injury to the heart. He returned to the track to coach his athletes through the trials.<ref>Joel Odom (June 29, 2008).

The book tracks Salazar's story from his family's roots in Cuba, his adolescence in Massachusetts, through his running career to present-day coaching efforts, culminating in his 14-minute-long heart stop in 2007.\n\n===Doping investigations===\nIn June 2015, Salazar was named in a joint [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' and [[ProPublica]] investigation into doping allegations. This involved testimonies from various athletes and people associated with Salazar about alleged [[microdosing]] of [[Testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] and [[prednisone]] at the [[Nike Oregon Project]]. Salazar declined to be interviewed for the programme, but denied any wrongdoing, saying in a statement that the \"allegations your sources are making are based upon false assumptions and half-truths in an attempt to further their personal agendas\".<ref name=\"BBC Panorama 3 June 2015\">{{cite news |last= Daly |first=Mark |title= Top athletics coach Alberto Salazar faces doping claims|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-32877702 | date=June 3, 2015|website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate=June 3, 2015 }}</ref> One of the more high-profile allegations was made by former Nike Oregon Project athlete [[Kara Goucher]], who claimed she was pressured by Salazar to take thyroid medication not prescribed by her doctor to lose weight gained during her pregnancy in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Kara Goucher Will Remain Publicly Silent on Doping Allegations Against Salazar|url = http://www.runnersworld.com/elite-runners/kara-goucher-will-remain-publicly-silent-on-doping-allegations-against-salazar|website = Runner's World|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref> The accusations were addressed by Salazar in public releases.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://nikeoregonproject.com/blogs/news/35522561-alberto-open-letter-part-1 |title= Alberto Open Letter Part 1 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://nikeoregonproject.com/blogs/news/35523713-alberto-open-letter-part-2 |title= Alberto Open Letter Part 2 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref> \n\nShortly after the allegations, [[Josh Rohatinsky]], who trained under Salazar at the Nike Oregon Project from 2007 until July 2009, used [[Facebook]] to describe both Galen Rupp's relationship with Salazar and the athlete's improved performance as \"highly suspicious\". In the social media posting, Rohatinsky claimed that there had been a \"wall of separation\" between Salazar and Rupp and the rest of the athletes. He also expressed his belief in \"the full extent\" of the witnesses' evidence which appeared in the BBC documentary adding that he also believed that all activity relating to performance-enhancing drugs during his own time at the NOP had been \"limited to Galen Rupp\".<ref name=\"BBC News 14 June 2015\">{{cite web | title= Alberto Salazar: Ex-Oregon Project runner backs BBC's doping claims |url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/athletics/33125707| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= June 14, 2015| website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= June 14, 2015}}</ref> \n\nOn October 1, 2019, USADA banned Salazar and Dr. Jeffery Brown, a colleague at the Oregon Project, for doping offences.<ref name=\"auto\"/> These included using a [[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]] prohibited method, tampering with doping control methods and trafficking [[Testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] through a prohibited testing program.

Governor [[Joseph Royal]].  The members voted on more than one occasion to nullify and make English the only language used in the assembly.  After some conflict with Ottawa and a decisive vote on January 19, 1892, the issue was put to rest as an English-only territory.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the government of Northwest Territories was again under pressure by the federal government to reintroduce French as an official language.  Some native members walked out of the assembly, protesting that they would not be permitted to speak their own language.  The executive council appointed a special committee of MLAs to study the matter.  They decided that if French was to be an official language, then so must the other languages in the territories.\n\nThe Northwest Territories's Official Languages Act recognizes the following eleven [[official language]]s, which is more than any other political division in Canada:<ref name=\"lang\">[http://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/PDF/ACTS/Official_Languages.pdf Northwest Territories Official Languages Act, 1988] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324000000/http://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/PDF/ACTS/Official_Languages.pdf |date=March 24, 2009 }} (as amended 1988, 1991-1992, 2003)</ref>\n\n*[[Dene Suline language|Chipewyan]]\n*[[Cree language|Cree]]\n*[[English language|English]]\n*[[French language|French]]\n*[[Gwich\u2019in language|Gwich\u2019in]]\n*[[Inuinnaqtun]]\n*[[Inuktitut]]\n*[[Inuvialuktun]]\n*[[North Slavey language|North Slavey]]\n*[[South Slavey language|South Slavey]]\n*[[Dogrib language|T\u0142\u012fch\u01eb]]\n\nNWT residents have a right to use any of the above languages in a territorial court and in debates and proceedings of the legislature.  However, laws are legally binding only in their French and English versions, and the government only publishes laws and other documents in the territory's other official languages when the legislature asks it to.  Furthermore, access to services in any language is limited to institutions and circumstances where there is significant demand for that language or where it is reasonable to expect it given the nature of the services requested.  In reality, this means that English language services are universally available and there is no guarantee that other languages, including French, will be used by any particular government service except for the courts.\n\nThe [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Canadian census]] showed a population of 41,464.<br />Of the 40,680 singular responses to the census question concerning 'mother tongue' the most commonly reported languages were: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|1.\n|'''English'''\n|31,545\n|77.54%\n|-\n|2.\n|Athapaskan languages\n|4,710\n|11.58%\n|-\n|\n|'''''Dogrib'''''\n|1,950\n|4.79%\n|-\n|\n|'''''South Slavey'''''\n|1,285\n|3.16%\n|-\n|\n|'''''North Slavey'''''\n|835\n|2.05%\n|-\n|\n|'''''Chipewyan'''''\n|390\n|0.96%\n|-\n|\n|'''''Gwich'in'''''\n|190\n|0.47%\n|-\n|\n|''Dene''\n|50\n|0.12%\n|-\n|3.\n|'''French'''\n|975\n|2.40%\n|-\n|4.\n|'''Inuktitut'''\n|695\n|1.71%\n|-\n|5.\n|Malayo-Polynesian languages\n|530\n|1.30%\n|-\n|\n|''Tagalog''\n|505\n|1.24%\n|-\n|6.\n|Vietnamese\n|305\n|0.75%\n|-\n|7.\n|Chinese\n|260\n|0.64%\n|-\n|\n|''Cantonese''\n|120\n|0.29%\n|-\n|8.\n|Algonquian languages\n|250\n|0.61%\n|-\n|\n|'''''Cree'''''\n|190\n|0.47%\n|-\n|\n|''Ojibway''\n|35\n|0.09%\n|-\n|9.\n|German\n|190\n|0.47%\n|-\n|10=\n|Arabic\n|105\n|0.26%\n|-\n|10=\n|Creole\n|105\n|0.26%\n|-\n|12.\n|Dutch\n|95\n|0.23%\n|-\n|13.\n|Spanish\n|90\n|0.22%\n|-\n|14.\n|Niger-Congo languages\n|80\n|0.20%\n|-\n|\n|''Bantu languages''\n|55\n|0.14%\n|-\n|15.\n|Yugoslavian languages\n|60\n|0.15%\n|-\n|16=\n|'''Innuinaqtun'''\n|55\n|0.14%\n|-\n|16=\n|Italian\n|55\n|0.14%\n|-\n|}\nThere were also about 40 single-language responses for Ukrainian; 35 for the Scandinavian languages, Slovak and Urdu; and 30 for Hungarian, the Iranian languages and Polish.

Governor [[Joseph Royal]].  The members voted on more than one occasion to nullify and make English the only language used in the assembly.  After some conflict with Ottawa and a decisive vote on January 19, 1892, the issue was put to rest as an English-only territory.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the government of Northwest Territories was again under pressure by the federal government to reintroduce French as an official language.  Some native members walked out of the assembly, protesting that they would not be permitted to speak their own language.  The executive council appointed a special committee of MLAs to study the matter.  They decided that if French was to be an official language, then so must the other languages in the territories.\n\nThe Northwest Territories's Official Languages Act recognizes the following eleven [[official language]]s, which is more than any other political division in Canada:<ref name=\"lang\">[http://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/PDF/ACTS/Official_Languages.pdf Northwest Territories Official Languages Act, 1988] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324000000/http://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/PDF/ACTS/Official_Languages.pdf |date=March 24, 2009 }} (as amended 1988, 1991-1992, 2003)</ref>\n\n*[[Dene Suline language|Chipewyan]]\n*[[Cree language|Cree]]\n*[[English language|English]]\n*[[French language|French]]\n*[[Gwich\u2019in language|Gwich\u2019in]]\n*[[Inuinnaqtun]]\n*[[Inuktitut]]\n*[[Inuvialuktun]]\n*[[North Slavey language|North Slavey]]\n*[[South Slavey language|South Slavey]]\n*[[Dogrib language|T\u0142\u012fch\u01eb]]\n\nNWT residents have a right to use any of the above languages in a territorial court and in debates and proceedings of the legislature.  However, laws are legally binding only in their French and English versions, and the government only publishes laws and other documents in the territory's other official languages when the legislature asks it to.  Furthermore, access to services in any language is limited to institutions and circumstances where there is significant demand for that language or where it is reasonable to expect it given the nature of the services requested.  In reality, this means that English language services are universally available and there is no guarantee that other languages, including French, will be used by any particular government service except for the courts.\n\nThe [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Canadian census]] showed a population of 41,464.<br />Of the 40,680 singular responses to the census question concerning 'mother tongue' the most commonly reported languages were: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|1.\n|'''English'''\n|31,545\n|77.54%\n|-\n|2.\n|Athapaskan languages\n|4,710\n|11.58%\n|-\n|\n|'''''Dogrib'''''\n|1,950\n|4.79%\n|-\n|\n|'''''South Slavey'''''\n|1,285\n|3.16%\n|-\n|\n|'''''North Slavey'''''\n|835\n|2.05%\n|-\n|\n|'''''Chipewyan'''''\n|390\n|0.96%\n|-\n|\n|'''''Gwich'in'''''\n|190\n|0.47%\n|-\n|\n|''Dene''\n|50\n|0.12%\n|-\n|3.\n|'''French'''\n|975\n|2.40%\n|-\n|4.\n|'''Inuktitut'''\n|695\n|1.71%\n|-\n|5.\n|Malayo-Polynesian languages\n|530\n|1.30%\n|-\n|\n|''Tagalog''\n|505\n|1.24%\n|-\n|6.\n|Vietnamese\n|305\n|0.75%\n|-\n|7.\n|Chinese\n|260\n|0.64%\n|-\n|\n|''Cantonese''\n|120\n|0.29%\n|-\n|8.\n|Algonquian languages\n|250\n|0.61%\n|-\n|\n|'''''Cree'''''\n|190\n|0.47%\n|-\n|\n|''Ojibway''\n|35\n|0.09%\n|-\n|9.\n|German\n|190\n|0.47%\n|-\n|10=\n|Arabic\n|105\n|0.26%\n|-\n|10=\n|Creole\n|105\n|0.26%\n|-\n|12.\n|Dutch\n|95\n|0.23%\n|-\n|13.\n|Spanish\n|90\n|0.22%\n|-\n|14.\n|Niger-Congo languages\n|80\n|0.20%\n|-\n|\n|''Bantu languages''\n|55\n|0.14%\n|-\n|15.\n|Yugoslavian languages\n|60\n|0.15%\n|-\n|16=\n|'''Innuinaqtun'''\n|55\n|0.14%\n|-\n|16=\n|Italian\n|55\n|0.14%\n|-\n|}\nThere were also about 40 single-language responses for Ukrainian; 35 for the Scandinavian languages, Slovak and Urdu; and 30 for Hungarian, the Iranian languages and Polish.

The provincial Department of Finance estimates that the province's population in 2006 was 729,997 of which the majority is English-speaking but with a substantial (27%) French-speaking minority of mostly [[Acadian]] origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/french-language-decline-new-brunswick-statistics-canada-1.5077193 |publisher=CBC |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nFirst Nations in New Brunswick include the Mi'kmaq and Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet). The first European settlers, the Acadians are descendants of French colonists of Acadia, a French colony in what is today Nova Scotia. The Acadians were expelled by the British (1755) for refusing to take an oath of allegiance to King George II which drove several thousand French residents into exile in North America, the UK and France  during the [[French and Indian War]]. American Acadians, who wound up in [[Louisiana]] and other parts of the American South, are often referred to as [[Cajuns]].\n\nMany of the English-Canadian population of New Brunswick are descended from Loyalists who fled the American Revolution. This is commemorated in the province's motto, ''Spem reduxit'' (\"hope was restored\"). There is also a significant population with [[Irish People|Irish]] ancestry, especially in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] and the Miramichi Valley. People of Scottish descent are scattered throughout the Province with higher concentrations in the Miramichi and in Campbellton. A small population of [[Denmark|Danish]] origin may be found in [[New Denmark, New Brunswick|New Denmark]] in the northwest of the province.\n\n==Population==\n\n===City Metropolitan Areas===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n!City\n!2011\n!2006\n!Land Area <small>km\u00b2</small>\n!Density <small>/km\u00b2</small>\n|-\n|[[Greater Moncton]] ||138,644||126,424||2,406.31||57.6\n|-\n|[[Greater Saint John]] ||127,761||122,389||3,362.95||38.0\n|-\n|[[Greater Fredericton]] ||94,268||85,688||4,886.40||19.3\n|-\n|[[Greater Bathurst, New Brunswick|Greater Bathurst]] ||33,484||34,106||2,292.80||14.6\n|-\n|[[Greater Miramichi, New Brunswick|Greater Miramichi]] ||28,115||28,773||7,578.30||3.7\n|-\n|[[Greater Edmundston]] ||21,903||22,471||916.85||23.9\n|-\n|[[Greater Campbellton, New Brunswick|Greater Campbellton]] ||17,842||17,878||1,629.94||10.9\n|}\n\n===Cities and towns===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

The province also has a relatively high proportion of people who state that they can speak both official languages, with about 246,000 people, or 33.2% of the population reporting the ability to speak both English and French (though Francophones make up two-thirds of those who are bilingual).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officiallanguages.nb.ca/sites/default/files/imce/pdfs/annual_report_2014-2015.pdf|title=2014\u20132015 Annual Report, Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages of New Brunswick|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|page=39|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nLanguage policy remains a perennial issue in New Brunswick society and politics. Recurring debates have arisen in regards to interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy, duality (the system of parallel French and English speaking public services), and specifics of implementation. The extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the New Brunswick news cycle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/01/31/new-brunswick-still-debating-language-issues-after-50-years-of-bilingualism.html|title=New Brunswick still debating language issues after 50 years of bilingualism {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/liberals-conservatives-bilingualism-controversy-1.3317523|title=Liberals, PCs show fissures over bilingualism controversy|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-05-05}}</ref> The French-speaking community continues to advocate for full funding of French-language public services and fair representation in public sector employment, while some Anglophones (and Francophones) fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile, or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government, as Anglophones are less likely than Francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment.\n\nThe province's bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law. The Canadian Constitution makes specific mention of New Brunswick's bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights (in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals, though this extends to \"community\" issues in terms of provision of schooling etc.). The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] has a number of New Brunswick specific articles and makes specific mention of New Brunswick in each section relating to language (ex. [[Section Eighteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 18]] has two paragraphs, the first regarding bilingual publication of the Canadian Parliaments work and laws, the second specifying that New Brunswick's legislature will publish its work in both French and English). Of particular interest is Article 16.1, which declares that the French and English speaking communities of New Brunswick have equal rights and privileges, including community specific educational and cultural institutions. This specific distinction of linguistic community is important in that it recognizes not only the rights of individuals to use their language, but also demands that the two official language communities have their specific institutions upheld.\n\nThe [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Canadian census]] showed a population of 751,171. Of the 731,855 single responses to the census question concerning mother tongue, the most commonly reported languages were:<ref name=\"www12.statcan.gc.ca\">[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=13&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&Data=Count&SearchText=new%20brunswick&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 Detailed Mother Tongue (186), Knowledge of Official Languages (5), Age Groups (17A) and Sex (3) (2011 Census)]</ref>\n\nNew Brunswick's official languages are shown in '''bold'''.

During the 19th century [[Scottish Gaelic]] was also spoken in the Campbellton and Dalhousie area. The language died out as a natively-spoken language in the province in the early 20th century.\n\nIn 2012, New Brunswick francophones scored lower on the [[Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies]] than their anglophone counterparts in New Brunswick.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/160919/dq160919a-eng.htm|title=Study: The literacy skills of New Brunswick francophones|last=|first=|date=2016-09-19|website=|publisher=Statistics Canada|access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref>\n[[File:Nouveau-Brunswick langues.PNG|thumb|Mother tongue in New Brunswick, Statistics Canada, 2006.

The provincial Department of Finance estimates that the province's population in 2006 was 729,997 of which the majority is English-speaking but with a substantial (27%) French-speaking minority of mostly [[Acadian]] origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/french-language-decline-new-brunswick-statistics-canada-1.5077193 |publisher=CBC |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nFirst Nations in New Brunswick include the Mi'kmaq and Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet). The first European settlers, the Acadians are descendants of French colonists of Acadia, a French colony in what is today Nova Scotia. The Acadians were expelled by the British (1755) for refusing to take an oath of allegiance to King George II which drove several thousand French residents into exile in North America, the UK and France  during the [[French and Indian War]]. American Acadians, who wound up in [[Louisiana]] and other parts of the American South, are often referred to as [[Cajuns]].\n\nMany of the English-Canadian population of New Brunswick are descended from Loyalists who fled the American Revolution. This is commemorated in the province's motto, ''Spem reduxit'' (\"hope was restored\"). There is also a significant population with [[Irish People|Irish]] ancestry, especially in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] and the Miramichi Valley. People of Scottish descent are scattered throughout the Province with higher concentrations in the Miramichi and in Campbellton. A small population of [[Denmark|Danish]] origin may be found in [[New Denmark, New Brunswick|New Denmark]] in the northwest of the province.\n\n==Population==\n\n===City Metropolitan Areas===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n!City\n!2011\n!2006\n!Land Area <small>km\u00b2</small>\n!Density <small>/km\u00b2</small>\n|-\n|[[Greater Moncton]] ||138,644||126,424||2,406.31||57.6\n|-\n|[[Greater Saint John]] ||127,761||122,389||3,362.95||38.0\n|-\n|[[Greater Fredericton]] ||94,268||85,688||4,886.40||19.3\n|-\n|[[Greater Bathurst, New Brunswick|Greater Bathurst]] ||33,484||34,106||2,292.80||14.6\n|-\n|[[Greater Miramichi, New Brunswick|Greater Miramichi]] ||28,115||28,773||7,578.30||3.7\n|-\n|[[Greater Edmundston]] ||21,903||22,471||916.85||23.9\n|-\n|[[Greater Campbellton, New Brunswick|Greater Campbellton]] ||17,842||17,878||1,629.94||10.9\n|}\n\n===Cities and towns===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

The province also has a relatively high proportion of people who state that they can speak both official languages, with about 246,000 people, or 33.2% of the population reporting the ability to speak both English and French (though Francophones make up two-thirds of those who are bilingual).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officiallanguages.nb.ca/sites/default/files/imce/pdfs/annual_report_2014-2015.pdf|title=2014\u20132015 Annual Report, Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages of New Brunswick|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|page=39|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nLanguage policy remains a perennial issue in New Brunswick society and politics. Recurring debates have arisen in regards to interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy, duality (the system of parallel French and English speaking public services), and specifics of implementation. The extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the New Brunswick news cycle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/01/31/new-brunswick-still-debating-language-issues-after-50-years-of-bilingualism.html|title=New Brunswick still debating language issues after 50 years of bilingualism {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/liberals-conservatives-bilingualism-controversy-1.3317523|title=Liberals, PCs show fissures over bilingualism controversy|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-05-05}}</ref> The French-speaking community continues to advocate for full funding of French-language public services and fair representation in public sector employment, while some Anglophones (and Francophones) fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile, or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to work for the government, as Anglophones are less likely than Francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment.\n\nThe province's bilingual status is enshrined in both provincial and federal law. The Canadian Constitution makes specific mention of New Brunswick's bilingual status and defines the spirit of implementation as one based on both community and individual rights (in contrast with the constitutional protections for the other provinces that is limited to individuals, though this extends to \"community\" issues in terms of provision of schooling etc.). The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] has a number of New Brunswick specific articles and makes specific mention of New Brunswick in each section relating to language (ex. [[Section Eighteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 18]] has two paragraphs, the first regarding bilingual publication of the Canadian Parliaments work and laws, the second specifying that New Brunswick's legislature will publish its work in both French and English). Of particular interest is Article 16.1, which declares that the French and English speaking communities of New Brunswick have equal rights and privileges, including community specific educational and cultural institutions. This specific distinction of linguistic community is important in that it recognizes not only the rights of individuals to use their language, but also demands that the two official language communities have their specific institutions upheld.\n\nThe [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Canadian census]] showed a population of 751,171. Of the 731,855 single responses to the census question concerning mother tongue, the most commonly reported languages were:<ref name=\"www12.statcan.gc.ca\">[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=13&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&Data=Count&SearchText=new%20brunswick&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 Detailed Mother Tongue (186), Knowledge of Official Languages (5), Age Groups (17A) and Sex (3) (2011 Census)]</ref>\n\nNew Brunswick's official languages are shown in '''bold'''.

During the 19th century [[Scottish Gaelic]] was also spoken in the Campbellton and Dalhousie area. The language died out as a natively-spoken language in the province in the early 20th century.\n\nIn 2012, New Brunswick francophones scored lower on the [[Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies]] than their anglophone counterparts in New Brunswick.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/160919/dq160919a-eng.htm|title=Study: The literacy skills of New Brunswick francophones|last=|first=|date=2016-09-19|website=|publisher=Statistics Canada|access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref>\n[[File:Nouveau-Brunswick langues.PNG|thumb|Mother tongue in New Brunswick, Statistics Canada, 2006.

His interest in the economic potential of the Carolina backcountry led to his involvement in the formation of the present-day town of [[Camden, South Carolina]]. Of particular value to historians are the ''William Ancrum Papers, 1757&ndash;1789'', which are made up of Ancrum's letters and personal account books, currently held by the South Caroliniana Library at the [[University of South Carolina]].<ref>http://library.sc.edu/digital/collections/ancrum.html</ref> This collection provides insight into the economic impact of the American Revolution on Charleston planters and merchants, from the prices of slaves to restrictions on imports and exports.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHe was born the oldest of five siblings in 1722 in [[Northumberland]], England.<ref>Charleston Courier, (Charleston, S.C.)

The success of this initial backcountry business led to the formation of at least two more stores, one on the Congaree River near present-day Columbia and another in the Cheraw area. They also owned a plantation called Liberty Hill on the Pee Dee River. This event has been viewed as the main impetus leading to the birth of the town of Camden, South Carolina. [[Kershaw County, South Carolina]] (of which Camden is the seat) was named for the two brothers.\n\n==Planter==\nIn addition to his mercantile pursuits, Ancrum also engaged rather extensively in planting. Independently, he received nearly 3,650 acres in land grants between 1763 and 1775. His two primary plantations were Red Bank and Hopewell, located adjacent to one another on the [[Wateree River]] about 7 miles south of present-day Camden, South Carolina. The main crop grown on these plantations was indigo, like most plantations in the area at that time. Ancrum was an absentee landowner, and much can be learned of his role in that capacity through the numerous letters written to his overseers, which are part of the ''William Ancrum Papers, 1757-1789''.\n\n==Political roles==\nWhen the citizens of South Carolina entered resolutions demanding their equal treatment as colonists in 1774, Ancrum was elected to serve as a representative for St. Matthew's Parish on the newly formed Committee of Ninety-Nine.<ref>The South Carolina Gazette and Country Journal, July 12, 1774.</ref> From 1779 to 1780 he was elected to serve as a Representative for the District Eastward of the Wateree in the Third General Assembly.<ref>The Gazette of the State of South Carolina, December 8, 1779.</ref> In May 1780, when Charleston fell under British control, Ancrum signed a congratulatory address to [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]], an act which subsequently resulted in his being designated a Loyalist. This, in conjunction with his service to the Crown on a committee to evaluate paper currency each month, led to his property being confiscated and his banishment from Charleston.<ref name=\"LouiseBailey\" /> While in London, Ancrum successfully petitioned the South Carolina State Legislature to lift the confiscation order and grant him twelve percent amercement.

It consists of [[List of MAX Light Rail stations|94 stations]] over a {{convert|59.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} network and is served by five lines, each of which is designated by a color. The system connects the north, northeast, and southeast [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|sections]] of Portland; the suburban communities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]; and [[Portland International Airport]] to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]]. MAX is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|fourth-busiest light rail system]] in the United States after comparable light rail services in [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], and [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The system had an average daily ridership of 120,900 and nearly 39 million annual riders in 2019. Lines run seven days a week with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during [[rush hour]]s.\n\nMAX was among the first [[Light rail in the United States#Second-generation systems|second-generation]] American light rail systems to be built. It was conceived as a result of [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] that took place in Portland in the early 1970s. Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks.

a [[light rail]] system in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States, that is owned and operated by [[TriMet]]. It consists of [[List of MAX Light Rail stations|94 stations]] over a {{convert|59.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} network and is served by five lines, each of which is designated by a color. The system connects the north, northeast, and southeast [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|sections]] of Portland; the suburban communities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]; and [[Portland International Airport]] to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]]. MAX is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|fourth-busiest light rail system]] in the United States after comparable light rail services in [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], and [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The system had an average daily ridership of 120,900 and nearly 39 million annual riders in 2019. Lines run seven days a week with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during [[rush hour]]s.\n\nMAX was among the first [[Light rail in the United States#Second-generation systems|second-generation]] American light rail systems to be built. It was conceived as a result of [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] that took place in Portland in the early 1970s. Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks. Fares are charged at a flat rate and are mainly collected through the [[Hop Fastpass]] payment system.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{see also|Oregon Electric Railway}}\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|right|An [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] train seen in Beaverton]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, privately funded [[interurban]] railways gave Portland one of the largest urban rail systems in the [[Western United States|American West]], including lines that once extended from [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]] to [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]] to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].<ref name=\"Selinger\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |oclc=919377348 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}<ref name=\"thompson2010\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Richard M. |date=2010 |title=Portland's Streetcar Lines |pages=7\u20138 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7385-8126-2 |access-date=March 12, 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCD1zjOPXvMC&pg=PA71}}</ref> [[Ben Holladay]] brought over Portland's first [[tram|trolley]]s from [[San Francisco]]; they were introduced in 1872 and were initially drawn by horses and mules.
