Though the habitat plays a large part in a plant's growth and development, the inland pigface can grow in acidic, basic, and neutral soil [[pH]]s that are well-drained. In these tough environments, the Inland Pigface can tolerate harsh habitual influences such as droughts, frost, and salinity in the soil (since it can grow in coastal areas which are close to the ocean). The Inland Pigface is perennial and flowers during the southern summer and winter.<ref name=\"Plant Selector\">{{cite web|url=http://plantselector.botanicgardens.sa.gov.au/Plants/Details/730|title=Carpobrotus modestus|publisher= Botanic Gardens of South Australia|website=plantselector.botanicgardens.sa.gov.au|accessdate=14 March 2020}}}</ref> \n\nIn a study done testing the effects of severe drought on the growth, water usage, and survival of several plants, including the Carprobrotus Modestus, it was shown that high water use by Carpobrotus Modestus resulted in reduced survival relative to the other plants tested.

''Carpobrotus modestus'' has thick fleshy leaves since it is a perennial succulent. Leaves are usually around 3\u20137&nbsp;cm and curve in a triangular shape towards the tip. Near the points of the leaves are usually tinted pink, but occasionally have a bluish hue to it. The flowers are open-petalled once they bloom outwards in a linear direction. The petals are purple and are almost shaped like sunflower petals, but much narrower. These petals surround the stamen scattered inside which are thin, light yellow, and shaped like the letter 'T'.<ref name=\"Agriculture Victoria\"/> Species contain both male and female reproductive organs (hermaphrodite.) <ref name=\"Plants for a Future\">{{cite web|url=https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Carpobrotus+modestus|title=Carpobrotus Modestus- S.T.

A prostrate plant has stems that grow parallel to the soil, so the surface of the plant appears to be flat and sprawling. The growth of ''Carpobrotus modestus'' gives the appearance of a form of flat \u201ccover\u201d on the ground. \n\nIn the fruiting stage of ''Carpobrotus modestus'', the bulb is surrounded by the thick three-edged leaves that surround it. The fruit is egg-shaped, and as it develops, pushes the thick leaves outwards and has petals sprout out of it.<ref name=\"Agriculture Victoria\"/>\n\nThe Carpobrotus Modestus is an Australian succulent that switches between CAM and C3 photosynthesis. When soil water is limited, the plant uses CAM photosynthesis with dark CO2 fixation and switches to C3 photosynthesis when water is available again. \n<ref name=\"Green Roof\u201d>{{cite journal|last1= Farrell|first1= C|last2=Mitchell|first2= R.E.|last3= Szota|first3= C|date=10 August 2012|title=Green roofs for hot and dry climates: Interacting effects of plant water use, succulence and substrate |url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925857412002960<path>|journal= Ecological Engineering|volume= 49|issue=December|pages=270-276|doi= 10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.08.036|access-date= 5 April 2020}}}</ref>\n\n==Flowers and fruit==\nThe flowers of ''Carpobrotus modestus'' grow to be about {{convert|2|cm|0}} when they are fully open.

The film received positive reviews from critics, receiving praise for its acting, direction, screenplay, score, and production merits; but it was also criticized by some critics for being \"over-sentimental\" and \"stereotypical.\" The film was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], without winning any; it also received four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, with [[Whoopi Goldberg]] winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress in a Drama]]. Steven Spielberg didn't receive an Academy Award nomination for his directing, but did receive a [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film|Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement]], and a Golden Globe nomination. The film was later included in [[Roger Ebert]]'s book series ''[[The Great Movies]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1909, Celie is an [[African Americans|African-American]] girl in rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] who has had two children by her abusive father, both of whom have been taken from her. Her father then gives her away as a wife to widower Albert \"Mister\" Johnson, who already has three children and who also abuses Celie and the children treat her badly. Celie's younger sister, Nettie, the only person who loves her, runs away from home when their father starts abusing her and seeks shelter at Celie and Mister's home. The sisters promise to write each other should they ever be separated. Nettie teaches Celie to read and the two are happy together until Mister tries to rape Nettie while on her way to school. She successfully fights him off and is forcibly removed by him from the property.\n\nSeven years later, Celie is now a meek adult who has avoided standing up to Mister's continued abuse. His eldest son, Harpo, marries his pregnant girlfriend, Sofia, a strong-willed, boisterous woman, and Celie is shocked to find her running a matriarchal household. On Mister's advice, Harpo attempts to overpower and strike Sofia in an attempt to better control her. After he fails, he asks Celie what to do. Confronted with her own inability to stand up to abuse, she also advises Harpo to start beating Sofia. Sofia forcefully retaliates and confronts Celie about what she told Harpo. She also reveals she has had to fight off abuse from all the men in her family. She threatens to kill Harpo if he beats her again and tells Celie to do likewise to Mister. After Harpo doesn't change his ways, Sofia leaves him, taking their children with her.\n\nMister and Harpo bring home Shug Avery, a [[showgirl]] and the former's long-time [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], as she suffers from an unknown illness. Celie, who has slowly developed a fondness for Shug through a photograph sent to Mister, is in awe of Shug's strong will and ability to stand up to Mister. She nurses Shug back to health over the next six years, and Shug in turn takes a liking to her, writing and performing a song about her at Harpo's newly opened bar. That night, Shug tells Celie she's moving to Memphis, and Celie confesses to Shug that Mister beats her when Shug isn't there for not being her. Shug tells Celie she's beautiful and that she loves her, and the two women kiss. Celie decides to follow Shug to Memphis, but gets caught by Mister while she's frantically packing her things.\n\nMeanwhile, Sofia has been imprisoned for striking the town's mayor after he assaults her. Years pass, and she, now a shell of her former self, is released from prison{{snd}}only to be immediately ordered by the judge to become a maid to the mayor's wife, Ms. Millie. Having not seen her children in eight years, Sofia is allotted Christmas to be with her family. As Ms. Millie tries to drive home, she panics after encountering a group of Sofia's friends trying to help her, ordering Sofia to help her drive home before Sofia can spend any time with her children.\n\nShug returns to Celie and Mister's home with her new husband, Grady, expecting to receive a [[recording contract]]. Shug gives Celie a letter from Nettie, who tells her that she's working for a couple that has adopted Celie's children. Celie and Shug realize that Mister has been hiding Nettie's letters from Celie; while he and Grady are out drinking, the two search the house and find a hidden compartment under the floor boards filled with dozens and dozens of Nettie's letters. Engrossed in reading, Celie does not hear Mister's calls to shave him and he beats her. Celie attempts to kill Mister with a straight razor, but Shug intervenes and stops her. At a family gathering, Celie finally speaks up against Mister to the delight of Shug and Sofia, who finds her old fighting spirit, which prompts Harpo's new wife, Squeak, to stand up for herself as well. Shug and Grady drive away, taking Celie and Squeak with them.\n\nYears later, Celie owns and operates a [[Tailor|tailor shop]]. Mister is old, a drunk, and alone, and Harpo has made amends with Sofia; the two now run the bar together, and Shug still performs there. Celie's father passes away, and she finally learns from Nettie's letters that he wasn't their biological father and that when their mother passed, \"his\" property was legally inherited by Celie and Nettie. Mister receives a letter from Nettie addressed to Celie, takes money from his secret stash, and arranges for Nettie, her husband, and Celie's children to return to the U.S., where they finally reunite while Mister watches from a distance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Mister\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Celie\n** [[Desreta Jackson]] as Young Celie\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]] as Sofia\n* [[Margaret Avery]] as Shug Avery\n** [[T\u00e1ta Vega]] as Shug's singing voice\n* [[Akosua Busia]] as Nettie\n* [[Adolph Caesar]] as Old Mister, Mister's father\n* [[Willard E.

Some parts of it are rapturous and stirring, others hugely improbable, and the film moves unpredictably from one mode to another. From another director, this might be fatally confusing, but Mr. Spielberg's showmanship is still with him. Although the combination of his sensibilities and Miss Walker's amounts to a colossal mismatch, Mr. Spielberg's ''Color Purple'' manages to have momentum, warmth and staying power all the same.<ref>{{cite news| author=Maslin, Janet| title=Film: 'The Color Purple,' from Steven Spielberg| date=December 18, 1985| newspaper=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/spielberg-color.html| accessdate=2010-10-29}}</ref>}}\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' found the film over-sentimental, writing, \"there are some great scenes and great performances in ''The Color Purple'', but it is not a great film.

That was the main criticism. The other criticism was that I had softened the book. I have always copped to that. I made the movie I wanted to make from Alice Walker's book. There were certain things in the [lesbian] relationship between Shug Avery and Celie that were finely detailed in Alice's book, that I didn't feel could get a [PG-13] rating. And I was shy about it.

The film received positive reviews from critics, receiving praise for its acting, direction, screenplay, score, and production merits; but it was also criticized by some critics for being \"over-sentimental\" and \"stereotypical.\" The film was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], without winning any; it also received four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, with [[Whoopi Goldberg]] winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress in a Drama]]. Steven Spielberg didn't receive an Academy Award nomination for his directing, but did receive a [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film|Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement]], and a Golden Globe nomination. The film was later included in [[Roger Ebert]]'s book series ''[[The Great Movies]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1909, Celie is an [[African Americans|African-American]] girl in rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] who has had two children by her abusive father, both of whom have been taken from her. Her father then gives her away as a wife to widower Albert \"Mister\" Johnson, who already has three children and who also abuses Celie and the children treat her badly. Celie's younger sister, Nettie, the only person who loves her, runs away from home when their father starts abusing her and seeks shelter at Celie and Mister's home. The sisters promise to write each other should they ever be separated. Nettie teaches Celie to read and the two are happy together until Mister tries to rape Nettie while on her way to school. She successfully fights him off and is forcibly removed by him from the property.\n\nSeven years later, Celie is now a meek adult who has avoided standing up to Mister's continued abuse. His eldest son, Harpo, marries his pregnant girlfriend, Sofia, a strong-willed, boisterous woman, and Celie is shocked to find her running a matriarchal household. On Mister's advice, Harpo attempts to overpower and strike Sofia in an attempt to better control her. After he fails, he asks Celie what to do. Confronted with her own inability to stand up to abuse, she also advises Harpo to start beating Sofia. Sofia forcefully retaliates and confronts Celie about what she told Harpo. She also reveals she has had to fight off abuse from all the men in her family. She threatens to kill Harpo if he beats her again and tells Celie to do likewise to Mister. After Harpo doesn't change his ways, Sofia leaves him, taking their children with her.\n\nMister and Harpo bring home Shug Avery, a [[showgirl]] and the former's long-time [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], as she suffers from an unknown illness. Celie, who has slowly developed a fondness for Shug through a photograph sent to Mister, is in awe of Shug's strong will and ability to stand up to Mister. She nurses Shug back to health over the next six years, and Shug in turn takes a liking to her, writing and performing a song about her at Harpo's newly opened bar. That night, Shug tells Celie she's moving to Memphis, and Celie confesses to Shug that Mister beats her when Shug isn't there for not being her. Shug tells Celie she's beautiful and that she loves her, and the two women kiss. Celie decides to follow Shug to Memphis, but gets caught by Mister while she's frantically packing her things.\n\nMeanwhile, Sofia has been imprisoned for striking the town's mayor after he assaults her. Years pass, and she, now a shell of her former self, is released from prison{{snd}}only to be immediately ordered by the judge to become a maid to the mayor's wife, Ms. Millie. Having not seen her children in eight years, Sofia is allotted Christmas to be with her family, and Ms. Millie tries to drive her but panics and turns around after encountering a group of Sofia's friends, who were only trying to help her.\n\nShug returns to Celie and Mister's home with her new husband, Grady, expecting to receive a [[recording contract]]. Shug gives Celie a letter from Nettie, who tells her that she's working for a couple that has adopted Celie's children. Celie and Shug realize that Mister has been hiding Nettie's letters from Celie; while he and Grady are out drinking, the two search the house and find a hidden compartment under the floor boards filled with dozens and dozens of Nettie's letters. Engrossed in reading, Celie does not hear Mister's calls to shave him and he beats her. Celie attempts to kill Mister with a straight razor, but Shug intervenes and stops her. At a family gathering, Celie finally speaks up against Mister to the delight of Shug and Sofia, who finds her old fighting spirit, which prompts Harpo's new wife, Squeak, to stand up for herself as well. Shug and Grady drive away, taking Celie and Squeak with them.\n\nYears later, Celie owns and operates a [[Tailor|tailor shop]]. Mister is old, a drunk, and alone, and Harpo has made amends with Sofia; the two now run the bar together, and Shug still performs there. Celie's father passes away, and she finally learns from Nettie's letters that he wasn't their biological father and that when their mother passed, \"his\" property was legally inherited by Celie and Nettie. Mister receives a letter from Nettie addressed to Celie, takes money from his secret stash, and arranges for Nettie, her husband, and Celie's children to return to the U.S., where they finally reunite while Mister watches from a distance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Mister\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Celie\n** [[Desreta Jackson]] as Young Celie\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]] as Sofia\n* [[Margaret Avery]] as Shug Avery\n** [[T\u00e1ta Vega]] as Shug's singing voice\n* [[Akosua Busia]] as Nettie\n* [[Adolph Caesar]] as Old Mister, Mister's father\n* [[Willard E.

Some parts of it are rapturous and stirring, others hugely improbable, and the film moves unpredictably from one mode to another. From another director, this might be fatally confusing, but Mr. Spielberg's showmanship is still with him.

Presently, the organisation has branch centres all over India, and in Sri Lanka and Australia.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/centers.php</ref>\n\nThe main aim of the organisation is to fulfil the mission of Swami Vivekananda, that is \u2018Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva\u2019 serving God in Man, irrespective of caste, creed and nationality as well as the upliftment and empowerment of women.<ref>http://srisaradamathrb.org/our-origin/</ref><ref>''Echoes of Vedanta in the far East'' (Ramakrishna Sarada Vedanta Societty of New South Wales: Australia, 1994), p.i)</ref>\n\nThe organisation mainly propagates the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta\u2013Advaita Vedanta and four yogic ideals\u2013jnana, bhakti, karma, and Raja Yoga.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nApart from religious and spiritual teaching the organisation carries out extensive educational and philanthropic work in India. This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sri-Sarada-Math</ref>\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref> But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math's emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen.\n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.130</ref>\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973).<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref><ref>Bengali newspaper, ''Ananda Bazar Patrika'' on 31 January 1973</ref> Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]].

[[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women's Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\n\"Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive...[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi]]s be born into the world... Hence it is her Math that I want first... Without the grace of [[Shakti]] nothing is to be accomplished....

He has witnessed some outstanding women of renunciation among the women disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] such as [[Gauri Ma]], [[Yogin Ma]], and [[Golap Ma]]. He wanted them to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna through an organisation.<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.112</ref>\n\nIncidently, [[Sri Sarada Devi]] too, cherished the dream to start a monastery for women. This came to light from the letters of [[Swami Saradananda]] written to [[Sara Bull]], '[[Sister Nivedita]] and myself have found out by talking to Mother that she would like to see a convent started in the fashion of the Math, Belur, for women. Miss Glen who was here to visit the Holy Mother... also had a talk with Mother about it, and is very sanguine about the work.'<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.126</ref>\n\n== Activities ==\n6 November 1981, the stone temple was consecrated as per the Hindu tradition. Daily ritual worships are performed here by the nuns. The birthdays of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, and other holy personalities are celebrated here, besides the Hindu festivals.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vMMN2iqrag</ref> Religious discourse and lectures are also done regularly.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/mathhq.php</ref>\n\nThe training of brahmacharinis and novices are an essential activity of the Sri Sarada Math.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.302</ref>\n\nSri Sarada Math also has some prominent speakers on Vedanta and Hinduism who have been travelling the various parts of the world to deliver lectures, talks, and discourses. To name a few, Pravrajika Ajayaprana Mataji, Pravrajika Divyanandaprana<ref>http://vedantadc.org/sri-ramakrishna-and-vedanta-pravrajika-divyanandaprana</ref>, are some well-known nuns of Sri Sarada Math.\n\n== Publication ==\n''Nibodhata'', is the Bengali journal published every two months.

Presently, the organisation has branch centres all over India, and in Sri Lanka and Australia.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/centers.php</ref>\n\nThe main aim of the organisation is to fulfil the mission of Swami Vivekananda, that is \u2018Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva\u2019 serving God in Man, irrespective of caste, creed and nationality as well as the upliftment and empowerment of women.<ref>http://srisaradamathrb.org/our-origin/</ref><ref>''Echoes of Vedanta in the far East'' (Ramakrishna Sarada Vedanta Societty of New South Wales: Australia, 1994), p.i)</ref>\n\nThe organisation mainly propagates the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta\u2013Advaita Vedanta and four yogic ideals\u2013jnana, bhakti, karma, and Raja Yoga.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nApart from religious and spiritual teaching the organisation carries out extensive educational and philanthropic work in India. This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sri-Sarada-Math</ref>\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref> But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math's emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen.\n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.130</ref>\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973).<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref><ref>Bengali newspaper, ''Ananda Bazar Patrika'' on 31 January 1973</ref> Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]].

[[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women's Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\n\"Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive...[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi]]s be born into the world...

He has witnessed some outstanding women of renunciation among the women disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] such as [[Gauri Ma]], [[Yogin Ma]], and [[Golap Ma]]. He wanted them to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna through an organisation.<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.112</ref>\n\nIncidently, [[Sri Sarada Devi]] too, cherished the dream to start a monastery for women. This came to light from the letters of [[Swami Saradananda]] written to [[Sara Bull]], '[[Sister Nivedita]] and myself have found out by talking to Mother that she would like to see a convent started in the fashion of the Math, Belur, for women. Miss Glen who was here to visit the Holy Mother... also had a talk with Mother about it, and is very sanguine about the work.'<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.126</ref>\n\n== Activities ==\n6 November 1981, the stone temple was consecrated as per the Hindu tradition.

In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.
