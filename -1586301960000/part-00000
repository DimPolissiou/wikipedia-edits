Leading themes include the political takeover in 1933 of Germany by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], which ruthlessly promoted an aggressive foreign policy in violation of the Versailles Treaty of 1919, [[Japanese militarism]] against China, Italian aggression against Ethiopia, and the success of Germany in forming an agreement with the Soviet Union in August 1939 to divide up Eastern Europe. The immediate precipitating event was [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invading Poland]] on September 1, 1939, and Britain and France declaring war on Germany on September 3, 1939.\n\nDeep anger arose in [[Weimar Germany]] that experienced strong currents of [[revanchism]] after the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that punished Germany for causing [[World War I]] in 1918. Complaints focused on the [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarization]] of Germany's [[Rhineland]], the prohibition of unification with Austria, and the loss of some German-speaking territories. The loss of overseas colonies was a less prominent issue. Germans said they had endorsed  Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]] in good faith, but the points were ignored. Versailles imposed severe conditions to prevent Germany from ever becoming a military power again, as well as heavy financial [[World War I reparations|reparations]].  Resentment and hatred of other countries was intensified by the instability of the German political system, as many activists rejected the legitimacy of the Weimar Republic. The most extreme politician was  [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Adolf Hitler]] and his violent Nazi party. They [[Machtergreifung|took totalitarian power in Germany starting in 1933]] and demanded the undoing of the Versailles provisions. The ambitious and aggressive foreign policy reflected Nazi ideology, such as: [[Anti-Semitism]], [[pan-germanism|unification of all Germans]], the acquisition of \"living space\" ([[Lebensraum]]) for agrarian settlers ([[Blut und Boden]]), creating a \"pull towards the East\" ([[Drang nach Osten]]) (that is, Poland and Russia), the elimination of [[Bolshevism]], and the hegemony of an \"[[Aryan race|Aryan]]\"/\"[[Nordic race|Nordic]]\" [[Master Race]] over the \"sub-humans\" ([[Untermensch]]en) of [[Jews]] and [[Slavs]].\n\nOther factors leading to the war included aggression by Italy against Ethiopia and Albania, the Japanese aggression and seizure of most of China and the Axis alliance formed by Germany, Japan and Italy. The 1930s were a decade in which democracy was in disrepute; countries across the world turned to authoritarian regimes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Dahl|title=Democracy and Its Critics|url=https://archive.org/details/democracyitscrit00dahl_0|url-access=registration|year=1989|publisher=Yale UP|pages=[https://archive.org/details/democracyitscrit00dahl_0/page/239 239]\u201340|isbn=0300153554}}</ref>\n\nThese aggressive moves met only feeble and ineffectual [[appeasement|policies of appeasement]] from Britain and France. The League of Nations proved helpless regarding China and Ethiopia.  A decisive event was the 1938 [[Munich Conference]] which formally approved Germany's annexation of the Sudeten region from Czechoslovakia.  Hitler promised it was his last claim, but in early 1939 he became even more aggressive, as the British and French finally realized that appeasement was not guaranteeing peace. Britain and France badly fumbled diplomatic efforts to form a military alliance with the Soviet Union. Instead Hitler offered Stalin a better deal in the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Expansionism==\n\n[[Expansionism]] is the doctrine of expanding the territorial base (or economic influence) of a country, usually by means of military aggression. In Europe, Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]] sought to create a [[New Roman Empire]] based around the Mediterranean. It invaded [[Albania]] in early 1938, at the start of the war, and later invaded [[Greece]]. Italy had also invaded [[Ethiopia]] as early as 1935. This provoked angry words and an oil embargo from the [[League of Nations]], which failed.\n\nUnder the Nazi regime, Germany began its own program of expansion, seeking to restore the \"rightful\" boundaries of historic Germany. As a prelude toward these goals the [[Rhineland]] was [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized in March 1936]].<ref>{{cite web|title=World War 2 Causes|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/causes_world_war_two.htm|publisher=History Learning Site|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlso of importance was the idea of a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]], supporters of which hoped to unite the [[German people]] under one nation state, which included all territories where Germans lived, regardless of whether they happened to be a minority in a particular territory. After the [[Treaty of Versailles]], a unification between Germany and a newly formed [[German-Austria]], a successor [[rump state]] of [[Austria-Hungary]], was prohibited by the Allies despite the majority of [[Austrians|Austrian Germans]] supporting such a union.\n\n[[File:First pictures of the Japanese occupation of Peiping in China.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese march into [[Zhengyangmen]] of [[Beijing]] after capturing the city in July 1937]]\nIn Asia, the [[Empire of Japan]] harbored expansionist desires towards [[Manchuria]] and the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].\n\n==Militarism==\n  \n{{Further|Militarism|Italian irredentism|Weimar Republic|Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|Japanese militarism|}}\n[[Militarism]] is the principle or policy of maintaining a strong [[military]] capability to use aggressively to expand national interests and/or values, with the view that military efficiency is the supreme ideal of a state.<ref>{{Cite web|title = the definition of militarism|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/militarism|website = Dictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> A highly militaristic and aggressive national ideology prevailed in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Italy]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Bruno Coppieters|author2=N.

The leaders of countries that have been militarized often feel a need to prove that their armies are important and formidable, and this was often a contributing factor in the start of conflicts in the [[interwar period]] such as the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2129.html|title=Japanese history: Militarism and World War II|website=www.japan-guide.com|accessdate=2015-05-30}}</ref>\n\nDuring the period of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919\u20131933), the [[Kapp Putsch]], an attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the republican government, was launched by disaffected members of the armed forces. After this event, some of the more radical militarists and nationalists were submerged in grief and despair into the [[NSDAP]], while more moderate elements of militarism declined. The result was an influx of militarily-inclined men into the Nazi Party which, when combined with their racial theories, fueled [[Irredentism|irredentist]] sentiments and put Germany on a collision course for war with its immediate neighbors.\n\nTwo contemporaneous factors in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] contributed both to the growing power of its military and chaos within its ranks leading up to the Second World War. One was the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] Law, which required the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) to nominate cabinet members before changes could be formed. This essentially gave the military veto power over the formation of any Cabinet in the ostensibly parliamentary country. Another factor was ''[[gekokuj\u014d]]'', or institutionalized [[Insubordination|disobedience]] by junior officers. It was not uncommon for radical junior officers to press their goals, to the extent of assassinating their seniors. In 1936, this phenomenon resulted in the [[February 26 Incident]], in which junior officers attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and killed leading members of the Japanese government. In the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] wrecked Japan's economy and gave radical elements within the Japanese military the chance to force the entire military into working towards the conquest of all of Asia. For example, in 1931 the [[Kwantung Army]] (a Japanese military force stationed in [[Manchuria]]) staged the [[Mukden Incident]], which sparked the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Invasion of Manchuria]] and its transformation into the Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].\n\n==Germans vs Slavs==\n\n{{Further|Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Lebensraum|Drang nach Osten}}\nTwentieth-century events marked the culmination of a millennium-long process of intermingling between Germans and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. The rise of nationalism in the 19th century made race a centerpiece of political loyalty. The rise of the nation-state had given way to the politics of identity, including [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Pan-Slavism]]. Furthermore, [[Social Darwinism|Social-Darwinist]] theories framed the coexistence as a \"Teuton vs. Slav\" struggle for domination, land and limited resources.<ref>Andreas Wimmer, ''Waves of War: Nationalism, State Formation, and Ethnic Exclusion in the Modern World'' (2012)</ref> Integrating these ideas into their own world-view, the Nazis believed that the Germans, the \"[[Aryan race]]\", were the [[master race]] and that the Slavs were inferior.<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]], ''The Third Reich: A New History'' (2001)</ref>\n\n==Interrelations and economics==\n\n===Problems with the Treaty of Versailles===\n{{Further|Treaty of Versailles}}\n[[File:German losses after WWI.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Germany after Versailles\n----\n{{legend|#ddefd0|Administered by the [[League of Nations]]}}\n{{legend|#ffffcf|Annexed or transferred to neighboring countries by the treaty, or later via plebiscite and League of Nation action}}\n{{legend|#f6d3a9|[[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]}}]]\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]] was neither lenient enough to appease [[Germany]], nor harsh enough to prevent it from becoming the dominant continental power again.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The National Archives Learning Curve {{!}} The Great War {{!}} Making peace {{!}} Reaction to the Treaty of Versailles {{!}} Background|url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/greatwar/g5/cs2/background.htm|website = www.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> Germans largely saw the treaty place the blame, or \"[[War Guilt Clause|war guilt]]\", on Germany and Austria-Hungary and punish them for their \"responsibility\" rather than working out an agreement that would assure long-term peace. The treaty provided for harsh monetary [[World War I reparations|reparations]], separated millions of ethnic Germans into neighboring countries, [[Territorial changes of Germany|territorial dismemberment]], and caused mass ethnic resettlement. In an effort to pay war reparations to Britain and France, the [[Weimar Republic]] printed trillions of marks, causing extremely high [[inflation]] of the German currency (see [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]]).\n\nThe treaty created bitter resentment towards the victors of World War I, who had promised the people of Germany that U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Wilson's Fourteen Points|Fourteen Points]] would be a guideline for peace; however, the US played a minor role in World War I and Wilson could not convince the Allies to agree to adopt his Fourteen Points. Many Germans felt that the German government had agreed to an [[armistice]] based on this understanding, while others felt that the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]] had been orchestrated by the \"November criminals\" who later assumed office in the new Weimar Republic.\n\nThe [[German colonial empire|German colonies]] were taken during the war, and Italy took the [[South Tyrol|southern half]] of [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] after an armistice had been agreed upon. The [[Eastern Front (World War I)|war in the east]] ended with the defeat and collapse of the [[Russian Empire]], and German troops [[Ober Ost|occupied]] large parts of Eastern and Central Europe (with varying degree of control), establishing various client states such as a [[Kingdom of Poland (1916-1918)|kingdom of Poland]] and the [[United Baltic Duchy]]. After the destructive and indecisive [[battle of Jutland]] (1916) and the mutiny of its sailors in 1917, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] spent most of the war in port, only to be turned over to the allies and scuttled at surrender by its own officers. The lack of an obvious military defeat was one of the pillars that held together the ''[[Dolchstosslegende]]'' (\"Stab-in-the-back myth\") and gave the Nazis another propaganda tool at their disposal.\n\n===French security demands===\nFrench security demands, such as reparations, coal payments, and a demilitarized Rhineland, took precedence at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and shaped the Treaty of Versailles by severely punishing Germany; however, Austria found the treaty to be unjust which encouraged Hitler's popularity.  Ginsberg argues, \"France was greatly weakened and, in its weakness and fear of a resurgent Germany, sought to isolate and punish Germany....French revenge would come back to haunt France during the Nazi invasion and occupation twenty years later.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Roy H.

The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding century.

Under the new philosophy, the League was a government of governments, with the role of settling disputes between individual nations in an open and legalist forum.

Mason had contended that a \"flight into war\" had been imposed on [[Adolf Hitler]] by a structural economic crisis, which confronted Hitler with the choice of making difficult economic decisions or aggression. Overy argued against Mason's thesis, maintaining that though Germany was faced with economic problems in 1939, the extent of these problems cannot explain aggression against [[Poland]] and the reasons for the outbreak of war were due to the choices made by the Nazi leadership.\n\nMason had argued that the German working-class was always  to the Nazi dictatorship; that in the over-heated German economy of the late 1930s, German workers could force employers to grant higher wages by leaving for another firm that would grant the desired wage increases; that this was a form of political resistance and this resistance forced [[Adolf Hitler]] to go to war in 1939.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\">Perry, Matt \"Mason, Timothy\" pages&nbsp;780\u2013781 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians

by a rearmament program that was overwhelming the economy and in which the Nazi regime's nationalist bluster limited its options.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\"/> In this way, Mason articulated a ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' (\"primacy of domestic politics\")  view of World War II's origins through the concept of [[social imperialism]].<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages&nbsp;6\u20137</ref> Mason's ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' thesis was in marked contrast to the ''Primat der Au\u00dfenpolitik'' (\"primacy of foreign politics) usually used to explain World War II.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\"/> In Mason's opinion, German foreign policy was driven by domestic political considerations, and the launch of World War II in 1939 was best understood as a \"barbaric variant of social imperialism\".<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 7</ref>\n\nMason argued that \"Nazi Germany was always bent ''at some time'' upon a major war of expansion.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated165\">Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 165</ref> However, Mason argued that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy, and had nothing to do with what Hitler wanted.<ref name=\"autogenerated165\"/> In Mason's view in the period between 1936\u201341, it was the state of the German economy, and not Hitler's 'will' or 'intentions' that was the most important determinate on German decision-making on foreign policy.<ref name=\"autogenerated88\">Kershaw, Ian'' The Nazi Dictatorship'' London : Arnold 2000 page 88.</ref> Mason argued that the Nazi leaders were deeply haunted by the November Revolution of 1918, and was most unwilling to see any fall in working class living standards out of the fear that it might provoke another November Revolution.<ref name=\"autogenerated88\"/> According to Mason, by 1939, the \"overheating\" of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and the sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\">Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages&nbsp;165\u2013166</ref> Mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless 'smash and grab' foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany.<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 166</ref> Mason described German foreign policy as driven by an opportunistic 'next victim' syndrome after the ''[[Anschluss]]'', in which the \"promiscuity of

No fighting occurred as most Austrians were enthusiastic, and Austria was fully absorbed as part of Germany. Outside powers did nothing.

Its more than 3 million ethnic Germans comprised almost a quarter of the population of Czechoslovakia. In the [[Treaty of Versailles]] it was given to the new Czechoslovak state against the wishes of much of the local population.

However its defensive strategy against Germany was based on the mountains of the Sudetenland.\n\nHitler pressed for the Sudetenland's incorporation into the Reich, supporting German separatist groups within the Sudeten region. Alleged Czech brutality and persecution under Prague helped to stir up nationalist tendencies, as did the Nazi press. After the Anschluss, all German parties (except the German Social-Democratic party) merged with the [[Sudeten German Party]] (SdP). Paramilitary activity and extremist violence peaked during this period and the Czechoslovakian government declared martial law in parts of the Sudetenland to maintain order. This only complicated the situation, especially now that Slovakian nationalism was rising, out of suspicion towards Prague and Nazi encouragement. Citing the need to protect the Germans in Czechoslovakia, Germany requested the immediate annexation of the Sudetenland.\n\nIn the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 30, 1938, British, French and Italian prime ministers appeased Hitler by giving him what he wanted, hoping he would not want any more. The conferring powers allowed Germany to move troops into the region and incorporate it into the Reich \"for the sake of peace.\" In exchange for this, Hitler gave his word that Germany would make no further territorial claims in Europe.<ref>[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~pv/munich/czdoc09.html Chamberlain's radio broadcast] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607043817/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~pv/munich/czdoc09.html# |date=2007-06-07 }}, 27 September 1938</ref> Czechoslovakia was not allowed to participate in the conference.

The entire ordeal was the last show of the French and British policy of appeasement.\n\n===Italian invasion of Albania===\n{{Further|Italian invasion of Albania}}\nAfter the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, [[Benito Mussolini]] feared for Italy becoming a second-rate member of the Axis. Rome delivered Tirana an ultimatum on March 25, 1939, demanding that it accede to Italy's occupation of Albania. [[King Zog]] refused to accept money in exchange for countenancing a full Italian takeover and colonization of Albania. On April 7, 1939, Italian troops invaded Albania. Albania was occupied after a 3 days campaign with minimal resistance offered by the Albanian forces.\n\n===Soviet\u2013Japanese Border War===\n{{Further|Battle of Khalkhin Gol}}\nIn 1939, the Japanese attacked west from Manchuria into the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], following the earlier [[Battle of Lake Khasan]] in 1938. They were decisively beaten by Soviet units under General [[Georgy Zhukov]]. Following this battle, the Soviet Union and Japan were at peace until 1945. Japan looked south to expand its empire, leading to conflict with the United States over the Philippines and control of shipping lanes to the Dutch East Indies. The Soviet Union focused on her western border, but leaving 1 million to 1.5 million troops to guard the frontier with Japan.\n\n===Danzig crisis===\n[[File:Polish Corridor.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Polish Corridor]] and the [[Free City of Danzig (interwar)|Free City of Danzig]]]]\n{{Further|Free City of Danzig (interwar)|Polish Corridor}}\n\nAfter the final fate of Czechoslovakia proved that the F\u00fchrer's word could not be trusted, Britain and France decided on a change of strategy. They decided any further unilateral German expansion would be met by force. The natural next target for the Third Reich's further expansion was Poland, whose [[Polish Corridor|access to the Baltic sea]] had been carved out of [[West Prussia]] by the Versailles treaty, making [[East Prussia]] an [[exclave]]. The main port of the area, [[Danzig]], had been made [[Free City of Danzig (interwar)|a free city-state]] under Polish influence guaranteed by the League of Nations, a stark reminder to German nationalists of the [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic free city]] established after the French emperor's crushing victory over [[Prussia]] in 1807.\n\nAfter taking power, the Nazi government made efforts to establish friendly relations with Poland, resulting in the signing of the ten-year [[German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] with the Pi\u0142sudski regime in 1934. In 1938, Poland participated in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia by annexing [[Zaolzie]]. In 1939, Hitler claimed [[extraterritoriality]] for the [[Reichsautobahn Berlin-K\u00f6nigsberg]] and a change in Danzig's status, in exchange for promises of territory in Poland's neighbours and a 25-year extension of the non-aggression pact.

The Soviet Union had lost territory to Poland in 1920. Although officially labeled a \"non-aggression treaty\", the pact included a secret protocol, in which the independent countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania were divided into [[spheres of interest]] of the parties. The secret protocol explicitly assumed ''\"territorial and political rearrangements\"'' in the areas of these countries.\n\nSubsequently, all the mentioned countries were invaded, occupied, or forced to cede part of their territory by either the Soviet Union, Germany, or both.\n\n====Invasion of Poland====\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939 which directly led to the Anglo-French declaration of War on Germany on 3 Sept.

London's attempt at deterrence failed, but Hitler did not expect a wider war.

Leading themes include the political takeover in 1933 of Germany by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], which ruthlessly promoted an aggressive foreign policy in violation of the Versailles Treaty of 1919, [[Japanese militarism]] against China, Italian aggression against Ethiopia, and the success of Germany in forming an agreement with the Soviet Union in August 1939 to divide up Eastern Europe. The immediate precipitating event was [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invading Poland]] on September 1, 1939, and Britain and France declaring war on Germany on September 3, 1939.\n\nDeep anger arose in [[Weimar Germany]] that experienced strong currents of [[revanchism]] after the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that punished Germany for causing [[World War I]] in 1918. Complaints focused on the [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarization]] of Germany's [[Rhineland]], the prohibition of unification with Austria, and the loss of some German-speaking territories. The loss of overseas colonies was a less prominent issue. Germans said they had endorsed  Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]] in good faith, but the points were ignored. Versailles imposed severe conditions to prevent Germany from ever becoming a military power again, as well as heavy financial [[World War I reparations|reparations]].  Resentment and hatred of other countries was intensified by the instability of the German political system, as many activists rejected the legitimacy of the Weimar Republic. The most extreme politician was  [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Adolf Hitler]] and his violent Nazi party. They [[Machtergreifung|took totalitarian power in Germany starting in 1933]] and demanded the undoing of the Versailles provisions. The ambitious and aggressive foreign policy reflected Nazi ideology, such as: [[Anti-Semitism]], [[pan-germanism|unification of all Germans]], the acquisition of \"living space\" ([[Lebensraum]]) for agrarian settlers ([[Blut und Boden]]), creating a \"pull towards the East\" ([[Drang nach Osten]]) (that is, Poland and Russia), the elimination of [[Bolshevism]], and the hegemony of an \"[[Aryan race|Aryan]]\"/\"[[Nordic race|Nordic]]\" [[Master Race]] over the \"sub-humans\" ([[Untermensch]]en) of [[Jews]] and [[Slavs]].\n\nOther factors leading to the war included aggression by Italy against Ethiopia and Albania, the Japanese aggression and seizure of most of China and the Axis alliance formed by Germany, Japan and Italy. The 1930s were a decade in which democracy was in disrepute; countries across the world turned to authoritarian regimes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Dahl|title=Democracy and Its Critics|url=https://archive.org/details/democracyitscrit00dahl_0|url-access=registration|year=1989|publisher=Yale UP|pages=[https://archive.org/details/democracyitscrit00dahl_0/page/239 239]\u201340|isbn=0300153554}}</ref>\n\nThese aggressive moves met only feeble and ineffectual [[appeasement|policies of appeasement]] from Britain and France. The League of Nations proved helpless regarding China and Ethiopia.  A decisive event was the 1938 [[Munich Conference]] which formally approved Germany's annexation of the Sudeten region from Czechoslovakia.  Hitler promised it was his last claim, but in early 1939 he became even more aggressive, as the British and French finally realized that appeasement was not guaranteeing peace. Britain and France badly fumbled diplomatic efforts to form a military alliance with the Soviet Union. Instead Hitler offered Stalin a better deal in the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Expansionism==\n\n[[Expansionism]] is the doctrine of expanding the territorial base (or economic influence) of a country, usually by means of military aggression. In Europe, Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]] sought to create a [[New Roman Empire]] based around the Mediterranean. It invaded [[Albania]] in early 1938, at the start of the war, and later invaded [[Greece]]. Italy had also invaded [[Ethiopia]] as early as 1935. This provoked angry words and an oil embargo from the [[League of Nations]], which failed.\n\nUnder the Nazi regime, Germany began its own program of expansion, seeking to restore the \"rightful\" boundaries of historic Germany. As a prelude toward these goals the [[Rhineland]] was [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized in March 1936]].<ref>{{cite web|title=World War 2 Causes|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/causes_world_war_two.htm|publisher=History Learning Site|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlso of importance was the idea of a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]], supporters of which hoped to unite the [[German people]] under one nation state, which included all territories where Germans lived, regardless of whether they happened to be a minority in a particular territory. After the [[Treaty of Versailles]], a unification between Germany and a newly formed [[German-Austria]], a successor [[rump state]] of [[Austria-Hungary]], was prohibited by the Allies despite the majority of [[Austrians|Austrian Germans]] supporting such a union.\n\n[[File:First pictures of the Japanese occupation of Peiping in China.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese march into [[Zhengyangmen]] of [[Beijing]] after capturing the city in July 1937]]\nIn Asia, the [[Empire of Japan]] harbored expansionist desires towards [[Manchuria]] and the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].\n\n==Militarism==\n  \n{{Further|Militarism|Italian irredentism|Weimar Republic|Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|Japanese militarism|}}\n[[Militarism]] is the principle or policy of maintaining a strong [[military]] capability to use aggressively to expand national interests and/or values, with the view that military efficiency is the supreme ideal of a state.<ref>{{Cite web|title = the definition of militarism|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/militarism|website = Dictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> A highly militaristic and aggressive national ideology prevailed in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Italy]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Bruno Coppieters|author2=N.

The leaders of countries that have been militarized often feel a need to prove that their armies are important and formidable, and this was often a contributing factor in the start of conflicts in the [[interwar period]] such as the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2129.html|title=Japanese history: Militarism and World War II|website=www.japan-guide.com|accessdate=2015-05-30}}</ref>\n\nDuring the period of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919\u20131933), the [[Kapp Putsch]], an attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the republican government, was launched by disaffected members of the armed forces. After this event, some of the more radical militarists and nationalists were submerged in grief and despair into the [[NSDAP]], while more moderate elements of militarism declined. The result was an influx of militarily-inclined men into the Nazi Party which, when combined with their racial theories, fueled [[Irredentism|irredentist]] sentiments and put Germany on a collision course for war with its immediate neighbors.\n\nTwo contemporaneous factors in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] contributed both to the growing power of its military and chaos within its ranks leading up to the Second World War. One was the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] Law, which required the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) to nominate cabinet members before changes could be formed. This essentially gave the military veto power over the formation of any Cabinet in the ostensibly parliamentary country. Another factor was ''[[gekokuj\u014d]]'', or institutionalized [[Insubordination|disobedience]] by junior officers. It was not uncommon for radical junior officers to press their goals, to the extent of assassinating their seniors. In 1936, this phenomenon resulted in the [[February 26 Incident]], in which junior officers attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and killed leading members of the Japanese government. In the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] wrecked Japan's economy and gave radical elements within the Japanese military the chance to force the entire military into working towards the conquest of all of Asia. For example, in 1931 the [[Kwantung Army]] (a Japanese military force stationed in [[Manchuria]]) staged the [[Mukden Incident]], which sparked the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Invasion of Manchuria]] and its transformation into the Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].\n\n==Germans vs Slavs==\n\n{{Further|Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Lebensraum|Drang nach Osten}}\nTwentieth-century events marked the culmination of a millennium-long process of intermingling between Germans and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. The rise of nationalism in the 19th century made race a centerpiece of political loyalty. The rise of the nation-state had given way to the politics of identity, including [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Pan-Slavism]]. Furthermore, [[Social Darwinism|Social-Darwinist]] theories framed the coexistence as a \"Teuton vs. Slav\" struggle for domination, land and limited resources.<ref>Andreas Wimmer, ''Waves of War: Nationalism, State Formation, and Ethnic Exclusion in the Modern World'' (2012)</ref> Integrating these ideas into their own world-view, the Nazis believed that the Germans, the \"[[Aryan race]]\", were the [[master race]] and that the Slavs were inferior.<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]], ''The Third Reich: A New History'' (2001)</ref>\n\n==Interrelations and economics==\n\n===Problems with the Treaty of Versailles===\n{{Further|Treaty of Versailles}}\n[[File:German losses after WWI.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Germany after Versailles\n----\n{{legend|#ddefd0|Administered by the [[League of Nations]]}}\n{{legend|#ffffcf|Annexed or transferred to neighboring countries by the treaty, or later via plebiscite and League of Nation action}}\n{{legend|#f6d3a9|[[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]}}]]\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]] was neither lenient enough to appease [[Germany]], nor harsh enough to prevent it from becoming the dominant continental power again.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The National Archives Learning Curve {{!}} The Great War {{!}} Making peace {{!}} Reaction to the Treaty of Versailles {{!}} Background|url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/greatwar/g5/cs2/background.htm|website = www.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> Germans largely saw the treaty place the blame, or \"[[War Guilt Clause|war guilt]]\", on Germany and Austria-Hungary and punish them for their \"responsibility\" rather than working out an agreement that would assure long-term peace. The treaty provided for harsh monetary [[World War I reparations|reparations]], separated millions of ethnic Germans into neighboring countries, [[Territorial changes of Germany|territorial dismemberment]], and caused mass ethnic resettlement. In an effort to pay war reparations to Britain and France, the [[Weimar Republic]] printed trillions of marks, causing extremely high [[inflation]] of the German currency (see [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]]).\n\nThe treaty created bitter resentment towards the victors of World War I, who had promised the people of Germany that U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Wilson's Fourteen Points|Fourteen Points]] would be a guideline for peace; however, the US played a minor role in World War I and Wilson could not convince the Allies to agree to adopt his Fourteen Points. Many Germans felt that the German government had agreed to an [[armistice]] based on this understanding, while others felt that the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]] had been orchestrated by the \"November criminals\" who later assumed office in the new Weimar Republic.\n\nThe [[German colonial empire|German colonies]] were taken during the war, and Italy took the [[South Tyrol|southern half]] of [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] after an armistice had been agreed upon. The [[Eastern Front (World War I)|war in the east]] ended with the defeat and collapse of the [[Russian Empire]], and German troops [[Ober Ost|occupied]] large parts of Eastern and Central Europe (with varying degree of control), establishing various client states such as a [[Kingdom of Poland (1916-1918)|kingdom of Poland]] and the [[United Baltic Duchy]]. After the destructive and indecisive [[battle of Jutland]] (1916) and the mutiny of its sailors in 1917, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] spent most of the war in port, only to be turned over to the allies and scuttled at surrender by its own officers. The lack of an obvious military defeat was one of the pillars that held together the ''[[Dolchstosslegende]]'' (\"Stab-in-the-back myth\") and gave the Nazis another propaganda tool at their disposal.\n\n===French security demands===\nFrench security demands, such as reparations, coal payments, and a demilitarized Rhineland, took precedence at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and shaped the Treaty of Versailles by severely punishing Germany; however, Austria found the treaty to be unjust which encouraged Hitler's popularity.  Ginsberg argues, \"France was greatly weakened and, in its weakness and fear of a resurgent Germany, sought to isolate and punish Germany....French revenge would come back to haunt France during the Nazi invasion and occupation twenty years later.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Roy H.

The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 was their chance to punish Germany for starting the war. The war \"must be someone's fault \u2013 and that's a very natural human reaction\" analyzed historian Margaret MacMillan.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winter|first=Jay|title=The Legacy of the Great War: Ninety Years On|year=2009|publisher=University of Missouri Press|page=126}}</ref> Germany was charged with the sole responsibility of starting World War I. The War Guilt Clause was the first step towards a satisfying revenge for the victor countries, namely France, against Germany. France understood that its position in 1918 was \"artificial and transitory\".<ref name=\"Paxton 2011 145\">{{cite book|last=Paxton|first=Robert O.|title=Europe in the Twentieth Century|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|location=United States|page=145}}</ref> Thus, [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]], the French leader at the time, worked to gain French security via the Treaty of Versailles.<ref name=\"Paxton 2011 145\"/>\n[[File:Council of Four Versailles.jpg|thumb|\"The Big Four\" made all the major decisions at the Paris Peace Conference (from left to right, [[David Lloyd George]] of Britain, [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] of Italy, [[Georges Clemenceau]] of France, [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the U.S.)]]\nThe two main provisions of the French security agenda were reparations from Germany in the form of money and coal and a detached German Rhineland. The French government printed excess currency, which created inflation, to compensate for the lack of funds in addition to borrowing money from the United States.

The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding century. The old philosophy of \"concert of nations\", growing out of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), saw Europe as a shifting map of alliances among nation-states, creating a [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] maintained by strong armies and secret agreements. Under the new philosophy, the League was a government of governments, with the role of settling disputes between individual nations in an open and legalist forum.

However, they were often very reluctant to do so. After numerous notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the [[Axis powers]] in the 1930s. The reliance upon unanimous decisions, the lack of an armed force, and the continued self-interest of its leading members meant that this failure was arguably inevitable.<ref>{{cite book|author=David T.

Mason had contended that a \"flight into war\" had been imposed on [[Adolf Hitler]] by a structural economic crisis, which confronted Hitler with the choice of making difficult economic decisions or aggression. Overy argued against Mason's thesis, maintaining that though Germany was faced with economic problems in 1939, the extent of these problems cannot explain aggression against [[Poland]] and the reasons for the outbreak of war were due to the choices made by the Nazi leadership.\n\nMason had argued that the German working-class was always  to the Nazi dictatorship; that in the over-heated German economy of the late 1930s, German workers could force employers to grant higher wages by leaving for another firm that would grant the desired wage increases; that this was a form of political resistance and this resistance forced [[Adolf Hitler]] to go to war in 1939.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\">Perry, Matt \"Mason, Timothy\" pages&nbsp;780\u2013781 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' edited by Kelly Boyd, Volume 2, London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishing, 1999 page 780</ref> Thus, the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] was caused by structural economic problems, a \"flight into war\" imposed by a domestic crisis.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\"/> The key aspects of the crisis were according to Mason, a shaky economic recovery was threatened by a rearmament program that was overwhelming the economy and in which the Nazi regime's nationalist bluster limited its options.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\"/> In this way, Mason articulated a ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' (\"primacy of domestic politics\")  view of World War II's origins through the concept of [[social imperialism]].<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages&nbsp;6\u20137</ref> Mason's ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' thesis was in marked contrast to the ''Primat der Au\u00dfenpolitik'' (\"primacy of foreign politics) usually used to explain World War II.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\"/> In Mason's opinion, German foreign policy was driven by domestic political considerations, and the launch of World War II in 1939 was best understood as a \"barbaric variant of social imperialism\".<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 7</ref>\n\nMason argued that \"Nazi Germany was always bent ''at some time'' upon a major war of expansion.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated165\">Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 165</ref> However, Mason argued that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy, and had nothing to do with what Hitler wanted.<ref name=\"autogenerated165\"/> In Mason's view in the period between 1936\u201341, it was the state of the German economy, and not Hitler's 'will' or 'intentions' that was the most important determinate on German decision-making on foreign policy.<ref name=\"autogenerated88\">Kershaw, Ian'' The Nazi Dictatorship'' London : Arnold 2000 page 88.</ref> Mason argued that the Nazi leaders were deeply haunted by the November Revolution of 1918, and was most unwilling to see any fall in working class living standards out of the fear that it might provoke another November Revolution.<ref name=\"autogenerated88\"/> According to Mason, by 1939, the \"overheating\" of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and the sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\">Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages&nbsp;165\u2013166</ref> Mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless 'smash and grab' foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany.<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 166</ref> Mason described German foreign policy as driven by an opportunistic 'next victim' syndrome after the ''[[Anschluss]]'', in which the \"promiscuity of aggressive intentions\" was nurtured by every successful foreign policy move.<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 151</ref> In Mason's opinion, the decision to sign the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact]] with the Soviet Union and to attack Poland and the running of the risk of a war with Britain and France were the abandonment by Hitler of his foreign policy program outlined in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' forced on him by his need to stop a collapsing German economy by seizing territory abroad to be plundered.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\nFor Overy, the problem with Mason's thesis was that it rested on the assumption that in a way not shown by records, information was passed on to Hitler about the ''Reich'''s economic problems.<ref name=\"Ref-1\">Mason, Tim & Overy, R.J. \"Debate: Germany, 'domestic crisis' and the war in 1939\" from ''The Origins of The Second World War'' edited by Patrick Finney, (London: Edward Arnold, 1997) p 102</ref> Overy argued that there was a difference between economic pressures induced by the problems of the [[Four Year Plan]] and economic motives to seize raw materials, industry and foreign reserves of neighboring states as a way of accelerating the Four Year Plan.<ref>Overy, Richard \"Germany, 'Domestic Crisis' and War in 1939\" from ''The Third Reich'' edited by Christian Leitz (Oxford: Blackwell, 1999) p&nbsp;117\u2013118</ref> Overy asserted that Mason downplayed the repressive capacity of the German state as a way of dealing with domestic unhappiness.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/> Finally, Overy argued that there is considerable evidence that the German state felt they could master the economic problems of rearmament; as one civil servant put it in January 1940 \"we have already mastered so many difficulties in the past, that here too, if one or other raw material became extremely scarce, ways and means will always yet be found to get out

Paramilitary activity and extremist violence peaked during this period and the Czechoslovakian government declared martial law in parts of the Sudetenland to maintain order.

The entire ordeal was the last show of the French and British policy of appeasement.\n\n===Italian invasion of Albania===\n{{Further|Italian invasion of Albania}}\nAfter the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, [[Benito Mussolini]] feared for Italy becoming a second-rate member of the Axis. Rome delivered Tirana an ultimatum on March 25, 1939, demanding that it accede to Italy's occupation of Albania. [[King Zog]] refused to accept money in exchange for countenancing a full Italian takeover and colonization of Albania. On April 7, 1939, Italian troops invaded Albania. Albania was occupied after a 3 days campaign with minimal resistance offered by the Albanian forces.\n\n===Soviet\u2013Japanese Border War===\n{{Further|Battle of Khalkhin Gol}}\nIn 1939, the Japanese attacked west from Manchuria into the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], following the earlier [[Battle of Lake Khasan]] in 1938. They were decisively beaten by Soviet units under General [[Georgy Zhukov]]. Following this battle, the Soviet Union and Japan were at peace until 1945. Japan looked south to expand its empire, leading to conflict with the United States over the Philippines and control of shipping lanes to the Dutch East Indies. The Soviet Union focused on her western border, but leaving 1 million to 1.5 million troops to guard the frontier with Japan.\n\n===Danzig crisis===\n[[File:Polish Corridor.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Polish Corridor]] and the [[Free City of Danzig (interwar)|Free City of Danzig]]]]\n{{Further|Free City of Danzig (interwar)|Polish Corridor}}\n\nAfter the final fate of Czechoslovakia proved that the F\u00fchrer's word could not be trusted, Britain and France decided on a change of strategy. They decided any further unilateral German expansion would be met by force. The natural next target for the Third Reich's further expansion was Poland, whose [[Polish Corridor|access to the Baltic sea]] had been carved out of [[West Prussia]] by the Versailles treaty, making [[East Prussia]] an [[exclave]]. The main port of the area, [[Danzig]], had been made [[Free City of Danzig (interwar)|a free city-state]] under Polish influence guaranteed by the League of Nations, a stark reminder to German nationalists of the [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic free city]] established after the French emperor's crushing victory over [[Prussia]] in 1807.\n\nAfter taking power, the Nazi government made efforts to establish friendly relations with Poland, resulting in the signing of the ten-year [[German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] with the Pi\u0142sudski regime in 1934. In 1938, Poland participated in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia by annexing [[Zaolzie]]. In 1939, Hitler claimed [[extraterritoriality]] for the [[Reichsautobahn Berlin-K\u00f6nigsberg]] and a change in Danzig's status, in exchange for promises of territory in Poland's neighbours and a 25-year extension of the non-aggression pact. Poland refused, fearing losing de facto access to the sea, subjugation as a German [[satellite|satellite state]] or [[client state]], and future further German demands.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/fyb/part_4.html The German-Polish Crisis (March 27 \u2013 May 9, 1939)]</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite book|author=John Ashley Soames Grenville|title=A History of the World from the 20th to the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNmfAL0CBBIC&pg=PA234|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-28955-9|pages=234\u2013}}</ref> In August 1939, Hitler delivered an [[ultimatum]] to Poland on Danzig's status.\n\n====Polish alliance with the Entente====\n{{Further|British-Polish Military Alliance|Franco-Polish alliance (1921)}}\n{{expand section|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn March 1939, Britain and France guaranteed the independence of Poland. Hitler's claims in the summer of 1939 on Danzig and the Polish Corridor provoked yet another [[international crisis]]. On August 25, Britain signed the Polish-British Common Defence Pact.\n\n====Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact====\n{{Further|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Soviet invasion of Poland|Occupation of the Baltic States|Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Winter War}}\nNominally, the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] was a [[non-aggression treaty]] between Germany and the Soviet Union. It was signed in [[Moscow]] on August 23, 1939, by the Soviet foreign minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and the German foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]].\n\nIn 1939, neither Germany nor the Soviet Union were ready to go to war with each other. The Soviet Union had lost territory to Poland in 1920. Although officially labeled a \"non-aggression treaty\", the pact included a secret protocol, in which the independent countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania were divided into [[spheres of interest]] of the parties. The secret protocol explicitly assumed ''\"territorial and political rearrangements\"'' in the areas of these countries.\n\nSubsequently, all the mentioned countries were invaded, occupied, or forced to cede part of their territory by either the Soviet Union, Germany, or both.\n\n====Invasion of Poland====\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939 which directly led to the Anglo-French declaration of War on Germany on 3 Sept.

The USSR, however, gained control of the Baltic states and parts of Poland by allying with Germany, which it did through the secret [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] in August 1939. London's attempt at deterrence failed, but Hitler did not expect a wider war. Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, and rejected the British and French demands that it withdraw, resulting in their declaration of war on September 3, 1939, in accordance with the defense treaties with Poland that they had signed and publicly announced.<ref>Halik Kochanski, ''The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War'' (2012) pp&nbsp;34\u201393</ref><ref>Zara Steiner, ''The Triumph of the Dark: European International History, 1933\u20131939'' (2011) pp&nbsp;690\u201392, 738\u201341</ref>\n\n===Invasion of the Soviet Union===\n{{Further|Operation Barbarossa|Soviet offensive plans controversy}}\nGermany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. Hitler believed that the Soviet Union could be defeated in a fast-paced and relentless assault that capitalized on the Soviet Union's ill-prepared state, and hoped that success there would bring Britain to the negotiation table, ending the war altogether.\n\n===Attacks on Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, British Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong===\n{{Further|Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor}}\nThe US government and the American public in general had been supportive of China, condemning the [[century of humiliation|colonialist policies]] of the European powers and Japan, and promoting a so-called [[Open Door Policy]]. Many Americans viewed the Japanese as an aggressive and/or inferior race. The [[Nationalist Government]] of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] held friendly relations with the United States, which opposed Japan's invasion of China in 1937 that it considered an [[international law|illegal]] violation of the [[sovereignty]] of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]], and offered the Nationalist Government diplomatic, economic, and military assistance during its war against Japan. Diplomatic friction between the US and Japan manifested itself in events like the [[Panay incident]] in 1937 and the [[Allison incident]] in 1938.\n\n[[File:Japanese troops entering Saigon in 1941.jpg|thumb|Japanese troops entering [[Saigon]]]]\nReacting to Japanese pressure on French authorities of [[French Indochina]] to stop trade with China, the U.S. began restricting trade with Japan in July 1940.

Japan stepped in as a mediator for the French-Thai war in May 1941, allowing its ally to occupy bordering provinces in [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]]. In July 1941, as operation Barbarossa had effectively neutralized the Soviet threat, the faction of the Japanese military junta supporting the \"Southern Strategy\", pushed through the occupation of the rest of French Indochina.\n\nThe United States reacted by seeking to bring the Japanese war effort to a complete halt by imposing [[ABCD line|a full embargo]] on all trade between the United States to Japan on 1&nbsp;August 1941, demanding that Japan withdraw all troops from both China and Indochina. Japan was dependent on the United States for 80 percent of its oil, resulting in an economic and military crisis for Japan that could not continue its war effort with China without access to petroleum and oil products.<ref>Euan Graham.

The charges were based on research by [[Szymon Datner]], head of the [[Bia\u0142ystok]] branch of the [[Central Committee of Polish Jews]] (C\u017bKH). The German prosecutors found no hard evidence implicating Birkner, but in the course of their investigation they discovered a new German witness, the former SS ''Kreiskommissar'' of \u0141om\u017ca, who named the paramilitary [[Einsatzgruppe B]] under SS-Obersturmf\u00fchrer [[Hermann Schaper]] as having been deployed in the area at the time of the pogroms.

Poland's Institute of National Remembrance (''Instytut Pami\u0119ci Narodowej'', or ''IPN'') had recently been created as an independent successor to the Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Poland, formed only after the collapse of the Soviet empire. Its major role was the promotion of historical research on topics that had been banned for over 40 years under communist rule (1945\u201389), including anti-semitic pogroms in Soviet-occupied Poland.\n\nAs its first project, the IPN investigated the Jedwabne pogrom in response to a heated debate among leading historians following the publication, first in the Polish language, of ''S\u0105siedzi'' (English edition, ''Neighbors'', 2001) by the Polish-American historian {{nobreak|[[Jan T.

The IPN found that Poles played a \"decisive role\" in the massacre, but the massacre was \"instigated by the Germans\". The massacre was carried out in full view of the Germans, who were armed and had control of the town, and the Germans did not intervene and halt the killings. IPN wrote: \"The presence of German military policemen... and other uniformed Germans... was tantamount to consent to, and tolerance of, the crime.\"\n* At least 340 Jewish victims were killed in the pogrom, in two groups of which the first contained 40 to 50 men, and the second about 300 persons.

IPN could neither conclusively prove nor disprove these accounts. \"Witness testimonies vary considerably on this question.\"\n* \"A group of Jewish people survived\" the massacre.  Several dozen \u2014 according to several sources, about a hundred \u2014 Jews lived in a ghetto in Jedwabne until November 1942, when they were transferred by the Germans to a ghetto in \u0141om\u017ca, and eventually deported to Treblinka, where they were killed.

He said the murderers had been incited by German occupiers, but they alone carried the burden of guilt for their crimes.

Living among us also are Holocaust survivors whose lives were saved as a result of the brave actions of their Polish neighbors,\" he said.

Gross writes that \"it is not just a question of character that plays itself out in this drama, but also the logic of incentives one encounters within the totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century\".<ref>''Neighbors'', p.117</ref>\n\nGross recognized that German forces were in Jedwabne during the massacre.<!-- insufficient referencing --> and that German occupying forces had control of the town: \"At the time, the undisputed bosses over life and death in Jedwabne were the Germans. No sustained organized activity could take place there without their consent.\"<ref>''Neighbours'', p.47</ref> Gross concluded that the massacre was carried out entirely by Poles from Jedwabne and the surrounding area.<!-- insufficient referencing --> Gross said the Polish perpetrators were not coerced by the Germans (p.&nbsp;133).<!-- insufficient referencing --> One of Gross's principal sources was Szmul Wasersztajn, a witness whose testimony had been deposited in 1945 at the [[Jewish Historical Institute]] (''\u017bydowski Instytut Historyczny,'' ''\u017bIH'') in [[Bia\u0142ystok]], Poland; and Stalinist investigation affidavits and records of the 1949-1950 trials - which caused other academics to dispute his credibility as a source.
