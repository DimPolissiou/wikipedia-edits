Shao Kahn is depicted as a brutal warlord who is the [[Emperor]] of the mystical realm Outworld. Feared for his godlike strength and knowledge of [[Maleficium (sorcery)|black magic]], he seeks to conquer all of the realms of the ''Mortal Kombat'' [[fictional universe|universe]] and merge them with Outworld.\n\nShao Kahn is one of the most celebrated villains in video games. While he is noted as a difficult boss, publications and critics have praised his design, in-game abilities, and mannerisms\u2014particularly his tactic of mocking and taunting players.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Video games===\nPrior to the events of the game series, Shao Kahn was a warlord protecting Outworld and an advisor to the realm's ruler, [[Onaga (Mortal Kombat)|Onaga]]. Eventually, Shao Kahn poisoned Onaga, claiming his throne and his armies. Kahn continued to add lesser realms to Outworld, including Edenia, whose queen [[Sindel]] and princess [[Kitana]] were forced to be Kahn's wife and personal killer respectively. Sindel killed herself to escape Kahn, who keeps her soul in Outworld. One of the backwards dialogues in Deception's Konquest Mode says that Shao Kahn is part of the same race of beings as Lucifer and Raiden. In Deception's Konquest mode, Damashi who is the spirtual avatar of Onaga states to Shujinko that Shao Kahn was to Outworld what Raiden is to Earth making Shao Kahn a god similar to Raiden.\n\nKahn first appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' as the game's final boss and main antagonist. After the crooked tournament Grandmaster [[Shang Tsung]] and his warriors lose to Earthrealm in ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' Kahn invokes a tournament rematch clause which will allow him to take Earthrealm immediately if he wins. Though he lures Earth's warriors to Outworld to kill them, he is defeated by the Shaolin Monk [[Liu Kang]], which halts his plans.\n\n''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' features Shao Kahn as the final boss again. The game's story sees [[Shang Tsung]] resurrect Queen Sindel in Earthrealm, allowing Kahn to reclaim her by invading Earth, which is a violation of Mortal Kombat tournament rules. Billions of people are by Kahn stripped of their souls to empower himself and merges Earthrealm with Outworld. Kahn sends extermination squads to kill [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]]'s chosen few who were protected from this fate. Eventually, Liu Kang again trounces Kahn, and he and his Outworld armies retreat, restoring Earth and Edenia to normal.\n\nAfter being absent from ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'', Shao Kahn has a brief cameo in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]''. The Emperor, weakened from battle with Edenia and abandoned by many of his finest soldiers, is killed by the titular Alliance of Shang Tsung and [[Quan Chi]]. He makes a playable appearance in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] version of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]'' where it is revealed that the Deadly Alliance killed a decoy. Kahn sets out to reclaim his empire from a resurrected Onaga.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'', Shao Kahn is playable once more. In the game's story, he is the ruler of Outworld again after Onaga's defeat. He forms an uneasy alliance with Quan Chi, Shang Tsung, and Onaga to defeat [[Blaze (Mortal Kombat character)|Blaze]] and seize his godlike powers.\n\nIn 2011's [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|''Mortal Kombat'' reboot]] Shao Kahn is once again the main antagonist and final boss of the game's Arcade Ladder and Story Mode. Shao Kahn kills [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] after acquiring Blaze's powers, but not before Raiden sends prophetic messages to his past self using his broken talisman. The talisman periodically informs the younger Raiden of his progress in preventing Armageddon. As Shao Kahn [[Mortal Kombat 3|invades Earthrealm]], Raiden decides not to stop Kahn's attempts to merge Earth with Outworld. Kahn pummels a surrendering Raiden until the Elder Gods, enraged by Shao Kahn's violation of Mortal Kombat rules, empower Raiden which allows him to kill the emperor. While this averts the timeline leading to Armageddon while restoring Earthrealm, ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' reveals that Kitana's clone [[Mileena]] succeeded Shao Kahn in ruling Outworld as his \"daughter\", before she is overthrown by [[Kotal Kahn]]. Ermac's concept art reveals that Shao Kahn's soul is inside Ermac.\n\nShao Kahn returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]''. In the story, the past version of Shao Kahn is brought to the present timeline by Kronika, the keeper of time. Upon arriving, he is outraged to learn of his death in the modern timeline, and that Kotal Kahn became Outworld's ruler after D'Vorah killed Mileena. He agrees to work for Kronika after learning that she is planning to reset the timeline and wipe Raiden from existence. He attempts to take back his throne from Kotal and rebuild Outworld's forces, but he is defeated by Kitana, who becomes the new ruler of Outworld and Kotal's successor. In his noncanonical arcade ending, Shao Kahn merges all timelines into a Singularity, and becomes the undefeated Mortal Kombat champion for centuries.\n\n===Crossover appearances===\nShao Kahn and [[Darkseid]] are the key villains in the crossover game ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', though both are playable characters. In the game's plot, a defeated Shao Kahn limps into a graveyard where he meets with his secret ally Quan Chi. They are confronted by Raiden, who uses a lightning bolt on Shao Kahn, which knocks him into Quan Chi\u2019s portal. This event, along with a parallel one between [[Superman]] and [[Darkseid]] in the [[DC Universe]], results in the creation of '''Dark Kahn''', who serves as the main antagonist in the game. After Dark Kahn is defeated, Shao Kahn ends up in the DC Universe's Darkseid's throne room, where he discovers he has lost his powers. He is promptly imprisoned in the [[Phantom Zone]]. However, his powers came back in little time and was able to free himself but also everyone in the Phantom Zone, whom pledge allegiance to Shao Kahn.\n\n===Design and gameplay===\n[[Image:Shao Kahn comic.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An unmasked Shao Kahn in the ''Mortal Kombat II'' comic book by [[John Tobias]]]]\n\nKahn's attire for ''Mortal Kombat II'' was developed by Mark Runion.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[GamePro]] |author=Staff |page=117 |title=The Minds Behind Mortal Kombat II |issue=59 |date=June 1994}}</ref> Kahn started out unmasked and with large gnashing teeth similar to [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]], since everyone from Outworld was originally supposed to be of Baraka's race.<ref>''GamePro'' 58 (May 1994), p.29.</ref> The idea of all inhabitants of Outworld being Tarkatan was later dropped. It was originally stated that Shao Kahn is a demonic character, and his monstrous visage from the official comic books, as well as ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks]]'' lends credibility to that. In Mortal Kombat 9, he appears to simply be a large human, although his face is never seen. His face has only appeared in ''Shaolin Monks'', in which he is hit with his war hammer and his helmet breaks, and Mortal Kombat 11, when he is blinded by Kitana, revealing his face in that game to be clearly inhuman, but not completely monstrous.\n\n[[File:Brian Glynn (36402382651).jpg|thumb|Brian Glynn in 2017]]\n\nIn ''MKII'', Kahn was digitally resized to a taller height to make him tower over the playable characters. The actor who played him, bodybuilder Brian Glynn (who \"couldn't believe\" he was going to be in a ''Mortal Kombat'' game), was not nearly as imposing in comparison; a photograph published in ''[[GamePro]]'' of Glynn and ''Mortal Kombat'' co-creator [[Ed Boon]] standing side-by-side, which was snapped during production of the game, showed that Boon was taller.<ref>''GamePro'' 59 (June 1994), p.121.</ref> In many official depictions of Shao Kahn made by [[Midway Games|Midway]], he is shown wearing a cape, though he never wore one in his original digitized appearances. ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'' was the first time in which he wore the cape in-game. ''Mortal Kombat'' sound designer Dan Forden explained that the reason for Kahn not wearing the cape in earlier games, in addition to [[Kabal (Mortal Kombat)|Kabal]] not being able to wear a trenchcoat in ''Mortal Kombat 3'', was that loose flowing clothing took up memory.\n\nShao Kahn originated as an unplayable boss character in ''MKII''. He is fought as a boss (in most cases, the final boss) in most of his appearances, but became a [[player character]] for the first time in the home ports of ''MK3'' as an unlockable character. He would also be playable in the home ports of ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'', the Nintendo GameCube and [[PlayStation Portable]] versions of ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'', ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon'' and ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe''. Shao Kahn also appears as a playable character in ''Mortal Kombat 11'' via DLC. In ''Mortal Kombat'' (2011), Shao Kahn is once again a non-playable boss. He is also the final boss in the [[beat 'em up]] spin-off, ''Shaolin Monks''.\n\nShao Kahn's special moves consist mainly of powerful shoulder barges, magical projectiles, and attacks with his signature giant [[War hammer|maul]], the \"Wrath Hammer\". In some of his appearances as a boss, blocking Kahn's attacks will stun the player. Since his debut, his signature tactic has been taunting players before, during, and after rounds with such statements as \"''Feel the power of Shao Kahn!''\", \"''Bow to me!''\" and \"''It's official, you suck!\"'' {{-}}\n\n===Other appearances===\n[[Image:Shaokahnannihaltion.png|thumb|upright|[[Brian Thompson]] as Shao Kahn in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'']]\n\nShao Kahn makes his first appearance in [[Mortal Kombat (comics)|''MK'' comic books]] during the ''Battlewave'' miniseries by [[Malibu Comics]], though he already was present in the first, ''Blood & Thunder''. Shao Kahn remained mostly faithful to his game counterpart, being the Emperor of Outworld and attempting to take Earthrealm for himself. In ''Battlewave'', Shao Kahn would arrange a different plan to open the portals. He kidnaps [[Sonya Blade]] and, by means of hypnosis and brainwashing, convinces her to marry him; the marriage would weaken the barriers between realms enough to allow Shao Kahn to seize Earth easily (and make Sonya the queen of both realms and his wife). During these two series, he never appears wielding his trademark helmet (instead, he is always shown with his visible face and design taken from the official ''Mortal Kombat II'' comic by John Tobias), and he is seen wearing his helmet only in the comic ''Kitana & Mileena'' (according to which he actually loves Kitana).\n\nShao Kahn appears in both ''Mortal Kombat'' films. In the 1995 [[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|first movie]] he is referred to simply as \"The Emperor\" and makes a brief appearance at the end, as a special effect and voiced by [[Frank Welker]]. Kahn (his name, incorrectly hyphenated in the closing credits of ''Annihilation'', was additionally misspelled as \"Shoa-Kahn\" on the DVD release's fight scenes menu), played by [[Brian Thompson]], is the main antagonist in the 1997 sequel, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]''. In the film he fights [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]], [[Johnny Cage]] and [[Liu Kang]]. He brutally kills Johnny Cage in the film's opening scene, murders his own allies Rain and Jade in cold blood and then Raiden (later brought back to life) near the end prior to his final fight with Liu Kang. In addition, Kahn and Raiden were portrayed as brothers, with Shinnok as their father, though neither of them shared any relation in the games (with the exception of ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe'' in which Raiden's biography states that the two are brothers, although the game itself is non-canon). The only subplot taken directly from the games' storyline was his past relationship with Kitana and Sindel; a segment in the film featured Kitana, imprisoned in Kahn's fortress, mentioning the destruction of her family and Sindel's subsequent suicide under his rule.\n\nHe was played by Jeffrey D. Harris<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/16/arts/pop-review-heroes-in-outworld-fighting-to-save-the-earth.html |title=POP REVIEW; Heroes in Outworld, Fighting to Save the Earth - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1995-09-16 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref> and Ted Nordblum in the 1995-1996 stage show ''[[Mortal Kombat: Live Tour]]''. A Shao Kahn [[action figure]] was released in 1996 by Toy Island in the ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' series.<ref>{{cite web|author=Captain Coder |url=http://www.figurerealm.com/actionfigure.php?FID=11603&figure=shaokahn |title=Shao Kahn Action Figure Gallery |publisher=Figure Realm |date= |accessdate=2013-07-20}}</ref> He was also one of the characters featured in the collectible card game ''[[Mortal Kombat Kard Game]]''.\n\nShao Kahn was played by [[Jeffrey Meek]] (who also played Raiden) in the TV series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]''. Despite having lost much of his physical stature from the games and movies, the character has a much more threatening disposition, serving as the mediator of the Mortal Kombat matches. Meek played opposite himself in the series finale, where Kahn battles Raiden in a void seemingly between the realms. With Kung Lao dead, Shao Kahn forces Raiden into submission and commenced full military assault on Earthrealm.

Shao Kahn is depicted as a brutal warlord who is the [[Emperor]] of the mystical realm Outworld. Feared for his godlike strength and knowledge of [[Maleficium (sorcery)|black magic]], he seeks to conquer all of the realms of the ''Mortal Kombat'' [[fictional universe|universe]] and merge them with Outworld.\n\nShao Kahn is one of the most celebrated villains in video games. While he is noted as a difficult boss, publications and critics have praised his design, in-game abilities, and mannerisms\u2014particularly his tactic of mocking and taunting players.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Video games===\nPrior to the events of the game series, Shao Kahn was a warlord protecting Outworld and an advisor to the realm's ruler, [[Onaga (Mortal Kombat)|Onaga]]. Eventually, Shao Kahn poisoned Onaga, claiming his throne and his armies. Kahn continued to add lesser realms to Outworld, including Edenia, whose queen [[Sindel]] and princess [[Kitana]] were forced to be Kahn's wife and personal killer respectively. Sindel killed herself to escape Kahn, who keeps her soul in Outworld. One of the backwards dialogues in Deception's Konquest Mode says that Shao Kahn is part of the same race of beings as Lucifer and Raiden. In Deception's Konquest mode, Damashi who is the spirtual avatar of Onaga states to Shujinko that Shao Kahn was to Outworld what Raiden is to Earth making Shao Kahn a god similar to Raiden.\n\nKahn first appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' as the game's final boss and main antagonist. After the crooked tournament Grandmaster [[Shang Tsung]] and his warriors lose to Earthrealm in ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' Kahn invokes a tournament rematch clause which will allow him to take Earthrealm immediately if he wins. Though he lures Earth's warriors to Outworld to kill them, he is defeated by the Shaolin Monk [[Liu Kang]], which halts his plans.\n\n''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' features Shao Kahn as the final boss again. The game's story sees [[Shang Tsung]] resurrect Queen Sindel in Earthrealm, allowing Kahn to reclaim her by invading Earth, which is a violation of Mortal Kombat tournament rules. Billions of people are by Kahn stripped of their souls to empower himself and merges Earthrealm with Outworld. Kahn sends extermination squads to kill [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]]'s chosen few who were protected from this fate. Eventually, Liu Kang again trounces Kahn, and he and his Outworld armies retreat, restoring Earth and Edenia to normal.\n\nAfter being absent from ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'', Shao Kahn has a brief cameo in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]''. The Emperor, weakened from battle with Edenia and abandoned by many of his finest soldiers, is killed by the titular Alliance of Shang Tsung and [[Quan Chi]]. He makes a playable appearance in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] version of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]'' where it is revealed that the Deadly Alliance killed a decoy. Kahn sets out to reclaim his empire from a resurrected Onaga.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'', Shao Kahn is playable once more. In the game's story, he is the ruler of Outworld again after Onaga's defeat. He forms an uneasy alliance with Quan Chi, Shang Tsung, and Onaga to defeat [[Blaze (Mortal Kombat character)|Blaze]] and seize his godlike powers.\n\nIn 2011's [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|''Mortal Kombat'' reboot]] Shao Kahn is once again the main antagonist and final boss of the game's Arcade Ladder and Story Mode. Shao Kahn kills [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] after acquiring Blaze's powers, but not before Raiden sends prophetic messages to his past self using his broken talisman. The talisman periodically informs the younger Raiden of his progress in preventing Armageddon. As Shao Kahn [[Mortal Kombat 3|invades Earthrealm]], Raiden decides not to stop Kahn's attempts to merge Earth with Outworld. Kahn pummels a surrendering Raiden until the Elder Gods, enraged by Shao Kahn's violation of Mortal Kombat rules, empower Raiden which allows him to kill the emperor. While this averts the timeline leading to Armageddon while restoring Earthrealm, ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' reveals that Kitana's clone [[Mileena]] succeeded Shao Kahn in ruling Outworld as his \"daughter\", before she is overthrown by [[Kotal Kahn]]. Ermac's concept art reveals that Shao Kahn's soul is inside Ermac.\n\nShao Kahn returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]''. In the story, the past version of Shao Kahn is brought to the present timeline by Kronika, the keeper of time. Upon arriving, he is outraged to learn of his death in the modern timeline, and that Kotal Kahn became Outworld's ruler after D'Vorah killed Mileena. He agrees to work for Kronika after learning that she is planning to reset the timeline and wipe Raiden from existence. He attempts to take back his throne from Kotal and rebuild Outworld's forces, but he is defeated by Kitana, who becomes the new ruler of Outworld and Kotal's successor. In his noncanonical arcade ending, Shao Kahn merges all timelines into a Singularity, and becomes the undefeated Mortal Kombat champion for centuries.\n\n===Crossover appearances===\nShao Kahn and [[Darkseid]] are the key villains in the crossover game ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', though both are playable characters. In the game's plot, a defeated Shao Kahn limps into a graveyard where he meets with his secret ally Quan Chi. They are confronted by Raiden, who uses a lightning bolt on Shao Kahn, which knocks him into Quan Chi\u2019s portal. This event, along with a parallel one between [[Superman]] and [[Darkseid]] in the [[DC Universe]], results in the creation of '''Dark Kahn''', who serves as the main antagonist in the game. After Dark Kahn is defeated, Shao Kahn ends up in the DC Universe's Darkseid's throne room, where he discovers he has lost his powers. He is promptly imprisoned in the [[Phantom Zone]]. However, his powers came back in little time and was able to free himself but also everyone in the Phantom Zone, whom pledge allegiance to Shao Kahn.\n\n===Design and gameplay===\n[[Image:Shao Kahn comic.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An unmasked Shao Kahn in the ''Mortal Kombat II'' comic book by [[John Tobias]]]]\n\nKahn's attire for ''Mortal Kombat II'' was developed by Mark Runion.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[GamePro]] |author=Staff |page=117 |title=The Minds Behind Mortal Kombat II |issue=59 |date=June 1994}}</ref> Kahn started out unmasked and with large gnashing teeth similar to [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]], since everyone from Outworld was originally supposed to be of Baraka's race.<ref>''GamePro'' 58 (May 1994), p.29.</ref> The idea of all inhabitants of Outworld being Tarkatan was later dropped. It was originally stated that Shao Kahn is a demonic character, and his monstrous visage from the official comic books, as well as ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks]]'' lends credibility to that. In Mortal Kombat 9, he appears to simply be a large human, although his face is never seen. His face has only appeared in ''Shaolin Monks'', in which he is hit with his war hammer and his helmet breaks, and Mortal Kombat 11, when he is blinded by Kitana, revealing his face in that game to be clearly inhuman, but not completely monstrous.\n\n[[File:Brian Glynn (36402382651).jpg|thumb|Brian Glynn in 2017]]\n\nIn ''MKII'', Kahn was digitally resized to a taller height to make him tower over the playable characters. The actor who played him, bodybuilder Brian Glynn (who \"couldn't believe\" he was going to be in a ''Mortal Kombat'' game), was not nearly as imposing in comparison; a photograph published in ''[[GamePro]]'' of Glynn and ''Mortal Kombat'' co-creator [[Ed Boon]] standing side-by-side, which was snapped during production of the game, showed that Boon was taller.<ref>''GamePro'' 59 (June 1994), p.121.</ref> In many official depictions of Shao Kahn made by [[Midway Games|Midway]], he is shown wearing a cape, though he never wore one in his original digitized appearances. ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'' was the first time in which he wore the cape in-game. ''Mortal Kombat'' sound designer Dan Forden explained that the reason for Kahn not wearing the cape in earlier games, in addition to [[Kabal (Mortal Kombat)|Kabal]] not being able to wear a trenchcoat in ''Mortal Kombat 3'', was that loose flowing clothing took up memory.\n\nShao Kahn originated as an unplayable boss character in ''MKII''. He is fought as a boss (in most cases, the final boss) in most of his appearances, but became a [[player character]] for the first time in the home ports of ''MK3'' as an unlockable character. He would also be playable in the home ports of ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'', the Nintendo GameCube and [[PlayStation Portable]] versions of ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'', ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon'' and ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe''. Shao Kahn also appears as a playable character in ''Mortal Kombat 11'' via DLC. In ''Mortal Kombat'' (2011), Shao Kahn is once again a non-playable boss. He is also the final boss in the [[beat 'em up]] spin-off, ''Shaolin Monks''.\n\nShao Kahn's special moves consist mainly of powerful shoulder barges, magical projectiles, and attacks with his signature giant [[War hammer|maul]], the \"Wrath Hammer\". In some of his appearances as a boss, blocking Kahn's attacks will stun the player. Since his debut, his signature tactic has been taunting players before, during, and after rounds with such statements as \"''Feel the power of Shao Kahn!''\", \"''Bow to me!''\" and \"''It's official, you suck!\"'' {{-}}\n\n===Other appearances===\n[[Image:Shaokahnannihaltion.png|thumb|upright|[[Brian Thompson]] as Shao Kahn in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'']]\n\nShao Kahn makes his first appearance in [[Mortal Kombat (comics)|''MK'' comic books]] during the ''Battlewave'' miniseries by [[Malibu Comics]], though he already was present in the first, ''Blood & Thunder''. Shao Kahn remained mostly faithful to his game counterpart, being the Emperor of Outworld and attempting to take Earthrealm for himself. In ''Battlewave'', Shao Kahn would arrange a different plan to open the portals. He kidnaps [[Sonya Blade]] and, by means of hypnosis and brainwashing, convinces her to marry him; the marriage would weaken the barriers between realms enough to allow Shao Kahn to seize Earth easily (and make Sonya the queen of both realms and his wife). During these two series, he never appears wielding his trademark helmet (instead, he is always shown with his visible face and design taken from the official ''Mortal Kombat II'' comic by John Tobias), and he is seen wearing his helmet only in the comic ''Kitana & Mileena'' (according to which he actually loves Kitana).\n\nShao Kahn appears in both ''Mortal Kombat'' films. In the 1995 [[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|first movie]] he is referred to simply as \"The Emperor\" and makes a brief appearance at the end, as a special effect and voiced by [[Frank Welker]]. Kahn (his name, incorrectly hyphenated in the closing credits of ''Annihilation'', was additionally misspelled as \"Shoa-Kahn\" on the DVD release's fight scenes menu), played by [[Brian Thompson]], is the main antagonist in the 1997 sequel, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]''. In the film he fights [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]], [[Johnny Cage]] and [[Liu Kang]]. He brutally kills Johnny Cage in the film's opening scene, murders his own allies Rain and Jade in cold blood and then Raiden (later brought back to life) near the end prior to his final fight with Liu Kang. In addition, Kahn and Raiden were portrayed as brothers, with Shinnok as their father, though neither of them shared any relation in the games (with the exception of ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe'' in which Raiden's biography states that the two are brothers, although the game itself is non-canon). The only subplot taken directly from the games' storyline was his past relationship with Kitana and Sindel; a segment in the film featured Kitana, imprisoned in Kahn's fortress, mentioning the destruction of her family and Sindel's subsequent suicide under his rule.\n\nHe was played by Jeffrey D. Harris<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/16/arts/pop-review-heroes-in-outworld-fighting-to-save-the-earth.html |title=POP REVIEW; Heroes in Outworld, Fighting to Save the Earth - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1995-09-16 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref> and Ted Nordblum in the 1995-1996 stage show ''[[Mortal Kombat: Live Tour]]''. A Shao Kahn [[action figure]] was released in 1996 by Toy Island in the ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' series.<ref>{{cite web|author=Captain Coder |url=http://www.figurerealm.com/actionfigure.php?FID=11603&figure=shaokahn |title=Shao Kahn Action Figure Gallery |publisher=Figure Realm |date= |accessdate=2013-07-20}}</ref> He was also one of the characters featured in the collectible card game ''[[Mortal Kombat Kard Game]]''.\n\nShao Kahn was played by [[Jeffrey Meek]] (who also played Raiden) in the TV series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]''. Despite having lost much of his physical stature from the games and movies, the character has a much more threatening disposition, serving as the mediator of the Mortal Kombat matches. Meek played opposite himself in the series finale, where Kahn battles Raiden in a void seemingly between the realms. With Kung Lao dead, Shao Kahn forces Raiden into submission and commenced full military assault on Earthrealm. The series was discontinued following this event.\n\nHe also makes several appearances in the cartoon series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'', in his usual role of Outworld's emperor and the leader of enemy forces. He was voiced by [[John Vernon]] and [[Michael Des Barres]] in separate episodes.\n\n[[Aleks Paunovic]] portrayed an unmasked (human) Shao Kahn for the web series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]'' two-part episode \"Kitana & Mileena\", dealing with his early rule over the conquered Edenia and an alternate version of his relationship to Sindel, Kitana and Mileena. {{-}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{quote box|Fans of ''Mortal Kombat'' expect a certain level of brutality, what with all the grisly stage finishers and gory [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]].
