In 1982, the [[International Court of Justice]] ruled in Libya's favor in the partition of the oil-rich continental shelf it shares with Tunisia. Libya's 1985 expulsion of Tunisian workers and military threats led Tunisia to sever relations. Relations were normalized again in 1987. While supporting the [[United Nations]] sanctions imposed following airline bombings, Tunisia has been careful to maintain positive relations with its neighbor.

In each case, however, relations warmed again quickly, reflecting strong bilateral ties. The United States and Tunisia have an active schedule of joint military exercises. U.S. security assistance historically has played an important role in cementing relations.

The PLO Political Department remains in [[Tunis]].\n\nTunisia consistently has played a moderating role in the negotiations for a comprehensive Middle East peace.

Mattresses may consist of a [[Quilting|quilted]] or similarly fastened case, usually of heavy cloth, that contains materials such as hair, straw, cotton, foam rubber, or a framework of metal springs.<ref name=def>{{ cite web| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mattress?fromAsk=true&o=100074 |title=Mattress |publisher =Dictionary.com |accessdate=2012-05-26}}</ref> Mattresses may also be filled with air<ref name=def/> or water.\n\nMattresses are usually placed on top of a [[bed base]] which may be solid, as in the case of a [[platform bed]], or [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], such as an upholstered wood and wire [[box spring]] or a slatted foundation.

Divans have at least one innerspring layer as well as cushioning materials. They may be supplied with a secondary mattress and/or a removable \"topper.\" Mattresses may also be filled with air or water, or a variety of [[natural fiber]]s, such as in [[futon]]s.

In the first half of the 20th century, a typical mattress sold in North America had an innerspring core and cotton [[Batting (material)|batting]] or [[polyester|fiberfill]]. Modern mattresses usually contain either an inner [[Spring (device)|spring]] core or materials such as [[latex]], [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] or other flexible [[polyurethane]] [[foam]]s. Other fill components include insulator pads over the coils that prevent the bed's upholstery layers from cupping down into the innerspring, as well as polyester fiberfill in the bed's top upholstery layers. In 1899 James Marshall introduced the first individually wrapped pocketed spring coil mattress now commonly known as [[Marshall coil]]s.\n\nIn North America the typical mattress sold today is an innerspring; however there is increasing interest in all-foam beds and so-called hybrid beds, which include both an innerspring and high-end foams such as viscoelastic or latex in the comfort layers. In Europe, polyurethane foam cores and latex cores have long been popular and make up a much larger proportion of the mattresses sold.<ref>Nelles, Barbara. \"[http://bedtimesmagazine.com/2009/07/the-inside-story-foams-and-springs/ The Inside Story].\" ''[http://bedtimesmagazine.com BedTimes Magazine]''. July 2009. Retrieved 2011-9-1</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nA conventional mattress consists of two primary sections \u2013 a ''core'' or \"support layer\" and the ''upholstery'' or \"comfort layer\" \u2013 wrapped in a thick fabric called the ''[[ticking]].''\n\nUpholstery layers cover the mattress and provide cushioning and comfort. The upholstery layer consists of three parts: the insulator, the middle upholstery, and the quilt.\n\n==Sizes==\n{{main article|Bed size}}\nMattresses are typically made to conform to [[bed size|bed sizing]] standards that vary by market.  The size of mattress varies between national standards in width and height and depth. Many countries use non-numeric labels such as \"King\", \"Queen\" or \"Double\" to represent these dimensions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bedfed.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/BedBuyersGuide_2018.pdf|title=National Bed Federation Bed Buyers' Guide|year= 2018|publisher= [[National Bed Federation]]}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Innerspring===\nInnerspring mattresses commonly consist of just the spring core, and the top and bottom upholstery layers.<ref>{{cite book |title=Back and Bed: Ergonomic Aspects of Sleeping |first=Bart |last=Haex |publisher=CRC Press |year= 2005 |isbn=978-0-415-33297-2 |page=57}}</ref>\n\n====Core====\n{{main|Mattress coil}}\nThe core of the mattress supports the sleeper\u2019s body. Modern spring mattress cores, often called \"innersprings\" are made up of steel [[coil spring]]s, or \"coils\".\n\nThe [[American wire gauge|gauge]] of the coils is another factor which determines firmness and support. Coils are measured in quarter increments.  The lower the number, the thicker the spring. In general, higher-quality mattress coils have a 14-gauge (1.63&nbsp;mm) diameter. Coils of 14 to 15.5-gauge (1.63 to 1.37&nbsp;mm) give more easily under pressure, while a 12.5-gauge (1.94&nbsp;mm) coil, the thickest typically available, feels quite firm.\n\nConnections between the coils help the mattress retain its shape. Most coils are connected by interconnecting wires; encased coils are not connected, but the fabric encasement helps preserve the mattress shape.\n\nThere are four types of [[mattress coil]]s:\n* '''Bonnell coils''' are the oldest and most common. First adapted from [[Horse and buggy|buggy seat]] springs of the 19th century, they are still prevalent in mid-priced mattresses. Bonnell springs are a knotted, round-top, hourglass-shaped steel wire coil. When laced together with cross wire helicals, these coils form the simplest innerspring unit, also referred to as a Bonnell unit.\n* '''Offset coils''' are an hourglass type coil on which portions of the top and bottom convolutions have been flattened. In assembling the innerspring unit, these flat segments of wire are hinged together with helical wires. The hinging effect of the unit is designed to conform to body shape. LFK coils are an unknotted offset coil with a cylindrical or columnar shape.\n* '''Continuous coils''' (the Leggett & Platt brand name is \"Mira-coil\") is an innerspring configuration in which the rows of coils are formed from a single piece of wire. They work in a hinging effect similar to that of offset coils.\n* '''[[Marshall coil]]s,''' also known as wrapped or encased coils or '''pocket springs''', are thin-gauge, barrel-shaped, knot-less coils individually encased in fabric pockets\u2014normally a fabric from man-made, non-woven fiber. Some manufacturers pre-compress these coils, which makes the mattress firmer and allows for motion separation between the sides of the bed.  As the springs are not wired together, they work more or less independently: the weight on one spring does not affect its neighbors. More than half the consumers who participated in a survey had chosen to buy pocket spring mattresses.<ref name=which>[http://www.which.co.uk/home-and-garden/home-improvements/guides/choosing-the-best-type-of-mattress/find-the-perfect-bed-mattress/ Which, published by Consumers Association: Mattresses:  Choosing the best type of mattress]</ref>\n\n====Upholstery layers====\nUpholstery layers cover the mattress and provide cushioning and comfort. Some manufacturers call the mattress core the \"support layer\" and the upholstery layer the \"comfort layer\". The upholstery layer consists of three parts: the insulator, the middle upholstery, and the quilt.\n\nThe insulator separates the mattress core from the middle upholstery. It is usually made of fiber or mesh and is intended to keep the middle upholstery in place.\n\nThe middle upholstery comprises all the material between the insulator and the quilt. It is usually made from materials which are intended to provide comfort to the sleeper, including flexible polyurethane foam (which includes convoluted \"egg-crate\" foam), viscoelastic foam, latex foam, felt, polyester fiber, cotton fiber, wool fiber and non-woven fiber pads. In Europe and North America, mattress makers have begun incorporating gel-infused foams, soft-solid gels layered over foam, and poured gels in the top comfort layer of the bed.<ref>James, Gary. \"[http://bedtimesmagazine.com/2012/09/gel-foams-meet-fast-growing-mattress-industry-demand/ Gel foams meet fast-growing demand].\" ''BedTimes Magazine.'' October 2012. Retrieved 2012-9-26.</ref>\n\nThe quilt is the top layer of the mattress. Made of light foam or fibers stitched to the underside of the ticking, it provides a soft surface texture to the mattress and can be found in varying degrees of firmness.\n\n====Foundation====\nThere are three main types of foundation or [[bed base]]:\n* A traditional box spring consists of a rigid frame containing extra heavy duty springs. This foundation is often paired with an innerspring mattress, as it extends the life of the spring unit at the mattress's core.\n* An all-wood foundation usually has seven or eight support slats disposed below [[paperboard]] or [[beaverboard]]. This foundation, variously called a \"no-flex\", \"low-flex\" or ''zero-deflection'' unit, as well as an \"ortho box\", provides support similar to a platform foundation. All-wood foundations have become increasingly prevalent as U.S. mattress makers shifted to super-thick, one-sided mattresses.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nelles |first=Barbara |title=New features rev up steel frames & support systems |journal=BedTimes Magazine |date=February 2012 |url= http://bedtimesmagazine.com/2012/02/new-features-rev-up-steel-frames-support-systems/ |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n* A grid-top foundation is a combination of steel and wood.<!-- Detail? -->\n\nTypically the measurements of a foundation will be about 1-2\" shorter than the measurement of a mattress.\n\n====Fabric cover====\n[[Ticking]] is the protective fabric cover used to encase mattresses and foundations. It is usually designed to coordinate with the foundation border fabric and comes in a wide variety of colors and styles. Mattress fabrics can be knits, damask or printed wovens, or inexpensive non-wovens. During the past decade, along with the rise in popularity of all-foam beds, stretchy knit ticking on the bed's top panel has become a standard look on both innerspring and foam beds. Most ticking is made with polyester yarns. More expensive mattress fabrics may contain a combination of polyester with rayon, cotton, silk, wool or other natural yarns.<ref>Nelles, Barbara.

Retrieved 2011-8-21.</ref>\n\nUntil the early 2000s, beds were normally upholstered with a single fabric. This was usually a damask ticking or, for inexpensive bedsets, a non-woven fabric covering all surfaces of the mattress and foundation. Today's bedsets are covered with up to six different fabrics: A better quality circular knit or woven damask on the top panel\u2014the bed's sleeping surface; a matching or contrasting [usually woven] fabric on the border of the mattress; a matching or contrasting [usually woven] fabric on the foundation side panels; a 'non-skid' woven or non-woven fabric on the surface of the foundation and reverse side of the mattress; and a non-woven dust cover on the under side of the foundation. Some North American mattress producers are beginning to use furniture upholstery fabrics on the bed's borders giving beds a more European, home furnishings look.<ref>Nelles, Barbara.

Latex foam is produced using either the [[Talalay Process|Talalay]] or the [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]] process.<ref>\"The future of foam: An ever-widening sphere of influence. [http://bedtimesmagazine.com ''BedTimes\" Magazine'']. February 2003. Retrieved Aug. 15, 2011.</ref>\n* '''Memory foam:'''   [[Memory foam]] mattresses use conforming viscoelastic foam over firmer polyurethane base foam. Some innerspring mattresses have memory foam in their upholstery layer. Different feels and comfort levels are achieved by varying the thickness, weight and formulation of the viscoelastic foams and the base foams. Latex and memory foam mattresses each provide a unique feel. This type of mattress is good at relieving pressure on painful joints. Many memory foam mattresses are more expensive than standard spring mattresses.  Memory foam is affected by temperature. In a cool bedroom, a memory foam mattress will feel firmer than it does in a warm bedroom. Memory softens and conforms to the sleeper in response to body temperature and body weight. Traditional memory foam molds to the body creating a depression the sleeper must roll out of when changing sleep positions. Mattress manufacturers have responded to this issue by using \"faster response\" memory foams. They spring back more quickly when the sleeper moves. Foam mattresses are also known to generally \"sleep warmer\" than innerspring mattresses. Mattress makers have addressed the issue with \"open-cell\" memory foams, pinhole cored memory foam, gel-infused memory foams, channel-cut foam cores, reticulated foam support layers and other technologies to improve air circulation through all-foam beds.<ref>Nelles, Barbara.

These date to antiquity \u2013 goatskin bladders filled with water were used in Persia at least as early as 3600 BCE \u2013 and gained increased popularity in the 20th century with improved manufacturing.\n\n* '''Air mattress:'''   Air mattresses use one or more air chambers instead of springs to provide support. Quality and price can range from inexpensive ones used occasionally for camping, to high-end luxury beds. Air mattresses designed for typical bedroom use cost about the same as inner-spring mattresses with comparable features. Air bladder construction varies from a simple polyethylene bag to internally baffled, multiple chambers of [[latex]] (vulcanized rubber) or [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]] with bonded cotton exteriors.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://bedtimesmagazine.com/2006/06/whats-in-the-air/|title=What's in the air? {{!}} BedTimes|last=Nelles|first=Barbara|website=bedtimesmagazine.com|access-date=2016-03-08|date=June 2006}}</ref> Mattresses may have a layer of foam above the air chambers for added cushioning, and may be enclosed in a cover. Some such beds are termed soft-sided air beds.  Permanent use adjustable-firmness \"airbeds\" became popular particularly after market leader [[Select Comfort]] began a major marketing campaign around 2001.<ref name=\":1\" /> The original airbed was manufactured by Comfortaire in 1981, which was later purchased by Select Comfort. There are several other manufacturers. Some allow independent adjustment of each side of the bed. They are made in a variety of models from basic, no-frills ones that measure about 7\" in height, to high-profile, 15\" tall hybrids that contain several types of foam, pillow tops, and digital pumps with memory for individual pressure settings. Studies suggest that adjustable-firmness beds are better for back pain.<ref name=\":2\" />  Adjustable-firmness mattresses for medical use have special control mechanisms. In the 1990s self-adjusting air beds that automatically change their pressure periodically, or inflate and deflate several air chambers alternately, were introduced.  The intention of these periodic changes is to reduce problems with decubitus ulcers ([[Bedsore|bed sores]]), though {{As of|2008|lc=on}} the effectiveness of these techniques was still being researched.<ref>[http://www.journalofnursingstudies.com/article/S0020-7489%2807%2900166-6/abstract Alternating pressure air mattresses as prevention for pressure ulcers: A literature review] International Journal of Nursing Studies, Volume 45, Issue 5, Pages 784-801 (May 2008)</ref>  Air mattresses for camping are available which are filled with foam which itself provides little support, but expands when the air valve is opened allowing air to enter, so the mattress (nearly) inflates by itself. This is especially useful for campers who carry their equipment as, unlike with normal air mattresses, no pump is needed for inflating. Available brands include Aerobed, Coleman, [[Therm-a-Rest]] and others.  The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission advises consumers not to let infants sleep on air mattresses. This is motivated by reports of deaths, mostly infants younger than 8 months of age, who were placed to sleep on air mattresses, and either suffocated in a face down position on an air mattress or died due to suffocation after falling into gaps between the mattress and bed frame, or the mattress and adjacent furniture or wall.<ref>[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo50325 Air Mattresses are Not for Infants.] Bethesda, MD: [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]], 2012.</ref>\n* {{Main|Air mattress}}\n* '''Waterbeds:'''   A waterbed is a mattress with water in its interior instead of metal coils or air. Waterbeds can be lined with different layers of fiber to achieve the level of firmness the user desires. Waterbeds are well known for providing support to the spine and other body parts, similar to the other mattress types. There are several options of support which range up to 100% waveless, where the user does not notice he/she is lying upon a waterbed.\n* {{main|Waterbed}}\n\n==Quality==\nMany parameters determine the quality of a mattress. Laboratory test methods have been established for some of these parameters, such as pressure distribution, skin microclimate, hygiene, edge support, and long-term stability. Some of these have been developed by Duncan Bain, working on behalf of the UK's [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]].<ref>Bain, Duncan.

In general, firm mattresses are recommended for stomach and some back sleepers, soft mattresses are recommended for side sleepers, and medium mattresses are recommended for the majority of back sleepers.

A poor quality foam comfort layer can deteriorate noticeably in 1 year, while a quality latex core can last 20 years or more; innerspring cores typically last around 10 years. The comfort layer is almost invariably the first area to fail, which is why mattresses are often double-sided, to extend the lifespan. A separate topper may be used instead of or in addition to a comfort layer, which reduces wear and is replaceable without replacing the entire mattress. The majority of high-end mattresses have a lifespan of between 7\u201310 years but it can last beyond 10 years and more depending on the level of care.\n\nIn the United States, mattress warranties are typically for 10 years or 20 years, sometimes 25 years, though this specifically addresses manufacturing defects and faster-than-normal deterioration, not expected deterioration with time. In the United States, {{as of|2008|lc=yes}} there is a general expectation that mattresses should last about 10 years, and this is the average number of years Americans keep mattresses, though this varies by age group.<ref name=btfindings>{{cite web\n|url=http://bedtimesmagazine.com/2008/04/better-sleep-council-consumer-research-findings-on-mattresses-and-sleep/\n|title=Oklahoma State University research shows the importance of new mattress\n|publisher=[[BedTimes]]\n|date=April 2008\n}}</ref> This expectation is based on a number of factors, including sales pitches; the expectation that mattresses will last the length of their warranty, hence 10 years or 20 years, accordingly; and comparison with other household items.<ref name=btfindings/>\n\nThe mattress replacement cycle is a key driver of income and profits for the mattress industry \u2013 a 5-year replacement cycle yields double the sales of a 10-year replacement cycle, for instance \u2013 so the mattress industry has a financial incentive to shorten the replacement cycle.

These are prevented by proper support, rotation and flipping, keeping it dry, and using a mattress pad or protector. Some symptoms of a broken or worn-out mattress include springs which can be felt poking through the upholstery layer, visible permanent sagging or deformity, lumpiness, and excessive squeaking.\n\nMattresses require a solid foundation which does not itself sag \u2013 a sagging foundation, such as by weak slats on a wide bed, will in turn cause the mattress to sag. Consistently sleeping in the same place and body position causes excessive wear, and thus rotating or flipping mattresses is used to reduce this: double-sided mattresses can be alternately flipped width-wise (about the long axis) and length-wise (about the shorter axis), or alternately flipped and rotated; while single-sided mattresses are only rotated, which is simpler but less effective. Flipping/rotation schedules vary between materials and manufacturers, but typically recommended is monthly for the first six months and every two or three months thereafter. Foundations should also be rotated, if possible, though less frequently \u2013 rotating box springs twice a year is recommended. While sagging is undesirable, some level of indentation (about {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}}) is natural if natural materials are used in a comfort layer.\n\nExcessive wear on mattresses can occur when folding and bending takes place, placing heavy objects in one spot, or excess force on the handles, will also cause more rapid deterioration. Care should particularly be taken during transport or storage.\n\nMattresses require ventilation to remain dry and prevent mildew, and thus should not be placed directly on the floor or on a solid surface \u2013 slats or a box spring provide space for airflow, while solid wood or plywood (as in cheap [[bunkie board]]s) does not. Additional ventilation is recommended for natural materials, in which case leaving the mattress \"naked\" after stripping sheets (for example while laundering) is recommended. If a mattress is allowed to become damp, for example by wet cleaning, mildew may develop inside the upholstery; cleaning with a [[vacuum cleaner]] or mild surface cleanser and a slightly damp cloth avoids this.\n\nMattresses absorb fluids and stains readily, notably from nightly sweating (which results in a yellow stain), [[semen|seminal]] (or [[Cowper's fluid|Cowper]]) stains which are darker,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silenieks | first1 = Edmund | last2 = Kobus | first2 = Hilton J. | last3 = Scharnberg | first3 = Jordana | year = 2002 | title = Improving the effectiveness of fluorescence for the detection of semen stains on fabrics | url = | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 4| pages = 1\u20135 }}</ref> [[menstruation|menstrual fluid]]s which are dark red,<ref>Richman, Gina S., et al. \"Simulation procedures for teaching independent menstrual care to mentally retarded persons.\" Applied research in mental retardation 7.1 (1986): 21-35.</ref> and other bodily fluids in addition to accidental spills. These visibly stain the ticking and seep through into lower layers. In addition to being unhygienic, hard to launder, and unsightly, such stains typically void a warranty. Thus a [[mattress protector]] is suggested to protect the mattress; this can be removed and cleaned separately, and replaced if damaged.\n\n==Industry==\nCompanies often specialize in a particular type of mattress, such as innerspring, latex, and airbed, although as latex and airbeds have become more popular, they have become more common.\n\nMattresses which are mostly the same are often sold under different brand names;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/your-money/10haggler.html|title=Mattress Complaints: It's Going to Be a Bumpy Night|last=Segal|first=David|date=2010-10-09|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> two of the largest brands, [[Serta (company)|Serta]] and [[Simmons Bedding Company|Simmons]], became owned by the same company after a private equity buyout.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/business/economy/05simmons.html|title=At Simmons, Bought, Drained and Sold, Then Sent to Bankruptcy|last=Creswell|first=Julie|date=2009-10-04|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> Simmons, founded in the late 1800s, was bought and sold multiple times and faced bankruptcy after a major decline in the bedding industry in the 2000s.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[International Sleep Products Association]] was founded in 1915 and releases a report on U.S. mattress sales.

In the first half of the 20th century, a typical mattress sold in North America had an innerspring core and cotton [[Batting (material)|batting]] or [[polyester|fiberfill]]. Modern mattresses usually contain either an inner [[Spring (device)|spring]] core or materials such as [[latex]], [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] or other flexible [[polyurethane]] [[foam]]s. Other fill components include insulator pads over the coils that prevent the bed's upholstery layers from cupping down into the innerspring, as well as polyester fiberfill in the bed's top upholstery layers. In 1899 James Marshall introduced the first individually wrapped pocketed spring coil mattress now commonly known as [[Marshall coil]]s.\n\nIn North America the typical mattress sold today is an innerspring; however there is increasing interest in all-foam beds and so-called hybrid beds, which include both an innerspring and high-end foams such as viscoelastic or latex in the comfort layers. In Europe, polyurethane foam cores and latex cores have long been popular and make up a much larger proportion of the mattresses sold.<ref>Nelles, Barbara. \"[http://bedtimesmagazine.com/2009/07/the-inside-story-foams-and-springs/ The Inside Story].\" ''[http://bedtimesmagazine.com BedTimes Magazine]''.

The upholstery layer consists of three parts: the insulator, the middle upholstery, and the quilt.\n\n==Sizes==\n{{main article|Bed size}}\nMattresses are typically made to conform to [[bed size|bed sizing]] standards that vary by market.  The size of mattress varies between national standards in width and height and depth. Many countries use non-numeric labels such as \"King\", \"Queen\" or \"Double\" to represent these dimensions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bedfed.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/BedBuyersGuide_2018.pdf|title=National Bed Federation Bed Buyers' Guide|year= 2018|publisher= [[National Bed Federation]]}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Innerspring===\nInnerspring mattresses commonly consist of just the spring core, and the top and bottom upholstery layers.<ref>{{cite book |title=Back and Bed: Ergonomic Aspects of Sleeping |first=Bart |last=Haex |publisher=CRC Press |year= 2005 |isbn=978-0-415-33297-2 |page=57}}</ref>\n\n====Core====\n{{main|Mattress coil}}\nThe core of the mattress supports the sleeper\u2019s body. Modern spring mattress cores, often called \"innersprings\" are made up of steel [[coil spring]]s, or \"coils\".\n\nThe [[American wire gauge|gauge]] of the coils is another factor which determines firmness and support. Coils are measured in quarter increments.  The lower the number, the thicker the spring. In general, higher-quality mattress coils have a 14-gauge (1.63&nbsp;mm) diameter. Coils of 14 to 15.5-gauge (1.63 to 1.37&nbsp;mm) give more easily under pressure, while a 12.5-gauge (1.94&nbsp;mm) coil, the thickest typically available, feels quite firm.\n\nConnections between the coils help the mattress retain its shape. Most coils are connected by interconnecting wires; encased coils are not connected, but the fabric encasement helps preserve the mattress shape.\n\nThere are four types of [[mattress coil]]s:\n* '''Bonnell coils''' are the oldest and most common. First adapted from [[Horse and buggy|buggy seat]] springs of the 19th century, they are still prevalent in mid-priced mattresses. Bonnell springs are a knotted, round-top, hourglass-shaped steel wire coil. When laced together with cross wire helicals, these coils form the simplest innerspring unit, also referred to as a Bonnell unit.\n* '''Offset coils''' are an hourglass type coil on which portions of the top and bottom convolutions have been flattened. In assembling the innerspring unit, these flat segments of wire are hinged together with helical wires. The hinging effect of the unit is designed to conform to body shape. LFK coils are an unknotted offset coil with a cylindrical or columnar shape.\n* '''Continuous coils''' (the Leggett & Platt brand name is \"Mira-coil\") is an innerspring configuration in which the rows of coils are formed from a single piece of wire. They work in a hinging effect similar to that of offset coils.\n* '''[[Marshall coil]]s,''' also known as wrapped or encased coils or '''pocket springs''', are thin-gauge, barrel-shaped, knot-less coils individually encased in fabric pockets\u2014normally a fabric from man-made, non-woven fiber. Some manufacturers pre-compress these coils, which makes the mattress firmer and allows for motion separation between the sides of the bed.  As the springs are not wired together, they work more or less independently: the weight on one spring does not affect its neighbors. More than half the consumers who participated in a survey had chosen to buy pocket spring mattresses.<ref name=which>[http://www.which.co.uk/home-and-garden/home-improvements/guides/choosing-the-best-type-of-mattress/find-the-perfect-bed-mattress/ Which, published by Consumers Association: Mattresses:  Choosing the best type of mattress]</ref>\n\n====Upholstery layers====\nUpholstery layers cover the mattress and provide cushioning and comfort. Some manufacturers call the mattress core the \"support layer\" and the upholstery layer the \"comfort layer\". The upholstery layer consists of three parts: the insulator, the middle upholstery, and the quilt.\n\nThe insulator separates the mattress core from the middle upholstery. It is usually made of fiber or mesh and is intended to keep the middle upholstery in place.\n\nThe middle upholstery comprises all the material between the insulator and the quilt. It is usually made from materials which are intended to provide comfort to the sleeper, including flexible polyurethane foam (which includes convoluted \"egg-crate\" foam), viscoelastic foam, latex foam, felt, polyester fiber, cotton fiber, wool fiber and non-woven fiber pads. In Europe and North America, mattress makers have begun incorporating gel-infused foams, soft-solid gels layered over foam, and poured gels in the top comfort layer of the bed.<ref>James, Gary. \"[http://bedtimesmagazine.com/2012/09/gel-foams-meet-fast-growing-mattress-industry-demand/ Gel foams meet fast-growing demand].\" ''BedTimes Magazine.'' October 2012. Retrieved 2012-9-26.</ref>\n\nThe quilt is the top layer of the mattress. Made of light foam or fibers stitched to the underside of the ticking, it provides a soft surface texture to the mattress and can be found in varying degrees of firmness.\n\n====Foundation====\nThere are three main types of foundation or [[bed base]]:\n* A traditional box spring consists of a rigid frame containing extra heavy duty springs. This foundation is often paired with an innerspring mattress, as it extends the life of the spring unit at the mattress's core.\n* An all-wood foundation usually has seven or eight support slats disposed below [[paperboard]] or [[beaverboard]]. This foundation, variously called a \"no-flex\", \"low-flex\" or ''zero-deflection'' unit, as well as an \"ortho box\", provides support similar to a platform foundation. All-wood foundations have become increasingly prevalent as U.S. mattress makers shifted to super-thick, one-sided mattresses.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nelles |first=Barbara |title=New features rev up steel frames & support systems |journal=BedTimes Magazine |date=February 2012 |url= http://bedtimesmagazine.com/2012/02/new-features-rev-up-steel-frames-support-systems/ |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n* A grid-top foundation is a combination of steel and wood.<!-- Detail? -->\n\nTypically the measurements of a foundation will be about 1-2\" shorter than the measurement of a mattress.\n\n====Fabric cover====\n[[Ticking]] is the protective fabric cover used to encase mattresses and foundations. It is usually designed to coordinate with the foundation border fabric and comes in a wide variety of colors and styles. Mattress fabrics can be knits, damask or printed wovens, or inexpensive non-wovens. During the past decade, along with the rise in popularity of all-foam beds, stretchy knit ticking on the bed's top panel has become a standard look on both innerspring and foam beds. Most ticking is made with polyester yarns. More expensive mattress fabrics may contain a combination of polyester with rayon, cotton, silk, wool or other natural yarns.<ref>Nelles, Barbara.

This was usually a damask ticking or, for inexpensive bedsets, a non-woven fabric covering all surfaces of the mattress and foundation. Today's bedsets are covered with up to six different fabrics: A better quality circular knit or woven damask on the top panel\u2014the bed's sleeping surface; a matching or contrasting [usually woven] fabric on the border of the mattress; a matching or contrasting [usually woven] fabric on the foundation side panels; a 'non-skid' woven or non-woven fabric on the surface of the foundation and reverse side of the mattress; and a non-woven dust cover on the under side of the foundation. Some North American mattress producers are beginning to use furniture upholstery fabrics on the bed's borders giving beds a more European, home furnishings look.<ref>Nelles, Barbara.

Retrieved Aug. 15, 2011.</ref>\n* '''Memory foam:'''   [[Memory foam]] mattresses use conforming viscoelastic foam over firmer polyurethane base foam. Some innerspring mattresses have memory foam in their upholstery layer. Different feels and comfort levels are achieved by varying the thickness, weight and formulation of the viscoelastic foams and the base foams. Latex and memory foam mattresses each provide a unique feel. This type of mattress is good at relieving pressure on painful joints. Many memory foam mattresses are more expensive than standard spring mattresses.  Memory foam is affected by temperature. In a cool bedroom, a memory foam mattress will feel firmer than it does in a warm bedroom. Memory softens and conforms to the sleeper in response to body temperature and body weight. Traditional memory foam molds to the body creating a depression the sleeper must roll out of when changing sleep positions. Mattress manufacturers have responded to this issue by using \"faster response\" memory foams. They spring back more quickly when the sleeper moves. Foam mattresses are also known to generally \"sleep warmer\" than innerspring mattresses. Mattress makers have addressed the issue with \"open-cell\" memory foams, pinhole cored memory foam, gel-infused memory foams, channel-cut foam cores, reticulated foam support layers and other technologies to improve air circulation through all-foam beds.<ref>Nelles, Barbara.

These date to antiquity \u2013 goatskin bladders filled with water were used in Persia at least as early as 3600 BCE \u2013 and gained increased popularity in the 20th century with improved manufacturing.\n\n* '''Air mattress:'''   Air mattresses use one or more air chambers instead of springs to provide support. Quality and price can range from inexpensive ones used occasionally for camping, to high-end luxury beds. Air mattresses designed for typical bedroom use cost about the same as inner-spring mattresses with comparable features. Air bladder construction varies from a simple polyethylene bag to internally baffled, multiple chambers of [[latex]] (vulcanized rubber) or [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]] with bonded cotton exteriors.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://bedtimesmagazine.com/2006/06/whats-in-the-air/|title=What's in the air? {{!}} BedTimes|last=Nelles|first=Barbara|website=bedtimesmagazine.com|access-date=2016-03-08|date=June 2006}}</ref> Mattresses may have a layer of foam above the air chambers for added cushioning, and may be enclosed in a cover. Some such beds are termed soft-sided air beds.  Permanent use adjustable-firmness \"airbeds\" became popular particularly after market leader [[Select Comfort]] began a major marketing campaign around 2001.<ref name=\":1\" /> The original airbed was manufactured by Comfortaire in 1981, which was later purchased by Select Comfort. There are several other manufacturers. Some allow independent adjustment of each side of the bed. They are made in a variety of models from basic, no-frills ones that measure about 7\" in height, to high-profile, 15\" tall hybrids that contain several types of foam, pillow tops, and digital pumps with memory for individual pressure settings. Studies suggest that adjustable-firmness beds are better for back pain.<ref name=\":2\" />  Adjustable-firmness mattresses for medical use have special control mechanisms. In the 1990s self-adjusting air beds that automatically change their pressure periodically, or inflate and deflate several air chambers alternately, were introduced.  The intention of these periodic changes is to reduce problems with decubitus ulcers ([[Bedsore|bed sores]]), though {{As of|2008|lc=on}} the effectiveness of these techniques was still being researched.<ref>[http://www.journalofnursingstudies.com/article/S0020-7489%2807%2900166-6/abstract Alternating pressure air mattresses as prevention for pressure ulcers: A literature review] International Journal of Nursing Studies, Volume 45, Issue 5, Pages 784-801 (May 2008)</ref>  Air mattresses for camping are available which are filled with foam which itself provides little support, but expands when the air valve is opened allowing air to enter, so the mattress (nearly) inflates by itself. This is especially useful for campers who carry their equipment as, unlike with normal air mattresses, no pump is needed for inflating. Available brands include Aerobed, Coleman, [[Therm-a-Rest]] and others.  The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission advises consumers not to let infants sleep on air mattresses. This is motivated by reports of deaths, mostly infants younger than 8 months of age, who were placed to sleep on air mattresses, and either suffocated in a face down position on an air mattress or died due to suffocation after falling into gaps between the mattress and bed frame, or the mattress and adjacent furniture or wall.<ref>[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo50325 Air Mattresses are Not for Infants.] Bethesda, MD: [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]], 2012.</ref>\n* {{Main|Air mattress}}\n* '''Waterbeds:'''   A waterbed is a mattress with water in its interior instead of metal coils or air. Waterbeds can be lined with different layers of fiber to achieve the level of firmness the user desires. Waterbeds are well known for providing support to the spine and other body parts, similar to the other mattress types. There are several options of support which range up to 100% waveless, where the user does not notice he/she is lying upon a waterbed.\n* {{main|Waterbed}}\n\n==Quality==\nMany parameters determine the quality of a mattress. Laboratory test methods have been established for some of these parameters, such as pressure distribution, skin microclimate, hygiene, edge support, and long-term stability. Some of these have been developed by Duncan Bain, working on behalf of the UK's [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]].<ref>Bain, Duncan.

In general, firm mattresses are recommended for stomach and some back sleepers, soft mattresses are recommended for side sleepers, and medium mattresses are recommended for the majority of back sleepers.

A poor quality foam comfort layer can deteriorate noticeably in 1 year, while a quality latex core can last 20 years or more; innerspring cores typically last around 10 years. The comfort layer is almost invariably the first area to fail, which is why mattresses are often double-sided, to extend the lifespan. A separate topper may be used instead of or in addition to a comfort layer, which reduces wear and is replaceable without replacing the entire mattress. The majority of high-end mattresses have a lifespan of between 7\u201310 years but it can last beyond 10 years and more depending on the level of care.\n\nIn the United States, mattress warranties are typically for 10 years or 20 years, sometimes 25 years, though this specifically addresses manufacturing defects and faster-than-normal deterioration, not expected deterioration with time. In the United States, {{as of|2008|lc=yes}} there is a general expectation that mattresses should last about 10 years, and this is the average number of years Americans keep mattresses, though this varies by age group.<ref name=btfindings>{{cite web\n|url=http://bedtimesmagazine.com/2008/04/better-sleep-council-consumer-research-findings-on-mattresses-and-sleep/\n|title=Oklahoma State University research shows the importance of new mattress\n|publisher=[[BedTimes]]\n|date=April 2008\n}}</ref> This expectation is based on a number of factors, including sales pitches; the expectation that mattresses will last the length of their warranty, hence 10 years or 20 years, accordingly; and comparison with other household items.<ref name=btfindings/>\n\nThe mattress replacement cycle is a key driver of income and profits for the mattress industry \u2013 a 5-year replacement cycle yields double the sales of a 10-year replacement cycle, for instance \u2013 so the mattress industry has a financial incentive to shorten the replacement cycle.

These are prevented by proper support, rotation and flipping, keeping it dry, and using a mattress pad or protector. Some symptoms of a broken or worn-out mattress include springs which can be felt poking through the upholstery layer, visible permanent sagging or deformity, lumpiness, and excessive squeaking.\n\nMattresses require a solid foundation which does not itself sag \u2013 a sagging foundation, such as by weak slats on a wide bed, will in turn cause the mattress to sag. Consistently sleeping in the same place and body position causes excessive wear, and thus rotating or flipping mattresses is used to reduce this: double-sided mattresses can be alternately flipped width-wise (about the long axis) and length-wise (about the shorter axis), or alternately flipped and rotated; while single-sided mattresses are only rotated, which is simpler but less effective. Flipping/rotation schedules vary between materials and manufacturers, but typically recommended is monthly for the first six months and every two or three months thereafter. Foundations should also be rotated, if possible, though less frequently \u2013 rotating box springs twice a year is recommended. While sagging is undesirable, some level of indentation (about {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}}) is natural if natural materials are used in a comfort layer.\n\nExcessive wear on mattresses can occur when folding and bending takes place, placing heavy objects in one spot, or excess force on the handles, will also cause more rapid deterioration. Care should particularly be taken during transport or storage.\n\nMattresses require ventilation to remain dry and prevent mildew, and thus should not be placed directly on the floor or on a solid surface \u2013 slats or a box spring provide space for airflow, while solid wood or plywood (as in cheap [[bunkie board]]s) does not. Additional ventilation is recommended for natural materials, in which case leaving the mattress \"naked\" after stripping sheets (for example while laundering) is recommended. If a mattress is allowed to become damp, for example by wet cleaning, mildew may develop inside the upholstery; cleaning with a [[vacuum cleaner]] or mild surface cleanser and a slightly damp cloth avoids this.\n\nMattresses absorb fluids and stains readily, notably from nightly sweating (which results in a yellow stain), [[semen|seminal]] (or [[Cowper's fluid|Cowper]]) stains which are darker,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silenieks | first1 = Edmund | last2 = Kobus | first2 = Hilton J. | last3 = Scharnberg | first3 = Jordana | year = 2002 | title = Improving the effectiveness of fluorescence for the detection of semen stains on fabrics | url = | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 4| pages = 1\u20135 }}</ref> [[menstruation|menstrual fluid]]s which are dark red,<ref>Richman, Gina S., et al. \"Simulation procedures for teaching independent menstrual care to mentally retarded persons.\" Applied research in mental retardation 7.1 (1986): 21-35.</ref> and other bodily fluids in addition to accidental spills. These visibly stain the ticking and seep through into lower layers. In addition to being unhygienic, hard to launder, and unsightly, such stains typically void a warranty. Thus a [[mattress protector]] is suggested to protect the mattress; this can be removed and cleaned separately, and replaced if damaged.\n\n==Industry==\nCompanies often specialize in a particular type of mattress, such as innerspring, latex, and airbed, although as latex and airbeds have become more popular, they have become more common.\n\nMattresses which are mostly the same are often sold under different brand names;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/your-money/10haggler.html|title=Mattress Complaints: It's Going to Be a Bumpy Night|last=Segal|first=David|date=2010-10-09|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> two of the largest brands, [[Serta (company)|Serta]] and [[Simmons Bedding Company|Simmons]], became owned by the same company after a private equity buyout.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/business/economy/05simmons.html|title=At Simmons, Bought, Drained and Sold, Then Sent to Bankruptcy|last=Creswell|first=Julie|date=2009-10-04|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> Simmons, founded in the late 1800s, was bought and sold multiple times and faced bankruptcy after a major decline in the bedding industry in the 2000s.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[International Sleep Products Association]] was founded in 1915 and releases a report on U.S. mattress sales.

The concept was introduced by sociologists [[John H. Gagnon]] and [[William Simon (sociologist)|William Simon]] in their 1973 book ''Sexual Conduct''. The idea highlights three levels of scripting: cultural/historical, social/interactive and personal/intrapsychic. It draws from a range of theories including [[symbolic interactionism]], discourse theory and [[feminism]].<!-- It is the foundation of the new Critical Sexualities Studies and the reshaping of the field of sexualities studies in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century.--> The theory of sexual scripting brings sociological, cultural, anthropological, historical and social psychological tools to the study of human sexualities. Whereas human sexuality is usually seen as the province of the biologist and the clinician, scripting helps research and analysis to understand sexualities as less biological and more cultural, historical and social.\n\n== Sexual script ==\nSexual scripting suggests the importance of meanings and symbols in human sexuality. According to Gagnon and Simon, scripts can be layered through three dimensions: 'cultural scenarios', 'interpersonal scenarios', and 'intrapsychic scenarios'. Sexual feeling does not simply happen from within the body, but needs meanings and symbols which provide cues and clues to enable sexualities to develop. Cultural scenarios are linked to different historical periods and social change; scripts can be shown to change with the arrival of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s, for example (Epstein, Lauman ...). Interpersonal scenarios are linked to encounters and interactions (for example in rape, as illustrated in the early work of [[Stevi Jackson]]). And intra-psychic scenarios indicate the ways in which personal sexual 'turn ons' and imageries grow.<!-- (cf [[William Simon (sociologist)|William Simon]]'s)--> Sexual scripts can be seen as providing guidelines for appropriate sexual behaviour and sexual encounters, as sexual behaviour and encounters are learned through culture and others in interactions. It can be linked to theories of [[sexual desire]] but is critical of the tendency to stress the purely biological aspects of desire.\n\n== Developments==\nDrawing upon [[conversational analysis]],<!--Frith and Kitzinger,--> sexual encounters are considered to be scripted if the parties involved use any of these five linguistic devices:<ref>Hannah Frith, Celia Kitzinger, Reformulating Sexual Script Theory. Theory and Psychology, 11 (2). pp.&nbsp;209\u2013232. Sass, November 2007.</ref>\n* References to predictable stages\n* References to [[common knowledge]]\n* The production of consensus through seamless turn-talking & collaborative talk\n* The use of hypothetical & general instances\n* Active voicing\nResearch on sexual scripts and sexual script theory have concluded that sexual scripts are organised through gender, class, ethnicity and other social vectors.\n\nSexual script theory and its application in clinical practice are founded on the undeniable reality that the subjective understandings of each person about his or her sexuality (and called a sexual script) substantively determine that person's choice of sexual actions and the subsequent qualitative experiencing of those sexual acts. Scripts refer to social functions. They dictate what one should be doing at a particular time and in a particular place if one is to play the role characteristically associated with that script. There may be several people involved in the same situation, but they may differ in the roles that they have been given or have chosen to enact. Script theory is a form of social scripting theory which has been defined clearly by Michael W. Wiederman who says, \"Social scripting theory points to the fact that much of sexual behavior seems to follow a script. Similar to scripts that stage actors use to guide their behavior, social scripts instruct members of a society as to appropriate behavior and the meanings to attach to certain behaviors.\"<ref name=\":0\">Michael Wiederman, The Gendered Nature of Sexual Scripts. The Family Journal, Vol. 13, No. 4, 496-502. Sage Publications, 2005</ref> Social scripting theory directly relates to sexual scripts as it is just a specified example regarding sexual encounters and sexual behavior in social context. [[Social theory]] is also a useful resource in determining the construction of social scripts.\n\n== Social constructionism ==\nThe theory is linked to the wider development of [[social constructionism]] on the socially created nature of social life.<!-- See the social construction of sexuality.--> Social construction is important to sexual script because sexual scripts can come from how a child is raised through the beliefs of social construction.<ref>Social Construction of Gender. http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/ARTH/ARTH200/gender.html</ref> In other words, women are to be subjected to [[male gaze]] in order to be a part of the social construction system and maintain social norms of a long living society.\n\n== Sexuality ==\nSexuality is the behavior of human beings with regard to the activities that causes or is associated with sexual arousal. It is influenced by the genetically inherited sexual response patterns, societal attitudes toward sex, and each individual's upbringing. \"Physiology sets only very broad limits on human sexuality; most of the enormous variation found among humans results from learning and conditioning. What is deviant in one society may be normal in another. Sexuality covers gender identity, sexual orientation, and actual practices, as well as one's acceptance of these aspects of one's personality, which may be more important than their specifics.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/reproductive-health |title = Answers - the Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions}}</ref>\n\n== Sexual norms ==\nA [[sexual norm]] can be an individual or a social norm, which is a rule that is socially enforced. Norms affect a wide variety of human behavior.\nSocial norms regarding sexuality are present in most cultures. For example, the norm in most cultures consists of heterosexual acts between married individuals. Sexual norms are constantly changing and normal sexual behavior is a spectrum and cannot be rigidly defined. \nDeviance from normal sexual behavior is common and can be classified in several ways. If non-restrictive sexual norms are regarded positively they may be called \"sexual freedom\", \"sexual liberation\", or \"free love\". If regarded negatively they may be called \"sexual license\" or \"licentiousness\". Restrictive behavior when judged negatively is called \"sexual oppression\"; if judged positively they are called \"chastity\", \"sexual restraint\", The Maritial Effect, or \"sexual decency\".{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\nIn the West, sexual normality can be defined as any sexual practice which does not involve sexual perversions. There has been a liberalization in attitudes which has resulted in the legalization of homosexuality in many countries. There is a tendency in Western countries toward serial monogamy as a normal heterosexual lifestyle.<ref>Stanton L. Jones, Heather R. Hostler, Sexual Script Theory: An Integrative Exploration of the Possibilities and Limits of Sexual Self-Definition. 2002.</ref>\n\nSociologists believe that emotion emerges in relation to dominant sexual scripts and [[sexual identity]]. Sexual script is also believed to have different scripts for males and females in relation to sexual activity. In sexual script's link to sexual activity; sexuality, sexual norms, social construction and gender roles all play a part in what makes sexual script differ between males and females.\n\n== Gender script ==\n{{Main|Gender Script}}\n[[Gender schema theory]] also plays a part in sexual script because studies show that males and females interact in different ways, even from a young age. In 1991, Martha Boston and Gary Levy found that through their research observations, children, primarily boys, were better with being able to sequence own-sex rather than other-sex scripts.<ref>Gary Levy, Martha Boston, Preschoolers' Recall of Own-Sex and Other-Sex Gender Scripts. The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 155(3). pp.&nbsp;369\u2013371. 2001.</ref> \"As well as acquiring knowledge about the sex-role stereotypes of their culture, young children also develop sex-typed attitudes, preferences, and behaviors that pervade many aspects of their lives.\"<ref>Lisa Serbin, Kimberly Powlishta, Judith Gulko, The Development of Sex Typing in Middle Childhood.

The concept was introduced by sociologists [[John H. Gagnon]] and [[William Simon (sociologist)|William Simon]] in their 1973 book ''Sexual Conduct''. The idea highlights three levels of scripting: cultural/historical, social/interactive and personal/intrapsychic. It draws from a range of theories including [[symbolic interactionism]], discourse theory and [[feminism]].<!-- It is the foundation of the new Critical Sexualities Studies and the reshaping of the field of sexualities studies in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century.--> The theory of sexual scripting brings sociological, cultural, anthropological, historical and social psychological tools to the study of human sexualities. Whereas human sexuality is usually seen as the province of the biologist and the clinician, scripting helps research and analysis to understand sexualities as less biological and more cultural, historical and social.\n\n== Sexual script ==\nSexual scripting suggests the importance of meanings and symbols in human sexuality. According to Gagnon and Simon, scripts can be layered through three dimensions: 'cultural scenarios', 'interpersonal scenarios', and 'intrapsychic scenarios'. Sexual feeling does not simply happen from within the body, but needs meanings and symbols which provide cues and clues to enable sexualities to develop. Cultural scenarios are linked to different historical periods and social change; scripts can be shown to change with the arrival of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s, for example (Epstein, Lauman ...). Interpersonal scenarios are linked to encounters and interactions (for example in rape, as illustrated in the early work of [[Stevi Jackson]]). And intra-psychic scenarios indicate the ways in which personal sexual 'turn ons' and imageries grow.<!-- (cf [[William Simon (sociologist)|William Simon]]'s)--> Sexual scripts can be seen as providing guidelines for appropriate sexual behaviour and sexual encounters, as sexual behaviour and encounters are learned through culture and others in interactions. It can be linked to theories of [[sexual desire]] but is critical of the tendency to stress the purely biological aspects of desire.\n\n== Developments==\nDrawing upon [[conversational analysis]],<!--Frith and Kitzinger,--> sexual encounters are considered to be scripted if the parties involved use any of these five linguistic devices:<ref>Hannah Frith, Celia Kitzinger, Reformulating Sexual Script Theory. Theory and Psychology, 11 (2). pp.&nbsp;209\u2013232. Sass, November 2007.</ref>\n* References to predictable stages\n* References to common knowledge\n* The production of consensus through seamless turn-talking & collaborative talk\n* The use of hypothetical & general instances\n* Active voicing\nResearch on sexual scripts and sexual script theory have concluded that sexual scripts are organised through gender, class, ethnicity and other social vectors.\n\nSexual script theory and its application in clinical practice are founded on the undeniable reality that the subjective understandings of each person about his or her sexuality (and called a sexual script) substantively determine that person's choice of sexual actions and the subsequent qualitative experiencing of those sexual acts. Scripts refer to social functions. They dictate what one should be doing at a particular time and in a particular place if one is to play the role characteristically associated with that script. There may be several people involved in the same situation, but they may differ in the roles that they have been given or have chosen to enact. Script theory is a form of social scripting theory which has been defined clearly by Michael W. Wiederman who says, \"Social scripting theory points to the fact that much of sexual behavior seems to follow a script. Similar to scripts that stage actors use to guide their behavior, social scripts instruct members of a society as to appropriate behavior and the meanings to attach to certain behaviors.\"<ref name=\":0\">Michael Wiederman, The Gendered Nature of Sexual Scripts. The Family Journal, Vol. 13, No. 4, 496-502. Sage Publications, 2005</ref> Social scripting theory directly relates to sexual scripts as it is just a specified example regarding sexual encounters and sexual behavior in social context. [[Social theory]] is also a useful resource in determining the construction of social scripts.\n\n== Social constructionism ==\nThe theory is linked to the wider development of [[social constructionism]] on the socially created nature of social life.<!-- See the social construction of sexuality.--> Social construction is important to sexual script because sexual scripts can come from how a child is raised through the beliefs of social construction.<ref>Social Construction of Gender. http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/ARTH/ARTH200/gender.html</ref> In other words, women are to be subjected to [[male gaze]] in order to be a part of the social construction system and maintain social norms of a long living society.\n\n== Sexuality ==\nSexuality is the behavior of human beings with regard to the activities that causes or is associated with sexual arousal. It is influenced by the genetically inherited sexual response patterns, societal attitudes toward sex, and each individual's upbringing. \"Physiology sets only very broad limits on human sexuality; most of the enormous variation found among humans results from learning and conditioning. What is deviant in one society may be normal in another. Sexuality covers gender identity, sexual orientation, and actual practices, as well as one's acceptance of these aspects of one's personality, which may be more important than their specifics.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/reproductive-health |title = Answers - the Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions}}</ref>\n\n== Sexual norms ==\nA [[sexual norm]] can be an individual or a social norm, which is a rule that is socially enforced. Norms affect a wide variety of human behavior.\nSocial norms regarding sexuality are present in most cultures. For example, the norm in most cultures consists of heterosexual acts between married individuals. Sexual norms are constantly changing and normal sexual behavior is a spectrum and cannot be rigidly defined. \nDeviance from normal sexual behavior is common and can be classified in several ways. If non-restrictive sexual norms are regarded positively they may be called \"sexual freedom\", \"sexual liberation\", or \"free love\". If regarded negatively they may be called \"sexual license\" or \"licentiousness\". Restrictive behavior when judged negatively is called \"sexual oppression\"; if judged positively they are called \"chastity\", \"sexual restraint\", The Maritial Effect, or \"sexual decency\".{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\nIn the West, sexual normality can be defined as any sexual practice which does not involve sexual perversions. There has been a liberalization in attitudes which has resulted in the legalization of homosexuality in many countries. There is a tendency in Western countries toward serial monogamy as a normal heterosexual lifestyle.<ref>Stanton L. Jones, Heather R. Hostler, Sexual Script Theory: An Integrative Exploration of the Possibilities and Limits of Sexual Self-Definition. 2002.</ref>\n\nSociologists believe that emotion emerges in relation to dominant sexual scripts and [[sexual identity]]. Sexual script is also believed to have different scripts for males and females in relation to sexual activity. In sexual script's link to sexual activity; sexuality, sexual norms, social construction and gender roles all play a part in what makes sexual script differ between males and females.\n\n== Gender script ==\n{{Main|Gender Script}}\n[[Gender schema theory]] also plays a part in sexual script because studies show that males and females interact in different ways, even from a young age. In 1991, Martha Boston and Gary Levy found that through their research observations, children, primarily boys, were better with being able to sequence own-sex rather than other-sex scripts.<ref>Gary Levy, Martha Boston, Preschoolers' Recall of Own-Sex and Other-Sex Gender Scripts. The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 155(3). pp.&nbsp;369\u2013371. 2001.</ref> \"As well as acquiring knowledge about the sex-role stereotypes of their culture, young children also develop sex-typed attitudes, preferences, and behaviors that pervade many aspects of their lives.\"<ref>Lisa Serbin, Kimberly Powlishta, Judith Gulko, The Development of Sex Typing in Middle Childhood.
