Each friendly unit is made up of two characters (thus referred to as a Pair Unit), though a third character (or \"Solo Unit\") can be added for once-per-battle assistance. Unlike ''Namco \u00d7 Capcom'', units can move freely within their range on the field map, with no penalty for accessing treasure chests or destructible objects prior to attacking.<ref name=\"CharCount\"/>\n\nThe battle system is called the Cross Active Battle System, wherein pressing the A button in combination with the Circle Pad performs up to five basic attack combos. Additional gameplay elements include Support Attack, which allows the player to call in a nearby ally for assistance, and Cross Hit, which freezes the target in place during simultaneous attacks from multiple units. Also, the player can trigger Critical Hits by connecting their next attack just before the target hits the ground after the first. As the player's units deal damage, the player's Cross Power (XP) gauge fills up and can be used for special attacks and defensive moves on the map. Damage done via Cross Hits can fill this gauge up to 150%.<ref name=\"developer\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con117/project_x_zone_gameplay/|title=Project X Zone Gameplay Details|author=Anoop Gantayat|publisher=Andriasang|accessdate=May 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DFHdek0u?url=http://andriasang.com/con117/project_x_zone_gameplay/|archivedate=December 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n''Project X Zone'' has a total of 15 save game slots included in the game, which can be used for recording a save game file during intermissions with a quick save file and a soft reset command.<ref>{{cite web|author=Spencer .

Each friendly unit is made up of two characters (thus referred to as a Pair Unit), though a third character (or \"Solo Unit\") can be added for once-per-battle assistance. Unlike ''Namco \u00d7 Capcom'', units can move freely within their range on the field map, with no penalty for accessing treasure chests or destructible objects prior to attacking.<ref name=\"CharCount\"/>\n\nThe battle system is called the Cross Active Battle System, wherein pressing the A button in combination with the Circle Pad performs up to five basic attack combos. Additional gameplay elements include Support Attack, which allows the player to call in a nearby ally for assistance, and Cross Hit, which freezes the target in place during simultaneous attacks from multiple units. Also, the player can trigger Critical Hits by connecting their next attack just before the target hits the ground after the first. As the player's units deal damage, the player's Cross Power (XP) gauge fills up and can be used for special attacks and defensive moves on the map. Damage done via Cross Hits can fill this gauge up to 150%.<ref name=\"developer\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con117/project_x_zone_gameplay/|title=Project X Zone Gameplay Details|author=Anoop Gantayat|publisher=Andriasang|accessdate=May 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DFHdek0u?url=http://andriasang.com/con117/project_x_zone_gameplay/|archivedate=December 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n''Project X Zone'' has a total of 15 save game slots included in the game, which can be used for recording a save game file during intermissions with a quick save file and a soft reset command.<ref>{{cite web|author=Spencer .

Though costly and labour-intensive, the scheme was still cheaper than the previous plan by Browne and Turner which required 9 viaducts down the Piopiotea River.

Some of the sharp curves are only 7\u00bd chains (150 m) radius. \n\nAlthough [[spiral (railway)|spirals]] are relatively common in the [[Alps]], particularly in [[Switzerland]], they generally involve extensive tunnelling inside mountainsides. A masterly feature of Holmes' layout is the way in which it uses natural land contours to almost eliminate tunnels and viaducts, having only two short tunnels.\n\nLegend has it that a locomotive engineer once put on the emergency brakes of his train in the night upon mistaking the light of his Guard's Van on a nearby part of the spiral as the rear of a different train directly ahead of him.<ref name=JOURNEYCOUNTS>{{cite news|title=Auckland to Wellington: It's the journey that counts|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/auckland-region/news/article.cfm?l_id=117&objectid=10734806|accessdate=28 June 2011|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=28 June 2011|first=Danielle|last=Wright}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[North Island Main Trunk Railway]]\n* [[Raurimu railway station]]\n* [[Spiral (railway)]]\n* [[Spiral tunnels and tunnels on a curved alignment]]\n* [[Tehachapi Loop]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*''North Island Main Trunk: An Illustrated History'' by Bill Pierre (1981, Reed, Wellington) {{ISBN|0-589-01316-5}} (Chapters 12 & 13, pages 42\u201349)\n*''By Design: A brief history of the Public Works Department Ministry of Works 1870\u20131970'' by Rosslyn J.

A masterly feature of Holmes' layout is the way in which it uses natural land contours to almost eliminate tunnels and viaducts, having only two short tunnels.\n\nLegend has it that a locomotive engineer once put on the emergency brakes of his train in the night upon mistaking the light of his Guard's Van on a nearby part of the spiral as the rear of a different train directly ahead of him.<ref name=JOURNEYCOUNTS>{{cite news|title=Auckland to Wellington: It's the journey that counts|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/auckland-region/news/article.cfm?l_id=117&objectid=10734806|accessdate=28 June 2011|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=28 June 2011|first=Danielle|last=Wright}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[North Island Main Trunk Railway]]\n* [[Spiral (railway)]]\n* [[Spiral tunnels and tunnels on a curved alignment]]\n* [[Tehachapi Loop]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*''North Island Main Trunk: An Illustrated History'' by Bill Pierre (1981, Reed, Wellington) {{ISBN|0-589-01316-5}} (Chapters 12 & 13, pages 42\u201349)\n*''By Design: A brief history of the Public Works Department Ministry of Works 1870\u20131970'' by Rosslyn J.

{"title_page": "Weak equivalence (homotopy theory)", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], a '''weak equivalence''' is a notion from [[homotopy theory]] that in some sense identifies objects that have the same \"shape\". This notion is formalized in the [[axiom]]atic definition of a [[model category]].\n\nA model category is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with classes of [[morphism]]s called weak equivalences, [[fibration]]s, and [[cofibration]]s, satisfying several axioms. The associated [[homotopy category]] of a model category has the same objects, but the morphisms are changed in order to make the weak equivalences into [[isomorphism]]s. It is a useful observation that the associated homotopy category depends only on the weak equivalences, not on the fibrations and cofibrations.\n\n==Topological spaces==\nModel categories were defined by [[Daniel Quillen|Quillen]] as an axiomatization of homotopy theory that applies to [[topological space]]s, but also to many other categories in [[abstract algebra|algebra]] and [[geometry]]. The example that started the subject is the category of topological spaces with [[Serre fibration]]s as fibrations and '''weak homotopy equivalences''' as weak equivalences (the cofibrations for this model structure can be described as the [[retract (topology)|retract]]s of relative cell complexes ''X'' \u2286 ''Y''<ref>Hovey (1999), Definition 2.4.3.</ref>). By definition, a [[continuous mapping]] ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' of spaces is called a weak homotopy equivalence if the induced function on sets of [[path component]]s\n:<math>f_*\\colon \\pi_0(X) \\to \\pi_0(Y)</math>\nis [[bijective]], and for every point ''x'' in ''X'' and every ''n'' \u2265 1, the induced [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]]\n:<math>f_*\\colon \\pi_n(X,x) \\to \\pi_n(Y,f(x))</math>\non [[homotopy group]]s is bijective. (For ''X'' and ''Y'' [[path-connected]], the first condition is automatic, and it suffices to state the second condition for a single point ''x'' in ''X''.)\n\nFor [[simply connected]] topological spaces ''X'' and ''Y'', a map ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if the induced homomorphism ''f''<sub>*</sub>: ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>(''X'','''Z''') \u2192 ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>(''Y'','''Z''') on [[singular homology]] groups is bijective for all ''n''.<ref>Hatcher (2002), Theorem 4.32.</ref> Likewise, for simply connected spaces ''X'' and ''Y'', a map ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if the pullback homomorphism ''f''*: ''H''<sup>''n''</sup>(''Y'','''Z''') \u2192 ''H''<sup>''n''</sup>(''X'','''Z''') on [[singular cohomology]] is bijective for all ''n''.<ref>[https://mathoverflow.net/q/57783 Is there the Whitehead theorem for cohomology theory?]</ref>\n\nExample: Let ''X'' be the set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, ...} and let ''Y'' be the set {0} \u222a {1, 1/2, 1/3, ...}, both with the [[subspace topology]] from the [[real line]]. Define ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' by mapping 0 to 0 and ''n'' to 1/''n'' for positive integers ''n''. Then ''f'' is continuous, and in fact a weak homotopy equivalence, but it is not a [[homotopy equivalence]].\n\nThe homotopy category of topological spaces (obtained by inverting the weak homotopy equivalences) greatly simplifies the category of topological spaces. Indeed, this homotopy category is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of [[CW complex]]es with morphisms being [[homotopy class]]es of continuous maps.\n\nMany other model structures on the category of topological spaces have also been considered. For example, in the Str\u00f8m model structure on topological spaces, the fibrations are the [[Hurewicz fibration]]s and the weak equivalences are the homotopy equivalences.<ref>Str\u00f8m (1972).</ref>\n\n==Chain complexes==\nSome other important model categories involve [[chain complex]]es. Let ''A'' be a [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck abelian category]], for example the category of [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or the category of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of [[abelian group]]s on a topological space. Define a category ''C''(''A'') with objects the complexes ''X'' of objects in ''A'',\n:<math>\\cdots\\to X_1\\to X_0\\to X_{-1}\\to\\cdots,</math>\nand morphisms the [[chain map]]s. (It is equivalent to consider \"cochain complexes\" of objects of ''A'', where the numbering is written as\n:<math>\\cdots\\to X^{-1}\\to X^0\\to X^1\\to\\cdots,</math>\nsimply by defining ''X''<sup>''i''</sup> = ''X''<sub>\u2212''i''</sub>.)\n\nThe category ''C''(''A'') has a model structure in which the cofibrations are the [[monomorphism]]s and the weak equivalences are the '''[[quasi-isomorphism]]s'''.<ref>Beke (2000), Proposition 3.13.</ref> By definition, a chain map ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' is a quasi-isomorphism if the induced homomorphism\n:<math>f_*\\colon H_n(X) \\to H_n(Y)</math>\non [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] is an isomorphism for all integers ''n''. (Here ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>(''X'') is the object of ''A'' defined as the [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub> modulo the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of ''X''<sub>''n''+1</sub> \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>.) The resulting homotopy category is called the [[derived category]] ''D''(''A'').\n\n==Trivial fibrations and trivial cofibrations==\nIn any model category, a fibration that is also a weak equivalence is called a '''trivial''' (or '''acyclic''') '''fibration'''.  A cofibration that is also a weak equivalence is called a '''trivial''' (or '''acyclic''') '''cofibration'''.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | author1-first=Tibor | author1-last=Beke | title=Sheafifiable homotopy model categories | journal=[[Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]] | volume=129 | pages=447\u2013473 | year=2000 | mr=1780498 | doi=10.1017/S0305004100004722| arxiv=math/0102087 | bibcode=2000MPCPS.129..447B }}\n*{{Citation | author1-first=Allen | author1-last=Hatcher | author1-link=Allen Hatcher | title=Algebraic Topology | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2002 | url=http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html | isbn=0-521-79540-0 | mr =1867354}}\n*{{Citation | author1-first=Mark | author1-last=Hovey | title=Model Categories | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=1999 | mr=1650134 | isbn=0-8218-1359-5 | url=https://web.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/otherpapers/hovey-model-cats.pdf}}\n*{{Citation | author1-first=Arne | author1-last=Str\u00f8m | title=The homotopy category is a homotopy category | journal=Archiv der Mathematik | volume=23 | pages=435\u2013441 | year=1972 | mr=0321082 | doi=10.1007/BF01304912}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weak Equivalence}}\n[[Category:Homotopy theory]]\n[[Category:Homological algebra]]\n[[Category:Equivalence (mathematics)]]\n", "text_old": "In [[mathematics]], a '''weak equivalence''' is a notion from [[homotopy theory]] that in some sense identifies objects that have the same \"shape\".

Then ''f'' is continuous, and in fact a weak homotopy equivalence, but it is not a [[homotopy equivalence]].\n\nThe homotopy category of topological spaces (obtained by inverting the weak homotopy equivalences) greatly simplifies the category of topological spaces. Indeed, this homotopy category is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of [[CW complex]]es with morphisms being [[homotopy class]]es of continuous maps.\n\nMany other model structures on the category of topological spaces have also been considered. For example, in the Str\u00f8m model structure on topological spaces, the fibrations are the [[Hurewicz fibration]]s and the weak equivalences are the homotopy equivalences.<ref>Str\u00f8m (1972).</ref>\n\n==Chain complexes==\nSome other important model categories involve [[chain complex]]es. Let ''A'' be a [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck abelian category]], for example the category of [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or the category of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of [[abelian group]]s on a topological space. Define a category ''C''(''A'') with objects the complexes ''X'' of objects in ''A'',\n:<math>\\cdots\\to X_1\\to X_0\\to X_{-1}\\to\\cdots,</math>\nand morphisms the [[chain map]]s. (It is equivalent to consider \"cochain complexes\" of objects of ''A'', where the numbering is written as\n:<math>\\cdots\\to X^{-1}\\to X^0\\to X^1\\to\\cdots,</math>\nsimply by defining ''X''<sup>''i''</sup> = ''X''<sub>\u2212''i''</sub>.)\n\nThe category ''C''(''A'') has a model structure in which the cofibrations are the [[monomorphism]]s and the weak equivalences are the '''[[quasi-isomorphism]]s'''.<ref>Beke (2000), Proposition 3.13.</ref> By definition, a chain map ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' is a quasi-isomorphism if the induced homomorphism\n:<math>f_*\\colon H_n(X) \\to H_n(Y)</math>\non [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] is an isomorphism for all integers ''n''. (Here ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>(''X'') is the object of ''A'' defined as the [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub> modulo the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of ''X''<sub>''n''+1</sub> \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>.) The resulting homotopy category is called the [[derived category]] ''D''(''A'').\n\n==Trivial fibrations and trivial cofibrations==\nIn any model category, a fibration that is also a weak equivalence is called a '''trivial''' (or '''acyclic''') '''fibration'''.  A cofibration that is also a weak equivalence is called a '''trivial''' (or '''acyclic''') '''cofibration'''.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | author1-first=Tibor | author1-last=Beke | title=Sheafifiable homotopy model categories | journal=[[Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]] | volume=129 | pages=447\u2013473 | year=2000 | mr=1780498 | doi=10.1017/S0305004100004722| arxiv=math/0102087 | bibcode=2000MPCPS.129..447B }}\n*{{Citation | author1-first=Allen | author1-last=Hatcher | author1-link=Allen Hatcher | title=Algebraic Topology | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2002 | url=http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html | isbn=0-521-79540-0 | mr =1867354}}\n*{{Citation | author1-first=Mark | author1-last=Hovey | title=Model Categories | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=1999 | mr=1650134 | isbn=0-8218-1359-5 | url=https://web.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/otherpapers/hovey-model-cats.pdf}}\n*{{Citation | author1-first=Arne | author1-last=Str\u00f8m | title=The homotopy category is a homotopy category | journal=Archiv der Mathematik | volume=23 | pages=435\u2013441 | year=1972 | mr=0321082 | doi=10.1007/BF01304912}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weak Equivalence}}\n[[Category:Homotopy theory]]\n[[Category:Homological algebra]]\n[[Category:Equivalence (mathematics)]]\n", "name_user": "Tea2min", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTopological spaces:Use minimally more specific redirect.
