Farm sizes vary from anything around 80 acres (32 hectares) to over 8,000. Soil types vary from heavy clays to light sands. Crops grown include [[winter wheat]], [[barley|winter barley]], [[sugar beet]], [[rapeseed|oilseed rape]], winter and [[spring beans]] and [[linseed]], although smaller areas of rye and oats can be found growing in areas with lighter soils along with a variety of vegetables.\n\nThe continuing importance of agriculture in the county is reflected in the [[Suffolk Show]], which is held annually in May at Ipswich.

Unusually for the UK, some of Suffolk had a [[Three-tier education|3-tier school system]] in place with primary schools (ages 5\u20139), [[Middle Schools in England|middle schools]] (ages 9\u201313) and upper schools (ages 13\u201316). However, a 2006 Suffolk County Council study concluded that Suffolk should move to the 2-tier school system used in the majority of the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sudburytoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=850&ArticleID=1912030 |title=Suffolk Free Press |publisher=Sudburytoday.co.uk |date= |accessdate=6 June 2015}}</ref> For the purpose of conversion to 2-tier, the 3-tier system was divided into 4 geographical area groupings and corresponding phases. The first phase was the conversion of schools in Lowestoft and Haverhill in 2011, followed by schools in north and west Suffolk in 2012. The remainder of the changeovers to 2-tier took place from 2013, for those schools that stayed within Local government control, and did not become [[Academy (English school)|Academies]] and/or [[Free school (England)|free schools]]. The majority of schools thus now (2019) operate the more common primary to [[Secondary school|high school]] (11\u201316).\n\nMany of the county's upper schools have a [[sixth form]] and most [[further education]] colleges in the county offer [[A-level]] courses. In terms of school population, Suffolk's individual schools are large with the Ipswich district with the largest school population and Forest Heath the smallest, with just two schools. In 2013, a letter said that \"...nearly a fifth of the schools inspected were judged inadequate. This is unacceptable and now means that Suffolk has a higher proportion of pupils educated in inadequate schools than both the regional and national averages.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/local_authority_reports/Focused_school_insp_letters/Letter%20to%20Suffolk%20DCS%20following%20focused%20school%20inspections.pdf|title=Letter to local authority DCS following focused school inspections|date=|access-date=29 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305093836/http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/local_authority_reports/Focused_school_insp_letters/Letter%20to%20Suffolk%20DCS%20following%20focused%20school%20inspections.pdf|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[The Royal Hospital School]] near Ipswich is the largest independent boarding school in Suffolk.

Having finished second in [[2008 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season|2008]] and third in [[2009 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season|2009]], [[HWA Team]]'s [[Paul di Resta]] became champion for the first time, having come out on top of a three-way title battle in Shanghai.\n\n2010 season would be [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]]'s final season as the sole tyre supplier in [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] as the company announced on 19 November 2010 that it would not renew its contract at the end of the season. After several months of deliberation, [[Hankook Tires|Hankook]] was chosen as the tyre supplier for the 2011 season at the [[Hankook Tires|Hankook Tire]] company meeting in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] on 17 January 2011.\n\n==Season summary==\nDi Resta had trailed teammate [[Bruno Spengler]] \u2013 a race winner at Lausitz and the N\u00fcrburgring \u2013 by as many as fifteen points after four races, but by the ninth race, di Resta had taken the championship lead after five top-two finishes including three wins. A poor finish for di Resta at [[Adria International Raceway|Adria]] \u2013 ninth after being helped into spins by [[Audi]] drivers [[Mike Rockenfeller]] and [[Miguel Molina (racing driver)|Miguel Molina]] \u2013 coupled with Spengler's third place allowed the Canadian driver to take a three-point lead into the final race. Another HWA driver, [[2005 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season|2005]] season champion [[Gary Paffett]] remained in mathematical contention, succeeding in needing a top-two finish at Adria, which left him nine points behind with ten available. Spengler left himself immediately in trouble in Shanghai, crashing during the qualification session which left him 17th on the grid, while di Resta and Paffett lined up on the front row. Spengler could only advance to thirteenth in the race, while his teammates battled for victory. Ultimately, Paffett won the race \u2013 ended early due to a collision between Rockenfeller and [[Susie Wolff|Susie Stoddart]] \u2013 but di Resta's second place allowed him to take the championship by four points. Paffett's victory also enabled him to overhaul Spengler for second place, by just one point.\n\nBest of the rest went to the defending two-time champion [[Timo Scheider]], who finished as top Audi in fourth place in the championship standings. Scheider, albeit scoring in each of the first five races, struggled for form in the early running, but recovered towards the end of the season and took a single victory during the season, winning at Adria. [[Mattias Ekstr\u00f6m]] was the only other Audi driver to win a race during the season, winning the series' inaugural race at Valencia but only returned twice to the podium after that; finishing the season in fifth place. [[Jamie Green]] was the season's other race-winner, winning for the third season in a row at the [[Norisring]], each of which had been taken in a 2008-specification car. Green finished three points behind Ekstr\u00f6m, in sixth place in the points standings.\n\n==Rule changes for 2010==\n* With the championship undergoing a development freeze until the 2011 season, teams will use 2008 and 2009 cars only.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.racer.com/dtm-development-freeze-begins/article/146869/|title=DTM development freeze begins|first=Glenn|last=Freeman|work=[[Racer (magazine)|Racer]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=2009-08-20|accessdate=2010-07-13}}</ref>\n\n==Teams and drivers==\nThe following manufacturers, teams and drivers competed in the 2010 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters.

The season began on 25 April at the [[Hockenheimring]], and ended on 28 November at the [[Shanghai Street Circuit]], after eleven rounds held in Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy and China. Having finished second in [[2008 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season|2008]] and third in [[2009 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season|2009]], [[HWA Team]]'s [[Paul di Resta]] became champion for the first time, having come out on top of a three-way title battle in Shanghai.\n\n2010 season would be [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]]'s final season as the sole tyre supplier in [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] as the company announced on 19 November 2010 that it would not renew its contract at the end of the season. After several months of deliberation, [[Hankook Tires|Hankook]] was chosen as the tyre supplier for the 2011 season at the [[Hankook Tires|Hankook Tire]] company meeting in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] on 17 January 2011.\n==Season summary==\nDi Resta had trailed teammate [[Bruno Spengler]] \u2013 a race winner at Lausitz and the N\u00fcrburgring \u2013 by as many as fifteen points after four races, but by the ninth race, di Resta had taken the championship lead after five top-two finishes including three wins. A poor finish for di Resta at [[Adria International Raceway|Adria]] \u2013 ninth after being helped into spins by [[Audi]] drivers [[Mike Rockenfeller]] and [[Miguel Molina (racing driver)|Miguel Molina]] \u2013 coupled with Spengler's third place allowed the Canadian driver to take a three-point lead into the final race. Another HWA driver, [[2005 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season|2005]] season champion [[Gary Paffett]] remained in mathematical contention, succeeding in needing a top-two finish at Adria, which left him nine points behind with ten available. Spengler left himself immediately in trouble in Shanghai, crashing during the qualification session which left him 17th on the grid, while di Resta and Paffett lined up on the front row. Spengler could only advance to thirteenth in the race, while his teammates battled for victory. Ultimately, Paffett won the race \u2013 ended early due to a collision between Rockenfeller and [[Susie Wolff|Susie Stoddart]] \u2013 but di Resta's second place allowed him to take the championship by four points. Paffett's victory also enabled him to overhaul Spengler for second place, by just one point.\n\nBest of the rest went to the defending two-time champion [[Timo Scheider]], who finished as top Audi in fourth place in the championship standings. Scheider, albeit scoring in each of the first five races, struggled for form in the early running, but recovered towards the end of the season and took a single victory during the season, winning at Adria. [[Mattias Ekstr\u00f6m]] was the only other Audi driver to win a race during the season, winning the series' inaugural race at Valencia but only returned twice to the podium after that; finishing the season in fifth place.

All previous releases by the band were [[Extended play|EP]]s. ''Atomizer'' is accompanied by liner notes that explain the stories behind many of the songs. The album cover is inspired by the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] art of animator [[Chuck Jones]].\n\nThe most popular song on the album and possibly by Big Black, \"Kerosene\", has a shaky guitar line that gives it an odd appeal and a slower rhythm than most Big Black songs. It discusses being bored and then as a result wanting to be set on fire. Violent lyrics such as these occur throughout Big Black's entire discography.<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/song/kerosene-mt0011427763</ref>\n\n==Singles==\nOne song from the album, \"Big Money\", was released as a B-side to the \"Il Duce\" single prior to the release of ''Atomizer''. Homestead Records also issued \"Big Money\" and \"[[Il Duce (song)|Il Duce]]\" the A-side of a 12\" record with three live songs on the B-side (including the live version of \"Cables\" that would appear on ''Atomizer'') with the agreement that the 12\" be used for promotional purposes only. The label sent the promo 12\" to radio stations, then sold extra copies outside of Big Black's native Chicago, hoping the band would never find out. When they did, Big Black left Homestead and signed to [[Touch and Go Records]].<ref name=Azerrad>{{cite book |last=Azerrad |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Azerrad |title=[[Our Band Could Be Your Life|Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981\u20131991]] |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |year =2001 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |page=314 |isbn=0-316-78753-1}}</ref>\n\n==Follow-up and CD releases==\nIn the year after ''Atomizer's'' release, Big Black recorded their 4-song ''[[Headache (EP)|Headache EP]]'' and released it with a sticker that bore the words, \"Warning! Not as good as ''Atomizer'', so don't get your hopes up, cheese.\" The same sticker also appeared on [[Sonic Youth]]'s EP ''[[Master=Dik]]''. That same year ''Atomizer'' was compiled onto [[compact disc]] along with the ''Headache'' EP and the band's [[Heartbeat (Wire song)#Big Black version|\"Heartbeat\" single]] under the name, ''[[The Rich Man's Eight Track Tape]].'' The CD omitted the album's instrumental \"Strange Things\", as well as the artwork and liner notes from the original records. Instead, [[Steve Albini]] expressed his general dislike for the compact disc format in the CD's liner notes, saying, \"This compact disc, compiled to exploit those of you gullible enough to own the bastardly first generation digital music system, contains all-[[analog recording|analog]] masters. Compact discs are quite durable, this being their only advantage over real music media. You should take every opportunity to scratch them, fingerprint them, and eat egg and bacon sandwiches off them. Don't worry about their longevity, as [[Philips]] will pronounce them [[Obsolescence|obsolete]] when the next phase of the market-squeezing technology bonanza begins.\"<ref name=\"Rich Man's liner notes\">{{cite book|last=Albini|first=Steve|title=The Rich Man's Eight Track Tape|year=1987|publisher=Touch and Go Records|location=Chicago|id=TG94|pages=CD liner notes|url=http://www.touchandgorecords.com/bands/album.php?id=138#}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/atomizer-mw0000617813|title=''Atomizer'' \u2013 Big Black|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=March 17, 2010|last=Kellman|first=Andy}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev2Score = 10/10<ref>{{cite journal|title=Big Black: ''Atomizer''|work=[[NME]]|date=November 28, 1992|page=30}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Big Black|last=Gross|first=Joe|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|year=2004|isbn=0-7432-0169-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/69 69\u201370]}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' \n| rev4Score = 5/5<ref>{{cite journal|title=Big Black: ''The Hammer Party'' / ''Atomizer'' / ''Songs About Fucking'' / ''Pigpile''|work=[[Select (magazine)|Select]]|issue=31|date=December 1992|last=Perry|first=Andrew|page=86}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]''\n| rev5Score = 9/10<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]|editor1-last=Weisbard|editor1-first=Eric|editor2-last=Marks|editor2-first=Craig|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|year=1995|isbn=0-679-75574-8}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev6Score = B+<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv9-86.php|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=September 2, 1986|accessdate=June 19, 2016|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe album went on to receive critical acclaim and is now regarded (along with its [[Songs About Fucking|follow-up]]) as one of the seminal releases of the [[noise rock]] genre. \"After countless rock and [[Post-industrial (music)|neo-industrial]] outfits attempted to one-up each other's levels of extremity over the years, ''Atomizer'' holds up extremely well\" writes Andy Kellman of ''[[Allmusic]]'', \"It's not every day that one hears a song considering self-immolation as \"just something to do\" or another that tackles the case of an alleged parent-child molestation ring from the viewpoint of the offender. Instrumentally, ''Atomizer'' is a wailing behemoth of assaultive Roland beats, [[Steve Albini]] and [[Santiago Durango]]'s clanging and whirring guitars, and new member [[Dave Riley]]'s lumberjack bass.\" He describes the song \"Kerosene\" as \"undeniably Big Black's brightest/bleakest moment, an epically roaming track that features an instantly memorable guitar intro, completely incapable of being accurately described by vocal imitation or physical gesture.

All previous releases by the band were [[Extended play|EP]]s. ''Atomizer'' is accompanied by liner notes that explain the stories behind many of the songs. The album cover is inspired by the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] art of animator [[Chuck Jones]].\n\nThe most popular song on the album and possibly by Big Black, \"Kerosene\", has a shaky guitar line that gives it an odd appeal and a slower rhythm than most Big Black songs. It discusses being bored and then as a result wanting to be set on fire. Violent lyrics such as these occur throughout Big Black's entire discography.<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/song/kerosene-mt0011427763</ref>\n\n==Singles==\nOne song from the album, \"Big Money\", was released as a B-side to the \"Il Duce\" single prior to the release of ''Atomizer''. Homestead Records also issued \"Big Money\" and \"[[Il Duce (song)|Il Duce]]\" the A-side of a 12\" record with three live songs on the B-side (including the live version of \"Cables\" that would appear on ''Atomizer'') with the agreement that the 12\" be used for promotional purposes only. The label sent the promo 12\" to radio stations, then sold extra copies outside of Big Black's native Chicago, hoping the band would never find out. When they did, Big Black left Homestead and signed to [[Touch and Go Records]].<ref name=Azerrad>{{cite book |last=Azerrad |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Azerrad |title=[[Our Band Could Be Your Life|Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981\u20131991]] |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |year =2001 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |page=314 |isbn=0-316-78753-1}}</ref>\n\n==Sticker==\nIn the year after ''Atomizer's'' release, Big Black recorded their 4-song ''[[Headache (EP)|Headache EP]]'' and released it with a sticker that bore the words, \"Warning! Not as good as ''Atomizer'', so don't get your hopes up, cheese.\" The same sticker also appeared on [[Sonic Youth]]'s EP ''[[Master=Dik]]''.\n\n''Atomizer'' was compiled on [[compact disc]], along with the ''[[Headache (EP)|Headache]]'' EP and [[Heartbeat (Wire song)#Big Black version|\"Heartbeat\" single]], as ''[[The Rich Man's Eight Track Tape]]'', which omitted the instrumental \"Strange Things\", as well as the artwork and liner notes from the original records. Instead, [[Steve Albini]] expressed his general dislike for the CD format in the CD's liner notes, saying, \"This compact disc, compiled to exploit those of you gullible enough to own the bastardly first generation digital music system, contains all-[[analog recording|analog]] masters. Compact discs are quite durable, this being their only advantage over real music media. You should take every opportunity to scratch them, fingerprint them, and eat egg and bacon sandwiches off them.

Instrumentally, ''Atomizer'' is a wailing behemoth of assaultive Roland beats, [[Steve Albini]] and [[Santiago Durango]]'s clanging and whirring guitars, and new member [[Dave Riley]]'s lumberjack bass.\" He describes the song \"Kerosene\" as \"undeniably Big Black's brightest/bleakest moment, an epically roaming track that features an instantly memorable guitar intro, completely incapable of being accurately described by vocal imitation or physical gesture. It's also Albini at his most plainspoken and bleak: \"Stare at the wall/Stare at each other and wait 'til we die.\" It's Big Black's \"[[Light My Fire]],\" literally.\" He concludes by calling it \"as horrifying as the day it was recorded.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \n\n===Accolades===\n\nIn addition to the ones mentioned below, the album was included in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Dimery|author2=Michael Lydon|title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die: Revised and Updated Edition|date=23 March 2010|publisher=Universe|isbn=978-0-7893-2074-2}}<!--|accessdate=2015-07-08--></ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
