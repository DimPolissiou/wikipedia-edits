She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, \"I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now, which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous.

She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, \"I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now, which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous. But then, the danger makes it more exciting.\" She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, and allowing her a degree of improvisation and to learn from her own mistakes.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}}\n\nKarina Longworth notes how \"external\" Streep's performances are, \"chameleonic\" in her impersonation of characters, \"subsuming herself into them, rather than personifying them\". In her early roles such as ''Manhattan'' and ''Kramer vs. Kramer'', she was compared to both [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Jill Clayburgh]], in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}} Streep has stated that many consider her to be a technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, \"I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable\".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Meryl Streep - Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|Streep's star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]'']]\nMike Nichols, who directed Streep in ''Silkwood'', ''Heartburn'', ''Postcards from the Edge'', and ''Angels in America'', praised Streep's ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that, \"In every role, she becomes a totally new human being.

The islands are administratively part of [[Krabi Province]]. [[Ko Phi Phi Don]] ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e19}}; {{rtgs|''ko phiphi don''}}) (''ko'' {{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30}} 'island') is the largest and most populated island of the group, although the beaches of the second largest island, [[Ko Phi Phi Le]] ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e40\u0e25}}; {{rtgs|''ko phiphi le''}}) are visited by many people as well.

The resident Thai population of Phi Phi Don remains more than 80 percent Muslim. The current population however\u2014if counting transient workers\u2014is more Buddhist than Muslim.

Tourism on the islands  exploded since the release of the movie ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.\n\nPhi Phi Le's Maya Bay was closed to tourists from June 2018 until the ecosystem recovers, but at least a year.<ref name=Guardian-20181003/>\n\n[https://www.phiphiislandvillage.com/phiphi-marine-discovery-centre.php Marine Discovery Centre], located at Loh Ba Gao Bay on Koh Phi Phi Don, houses a series of colourful, interactive displays explaining the life cycles and habits of many marine species endemic to the Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park, as well as information on area natural attractions and a gift shop.\n\n== Medical==\nThere is a small hospital on Phi Phi Island for emergencies. Its main purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Phuket hospital.  It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5\u20137 minute walk from the main pier.\n\n==2004 tsunami==\nOn 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The island's main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e23}}), is built on a sandy [[isthmus]] between the island's two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than  {{convert|2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].\n\nShortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=off}} high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone [[karst]]s, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong ([[Urak Lawoi|Sea Gypsy]] Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015.\n\nAt the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists.\n\n==Post-tsunami reconstruction==\n[[File:PhiPhiAftermath.jpg|thumb|[[Ko Phi Phi Don]], March 2005 in the aftermath of the tsunami.]]\nAfter the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. By the end of July 2005, an estimated 850 bodies had been recovered, and an estimated 1,200 people were still missing. The total number of fatalities is unlikely to be known. Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province.\n\nOn 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, ''Help International Phi Phi'' (\"HI Phi Phi\"). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work. On 18 February 2005, a second organization, Phi Phi Dive Camp,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phiphidivecamp.com |title=PhiPhiDiveCamp.com |publisher=Phiphidivecamp.com |accessdate=2012-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707043309/http://www.phiphidivecamp.com/ |archivedate=2012-07-07 }}</ref> was set up to remove the debris from the bays and coral reef, most of which was in Ton Sai Bay.\n\nBy the end of July 2005, 23,000 tonnes of debris had been removed from the island, of which 7,000 tonnes had been cleared by hand. \"We try and do as much as possible by hand,\" said Kok, \"that way we can search for passports and identification.\" The majority of buildings that were deemed fit for repair by government surveyors had been repaired, and 300 businesses had been restored.

Dr Thon Thamrongnawasawat, an environmental activist and member of Thailand's National Reform Council, is campaigning to have Phi Phi tourist numbers capped before its natural beauty is completely destroyed. With southern Thailand attracting thousands more tourists every day, Dr Thon makes the point that the ecosystem is under threat and is fast disappearing. \"Economically, a few people may be enriched, but their selfishness will come at great cost to Thailand\", says Dr Thon, a marine biology lecturer at [[Kasetsart University]] and an established environmental writer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sidasathian|first1=Chutima|last2=Morison|first2=Alan|title=Mass Tourism Makes 'a Slum' of Phi Phi|url=http://phuketwan.com/tourism/phi-phi-slum-mass-tourism-destroys-thailands-natural-heritage-22092/|accessdate=15 June 2015|work=Phuket Wan Tourism News|date=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nMore than one thousand tourists arrive on Phi Phi daily. This figure does not include those who arrive by chartered speedboat or yacht. Phi Phi produces about {{convert|25|t|ST}} of solid waste a day, rising to {{convert|40|t|ST}} during the high season and most of this waste leaves Phi Phi island into the ocean - untreated; in fact, Phi Phi Island releases 83% wastewater untreated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Phi-Phi-Island-releases-83-wastewater-untreated|title=Phi Phi Island releases 83% wastewater untreated|last=Gazette|first=Legacy Phuket|date=2016-03-03|website=The Thaiger|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref> All tourists arriving on the island pay a 20-baht fee at Ton Sai Pier to assist in \"keeping Ko Phi Phi clean\". \"We collect up to 20,000 baht a day from tourists at the pier. The money is then used to pay a private company to haul the rubbish from the island to the mainland in Krabi to be disposed of\", Mr Pankum Kittithonkun, Ao Nang Administration Organization (''OrBorTor'') President, said. The boat takes about 25 tonnes of trash from the island daily, weather permitting. ''Ao Nang OrBorTor'' pays 600,000 baht per month for the service. During high season, an Ao Nang ''OrBorTor'' boat is used to help transport the overflow of rubbish. Further aggravating Phi Phi's waste issues is sewage. \"We have no wastewater management plant there. Our only hope is that hotels, restaurants and other businesses act responsibly \u2013 but I have no faith in them,\" Mr Pankum said. \"They of course have to treat their own wastewater before releasing it into the sea, but they very well could just be turning the devices on before officers arrive to check them.\" The fundamental issue is that the budget allocated for Ao Nang and Phi Phi is based on its registered population, not on the number of people it hosts every year, Mr Pankum said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Plerin|first1=Chutharat|title=Special Report: Phi Phi cries for help|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Special-Report-Phi-Phi-cries-help|accessdate=29 September 2018|work=The Taiger|date=2014-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Maya Beach, made famous by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s 2000 film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'', was closed indefinitely to allow it to recover.

There are nine settlements under these two villages.\n\nThe villages are:\n*Laem Thong (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e15\u0e07, Mu 8, between 300-500 people)\n:* Ban Ko Mai Phai (about 20 fishermen live on this island)\n:* Ban Laem Tong\n:* Ao Loh Bakhao\n:* Ao Lana\n\n*[[Ko Phi Phi Don|Ko Phi Phi]] (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35, Mu 7, between 1,500 - 2,000 people)\n:* Ao Maya (about 10 people, mostly in the ranger station)\n:* Ton Sai, the capital and largest settlement\n:* Hat Yao\n:* Ao Lodalum\n:* Laem Pho\n\n== Climate ==\nHat Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park is influenced by tropical monsoon winds. There are two seasons: the rainy season from May till December and the hot season from January till April. Average temperature ranges between {{convert|17|\u2013|37|C|F}}. Average rainfall per year is about {{convert|2,231|mm|inch|lk=out|abbr=off}}, with wettest month being July and the driest February.<ref name=DNP/>\n\n== Transportation and communication==\n;Roads\nSince the re-building of Ko Phi Phi after the 2004 tsunami, paved roads now cover the vast majority of Ton Sai Bay and Loh Dalum Bay. All roads are for pedestrian use only with push carts used to transport goods and bags. The only permitted motor vehicles are reserved for emergency services.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Bicycling is the most popular form of transport in Ton Sai.\n\n;Air\nThe nearest airports are at Krabi, Trang, and Phuket. All three have direct road and boat connections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n;Ferry\nThere are frequent ferry boats to Ko Phi Phi from Phuket, Ko Lanta, and Krabi town starting at 08:30. Last boats from Krabi and Phuket depart at 14:30.  In the \"green season\" (Jun-Oct), travel to and from Ko Lanta is via Krabi town only.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.phuketharbour.com/|title=Phuket to Phi Phi Ferry {{!}} Phuket to Phi Phi Speedboat|work=phuketharbour.com|accessdate=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\nThere is a large modern deep water government pier on Tonsai Bay, Phi Phi Don Village, completed in late-2009. It takes in the main ferry boats from Phuket, Krabi, and Ko Lanta. Visitors to Phi Phi Island must pay 20 baht on arrival at the pier. Dive boats, longtail boats, and supply boats have their own drop off points along the piers, making the pier highly efficient in the peak season.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Ko Phi Phi after sunset, preparing for the night.JPG|thumb|right|Sunset, Ko Phi Phi]]\n[[File:Phi Phi party.jpg|thumb|right|Phi Phi party]]\n\nThe islands feature beaches and clear water, and the natural environment is protected by national park status. Tourism on the islands  exploded since the release of the movie ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.\n\nPhi Phi Le's Maya Bay was closed to tourists from June 2018 until the ecosystem recovers, but at least a year.<ref name=Guardian-20181003/>\n\n== Medical==\nThere is a small hospital on Phi Phi Island for emergencies. Its main purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Phuket hospital.  It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5\u20137 minute walk from the main pier.\n\n==2004 tsunami==\nOn 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The island's main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e23}}), is built on a sandy [[isthmus]] between the island's two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than  {{convert|2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].\n\nShortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=off}} high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone [[karst]]s, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong ([[Urak Lawoi|Sea Gypsy]] Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015.\n\nAt the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists.\n\n==Post-tsunami reconstruction==\n[[File:PhiPhiAftermath.jpg|thumb|[[Ko Phi Phi Don]], March 2005 in the aftermath of the tsunami.]]\nAfter the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. By the end of July 2005, an estimated 850 bodies had been recovered, and an estimated 1,200 people were still missing. The total number of fatalities is unlikely to be known. Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province.\n\nOn 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, ''Help International Phi Phi'' (\"HI Phi Phi\"). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work. On 18 February 2005, a second organization, Phi Phi Dive Camp,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phiphidivecamp.com |title=PhiPhiDiveCamp.com |publisher=Phiphidivecamp.com |accessdate=2012-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707043309/http://www.phiphidivecamp.com/ |archivedate=2012-07-07 }}</ref> was set up to remove the debris from the bays and coral reef, most of which was in Ton Sai Bay.\n\nBy the end of July 2005, 23,000 tonnes of debris had been removed from the island, of which 7,000 tonnes had been cleared by hand. \"We try and do as much as possible by hand,\" said Kok, \"that way we can search for passports and identification.\" The majority of buildings that were deemed fit for repair by government surveyors had been repaired, and 300 businesses had been restored. HI Phi Phi was nominated for a ''Time Magazine'' Heroes of Asia award.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marshall |first=Andrew |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2005/heroes/hi_phi_phi.html |work=Time |title=Help International Phi Phi |date=2005-10-03 |accessdate=2012-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226085802/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2005/heroes/hi_phi_phi.html |archive-date=2011-02-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs of 6 December 2005, nearly 1,500 hotel rooms were open, and a tsunami early-warning alarm system had been installed by the Thai government with the help of volunteers.\n\n==Impact of mass tourism==\n[[File:Bryde\u00b4s whale.jpg|thumb|[[Bryde's whale]] swims off the islands]]\nSince the tsunami, Phi Phi has come under greater threat from mass tourism. Dr Thon Thamrongnawasawat, an environmental activist and member of Thailand's National Reform Council, is campaigning to have Phi Phi tourist numbers capped before its natural beauty is completely destroyed. With southern Thailand attracting thousands more tourists every day, Dr Thon makes the point that the ecosystem is under threat and is fast disappearing. \"Economically, a few people may be enriched, but their selfishness will come at great cost to Thailand\", says Dr Thon, a marine biology lecturer at [[Kasetsart University]] and an established environmental writer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sidasathian|first1=Chutima|last2=Morison|first2=Alan|title=Mass Tourism Makes 'a Slum' of Phi Phi|url=http://phuketwan.com/tourism/phi-phi-slum-mass-tourism-destroys-thailands-natural-heritage-22092/|accessdate=15 June 2015|work=Phuket Wan Tourism News|date=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nMore than one thousand tourists arrive on Phi Phi daily. This figure does not include those who arrive by chartered speedboat or yacht. Phi Phi produces about {{convert|25|t|ST}} of solid waste a day, rising to {{convert|40|t|ST}} during the high season and most of this waste leaves Phi Phi island into the ocean - untreated; in fact, Phi Phi Island releases 83% wastewater untreated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Phi-Phi-Island-releases-83-wastewater-untreated|title=Phi Phi Island releases 83% wastewater untreated|last=Gazette|first=Legacy Phuket|date=2016-03-03|website=The Thaiger|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref> All tourists arriving on the island pay a 20-baht fee at Ton Sai Pier to assist in \"keeping Ko Phi Phi clean\". \"We collect up to 20,000 baht a day from tourists at the pier. The money is then used to pay a private company to haul the rubbish from the island to the mainland in Krabi to be disposed of\", Mr Pankum Kittithonkun, Ao Nang Administration Organization (''OrBorTor'') President, said. The boat takes about 25 tonnes of trash from the island daily, weather permitting. ''Ao Nang OrBorTor'' pays 600,000 baht per month for the service. During high season, an Ao Nang ''OrBorTor'' boat is used to help transport the overflow of rubbish. Further aggravating Phi Phi's waste issues is sewage. \"We have no wastewater management plant there. Our only hope is that hotels, restaurants and other businesses act responsibly \u2013 but I have no faith in them,\" Mr Pankum said. \"They of course have to treat their own wastewater before releasing it into the sea, but they very well could just be turning the devices on before officers arrive to check them.\" The fundamental issue is that the budget allocated for Ao Nang and Phi Phi is based on its registered population, not on the number of people it hosts every year, Mr Pankum said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Plerin|first1=Chutharat|title=Special Report: Phi Phi cries for help|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Special-Report-Phi-Phi-cries-help|accessdate=29 September 2018|work=The Taiger|date=2014-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Maya Beach, made famous by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s 2000 film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'', was closed indefinitely to allow it to recover.
