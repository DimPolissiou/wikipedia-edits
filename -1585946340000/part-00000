Six or seven Lebanese men, including [[Hassan Izz-Al-Din]], a veteran of the [[TWA 847]] hijacking armed with guns and hand grenades forced the pilot to land in Mashhad, Iran and demanded the release of 17 Shi'ite Muslim prisoners being held by Kuwait. Lasting 16 days and travelling 3,200-miles from Mashhad in northeastern Iran to Larnaca, Cyprus, and finally to Algiers, it is the longest skyjacking to date. Two passengers, Abdullah Khalidi, 25, and Khalid Ayoub Bandar, 20, both Kuwaitis, were shot to death by the hijackers and dumped on the tarmac in Cyprus.

From 1877 to 1891, George served in the [[Royal Navy]], until the unexpected death of his elder brother in early 1892 put him directly in line for the throne. On the death of his grandmother in 1901, George's father ascended the throne as Edward VII, and George was created [[Prince of Wales]]. He became [[king-emperor]] on his father's death in 1910.\n\nGeorge V's reign saw the rise of [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[fascism]], [[Irish republicanism]], and the [[Indian independence movement]], all of which radically changed the political landscape. The [[Parliament Act 1911]] established the supremacy of the elected [[British House of Commons]] over the unelected [[House of Lords]]. As a result of the [[First World War]] (1914\u20131918), the empires of his first cousins [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Wilhelm II of Germany]] fell, while the [[British Empire]] expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the [[House of Windsor]], which he renamed from the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] as a result of anti-German public sentiment. In 1924 he appointed the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[First MacDonald ministry|ministry]] and in 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate, independent states within the [[British Commonwealth of Nations]]. He had smoking-related health problems throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Edward VIII]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nGeorge was born on 3 June 1865, in [[Marlborough House]], London. He was the second son of [[Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]], and [[Alexandra, Princess of Wales]]. His father was the eldest son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], and his mother was the eldest daughter of [[King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]]. He was baptised at [[Windsor Castle]] on 7 July 1865 by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Charles Longley]].<ref>His godparents were the [[George V of Hanover|King of Hanover]] (Queen Victoria's cousin, for whom [[Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] stood proxy); the [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (Prince Albert's brother, for whom the [[Lord President of the Council]], [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Earl Granville]], stood proxy); the [[Ernst Leopold, 4th Prince of Leiningen|Prince of Leiningen]] (the Prince of Wales's half-cousin); the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]] (the Princess of Wales's brother, for whom the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney|Viscount Sydney]], stood proxy); the [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen of Denmark]] (George's maternal grandmother, for whom Queen Victoria stood proxy); the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's cousin); the [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|Duchess of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's aunt, for whom George's aunt [[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Princess Helena]] stood proxy); and [[Princess Louis of Hesse and by Rhine]] (George's aunt, for whom her sister [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] stood proxy) (''The Times'' (London), Saturday, 8 July 1865, p. 12).</ref>\n\n[[File:King George V of the United Kingdom as a boy, 1870.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|George as a young boy, 1870]]\nAs a younger son of the Prince of Wales, there was little expectation that George would become king. He was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother, [[Prince Albert Victor]]. George was only 17&nbsp;months younger than Albert Victor, and the two princes were educated together. [[John Neale Dalton]] was appointed as their tutor in 1871. Neither Albert Victor nor George excelled intellectually.<ref>Clay, p. 39; Sinclair, pp. 46\u201347</ref> As their father thought that the navy was \"the very best possible training for any boy\",<ref>Sinclair, pp. 49\u201350</ref> in September 1877, when George was 12&nbsp;years old, both brothers joined the cadet training ship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS ''Britannia'']] at [[Dartmouth, Devon]].<ref>Clay, p. 71; Rose, p. 7</ref>\n\nFor three years from 1879, the royal brothers served on {{HMS|Bacchante|1876|6}}, accompanied by Dalton. They toured the colonies of the [[British Empire]] in the [[Caribbean]], South Africa and Australia, and visited [[Norfolk, Virginia]], as well as South America, the [[Mediterranean]], Egypt, and East Asia. In 1881 on a visit to Japan, George had a local artist tattoo a blue and red dragon on his arm,<ref>Rose, p. 13</ref> and was received in an audience by the [[Emperor Meiji]]; George and his brother presented [[Empress Haruko]] with two [[wallabies]] from Australia.<ref>Keene, Donald ''Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852\u20131912 ''(Columbia University Press, 2002) pp. 350\u2013351</ref> Dalton wrote an account of their journey entitled ''The Cruise of HMS Bacchante''.<ref>Rose, p. 14; Sinclair, p. 55</ref> Between Melbourne and Sydney, Dalton recorded a sighting of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'', a mythical ghost ship.<ref>Rose, p. 11</ref> When they returned to Britain, the Queen complained that her grandsons could not speak French or German, and so they spent six months in [[Lausanne]] in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to learn another language.<ref>Clay, p. 92; Rose, pp. 15\u201316</ref> After Lausanne, the brothers were separated; Albert Victor attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], while George continued in the [[Royal Navy]]. He travelled the world, visiting many areas of the British Empire. During his naval career he commanded ''Torpedo Boat 79'' in home waters then {{HMS|Thrush|1889|6}} on the North America station, before his last active service in command of [[HMS Melampus (1890)|HMS ''Melampus'']] in 1891\u201392. From then on, his naval rank was largely honorary.<ref>Sinclair, p. 69</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n{{see also|Wedding of Prince George, Duke of York, and Princess Mary of Teck}}\n[[File:Kinggeorgev1928.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Pale-eyed young man with a beard and moustache|George, 1893]]\n\nAs a young man destined to serve in the navy, Prince George served for many years under the command of his uncle, [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], who was stationed in [[Malta]]. There, he grew close to and fell in love with his cousin, Princess [[Marie of Edinburgh]]. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but his mother and aunt\u2014the Princess of Wales and [[Maria Alexandrovna, Duchess of Edinburgh]]\u2014opposed it. The Princess of Wales thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. The Duchess, the only daughter of [[Alexander II of Russia]], resented the fact that, as the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, the Princess of Wales, whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her.

The tour was designed by [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Joseph Chamberlain]] with the support of Prime Minister [[Lord Salisbury]] to reward the Dominions for their participation in the [[South African War]] of 1899\u20131902. George presented thousands of specially designed South African War medals to colonial troops. In South Africa, the royal party met civic leaders, African leaders, and Boer prisoners, and was greeted by elaborate decorations, expensive gifts, and fireworks displays. Despite this, not all residents responded favourably to the tour. Many white Cape [[Afrikaner]]s resented the display and expense, the war having weakened their capacity to reconcile their Afrikaner-Dutch culture with their status as British subjects.

George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class\u2014a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Prochaska | first1 = Frank | year = 1999 | title = George V and Republicanism, 1917\u20131919 | url = | journal = Twentieth Century British History | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201351 | doi=10.1093/tcbh/10.1.27}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last1 = Kirk | first1 = Neville | year = 2005 | title = The Conditions of Royal Rule: Australian and British Socialist and Labour Attitudes to the Monarchy, 1901\u201311 | url = | journal = Social History | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 64\u201388 | doi=10.1080/0307102042000337297}}</ref>\n\nThe years between 1922 and 1929 saw frequent changes in government. In 1924, George appointed the first Labour Prime Minister, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], in the absence of a clear majority for any one of the three major parties. George's tactful and understanding reception of the first Labour government (which lasted less than a year) allayed the suspicions of the party's sympathisers.

[[Emperor of India]], from 6 May 1910 until his death in 1936.\n\nBorn during the reign of his grandmother [[Queen Victoria]], George was third in the [[succession to the British throne|line of succession]] behind his father, [[Prince Albert Edward]], and his own elder brother, [[Prince Albert Victor]]. From 1877 to 1891, George served in the [[Royal Navy]], until the unexpected death of his elder brother in early 1892 put him directly in line for the throne. On the death of his grandmother in 1901, George's father ascended the throne as Edward VII, and George was created [[Prince of Wales]]. He became [[king-emperor]] on his father's death in 1910.\n\nGeorge V's reign saw the rise of [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[fascism]], [[Irish republicanism]], and the [[Indian independence movement]], all of which radically changed the political landscape. The [[Parliament Act 1911]] established the supremacy of the elected [[British House of Commons]] over the unelected [[House of Lords]]. As a result of the [[First World War]] (1914\u20131918), the empires of his first cousins [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Wilhelm II of Germany]] fell, while the [[British Empire]] expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the [[House of Windsor]], which he renamed from the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] as a result of anti-German public sentiment. In 1924 he appointed the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[First MacDonald ministry|ministry]] and in 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate, independent states within the [[British Commonwealth of Nations]]. He had smoking-related health problems throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Edward VIII]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nGeorge was born on 3 June 1865, in [[Marlborough House]], London. He was the second son of [[Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]], and [[Alexandra, Princess of Wales]]. His father was the eldest son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], and his mother was the eldest daughter of [[King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]]. He was baptised at [[Windsor Castle]] on 7 July 1865 by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Charles Longley]].<ref>His godparents were the [[George V of Hanover|King of Hanover]] (Queen Victoria's cousin, for whom [[Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] stood proxy); the [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (Prince Albert's brother, for whom the [[Lord President of the Council]], [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Earl Granville]], stood proxy); the [[Ernst Leopold, 4th Prince of Leiningen|Prince of Leiningen]] (the Prince of Wales's half-cousin); the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]] (the Princess of Wales's brother, for whom the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney|Viscount Sydney]], stood proxy); the [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen of Denmark]] (George's maternal grandmother, for whom Queen Victoria stood proxy); the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's cousin); the [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|Duchess of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's aunt, for whom George's aunt [[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Princess Helena]] stood proxy); and [[Princess Louis of Hesse and by Rhine]] (George's aunt, for whom her sister [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] stood proxy) (''The Times'' (London), Saturday, 8 July 1865, p. 12).</ref>\n\n[[File:King George V of the United Kingdom as a boy, 1870.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|George as a young boy, 1870]]\nAs a younger son of the Prince of Wales, there was little expectation that George would become king. He was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother, [[Prince Albert Victor]]. George was only 17&nbsp;months younger than Albert Victor, and the two princes were educated together. [[John Neale Dalton]] was appointed as their tutor in 1871. Neither Albert Victor nor George excelled intellectually.<ref>Clay, p. 39; Sinclair, pp. 46\u201347</ref> As their father thought that the navy was \"the very best possible training for any boy\",<ref>Sinclair, pp. 49\u201350</ref> in September 1877, when George was 12&nbsp;years old, both brothers joined the cadet training ship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS ''Britannia'']] at [[Dartmouth, Devon]].<ref>Clay, p. 71; Rose, p. 7</ref>\n\nFor three years from 1879, the royal brothers served on {{HMS|Bacchante|1876|6}}, accompanied by Dalton. They toured the colonies of the [[British Empire]] in the [[Caribbean]], South Africa and Australia, and visited [[Norfolk, Virginia]], as well as South America, the [[Mediterranean]], Egypt, and East Asia. In 1881 on a visit to Japan, George had a local artist tattoo a blue and red dragon on his arm,<ref>Rose, p. 13</ref> and was received in an audience by the [[Emperor Meiji]]; George and his brother presented [[Empress Haruko]] with two [[wallabies]] from Australia.<ref>Keene, Donald ''Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852\u20131912 ''(Columbia University Press, 2002) pp. 350\u2013351</ref> Dalton wrote an account of their journey entitled ''The Cruise of HMS Bacchante''.<ref>Rose, p. 14; Sinclair, p. 55</ref> Between Melbourne and Sydney, Dalton recorded a sighting of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'', a mythical ghost ship.<ref>Rose, p. 11</ref> When they returned to Britain, the Queen complained that her grandsons could not speak French or German, and so they spent six months in [[Lausanne]] in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to learn another language.<ref>Clay, p. 92; Rose, pp. 15\u201316</ref> After Lausanne, the brothers were separated; Albert Victor attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], while George continued in the [[Royal Navy]]. He travelled the world, visiting many areas of the British Empire. During his naval career he commanded ''Torpedo Boat 79'' in home waters then {{HMS|Thrush|1889|6}} on the North America station, before his last active service in command of [[HMS Melampus (1890)|HMS ''Melampus'']] in 1891\u201392. From then on, his naval rank was largely honorary.<ref>Sinclair, p. 69</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n{{see also|Wedding of Prince George, Duke of York, and Princess Mary of Teck}}\n[[File:Kinggeorgev1928.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Pale-eyed young man with a beard and moustache|George, 1893]]\n\nAs a young man destined to serve in the navy, Prince George served for many years under the command of his uncle, [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], who was stationed in [[Malta]]. There, he grew close to and fell in love with his cousin, Princess [[Marie of Edinburgh]]. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but his mother and aunt\u2014the Princess of Wales and [[Maria Alexandrovna, Duchess of Edinburgh]]\u2014opposed it. The Princess of Wales thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. The Duchess, the only daughter of [[Alexander II of Russia]], resented the fact that, as the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, the Princess of Wales, whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her. She married [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]], the future [[King of Romania]], in 1893.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, pp. 250\u2013251</ref>\n\n[[File:Princess Mary of Teck wedding dress 1893 no2.jpg|thumb|right|George and Mary on their wedding day]]\n\nIn November 1891, George's elder brother, Albert Victor, became engaged to his [[second cousin once removed]] [[Princess Victoria Mary of Teck]], known as \"May\" within the family.<ref>Rose, pp. 22\u201323</ref> Her parents were [[Prince Francis, Duke of Teck]] (a member of a [[morganatic]], cadet branch of the [[House of W\u00fcrttemberg]]), and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge]], a male-line granddaughter of [[King George&nbsp;III]] and a first cousin of Queen Victoria.<ref>Rose, p. 29</ref>\n\nOn 14 January 1892, six weeks after the formal engagement, Albert Victor died of [[pneumonia]], leaving George second in line to the throne, and likely to succeed after his father. George had only just recovered from a serious illness himself, after being confined to bed for six weeks with [[typhoid fever]], the disease that was thought to have killed his grandfather Prince Albert.<ref>Rose, pp. 20\u201321, 24</ref> Queen Victoria still regarded Princess May<!--Yes, May! Please do not change--> as a suitable match for her grandson, and George and May grew close during their shared period of mourning.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, pp. 230\u2013231</ref>\n\nA year after Albert Victor's death, George proposed to May<!--Yes, May! Please do not change--> and was accepted. They married on 6 July 1893 at the [[Chapel Royal]] in [[St James's Palace]], London. Throughout their lives, they remained devoted to each other. George was, on his own admission, unable to express his feelings easily in speech, but they often exchanged loving letters and notes of endearment.<ref>Sinclair, p. 178</ref>\n\n==Duke of York==\n[[File:George, Duke of York, and his children.jpg|thumb|George with his children, [[Edward VIII|Edward]], [[George VI|Albert]], and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Mary]], photographed by Alexandra in 1899]]\n\nThe death of his elder brother effectively ended George's naval career, as he was now second in line to the throne, after his father.<ref name=\"dnb\">[[Colin Matthew|Matthew, H.

[[Randolph Churchill]] claimed that George was a strict father, to the extent that his children were terrified of him, and that George had remarked to the [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]]: \"My father was frightened of his mother, I was frightened of my father, and I am damned well going to see to it that my children are frightened of me.\" In reality, there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.<ref>Rose, pp. 53\u201357; Sinclair, p. 93 ''ff''</ref> Whether this was the case or not, his children did seem to resent his strict nature, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Prince Henry]] going as far as to describe him as a \"terrible father\" in later years.<ref>Vickers, ch. 18</ref>\n\nThey lived mainly at [[York Cottage]],<ref>Renamed from ''Bachelor's Cottage''</ref> a relatively small house in [[Sandringham, Norfolk]], where their way of life mirrored that of a comfortable middle-class family rather than royalty.<ref>Clay, p. 154; Nicolson, p. 51; Rose, p. 97</ref> George preferred a simple, almost quiet, life, in marked contrast to the lively social life pursued by his father. His official biographer, [[Harold Nicolson]], later despaired of George's time as Duke of York, writing: \"He may be all right as a young midshipman and a wise old king, but when he was Duke of York&nbsp;... he did nothing at all but kill [''i.e.'' shoot] animals and stick in stamps.\"<ref>[[Harold Nicolson]]'s diary quoted in Sinclair, p. 107</ref> George was an avid [[stamp collector]], which Nicolson disparaged,<ref>Nicolson's ''Comments 1944\u20131948'', quoted in Rose, p. 42</ref> but George played a large role in building the [[Royal Philatelic Collection]] into the most comprehensive collection of United Kingdom and Commonwealth stamps in the world, in some cases setting record purchase prices for items.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/The%20Royal%20Collection%20and%20other%20collections/TheRoyalPhilatelicCollection/History.aspx|title=The Royal Philatelic Collection|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1894, George's uncle [[Alexander III of Russia]] died.

Their tour included Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, South Africa, Canada, and the [[Colony of Newfoundland]]. The tour was designed by [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Joseph Chamberlain]] with the support of Prime Minister [[Lord Salisbury]] to reward the Dominions for their participation in the [[South African War]] of 1899\u20131902. George presented thousands of specially designed South African War medals to colonial troops. In South Africa, the royal party met civic leaders, African leaders, and Boer prisoners, and was greeted by elaborate decorations, expensive gifts, and fireworks displays. Despite this, not all residents responded favourably to the tour. Many white Cape [[Afrikaner]]s resented the display and expense, the war having weakened their capacity to reconcile their Afrikaner-Dutch culture with their status as British subjects. Critics in the English-language press decried the enormous cost at a time when families faced severe hardship.<ref>{{citation|first=Phillip|last=Buckner|title=The Royal Tour of 1901 and the Construction of an Imperial Identity in South Africa|journal=South African Historical Journal|date=November 1999|volume=41|pages=324\u2013348|doi=10.1080/02582479908671897}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Opening of the first parliament.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Tom Roberts]] of the Duke opening the first [[Parliament of Australia]] on 9 May 1901]]\n\nIn Australia, the Duke opened the first session of the [[Australian Parliament]] upon the [[Constitutional history of Australia|creation of the Commonwealth of Australia]].<ref>Rose, pp. 43\u201344</ref> In New Zealand, he praised the military values, bravery, loyalty, and obedience to duty of New Zealanders, and the tour gave New Zealand a chance to show off its progress, especially in its adoption of up-to-date British standards in communications and the processing industries.

In an effort to kill off rumours, Mylius was arrested, tried and found guilty of [[criminal libel]], and was sentenced to a year in prison.<ref>Rose, pp. 82\u201384</ref>\n\nGeorge objected to the [[anti-Catholic]] wording of the Accession Declaration that he would be required to make at the opening of his first parliament. He made it known that he would refuse to open parliament unless it was changed. As a result, the [[Accession Declaration Act 1910]] shortened the declaration and removed the most offensive phrases.<ref>{{citation|author=Wolffe, John|contribution=Protestantism, Monarchy and the Defence of Christian Britain 1837\u20132005|editor1=Brown, Callum G. |editor2=Snape, Michael F. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXhovNnt76QC&pg=PA63|title=Secularisation in the Christian World|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Farnham, Surrey|year=2010|pages=63\u201364|isbn=978-0-7546-9930-9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:India Before the First World War; George V and Queen Mary at Delhi Durbar Q107150.jpg|thumb|left|King George and Queen Mary at the Delhi Durbar, 1911]]\n[[Coronation of George V and Mary|George and Mary's coronation]] took place at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 22 June 1911,<ref name=\"dnb\"/> and was celebrated by the [[Festival of Empire]] in London.

George wore the newly created [[Imperial Crown of India]] at the ceremony, and declared the shifting of the Indian capital from [[Calcutta]] to [[Delhi]]. He was the only Emperor of India to be present at his own Delhi Durbar. \nThey travelled throughout the sub-continent, and George took the opportunity to indulge in [[big game hunting]] in Nepal, shooting 21 tigers, 8 rhinoceroses and a bear over 10 days.<ref>Rose, p. 136</ref> He was a keen and expert marksman.<ref>Rose, pp. 39\u201340</ref> On 18 December 1913, he shot over a thousand [[pheasant]]s in six hours<ref>About one bird every 20 seconds</ref> at [[Hall Barn]], the home of [[Edward Levy-Lawson, 1st Baron Burnham|Lord Burnham]], although even George had to acknowledge that \"we went a little too far\" that day.<ref>Rose, p. 87; Windsor, pp. 86\u201387</ref>\n\n===National politics===\nGeorge inherited the throne at a politically turbulent time.<ref>Rose, p. 115</ref> [[Lloyd George]]'s [[People's Budget]] had been rejected the previous year by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]]-dominated [[House of Lords]], contrary to the normal convention that the Lords did not veto [[money bill]]s.<ref>Rose, pp. 112\u2013114</ref> [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] had asked the previous king to give an undertaking that he would create sufficient Liberal peers to force the budget through the House. Edward had reluctantly agreed, provided the Lords rejected the budget after two successive general elections. After the [[January 1910 general election]], the Conservative peers allowed the budget, for which the government now had an electoral mandate, to pass without a vote.<ref>Rose, p. 114</ref>\n\n[[File:1914 Sydney Half Sovereign - George V.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Gold coin with left-facing profile portrait of George V|A [[half-sovereign]] minted during George's reign ([[Bertram Mackennal]], sculptor)]]\n\nAsquith attempted to curtail the power of the Lords through constitutional reforms, which were again blocked by the Upper House. A constitutional conference on the reforms broke down in November 1910 after 21 meetings. Asquith and [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]], Liberal leader in the Lords, asked George to grant a dissolution, leading to a second general election, and to promise to create sufficient Liberal peers if the Lords blocked the legislation again.<ref>Rose, pp. 116\u2013121</ref> If George refused, the Liberal government would otherwise resign, which would have given the appearance that the monarch was taking sides\u2014with \"the peers against the people\"\u2014in party politics.<ref>Rose, pp. 121\u2013122</ref> The King's two private secretaries, the Liberal [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Lord Knollys]] and the Unionist [[Lord Stamfordham]], gave George conflicting advice. Knollys advised George to accept the Cabinet's demands, while Stamfordham advised George to accept the resignation.<ref>Rose, pp. 120, 141</ref> Like his father, George reluctantly agreed to the dissolution and creation of peers, although he felt his ministers had taken advantage of his inexperience to browbeat him.<ref>Rose, pp. 121\u2013125</ref> After the [[December 1910 general election]], the Lords let the bill pass on hearing of the threat to swamp the house with new peers.<ref>Rose, pp. 125\u2013130</ref> The subsequent [[Parliament Act 1911]] permanently removed\u2014with a few exceptions\u2014the power of the Lords to veto bills. The King later came to feel that Knollys had withheld information from him about the willingness of the opposition to form a government if the Liberals had resigned.<ref>Rose, p. 123</ref>\n\nThe 1910 general elections had left the Liberals as a minority government dependent upon the support of the [[Irish Nationalist Party]]. As desired by the Nationalists, Asquith introduced [[Home Rule Act 1914|legislation that would give Ireland Home Rule]], but the Conservatives and Unionists opposed it.<ref name=\"dnb\"/><ref>Rose, p. 137</ref> As tempers rose over the Home Rule Bill, which would never have been possible without the Parliament Act, relations between the elderly Knollys and the Conservatives became poor, and he was pushed into retirement.<ref>Rose, pp. 141\u2013143</ref> Desperate to avoid the prospect of civil war in Ireland between Unionists and Nationalists, George called a [[Buckingham Palace Conference|meeting of all parties at Buckingham Palace]] in July 1914 in an attempt to negotiate a settlement.<ref>Rose, pp. 152\u2013153, 156\u2013157</ref> After four days the conference ended without an agreement.<ref name=\"dnb\"/><ref>Rose, p. 157</ref> Political developments in Britain and Ireland were overtaken by events in Europe, and the issue of Irish Home Rule was shelved.<ref name=\"dnb\"/><ref>Rose, p. 158</ref>\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:A Good Riddance - George V of the United Kingdom cartoon in Punch, 1917.png|upright|thumb|alt=George V dressed in the ceremonial robes of the Order of the Garter uses a broom to sweep aside assorted crowns labelled \"Made in Germany\"|\"A good riddance\"<br />\u2014a 1917 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon depicts King George sweeping away his German titles]]\n\nOn 4 August 1914 the King wrote in his diary, \"I held a council at 10.45 to declare war with Germany.

The German Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]], who for the British public came to symbolise all the horrors of the war, was the King's first cousin. The King's paternal grandfather was [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]; consequently, the King and his children bore the titles Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke and Duchess of Saxony. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the [[Duke of Teck]], a descendant of the German [[Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The King had brothers-in-law and cousins who were British subjects but who bore German titles such as Duke and Duchess of Teck, Prince and Princess of Battenberg, and Prince and Princess of Schleswig-Holstein. When [[H. G. Wells]] wrote about Britain's \"alien and uninspiring court\", George replied: \"I may be uninspiring, but I'll be damned if I'm alien.\"<ref>Nicolson, p. 308</ref>\n\nOn 17 July 1917, George appeased British nationalist feelings by issuing a royal proclamation that changed the name of the British [[royal house]] from the German-sounding [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] to the [[House of Windsor]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30186|date=17 July 1917|page=7119}}</ref> He and all his British relatives relinquished their German titles and styles, and adopted British-sounding surnames. George compensated his male relatives by creating them British peers. His cousin, [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]], who earlier in the war had been forced to resign as [[First Sea Lord]] through anti-German feeling, became Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, while Queen Mary's brothers became [[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge]], and [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone]].<ref>Rose, pp. 174\u2013175</ref>\n[[File:Tsar Nicholas II & King George V.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Two bearded men of identical height wear military dress uniforms emblazoned with medals and stand side-by-side|George V (right) and his physically similar cousin [[Nicholas II of Russia]] in German uniforms before the war<ref>At George's wedding in 1893, ''[[The Times]]'' claimed that the crowd may have confused Nicholas with George, because their beards and dress made them look alike superficially (''The Times'' (London), Friday, 7 July 1893, p. 5).

George's relatives who fought on the German side, such as [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover]], and [[Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], had their British peerages suspended by a 1919 [[Order in Council]] under the provisions of the [[Titles Deprivation Act 1917]]. Under pressure from his mother, Queen Alexandra, the King also removed the [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle#Heraldry|Garter flags]] of his German relations from [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].<ref>Clay, p. 326; Rose, p. 173</ref>\n\nWhen Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, George's first cousin, was overthrown in the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the British government offered [[political asylum]] to the Tsar and his family, but worsening conditions for the British people, and fears that revolution might come to the British Isles, led George to think that the presence of the [[Romanovs]] would be seen as inappropriate.<ref>Nicolson, p. 301; Rose, pp. 210\u2013215; Sinclair, p. 148</ref> Despite the later claims of [[Lord Mountbatten of Burma]] that Prime Minister Lloyd George was opposed to the rescue of the Russian imperial family, the letters of Lord Stamfordham suggest that it was George&nbsp;V who opposed the idea against the advice of the government.<ref>Rose, p. 210</ref> Advance planning for a rescue was undertaken by [[MI1]], a branch of the British secret service,<ref>{{citation|last=Crossland|first=John|title=British Spies In Plot To Save Tsar|journal=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=15 October 2006}}</ref> but because of the strengthening position of the [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries and wider difficulties with the conduct of the war, the plan was never put into operation.<ref>Sinclair, p. 149</ref> The Tsar and his immediate family remained in Russia, where  they were [[Execution of the Romanov family|killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918]].

George was informed of his death by Queen Mary, who wrote, \"[John] had been a great anxiety to us for many years&nbsp;...

The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready to come to terms with the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class\u2014a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Prochaska | first1 = Frank | year = 1999 | title = George V and Republicanism, 1917\u20131919 | url = | journal = Twentieth Century British History | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201351 | doi=10.1093/tcbh/10.1.27}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last1 = Kirk | first1 = Neville | year = 2005 | title = The Conditions of Royal Rule: Australian and British Socialist and Labour Attitudes to the Monarchy, 1901\u201311 | url = | journal = Social History | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 64\u201388 | doi=10.1080/0307102042000337297}}</ref>\n\nThe years between 1922 and 1929 saw frequent changes in government. In 1924, George appointed the first Labour Prime Minister, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], in the absence of a clear majority for any one of the three major parties. George's tactful and understanding reception of the first Labour government (which lasted less than a year) allayed the suspicions of the party's sympathisers. During the [[General Strike of 1926]] the King advised the government of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] against taking inflammatory action,<ref>Nicolson, p. 419; Rose, pp. 341\u2013342</ref> and took exception to suggestions that the strikers were \"revolutionaries\" saying, \"Try living on their wages before you judge them.\"<ref>Rose, p. 340; Sinclair, p. 105</ref>\n\n[[File:ImperialConference.jpg|thumb|alt=A group pose of eight men in smart evening wear.

Alderson is the second ''One Life to Live'' actor after [[Gerald Anthony]] ([[Marco Dane]]) to win an Emmy for a crossover role to ''General Hospital''.\n\nStarr is the oldest child of [[Todd Manning and Blair Cramer]].

The character's most significant storylines featured her dealing with her parents' volatile relationship, her early adolescent friendship with [[Matthew Buchanan]], portrayed by Alderson's real-life brother, Eddie, and her close friendship with [[Langston Wilde]], as well as her romantic relationships with [[Cole Thornhart]] and [[James Ford (One Life to Live)|James Ford]] on ''One Life to Live'' and [[Michael Corinthos]] on ''General Hospital''.\n\n==Casting and creation==\nThe role of Starr was originated by child actors, Ariella and Natalie Jamnik who appeared in the role from in January 1996 upon the character's birth onscreen.

Langston is her best friend, but at the same time, Cole was going through terrible times like Starr was.\" Starr knows she and Cole can't bet together because they both are dealing with their own individual issues, so she goes and finds someone else, Schuyler, and projects her feelings for Cole onto him. Alderson stated that Starr's attraction to her teacher developed \"out of desperation.\" Schuyler helps her realize that the feelings they had for one another were not real, as they were both on the rebound from failed relationships.<ref name=\"Fairman 2009\"/>\n\n====Hannah and James====\nIn the spring of 2010, Starr does not have a date to prom because Cole is in prison. At the time, Cole and Starr's relationship is being threatened by Cole's college lab partner, the crazed [[Hannah O'Connor]] ([[Meghann Fahy]]). Alderson describes Starr's life as being blown apart. Starr and Cole at the time are juggling being parents finishing high school, and their lives appear to be \"settling down,\" \u2014 enter Hannah. \"She spills coffee on herself with Cole, and then Todd, my dad, walks in on the two of them. Something innocent gets blown out of proportion, and then when Marty's pushed down the stairs, Cole automatically thinks it's Todd. It's been upsetting for Starr.\"<ref name=\"MSN 2010\"/> Carlivati stated Hannah as being a \"real problem.\" Cole's incarceration for his brutal attack on \"Todd\" allows for the introduction of another love interest, James (Nic Robuck), the younger brother of [[Robert Ford (One Life to Live)|Robert Ford]] (David A. Gregory), the man Langston is cheating on Markko with. When James and Starr are forced to go on the run together, they fall for one another very quickly. When asked if Starr would get revenge on Hannah for interfering with her relationship with Cole, Alderson revealed that Starr is more focused on whether Cole will be able to make it to the prom. Starr's trust in her father, \"[[Victor Lord, Jr.|Todd]]\" ([[Trevor St. John]]) that Hannah is responsible for Cole's mother, Marty miscarriage, while Cole blames \"Todd\" thanks to Hannah's accusations.<ref name=\"Alderson-Carlivati\"/> When asked if the couple would make it past the next obstacle, Alderson explained, though they love one another and they still have a connection, Cole's friendship with Hannah is what tears them apart. Cole taking Hannah's side when Marty miscarries only makes matters worse. Starr knows Hannah intends to win Cole for herself forcing Starr to fight for Cole. According to Alderson, Cole and Starr are forced to grow up very fast, while their parents continue acting like children, in order to deal with all the issues they face, including the tension between their parents, and becoming teenage parents. Despite them being forced into adulthood, Starr sees their senior prom as sort of a full-circle event, because prom is where it all began for them.<ref name=\"MSN 2010\"/> In late 2010, it is announced that Brandon Buddy would be departing from the series with his character, Cole being sent back to prison for violating his probation. Alderson compares her attraction to James to her prior attraction to Schuyler; because Cole is going to be in jail for the next several years, Starr leans on James. Alderson revealed that James being around Starr's age would be a real threat to her relationship with Cole \"because unlike Schuyler, this is what James wants. Schuyler did not want to get with Starr at any point. He felt feelings for her like a friend. He cared about her, but James not only cares about Starr; he really does have feelings for her and wants to be with her.\"<ref name=\"Starr Attraction\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/starr-attraction-0|title=Starr Attraction|first=Gabrielle|last=Winkel|date=November 8, 2010|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media]]|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|accessdate=November 6, 2012}}</ref> Starr ends her relationship with Cole in early 2011 and soon begins dating James. The relationship is quickly threatened with the introduction of James's ex-girlfriend, Deanna and Starr's music producer, Baz Moreau. Baz seems to have feelings for Starr, but she quickly rejects him because she is dating James. After causing a bit of trouble for the couple, and breaking up Starr's sister Danielle's relationship with Nate, Deena leaves town. Upon the serial's cancellation, many began speculate that Cole would return to the series in time for the finale. However, the show is forced to abandon those plans and quickly recast the role with actor Van Hughes due to Buddy being unable to continue taping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2011/11/01/emergency-recast-brandon-buddy-to-be-replaced-as-one-life-to-lives-cole|title=EMERGENCY RECAST: Brandon Buddy to Be Replaced as One Life to Live's Cole!|date=November 1, 2011|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|work=[[Daytime Confidential]]|first=Jamey|last=Giddens|accessdate=November 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215065317/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2011/11/01/emergency-recast-brandon-buddy-to-be-replaced-as-one-life-to-lives-cole|archive-date=December 15, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2011/11/01/update-van-hughes-cast-as-cole-on-one-life-to-live|title=UPDATE: Van Hughes Cast as Cole on One Life to Live!|date=November 1, 2011|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|work=[[Daytime Confidential]]|first=Jamey|last=Giddens|accessdate=November 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125073416/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2011/11/01/update-van-hughes-cast-as-cole-on-one-life-to-live|archive-date=November 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Losing Cole and Hope===\nUpon Alderson's introduction as Starr on ''General Hospital'', it was assumed by fans and critics that Starr would be paired with Michael Corinthos ([[Chad Duell]]).

Langston is her best friend, but at the same time, Cole was going through terrible times like Starr was.\" Starr knows she and Cole can't bet together because they both are dealing with their own individual issues, so she goes and finds someone else, Schuyler, and projects her feelings for Cole onto him. Alderson stated that Starr's attraction to her teacher developed \"out of desperation.\" Schuyler helps her realize that the feelings they had for one another were not real, as they were both on the rebound from failed relationships.<ref name=\"Fairman 2009\"/>\n\n====Hannah and James====\nIn the spring of 2010, Starr does not have a date to prom because Cole is in prison. At the time, Cole and Starr's relationship is being threatened by Cole's college lab partner, the crazed [[Hannah O'Connor]] ([[Meghann Fahy]]). Alderson describes Starr's life as being blown apart. Starr and Cole at the time are juggling being parents finishing high school, and their lives appear to be \"settling down,\" \u2014 enter Hannah. \"She spills coffee on herself with Cole, and then Todd, my dad, walks in on the two of them. Something innocent gets blown out of proportion, and then when Marty's pushed down the stairs, Cole automatically thinks it's Todd. It's been upsetting for Starr.\"<ref name=\"MSN 2010\"/> Carlivati stated Hannah as being a \"real problem.\" Cole's incarceration for his brutal attack on \"Todd\" allows for the introduction of another love interest, James (Nic Robuck), the younger brother of [[Robert Ford (One Life to Live)|Robert Ford]] (David A. Gregory), the man Langston is cheating on Markko with. When James and Starr are forced to go on the run together, they fall for one another very quickly. When asked if Starr would get revenge on Hannah for interfering with her relationship with Cole, Alderson revealed that Starr is more focused on whether Cole will be able to make it to the prom. Starr's trust in her father, \"[[Victor Lord, Jr.|Todd]]\" ([[Trevor St. John]]) that Hannah is responsible for Cole's mother, Marty miscarriage, while Cole blames \"Todd\" thanks to Hannah's accusations.<ref name=\"Alderson-Carlivati\"/> When asked if the couple would make it past the next obstacle, Alderson explained, though they love one another and they still have a connection, Cole's friendship with Hannah is what tears them apart. Cole taking Hannah's side when Marty miscarries only makes matters worse. Starr knows Hannah intends to win Cole for herself forcing Starr to fight for Cole. According to Alderson, Cole and Starr are forced to grow up very fast, while their parents continue acting like children, in order to deal with all the issues they face, including the tension between their parents, and becoming teenage parents. Despite them being forced into adulthood, Starr sees their senior prom as sort of a full-circle event, because prom is where it all began for them.<ref name=\"MSN 2010\"/> In late 2010, it is announced that Brandon Buddy would be departing from the series with his character, Cole being sent back to prison for violating his probation. Alderson compares her attraction to James to her prior attraction to Schuyler; because Cole is going to be in jail for the next several years, Starr leans on James. Alderson revealed that James being around Starr's age would be a real threat to her relationship with Cole \"because unlike Schuyler, this is what James wants. Schuyler did not want to get with Starr at any point. He felt feelings for her like a friend. He cared about her, but James not only cares about Starr; he really does have feelings for her and wants to be with her.\"<ref name=\"Starr Attraction\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/starr-attraction-0|title=Starr Attraction|first=Gabrielle|last=Winkel|date=November 8, 2010|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media]]|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|accessdate=November 6, 2012}}</ref> Starr ends her relationship with Cole in early 2011 and soon begins dating James. The relationship is quickly threatened with the introduction of James's ex-girlfriend, Deanna and Starr's music producer, Baz Moreau. Baz seems to have feelings for Starr, but she quickly rejects him because she is dating James. After causing a bit of trouble for the couple, and breaking up Starr's sister Danielle's relationship with Nate, Deena leaves town. Upon the serial's cancellation, many began speculate that Cole would return to the series in time for the finale.

However, although Mishima took themes, titles and characters from the noh canon, he included his own twists and modern settings, such as hospitals and ballrooms, which startled audiences who were accustomed to the long-settled originals.\n\nIn total, Mishima wrote 34 novels (including some entertainment novels), about 50 plays, 25 books of short stories, and at least 35 books of essays, one [[libretto]], as well as one film.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Sato |first1= Hideaki |last2= Inoue |first2= Takashi |last3= Yamanaka |first3= Takeshi | title= \u6c7a\u5b9a\u7248 \u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u7d00\u592b\u5168\u96c6\u30fb\u7b2c42\u5dfb\u30fb\u5e74\u8b5c\u30fb\u66f8\u8a8c|trans-title=Final edition-Yukio Mishima complete works No.42-Biographical sketch and Bibliography |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Shinchosha]]|location= |language= Japanese |isbn= 978-4106425820 }}</ref>\n\n==Novels==\n* ''T\u014dzoku'' ([[:ja:\u76d7\u8cca (\u5c0f\u8aac)|\u76d7\u8cca]] ''Thieves''), [[1948 in literature|1948]] \n** ''T\u014dzoku\u2015Dai 1-Sh\u014d Monogatari no Hottan (Koi no Sh\u016bkyoku soshite Monogatari no Hottan)'' (\u76d7\u8cca \u7b2c1\u7ae0 \u7269\u8a9e\u306e\u767a\u7aef (\u604b\u306e\u7d42\u5c40\u305d\u3057\u3066\u7269\u8a9e\u306e\u767a\u7aef) ''Thieves\u2015Chapter 1 Beginning of a Story \uff08End of Love, and The Beginning of a Story\uff09'') [[1948 in literature|1948]] \n** ''T\u014dzoku\u2015Dai 2-Sh\u014d Kesshin to sono Fushigina K\u014dka (Jisatsu Kitosha)'' (\u76d7\u8cca \u7b2c2\u7ae0 \u6c7a\u5fc3\u3068\u305d\u306e\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u52b9\u679c (\u81ea\u6bba\u4f01\u753b\u8005) ''Thieves\u2015Chapter 2 Determination and The Mysterious Effect \uff08Suicide Planner\uff09'') [[1947 in literature|1947]] \n** ''T\u014dzoku\u2015Dai 3-Sh\u014d Deai'' (\u76d7\u8cca \u7b2c3\u7ae0 \u51fa\u4f1a ''Thieves\u2015Chapter 3 Encounter'') [[1948 in literature|1948]] \n** ''T\u014dzoku\u2015Dai 4-Sh\u014d Sh\u016bto na Ky\u014db\u014d\u2015J\u014d (Biteki Seikatsusha)'' (\u76d7\u8cca \u7b2c4\u7ae0 \u5468\u5230\u306a\u5171\u8b00\u2015\u4e0a (\u7f8e\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u8005) ''Thieves\u2015Chapter 4 Careful Conspiracy\u2015upper (One Who Lives Beauty) '') [[1948 in literature|1948]] \n** ''T\u014dzoku\u2015Dai 5-Sh\u014d Sh\u016bto na Ky\u014db\u014d\u2015Ge (Karei)'' (\u76d7\u8cca \u7b2c5\u7ae0 \u5468\u5230\u306a\u5171\u8b00\u2015\u4e0b (\u5609\u4f8b) ''Thieves\u2015Chapter 5 Careful Conspiracy\u2015second (An Auspicious Occasion)'') [[1948 in literature|1948]] \n** ''T\u014dzoku\u2015Dai 6-Sh\u014d Jikk\u014d\u2015Mijikaki Daidanen'' (\u76d7\u8cca \u7b2c6\u7ae0 \u5b9f\u884c\u2015\u77ed\u304d\u5927\u56e3\u5186 ''Thieves\u2015Chapter 6 Practice\u2015Short Grand finale'') [[1948 in literature|1948]] \n* ''Kamen no Kokuhaku'' ([[:ja:\u4eee\u9762\u306e\u544a\u767d|\u4eee\u9762\u306e\u544a\u767d]] ''[[Confessions of a Mask]])'', [[1949 in literature|1949]]\n* ''Ai no Kawaki'' ([[:ja:\u611b\u306e\u6e07\u304d|\u611b\u306e\u6e07\u304d]] ''[[Thirst for Love]]''), [[1950 in literature|1950]]\n* ''Junpaku no Yoru'' ([[:ja:\u7d14\u767d\u306e\u591c|\u7d14\u767d\u306e\u591c]] ''Pure White Nights''), [[1950 in literature|1950]]\n* ''Ao no Jidai'' ([[:ja:\u9752\u306e\u6642\u4ee3 (\u5c0f\u8aac)|\u9752\u306e\u6642\u4ee3]] ''The Age of Blue''), [[1950 in literature|1950]]\n* ''Natsuko no B\u014dken'' ([[:ja:\u590f\u5b50\u306e\u5192\u967a|\u590f\u5b50\u306e\u5192\u967a]] ''Natsuko's Adventure''), [[1951 in literature|1951]]\n* ''Nippon-sei'' ([[:ja:\u306b\u3063\u307d\u3093\u88fd|\u306b\u3064\u307d\u3093\u88fd]] ''Made in Japan''), [[1952 in literature|1952-1953]]\n* ''Kinijiki'' ([[:ja:\u7981\u8272 (\u5c0f\u8aac)|\u7981\u8272]] ''[[Forbidden Colors]]'')\n** ''Kinijiki'' (\u7981\u8272 ''Forbidden Colors''), [[1951 in literature|1951]]\n** ''Higy\u014d'' (\u79d8\u697d ''Secret Pleasure''), [[1953 in literature|1953]]\n* ''Koi no Miyako'' ([[:ja:\u604b\u306e\u90fd|\u604b\u306e\u90fd]] ''The Capital of Love''), [[1954 in literature|1954]]\n* ''Shiosai'' ([[:ja:\u6f6e\u9a12 (\u5c0f\u8aac)|\u6f6e\u9a12]] ''[[The Sound of Waves]]''), [[1954 in literature|1954]]\n* ''Megami'' ([[:ja:\u5973\u795e (\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u7d00\u592b\u306e\u5c0f\u8aac)|\u5973\u795e]] ''Goddess''), [[1954 in literature|1954-1955]]\n* ''Shizumeru Taki'' ([[:ja:\u6c88\u3081\u308b\u6edd|\u6c88\u3081\u308b\u6edd]] ''The Sunken Waterfall''), [[1955 in literature|1955]]\n* ''K\u014dfukug\u014d Shuppan'' ([[:ja:\u5e78\u798f\u53f7\u51fa\u5e06|\u5e78\u798f\u53f7\u51fa\u5e06]] ''The S.S.

''Greater Detroit'' and her sister ship the S.S. ''Greater Buffalo'', to be built by the [[American Ship Building Company]] at their shipyards in [[Lorain, Ohio|Lorain]], [[Ohio]]. The hull of the ''Greater Detroit'' was launched on September 15, 1923, and was then towed to the American Shipbuilding Company yard in Detroit to be fitted out with numerous decks and an ornate wooden interior. This work was completed in almost a year, and the ''Greater Detroit'' began service on August 24, 1924, sailing overnight from Detroit to Buffalo.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe ships were outfitted with the most powerful paddle engines ever built - [[Corliss steam engine|corliss engines]] capable of producing 10,000 hp (7457 kW) and propelling the ship at speeds of up to 21 knots (38.9 km/h).<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The ship's paddlewheel and bow rudder also helped the ship navigate the narrow rivers and harbors common on the great lakes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Mural_from_the_SS_Greater_Detroit.png|left|thumb|A mural from the ship depicting the Detroit and Cleveland Navigation Company's routes]] \n\nThe ship boasted numerous modern luxuries, including distilled water, air conditioning, movie theaters, and [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless equipment]] for communication.

''Greater Detroit'' and her sister ship the S.S. ''Greater Buffalo'', to be built by the [[American Ship Building Company]] at their shipyards in [[Lorain, Ohio|Lorain]], [[Ohio]]. The hull of the ''Greater Detroit'' was launched on September 15, 1923, and was then towed to the American Shipbuilding Company yard in Detroit to be fitted out with numerous decks and an ornate wooden interior. This work was completed in almost a year, and the ''Greater Detroit'' began service on August 24, 1924, sailing overnight from Detroit to Buffalo.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe ships were outfitted with the most powerful paddle engines ever built - [[Corliss steam engine|corliss engines]] capable of producing 10,000 hp (7457 kW) and propelling the ship at speeds of up to 21 knots (38.9 km/h).<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The ship's paddlewheel and bow rudder also helped the ship navigate the narrow rivers and harbors common on the great lakes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Mural_from_the_SS_Greater_Detroit.png|left|thumb|A mural from the ship depicting the Detroit and Cleveland Navigation Company's routes]] \n\nThe ship boasted numerous modern luxuries, including distilled water, air conditioning, movie theaters, and [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless equipment]] for communication.
