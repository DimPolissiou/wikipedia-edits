He envisioned Sand Springs as a haven for orphans and widows.  He helped found and develop Sand Springs as a model city that included all components of a total community.<ref name=\"EOHC-SS\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 Carl N. Gregory, \"Sand Springs\", ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133246/http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 |date=2015-04-02 }}, Accessed May 6, 2011.</ref>\n\nPage bought 160 acres of land in Tulsa County, Oklahoma in 1908, intending to build a home for orphan children. The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa. The townsite was laid out the same year.<ref name = \"EOHC-SS\"/> Sand Springs was incorporated as a city in 1912, with a population of 400.<ref name=\"Davenport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|title=History of Sand Springs, OK|website=www.tulsaokhistory.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112750/http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Page also built the Sand Springs Power Plant, on the southeast corner of Main Street and Morrow Road. It anchored an area that Page intended to use for industrial development. Several significant additions were made to the facility, and it was the sole source of electric power for Sand Springs until 1947.<ref>National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. \"Sand Springs Power Plant.\"</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest manufacturing industries were: Kerr Glass Manufacturing; Commander Mills, Kerr, Hubbard and Kelley Lamp, and Chimney; Southwest Box Company; and Sinclair Prairie Refining Company. Medical and social welfare institutions other than the Sand Springs Home included the Oakwood Sanitorium for nervous and mental diseases, Poole Hospital, the Salvation Army Maternity Home, and the Sand Springs School for the Deaf.<ref name = \"Davenport\" /> Sand Springs became a center of glass production in Oklahoma. Kerr Glass Manufacturing moved to Sand Springs from Chicago in 1913. It and the Alexander H. Kerr company, which made fruit jars, were the only glass companies remaining in business as recently as 1955.<ref name=\"EOHC-Glass\">[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/G/GL002.html Everett, Dianna. \"Glass Manufacturing\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609161551/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/G/GL002.html |date=2011-06-09 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''.</ref>\n\nThe Children's Home is still operating. What used to be the Widows Colony now accepts single mothers with two or more children.\n\nAn EF2 tornado hit Sand Springs on March 25, 2015, killing one resident, injuring 30 citizens, and damaging 50 mobile homes.<ref>https://www.weather.gov/oun/tornadodata-county-ok-tulsa</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 2018, Clyde Boyd Middle School had a [[Carbon Monoxide]] leak. The leak started sometime around the morning. Between 11:15 and 12:58, five students went homesick. And between 1:15 to 1:35, seven more students got sick.<ref>https://www.newson6.com/story/39546855/middle-school-students-treated-after-sand-springs-carbon-monoxide-leak</ref> Around 2:27, an announcement on the intercom told all the students to \"go to the new gym\". Many students went to the hospital from [[Carbon Monoxide Poisoning]]. \"There was no evidence of the presence of carbon monoxide in the 6th Grade Center\". Over 50 students were sent to nearby hospitals. The school didn't have carbon monoxide detectors at the time which the district says \"it'll resolve\". The School was closed for several days while they fixed the problem. <ref>https://www.newson6.com/story/39553912/sand-springs-school-still-closed-after-carbon-monoxide-leak</ref> \nThe district has now installed [[carbon monoxide detectors]].\n\n==Geography==\nSand Springs is located at {{coord|36|8|23|N|96|6|32|W|type:city}} (36.1398102, -96.1088911).<ref>{{GNIS|1092617}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 21.0&nbsp;square miles (54.3&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which, 18.7&nbsp;square miles (48.4&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it is land and 2.3&nbsp;square miles (5.9&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it (10.84%) is water.

A western suburb of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], it is located predominantly in Tulsa County. The population was 18,906 in the 2010 U. S. Census, an increase of 8.3 percent from 17,451 at the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://censusviewer.com/city/OK/Sand+Springs|title=Sand Springs, OK Population - Census 2010 and 2000 Interactive Map, Demographics, Statistics, Quick Facts - CensusViewer|website=censusviewer.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424123654/http://censusviewer.com/city/OK/Sand+Springs|archivedate=24 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe city was founded in 1911, by [[philanthropist]] [[Charles Page]], a wealthy businessman in Oklahoma. He envisioned Sand Springs as a haven for orphans and widows.  He helped found and develop Sand Springs as a model city that included all components of a total community.<ref name=\"EOHC-SS\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 Carl N. Gregory, \"Sand Springs\", ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133246/http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 |date=2015-04-02 }}, Accessed May 6, 2011.</ref>\n\nPage bought 160 acres of land in Tulsa County, Oklahoma in 1908, intending to build a home for orphan children. The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa. The townsite was laid out the same year.<ref name = \"EOHC-SS\"/> Sand Springs was incorporated as a city in 1912, with a population of 400.<ref name=\"Davenport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|title=History of Sand Springs, OK|website=www.tulsaokhistory.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112750/http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Page also built the Sand Springs Power Plant, on the southeast corner of Main Street and Morrow Road. It anchored an area that Page intended to use for industrial development. Several significant additions were made to the facility, and it was the sole source of electric power for Sand Springs until 1947.<ref>National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. \"Sand Springs Power Plant.\"</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest manufacturing industries were: Kerr Glass Manufacturing; Commander Mills, Kerr, Hubbard and Kelley Lamp, and Chimney; Southwest Box Company; and Sinclair Prairie Refining Company. Medical and social welfare institutions other than the Sand Springs Home included the Oakwood Sanitorium for nervous and mental diseases, Poole Hospital, the Salvation Army Maternity Home, and the Sand Springs School for the Deaf.<ref name = \"Davenport\" /> Sand Springs became a center of glass production in Oklahoma. Kerr Glass Manufacturing moved to Sand Springs from Chicago in 1913. It and the Alexander H. Kerr company, which made fruit jars, were the only glass companies remaining in business as recently as 1955.<ref name=\"EOHC-Glass\">[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/G/GL002.html Everett, Dianna. \"Glass Manufacturing\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609161551/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/G/GL002.html |date=2011-06-09 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''.</ref>\n\nThe Children's Home is still operating.

The leak started sometime around the morning. Between 11:15 and 12:58, five students went homesick.

Many students went to the hospital from [[Carbon Monoxide Poisoning]]. \"There was no evidence of the presence of carbon monoxide in the 6th Grade Center\". Over 50 students were sent to nearby hospitals. The school didn't have carbon monoxide detectors at the time which the district says \"it'll resolve\". The School was closed for several days while they fixed the problem. <ref>https://www.newson6.com/story/39553912/sand-springs-school-still-closed-after-carbon-monoxide-leak</ref> \nThe district has now installed [[carbon monoxide detectors]].\n\n==Geography==\nSand Springs is located at {{coord|36|8|23|N|96|6|32|W|type:city}} (36.1398102, -96.1088911).<ref>{{GNIS|1092617}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 21.0&nbsp;square miles (54.3&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which, 18.7&nbsp;square miles (48.4&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it is land and 2.3&nbsp;square miles (5.9&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it (10.84%) is water.

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s. Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" and \"Guyute\") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much like the music of one of their heroes, [[Frank Zappa]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. In November 1995, Anastasio told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' \"When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they'd compare us to.

Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website.

Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]].

The band is known for [[musical improvisation]], extended [[Jam session#Rock|jams]], blending of [[Music genre|genres]], and a dedicated [[Fandom|fan base]]. The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.\n\nThe band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the quartet lineup has remained in place since then.

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s. Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" and \"Guyute\") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much like the music of one of their heroes, [[Frank Zappa]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. In November 1995, Anastasio told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' \"When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they'd compare us to.

Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website.

Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]].

Among the first was ''Analyze Phish'' which was hosted by comedians [[Harris Wittels]] and [[Scott Aukerman]] for the [[Earwolf]] podcast network, and ran for ten episodes posted between 2011 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish 101, episode #1 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/phish-101/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fuego, episode #10 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/fuego/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref> The podcast followed Wittels, a devoted fan of the band, in his humorous attempts to get Aukerman to enjoy their music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Harris Wittels: The Parks and Rec Writer Gets to \"Analyze Phish\" (Throwback) |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/harris-wittels-the-parks-and-rec-writer-gets-to-analyze-phish/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=26 February 2015}}</ref> Despite its truncated run, ''Analyze Phish'' inspired Phish lyricist Tom Marshall to start his own Phish podcast, ''Under the Scales'', in 2016.<ref name=\"osiris\">{{cite web |last1=Greenhaus |first1=Mike |title=Interview: Tom Marshall and RJ Bee on New Podcast Network Osiris |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/interview_tom_marshall_and_rj_bee_on_new_podcast_network_osiris/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=22 February 2018}}</ref> In 2018, Marshall co-founded the Osiris Podcasting Network, which hosts ''Under the Scales'' and other music podcasts, many of which are devoted to Phish or other jam bands.<ref name=\"osiris\"/> On 15 September 2019, C13Originals debuted ''Long May They Run'', a music documentary podcast series.
