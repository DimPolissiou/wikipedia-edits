P. Sanders, the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth narratives]] in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in [[Bethlehem]], in accordance with Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads as though it was invented to identify Jesus as like a new [[Moses]], and the historian [[Josephus]] reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that [[Massacre of the Innocents|he massacred little boys]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=85\u201388}}\n\nSanders says that the genealogies of Jesus are based not on historical information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=80\u201391}} In any event, once the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from [[David]] through Joseph.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=196}} Luke reports that Jesus was a [[Consanguinity|blood relation]] of [[John the Baptist]], but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=80\u201391}}<ref name=\"ActJBirth\">[[Robert W.

Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. p. 294</ref>\n\nThe Gospels portray Jesus teaching in well-defined sessions, such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]] in the Gospel of Matthew or the parallel [[Sermon on the Plain]] in Luke. According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of Jesus, but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings, which had originally been recorded without context.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=17\u201362}} While Jesus' [[miracle]]s fit within the social context of [[Ancient history|antiquity]], he defined them differently. First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed. Second, he connected them to [[end time]]s prophecy.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=310}}\n\nJesus chose [[Apostle (Christian)|twelve disciples]] {{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=10}} (the \"Twelve\"), evidently as an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] message.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186\u201387}} All three Synoptics mention the Twelve, although the names on Luke's list vary from those in Mark and Matthew, suggesting that Christians were not certain who all the disciples were.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186\u201387}} The twelve disciples might have represented the twelve original [[Twelve Tribes of Israel|tribes of Israel]], which would be restored once God's rule was instituted.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186\u201387}} The disciples were reportedly meant to be the rulers of the tribes in the coming Kingdom (Matthew 19:28, Luke 22:30).{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186\u201387}} According to Bart Ehrman, Jesus' promise that the Twelve would rule is historical, because the Twelve included [[Judas Iscariot]]. In Ehrman's view, no Christians would have invented a line from Jesus, promising rulership to the disciple who betrayed him.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|pp=186\u201387}}\nIn Mark, the disciples play hardly any role other than a negative one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and doubtful.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=123\u201324}} They serve as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Jesus and to other characters.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=123\u201324}} The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=123\u201324}}\n\nSanders says that Jesus' mission was not about [[repentance]], although he acknowledges that this opinion is unpopular. He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was [[John the Baptist]]'s message, and that Jesus' ministry would not have been scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=230\u201336}} According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=336}}\n\n====Role====\nJesus taught that an apocalyptic figure, the \"[[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]]\", would soon come on clouds of glory to gather the elect, or chosen ones (Mark 13:24\u201327, Matthew 24:29\u201331, Luke 21:25\u201328). He referred to himself as a \"[[son of man]]\" in the colloquial sense of \"a person\", but scholars do not know whether he also meant himself when he referred to the heavenly \"Son of Man\". [[Paul the Apostle]] and other early Christians interpreted the \"Son of Man\" as the risen Jesus.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nThe title [[Christ (title)|Christ]], or [[Messiah]], indicates that Jesus' followers believed him to be the anointed heir of King [[David]], whom some Jews expected to save Israel. The Gospels refer to him not only as a Messiah but in the absolute form as \"the Messiah\" or, equivalently, \"the Christ\". In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as \"his Messiah\". The tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether Jesus defined his [[Eschatology|eschatological]] role as that of the Messiah.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Messiah}} The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a Messiah figure and others not.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=533\u201340}} Based on the Christian tradition, [[Gerd Theissen]] advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title \"Messiah\".{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=533\u201340}} Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the Messiah, albeit in the sense that he would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in,<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrman|first= Bart|url= http://ehrmanblog.org/judas-and-the-messianic-secret/ |title=Judas and the Messianic Secret|website= The Bart Ehrman Blog|date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> not in the sense that most people today think of the term.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrman|first= Bart|url= http://ehrmanblog.org/jesus-claim-to-be-the-messiah/ |title=Jesus' Claim to be the Messiah|website= The Bart Ehrman Blog|date=December 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Passover and crucifixion in Jerusalem====\nAround AD 30, Jesus and his followers traveled from [[Galilee]] to [[Jerusalem]] to observe [[Passover]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=10}} Jesus caused a disturbance in the [[Second Temple]],{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}} which was the center of Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=254\u201362}} Jesus held a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. His words as recorded in the Synoptic gospels and Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|First Letter to the Corinthians]] do not entirely agree, but this symbolic meal appears to have pointed to Jesus' place in the coming Kingdom of God when very probably Jesus knew he was about to be killed, although he may have still hoped that God might yet intervene.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=263\u201364}}\n\nThe Gospels say that Jesus was betrayed to the authorities by a disciple, and many scholars consider this report to be highly reliable.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}} He was executed on the orders of [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman [[prefect]] of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judaea]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}} Pilate most likely saw Jesus' reference to the Kingdom of God as a threat to Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=465\u201366}} The Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple more plausibly had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}} They may have regarded him as a threat to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Second Temple.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}}<ref name=\"JE1906\"/> Other factors, such as Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, may have contributed to this decision.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=269\u201373}} Most scholars consider Jesus' crucifixion to be factual, because early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}}{{sfn|Meier|2006|pp=126\u201328}}\n\n====After crucifixion====\n[[File:The Resurrection Beaufort arms in border (f. 131) Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|The Resurrection of Christ from a 16th-century manuscript of ''La Passion de Nostre Seigneur'']]\nAfter Jesus' death, his followers said he rose from the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear.

He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was [[John the Baptist]]'s message, and that Jesus' ministry would not have been scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=230\u201336}} According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=336}}\n\n====Role====\nJesus taught that an apocalyptic figure, the \"[[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]]\", would soon come on clouds of glory to gather the elect, or chosen ones (Mark 13:24\u201327, Matthew 24:29\u201331, Luke 21:25\u201328). He referred to himself as a \"[[son of man]]\" in the colloquial sense of \"a person\", but scholars do not know whether he also meant himself when he referred to the heavenly \"Son of Man\". [[Paul the Apostle]] and other early Christians interpreted the \"Son of Man\" as the risen Jesus.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nThe title [[Christ (title)|Christ]], or [[Messiah]], indicates that Jesus' followers believed him to be the anointed heir of King [[David]], whom some Jews expected to save Israel. The Gospels refer to him not only as a Messiah but in the absolute form as \"the Messiah\" or, equivalently, \"the Christ\". In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as \"his Messiah\". The tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether Jesus defined his [[Eschatology|eschatological]] role as that of the Messiah.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Messiah}} The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a Messiah figure and others not.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=533\u201340}} Based on the Christian tradition, [[Gerd Theissen]] advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title \"Messiah\".{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=533\u201340}} Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the Messiah, albeit in the sense that he would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in,<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrman|first= Bart|url= http://ehrmanblog.org/judas-and-the-messianic-secret/ |title=Judas and the Messianic Secret|website= The Bart Ehrman Blog|date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> not in the sense that most people today think of the term.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrman|first= Bart|url= http://ehrmanblog.org/jesus-claim-to-be-the-messiah/ |title=Jesus' Claim to be the Messiah|website= The Bart Ehrman Blog|date=December 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Passover and crucifixion in Jerusalem====\nAround AD 30, Jesus and his followers traveled from [[Galilee]] to [[Jerusalem]] to observe [[Passover]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=10}} Jesus caused a disturbance in the [[Second Temple]],{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}} which was the center of Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=254\u201362}} Jesus held a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. His words as recorded in the Synoptic gospels and Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|First Letter to the Corinthians]] do not entirely agree, but this symbolic meal appears to have pointed to Jesus' place in the coming Kingdom of God when very probably Jesus knew he was about to be killed, although he may have still hoped that God might yet intervene.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=263\u201364}}\n\nThe Gospels say that Jesus was betrayed to the authorities by a disciple, and many scholars consider this report to be highly reliable.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}} He was executed on the orders of [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman [[prefect]] of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judaea]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|p=11}} Pilate most likely saw Jesus' reference to the Kingdom of God as a threat to Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=465\u201366}} The Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple more plausibly had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}} They may have regarded him as a threat to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Second Temple.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|loc=Jesus Christ}}<ref name=\"JE1906\"/> Other factors, such as Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, may have contributed to this decision.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=269\u201373}} Most scholars consider Jesus' crucifixion to be factual, because early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}}{{sfn|Meier|2006|pp=126\u201328}}\n\n====After crucifixion====\n[[File:The Resurrection Beaufort arms in border (f. 131) Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|The Resurrection of Christ from a 16th-century manuscript of ''La Passion de Nostre Seigneur'']]\nAfter Jesus' death, his followers said he rose from the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear.

A disagreement in contemporary research is whether Jesus was [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]]. Most scholars conclude that he was an apocalyptic preacher, like [[John the Baptist]] and [[Paul the Apostle]]. In contrast, certain prominent North American scholars, such as [[Burton Mack]] and John Dominic Crossan, advocate for a non-eschatological Jesus, one who is more of a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]] than an apocalyptic preacher.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pp=1\u201315}} In addition to portraying Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet, a charismatic healer or a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic philosopher]], some scholars portray him as the true Messiah or an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] prophet of [[social change]].<ref name=\"CambHist23\">{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Christianity| volume= 1 |first1= Margaret M.|last1= Mitchell |first2= Frances M. |last2=Young |year= 2006| isbn= 978-0-521-81239-9|publisher=Cambridge University Press| page= 23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UTfmw_zStsC&pg=PA23 }}</ref>{{sfn|K\u00f6stenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=124\u201325}} However, the attributes described in the portraits sometimes overlap, and scholars who differ on some attributes sometimes agree on others.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Why Study the Historical Jesus? | encyclopedia=Handbook for the Study of the Historical Jesus | publisher=Brill | year=2011 | first=Colin | last=Brown | page=1416 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LuKMmVu0tpMC&pg=PA1416 | isbn=978-90-04-16372-0 | editor1-first=Tom | editor1-last=Holmen | editor2-first=Stanley E. | editor2-last=Porter }}</ref>\n\nSince the 18th century, scholars have occasionally put forth that Jesus was a political national messiah, but the evidence for this portrait is negligible.

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n|headline=''3.15.20'' track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n| title1 = 0.00\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n|headline=''3.15.20'' track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n| title1 = 0.00\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.

In the conversations, when Weeraya was travelling to [[Taiwan]] in 2018, Bright commented on a photo and said \"Looks like a Chinese girl\". Weeraya replied \"What?\" Other netizens left a message and asked, \"What style is this today?\" Weeraya replied, \"Taiwanese girl.\" Some mainland Chinese netizens interpreted this dialogue as Weeraya supporting [[Taiwanese independence]]. Some mainland Chinese netizens also mentioned that Weeraya once tweeted alternative theories around the origin of [[SARS-CoV-2]], and that Bright also praised the tweet. In addition, Bright had also reposted an article about the [[2019 Hong Kong extradition bill]] that sparked the [[2019-20 Hong Kong protests]]. Since the article listed [[Hong Kong]] as a country, Bright publicly apologized to mainland Chinese netizens. Afterwards, mainland Chinese netizens brigaded Weeraya's Twitter and Instagram accounts with messages, accusing them of \"humiliating China\" and demanding an apology. The hashtag #\u6cf0\u570b\u8fb1\u83ef (#ThailandInsultsChina) was promoted onto [[Microblogging in China|Weibo]]'s top searches list, and the Thai TV series [[2gether: The Series (Thai TV series)]] was brigaded with negative comments on [[Douban]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/17/nnevvy-bright-firewall-thailand-china-online-army/|title=Thais Show How to Beat China's Online Army|first=Lauren|last=Teixeira}}</ref>\n\n==Incident==\nThai netizens felt dissatisfied at the behavior of mainland Chinese netizens, and immediately went to Bright and Weeraya\u2019s social media accounts to support the two.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscats.org/?p=23988|title=PROOF China Covered Up Coronavirus &#124; Thai-China Meme War \u2013 Newscats Hasslefree Allsort}}</ref>\n\nNetizens from both [[China]] and [[Thailand]] immediately launched a scolding battle (meme war). Thai netizens questioned why China did not apologize for the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]], and said \"Taiwan is an independent country\", questioning why [[mainland Chinese]] citizens needed a [[Travel visa|visa]] to visit [[Taiwan]], but [[Thailand|Thai]] citizens did not need a visa to go to [[Pattaya]]. During the dispute, netizens from the [[Japan]], [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[South Korea]], [[India]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Hong Kong]] also joined the war in solidarity with the Thai side, and the #nnevvy hashtag was added to [[Twitter]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/netizens-milktea-04152020142015.html|title=Milk Tea Alliance Takes on China's Little Pinks in Meme War|website=Radio Free Asia}}</ref>\n\nThe focus of the scolding war then gradually shifted to topics such as the leaders of [[China]] and [[Thailand]], food culture and historical events in the two places. Mainland Chinese netizens insulted the Thai king [[Rama X]] and asked \"Where are your kings going?\". Thai netizens asked the mainland Chinese netizens to \"speak again\", \"speak louder\" and responded with \"we are also looking for him, thank you for your concern!\". Mainland Chinese netizens also insulted Thai netizens with \"nmsl\" (\"Your mother is dead\" in Chinese [[pinyin]]) and similar phrases. Thai netizens responded, \"we have 20 mothers\" (a reference to [[Rama X]]'s retreat in Paris during the coronavirus pandemic) and ridiculed the many Thai queen palaces. Mainland Chinese netizens called Thailand's prime minister \"stupid\" and government \"very trash\", Thai netizens expressed their agreement and asked the other party to \"speak louder.\" Thai netizens accused Chinese state leader [[Xi Jinping]] for his policies. They also satirized China\u2019s lack of freedom and expressed their support for Taiwan and Hong Kong\u2019s independence. On the topic of food culture, mainland Chinese netizens said that Thai food is not appetizing, but Thai netizens responded \"because you all eat bats\". Since Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Thailand all have unique and famous [[Milk tea]]s, the three countries started calling each other \"milk tea\" in solidarity. In addition, mainland Chinese netizens were noted for being only able to use [[swear words]] such as \"NMSL\" and \"CNMB\" (\"fuck your mother's cunt\"). The Thai netizens counterattacked that the netizens were not \"[[Chinese people|Chinese]]\" but \"Nmslese\" (\"your mother is dead\" people). Thai netizens also used \"June 4th\", \"[[Tiananmen Incident]]\", \"[[1989]]\" and other sensitive keywords in mainland China to attack the other side. Mainland Chinese netizens countered with the [[Thammasat University massacre]] in 1976, but Thai netizens asked the other side to \"speak louder\", and responded that \"unlike some countries, our government will not hide the truth from people\" and \"are you ready to face the incidents of 1989?\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supchina.com/2020/04/13/chinese-nationalists-and-thai-meme-creators-face-off-on-twitter/|title=Chinese nationalists and Thai meme-creators face off on Twitter|author=Luiz|date=April 13, 2020|website=SupChina}}</ref>\n\n[[Joshua Wong]], a Hong Kong democracy activist, also vocally supported the \"Milk Tea Alliance\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1249254158538072064|title=1.

In the conversations, when Weeraya was travelling to [[Taiwan]] in 2018, Bright commented on a photo and said \"Looks like a Chinese girl\". Weeraya replied \"What?\" Other netizens left a message and asked, \"What style is this today?\" Weeraya replied, \"Taiwanese girl.\" Some mainland Chinese netizens interpreted this dialogue as Weeraya supporting [[Taiwanese independence]]. Some mainland Chinese netizens also mentioned that Weeraya once tweeted alternative theories around the origin of [[SARS-CoV-2]], and that Bright also praised the tweet. In addition, Bright had also reposted an article about the [[2019 Hong Kong extradition bill]] that sparked the [[2019-20 Hong Kong protests]]. Since the article listed [[Hong Kong]] as a country, Bright publicly apologized to mainland Chinese netizens. Afterwards, mainland Chinese netizens brigaded Weeraya's Twitter and Instagram accounts with messages, accusing them of \"humiliating China\" and demanding an apology. The hashtag #\u6cf0\u570b\u8fb1\u83ef (#ThailandInsultsChina) was promoted onto [[Weibo]]'s top searches list, and the Thai TV series [[2gether: The Series (Thai TV series)]] was brigaded with negative comments on [[Douban]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/17/nnevvy-bright-firewall-thailand-china-online-army/|title=Thais Show How to Beat China's Online Army|first=Lauren|last=Teixeira}}</ref>\n\n==Incident==\nThai netizens felt dissatisfied at the behavior of mainland Chinese netizens, and immediately went to Bright and Weeraya\u2019s social media accounts to support the two.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscats.org/?p=23988|title=PROOF China Covered Up Coronavirus &#124; Thai-China Meme War \u2013 Newscats Hasslefree Allsort}}</ref>\n\nNetizens from both [[China]] and [[Thailand]] immediately launched a scolding battle (meme war). Thai netizens questioned why China did not apologize for the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]], and said \"Taiwan is an independent country\", questioning why [[mainland Chinese]] citizens needed a [[visa]] to visit [[Taiwan]], but [[Thai]] citizens did not need a visa to go to [[Pattaya]]. During the dispute, netizens from the [[Japan]], [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[South Korea]], [[India]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Hong Kong]] also joined the war in solidarity with the Thai side, and the #nnevvy hashtag was added to [[Twitter]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/netizens-milktea-04152020142015.html|title=Milk Tea Alliance Takes on China's Little Pinks in Meme War|website=Radio Free Asia}}</ref>\n\nThe focus of the scolding war then gradually shifted to topics such as the leaders of [[China]] and [[Thailand]], food culture and historical events in the two places. Mainland Chinese netizens insulted the Thai king [[Rama X]] and asked \"Where are your kings going?\". Thai netizens asked the mainland Chinese netizens to \"speak again\", \"speak louder\" and responded with \"we are also looking for him, thank you for your concern!\". Mainland Chinese netizens also insulted Thai netizens with \"nmsl\" (\"Your mother is dead\" in Chinese [[pinyin]]) and similar phrases. Thai netizens responded, \"we have 20 mothers\" (a reference to [[Rama X]]'s retreat in Paris during the coronavirus pandemic) and ridiculed the many Thai queen palaces. Mainland Chinese netizens called Thailand's prime minister \"stupid\" and government \"very trash\", Thai netizens expressed their agreement and asked the other party to \"speak louder.\" Thai netizens accused Chinese state leader [[Xi Jinping]] for his policies. They also satirized China\u2019s lack of freedom and expressed their support for Taiwan and Hong Kong\u2019s independence. On the topic of food culture, mainland Chinese netizens said that Thai food is not appetizing, but Thai netizens responded \"because you all eat bats\". Since Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Thailand all have unique and famous [[Milk tea]]s, the three countries started calling each other \"milk tea\" in solidarity. In addition, mainland Chinese netizens were noted for being only able to use [[swear words]] such as \"NMSL\" and \"CNMB\" (\"fuck your mother's cunt\"). The Thai netizens counterattacked that the netizens were not \"[[Chinese]]\" but \"Nmslese\" (\"your mother is dead\" people). Thai netizens also used \"June 4th\", \"[[Tiananmen Incident]]\", \"[[1989]]\" and other sensitive keywords in mainland China to attack the other side. Mainland Chinese netizens countered with the [[Thammasat University massacre]] in 1976, but Thai netizens asked the other side to \"speak louder\", and responded that \"unlike some countries, our government will not hide the truth from people\" and \"are you ready to face the incidents of 1989?\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supchina.com/2020/04/13/chinese-nationalists-and-thai-meme-creators-face-off-on-twitter/|title=Chinese nationalists and Thai meme-creators face off on Twitter|author=Luiz|date=April 13, 2020|website=SupChina}}</ref>\n\n[[Joshua Wong]], a Hong Kong democracy activist, also vocally supported the \"Milk Tea Alliance\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1249254158538072064|title=1.

In ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'', set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, she is portrayed by [[Nina Dobrev]]. In the books, Elena was blonde, popular, selfish and a \"[[Meanness|mean girl]]\". However the show's producers, Julie Plec and [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]], felt that it wasn't the direction they wanted to go with their heroine in ''The Vampire Diaries'' television series. Instead, she became a nicer, relatable and more of \"the girl next door\" type, until her life gets flipped upside down when she meets the Salvatore Brothers. In April 2015, Nina Dobrev announced that she would be departing the series after the sixth-season finale.\n\nMuch of Elena's story revolves around her relationships with vampires [[Stefan Salvatore]] and his older brother, [[Damon Salvatore|Damon]]. It is revealed that Elena is a Petrova [[Doppelg\u00e4nger]], which is thus responsible for her being identical to her ancestor, [[Katherine Pierce]] (n\u00e9e Katerina Petrova). This also has the implication of making her a supernatural creature. Dobrev portrayed the \"conniving\" Katherine as well, who is opposite of Elena. The actress stated that it has been a challenge distinguishing the two, and enjoys playing them both. In the television series's fourth season, Elena becomes a vampire and dies then deals with the struggles that come with her change. She took the cure and became human again towards the end of the sixth season. In the finale of the sixth season, Kai linked Elena to Bonnie's life by magic. Elena will only wake up when Bonnie dies in around 60 years. She was locked inside the Salvatore tomb, then relocated to a warehouse in Brooklyn, New York in the seventh season, then back to Mystic Falls. In late 2016, when it was announced that the eighth season would be the final season, Dobrev was in talks about returning to the television series to reprise her role in the final episode. After much speculation. Dobrev's return was confirmed on January 26, 2017, via an [[Instagram]] post. Dobrev appeared in the final episode of the show as both Elena and her evil doppelg\u00e4nger Katherine Pierce.\n\n==Casting and portrayal==\n{{quote box\n|quoted=true\n|width = 17em\n|align=left \n|bgcolor= white \n|border = 0px\n|fontsize = 95%\n|quote = When I look in the mirror, I just feel different when I'm Katherine or when I'm Elena.

With the help of John's brother Grayson, Isobel and John flee town days later, leaving Grayson and his wife Miranda to adopt Elena as their own. A doctor, Grayson fakes a birth certificate so that it appeared Elena was his daughter with Miranda. The next year, Miranda and Grayson had a child of their own, Jeremy Gilbert. Elena dates her childhood friend Matt Donovan, who was her first love. On 23 May 2009, Elena is picked up by her mother and father after getting in a fight with Matt while attending the party. The three of them later end up in a car accident, with their car driving off a bridge. Stefan Salvatore finds them, and saves Elena, but it was too late to save Grayson and Miranda, who died. It remained unknown for months who saved Elena, and it was considered a miracle that she lived. Her relationship with Matt ended when they broke up.\n\n===Storyline===\n\n====Season 1====\nElena, still empty after losing her parents, begins to fit back into school. She meets a mysterious new student named Stefan Salvatore. They connect instantly, and begin dating. She meets his older and malevolent brother, Damon. After researching, Elena realizes Stefan was alive in 1953. It is later revealed that he is a 162-year-old vampire. Damon also begins falling for Elena. Elena finds a picture of a woman named Katherine Pierce who looks exactly like her. Stefan reveals that it is the woman who made him and Damon feud 145 years ago, and the person who turned them into vampires. He also told her that he is the person that saved her the night of her parents death. At the end of season one, Elena discovers that Grayson and Miranda weren't her biological parents, and that a woman named Isobel and her uncle John, who she grew up hating, were.\n\n====Season 2====\nIn season two, she learns that she is a Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger, having an appearance just like Katherine Pierce, which means that she has to be sacrificed to release Klaus' werewolf side. The sacrifice later happens, but Elena is saved, because John sacrificed himself for her after being put under a spell by Bonnie. However, her aunt Jenna is turned into a vampire and, as part of the sacrifice, is killed by Klaus, leaving Elena without a guardian. In the season two finale, while Damon is dying due to a werewolf bite, she forgives him for forcing her to drink his blood and kisses him with the thought that it might be Damon's last day, however Damon gets cured by drinking Klaus' blood.\n\n====Season 3====\nIn season three, Elena does everything in her power to make Stefan get his humanity back, which was turned off by Klaus as payment for saving Damon from a werewolf bite in the latter part of season two. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Damon while working together on saving Stefan and trying to defeat Klaus, eventually even sharing a kiss. She later admits to Stefan that she has feelings for Damon as well but that she never stopped loving Stefan. While in Denver together, Elena kisses Damon, later telling him that she doesn't know how she feels about him. It is eventually revealed that Elena met Damon the night of her parent's death, though he compelled her to forget. She eventually chooses Stefan in the season finale but before she can tell him, Elena drowns while having vampire blood in her system. During the last moments of season three, she awakens as a vampire in transition.\n\n====Season 4====\nIn season four, Elena is faced with the tough decision of whether to die or to feed on human blood so she can fully transition into a vampire. Elena, after realizing Stefan's desperation to keep her alive, decides to complete her transition. Her relationship with Stefan ends, allowing her to begin a proper romance with Damon. Although, it is later revealed there is a sire bond between them. Sometime later whilst searching for the cure for vampirism, Jeremy is fed to the immortal Silas by Katherine. As a result, Damon used the sire bond to convince her to turn off her humanity, due to her incredible grief over losing her brother and the last remaining member of her family. Elena became ruthless without her emotions, going on killing sprees and being very hateful towards her friends. Towards the end of season four, Damon kills Matt in front of Elena to trigger her grief. After revealing that Matt had the Gilbert Ring on, Elena's humanity was switched on and her emotions were focused on hate towards Katherine for killing Jeremy. Season four ended with Bonnie as a ghost after bringing Jeremy back to life and Elena fed Katherine the cure for vampirism in a moment of desperation as she was about to be killed. Elena had chosen Damon as the Salvatore that she loved.\n\n====Season 5====\nIn season five, Elena starts at Whitmore College and is happy after spending the summer with Damon. There she realises that Silas has taken Stefan's place and that Stefan is in that safe in a river constantly drowning. She and Damon then find the safe, only to find a dead body there meaning that someone opened the safe and Stefan is a Ripper again. However, Qetsiyah had fried Stefan's brain causing him to suffer amnesia. While trying to bring him back, they almost kiss meaning that she still feels something for him. Qetsiyah soon brings back Stefan's memories and says that Elena and Stefan were always meant to be as the Universe had to unite the doppelg\u00e4ngers of Silas and Amara. This leaves Damon and Elena questioning their relationship. Later on she is kidnapped and experimented on by Wes Maxfield, and she learns that her father also used to experiment on vampires.\nLater, when Katherine is about to die as a result of all of her years catching up with her as a result of having the cure in her system, Katherine uses a spell and possesses Elena, a fact that her friends were initially unable to deduce. But once they did, they trapped Katherine and left her with no escape. Stefan stabbed her with the traveller dagger, but ghost Katherine reveals to Bonnie, shortly before trying to cross into the Other Side, that she had injected Dr. Maxfield's enhanced ripper/werewolf virus into Elena's body, infecting Elena. The gang is eventually able to find an antidote.\nShe unfortunately loses trust in Damon, partly because he killed her friend Aaron, so they break up, but realise they cannot survive being apart and get back together.\nOnce Markos and his traveller army begin to take over Mystic Falls, setting an anti-magic barrier around the town, the gang comes up with a plan to take out the travellers by killing them all at the same time, overpowering the anchor to the Other Side AKA Bonnie and creating a possible way out of the now-collapsing Other Side. Elena and Damon drive into the gas-filled Mystic Grill with most of the travellers in it, blowing it up and killing most of the people in it, including Elena and Damon. She wakes up as a ghost and finds her body, sending her to Bonnie, where she passes to the Other Side, and she and many others are able to pass back to the land of the living afterwards. But the spell that allows this is broken before Damon passes back through, and as Bonnie is the anchor, she is a part of the Other Side and shall therefore disappear along with it. This leaves the gang mourning the loss of Damon and Bonnie in the season finale.\n\n====Season 6====\nIn season six, Elena starts back at Whitmore, and is unable to set foot in her hometown. She is also unable to recover from Damon's death and starts lurking the borders of Mystic Falls in order to grab civilians, drink their blood, then compel them to forget, but as spirit magic no longer works in Mystic Falls, any of her victims who cross into the town remember the ordeal, putting her identity as a vampire at risk when one of her victims, Sarah, comes to town.\nElena begs Alaric to compel her to forget that she ever loved Damon, which Alaric is able to do, due to him being an Enhanced Original, with the ability to compel other vampires. She eventually wears him down and asks her friends to never remind her once the compulsion had been done. After a number of failed attempts, Alaric successfully compels her to forget her love for Damon. She however leaves Alaric with some of her reminders of Damon, should she ever need them again. She is told of her former feelings for Damon soon afterwards, but decides to stay the way she is, as she doesn't want to go back to being unhappy again. She starts to date her classmate, Liam. \nOnce Damon comes back to life, Alaric tries to convince Elena to allow him to undo the compulsion, a decision she is reluctant to make. She eventually decides to have him undo it, but Alaric goes back to being human again after crossing into Mystic Falls, causing him to lose his vampire status (he only stayed alive because his once fatal human injuries were healed), meaning he will not be able to do so. She is then left to finally come face-to-face with Damon and see if she'll still feel the same way about him. They eventually rekindle their relationship, Elena takes the cure that Bonnie gave Damon. At Alaric's wedding, Kai ruins their wedding and casts a sleeping spell on Elena, linking her life to Bonnie's. She makes a sacrifice to let Bonnie live out her life until it is her turn. She bids goodbye to her friends and loved ones before parting ways but knows that she will see Damon, Stefan and Caroline again one day.\n\n====Season 7====\nElena doesn't make an appearance but is heard calling Damon's name when he visits the Armory vault. It was a way of Sybil, the Siren, luring him into a trap.\n\n====Season 8====\nIn the final episode, Elena makes an appearance. When a weakened Bonnie dies from the sounding bell, she meets Elena in a dream-like forest. Elena hugs her and wonders if she really has died. Enzo appears and says it isn't her time and takes Bonnie back to the world of the living. When Bonnie wakes up, it was Stefan who resuscitated her. Elena, asleep, is then taken to the Mystic Falls High School by Katherine and places her in the boiler room. Stefan tries to rescue Elena, but Katherine had Kai spell the boiler room, so that Elena can't be taken out of the room. After Bonnie had deflected the hellfire back into the bell, Bonnie passes out. Elena wakes up and wanders the school. Stefan meets up with her. It looks like Bonnie has died, but in fact Elena is still sleeping and Stefan's ghost came to visit her in her dream. He had taken the place of killing Katherine instead of Damon, since Damon is human after Stefan gave him the cure. He came to say goodbye. After a tearful hug and saying goodbye, Stefan goes into afterlife. Elena finally wakes up because Bonnie has broken the spell over her. Elena reunites with Damon and the rest of the gang. Elena gives Caroline the message Stefan whispered into her ear, saying he did hear her voice message and will love her forever. In the epilogue, Elena continued to study at medical school. After finishing her education, she went back to Mystic Falls and lived together with Damon, happily married for a long time. After living out her life, she crosses over to the afterlife where she finally reunites with her parents, Aunt Jenna and Uncle John.\n\n==== Post-Season 8 ====\nThe second-last episode of ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'', '[[The Originals (season 5)|The Tale of Two Wolves]]', features [[List of The Originals characters|Elijah and Hope Mikaelson]] visiting Mystic Falls, and the window of a doctor's office reads 'Elena Salvatore, M.D.', showing that Elena got her own medical practice.\n\n==Reception==\nElena has received mainly positive reviews. Steve West of the Cinema Blend compared the story of ''The Vampire Diaries'' and the character of Elena to the popular vampire franchise, ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', and its protagonist [[Bella Swan]]. West said \"Clearly Elena is way hotter than Bella, she has two immortal vampires fighting over her\".<ref name=\"casted\" /> After she transitioned into a vampire, Carina Adly MacKenzie of [[Zap2it]] hoped that the \"fierce\" and \"ripper\" side of Elena would emerge when \"someone messes with the people she loves\".<ref name=\"AT\" /> McKenzie noted that when a person becomes a vampire, \"their strongest personality traits are heightened\", and hoped that wouldn't see Elena's \"compassion and selflessness\" double into \"helping old ladies with their groceries and nursing injured animals back to health\".<ref name=\"AT\">{{cite web|last=MacKenzie|first=Carina Adly|title='The Vampire Diaries' Season 4: Elena vs Katherine and 10 other things we want to see|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/05/the-vampire-diaries-season-4-elena-vs-katherine-and-10-other-things-we-want-to-see.html|work=[[Zap2it]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=24 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102111025/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/05/the-vampire-diaries-season-4-elena-vs-katherine-and-10-other-things-we-want-to-see.html|archive-date=2 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Robyn Ross of ''[[TV Guide]]'' also hoped that after Elena \"has had a taste for blood\", she would lose control.

In ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'', set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, she is portrayed by [[Nina Dobrev]]. In the books, Elena was blonde, popular, selfish and a \"[[Meanness|mean girl]]\". However the show's producers, Julie Plec and [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]], felt that it wasn't the direction they wanted to go with their heroine in ''The Vampire Diaries'' television series. Instead, she became a nicer, relatable and more of \"the girl next door\" type, until her life gets flipped upside down when she meets the Salvatore Brothers. In April 2015, Nina Dobrev announced that she would be departing the series after the sixth-season finale.\n\nMuch of Elena's story revolves around her relationships with vampires [[Stefan Salvatore]] and his older brother, [[Damon Salvatore|Damon]]. It is revealed that Elena is a Petrova [[Doppelg\u00e4nger]], which is thus responsible for her being identical to her ancestor, [[Katherine Pierce]] (n\u00e9e Katerina Petrova). This also has the implication of making her a supernatural creature. Dobrev portrayed the \"conniving\" Katherine as well, who is opposite of Elena. The actress stated that it has been a challenge distinguishing the two, and enjoys playing them both. In the television series's fourth season, Elena becomes a vampire and dies then deals with the struggles that come with her change. She took the cure and became human again towards the end of the sixth season. In the finale of the sixth season, Kai linked Elena to Bonnie's life by magic. Elena will only wake up when Bonnie dies in around 60 years. She was locked inside the Salvatore tomb, then relocated to a warehouse in Brooklyn, New York in the seventh season, then back to Mystic Falls. In late 2016, when it was announced that the eighth season would be the final season, Dobrev was in talks about returning to the television series to reprise her role in the final episode. After much speculation. Dobrev's return was confirmed on January 26, 2017, via an [[Instagram]] post. Dobrev appeared in the final episode of the show as both Elena and her evil doppelg\u00e4nger Katherine Pierce.\n\n==Casting and portrayal==\n{{quote box\n|quoted=true\n|width = 17em\n|align=left \n|bgcolor= white \n|border = 0px\n|fontsize = 95%\n|quote = When I look in the mirror, I just feel different when I'm Katherine or when I'm Elena.

With the help of John's brother Grayson, Isobel and John flee town days later, leaving Grayson and his wife Miranda to adopt Elena as their own. A doctor, Grayson fakes a birth certificate so that it appeared Elena was his daughter with Miranda. The next year, Miranda and Grayson had a child of their own, Jeremy Gilbert. Elena dates her childhood friend Matt Donovan, who was her first love. On 23 May 2009, Elena is picked up by her mother and father after getting in a fight with Matt while attending the party. The three of them later end up in a car accident, with their car driving off a bridge. Stefan Salvatore finds them, and saves Elena, but it was too late to save Grayson and Miranda, who died. It remained unknown for months who saved Elena, and it was considered a miracle that she lived. Her relationship with Matt ended when they broke up.\n\n===Storyline===\n\n====Season 1====\nElena, still empty after losing her parents, begins to fit back into school. She meets a mysterious new student named Stefan Salvatore. They connect instantly, and begin dating. She meets his older and malevolent brother, Damon. After researching, Elena realizes Stefan was alive in 1953. It is later revealed that he is a 162-year-old vampire. Damon also begins falling for Elena. Elena finds a picture of a woman named Katherine Pierce who looks exactly like her. Stefan reveals that it is the woman who made him and Damon feud 145 years ago, and the person who turned them into vampires. He also told her that he is the person that saved her the night of her parents death. At the end of season one, Elena discovers that Grayson and Miranda weren't her biological parents, and that a woman named Isobel and her uncle John, who she grew up hating, were.\n\n====Season 2====\nIn season two, she learns that she is a Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger, having an appearance just like Katherine Pierce, which means that she has to be sacrificed to release Klaus' werewolf side. The sacrifice later happens, but Elena is saved, because John sacrificed himself for her after being put under a spell by Bonnie. However, her aunt Jenna is turned into a vampire and, as part of the sacrifice, is killed by Klaus, leaving Elena without a guardian. In the season two finale, while Damon is dying due to a werewolf bite, she forgives him for forcing her to drink his blood and kisses him with the thought that it might be Damon's last day, however Damon gets cured by drinking Klaus' blood.\n\n====Season 3====\nIn season three, Elena does everything in her power to make Stefan get his humanity back, which was turned off by Klaus as payment for saving Damon from a werewolf bite in the latter part of season two. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Damon while working together on saving Stefan and trying to defeat Klaus, eventually even sharing a kiss. She later admits to Stefan that she has feelings for Damon as well but that she never stopped loving Stefan. While in Denver together, Elena kisses Damon, later telling him that she doesn't know how she feels about him. It is eventually revealed that Elena met Damon the night of her parent's death, though he compelled her to forget. She eventually chooses Stefan in the season finale but before she can tell him, Elena drowns while having vampire blood in her system. During the last moments of season three, she awakens as a vampire in transition.\n\n====Season 4====\nIn season four, Elena is faced with the tough decision of whether to die or to feed on human blood so she can fully transition into a vampire. Elena, after realizing Stefan's desperation to keep her alive, decides to complete her transition. Her relationship with Stefan ends, allowing her to begin a proper romance with Damon. Although, it is later revealed there is a sire bond between them. Sometime later whilst searching for the cure for vampirism, Jeremy is fed to the immortal Silas by Katherine. As a result, Damon used the sire bond to convince her to turn off her humanity, due to her incredible grief over losing her brother and the last remaining member of her family. Elena became ruthless without her emotions, going on killing sprees and being very hateful towards her friends. Towards the end of season four, Damon kills Matt in front of Elena to trigger her grief. After revealing that Matt had the Gilbert Ring on, Elena's humanity was switched on and her emotions were focused on hate towards Katherine for killing Jeremy. Season four ended with Bonnie as a ghost after bringing Jeremy back to life and Elena fed Katherine the cure for vampirism in a moment of desperation as she was about to be killed. Elena had chosen Damon as the Salvatore that she loved.\n\n====Season 5====\nIn season five, Elena starts at Whitmore College and is happy after spending the summer with Damon. There she realises that Silas has taken Stefan's place and that Stefan is in that safe in a river constantly drowning. She and Damon then find the safe, only to find a dead body there meaning that someone opened the safe and Stefan is a Ripper again. However, Qetsiyah had fried Stefan's brain causing him to suffer amnesia. While trying to bring him back, they almost kiss meaning that she still feels something for him. Qetsiyah soon brings back Stefan's memories and says that Elena and Stefan were always meant to be as the Universe had to unite the doppelg\u00e4ngers of Silas and Amara. This leaves Damon and Elena questioning their relationship. Later on she is kidnapped and experimented on by Wes Maxfield, and she learns that her father also used to experiment on vampires.\nLater, when Katherine is about to die as a result of all of her years catching up with her as a result of having the cure in her system, Katherine uses a spell and possesses Elena, a fact that her friends were initially unable to deduce. But once they did, they trapped Katherine and left her with no escape. Stefan stabbed her with the traveller dagger, but ghost Katherine reveals to Bonnie, shortly before trying to cross into the Other Side, that she had injected Dr. Maxfield's enhanced ripper/werewolf virus into Elena's body, infecting Elena. The gang is eventually able to find an antidote.\nShe unfortunately loses trust in Damon, partly because he killed her friend Aaron, so they break up, but realise they cannot survive being apart and get back together.\nOnce Markos and his traveller army begin to take over Mystic Falls, setting an anti-magic barrier around the town, the gang comes up with a plan to take out the travellers by killing them all at the same time, overpowering the anchor to the Other Side AKA Bonnie and creating a possible way out of the now-collapsing Other Side. Elena and Damon drive into the gas-filled Mystic Grill with most of the travellers in it, blowing it up and killing most of the people in it, including Elena and Damon. She wakes up as a ghost and finds her body, sending her to Bonnie, where she passes to the Other Side, and she and many others are able to pass back to the land of the living afterwards. But the spell that allows this is broken before Damon passes back through, and as Bonnie is the anchor, she is a part of the Other Side and shall therefore disappear along with it. This leaves the gang mourning the loss of Damon and Bonnie in the season finale.\n\n====Season 6====\nIn season six, Elena starts back at Whitmore, and is unable to set foot in her hometown. She is also unable to recover from Damon's death and starts lurking the borders of Mystic Falls in order to grab civilians, drink their blood, then compel them to forget, but as spirit magic no longer works in Mystic Falls, any of her victims who cross into the town remember the ordeal, putting her identity as a vampire at risk when one of her victims, Sarah, comes to town.\nElena begs Alaric to compel her to forget that she ever loved Damon, which Alaric is able to do, due to him being an Enhanced Original, with the ability to compel other vampires. She eventually wears him down and asks her friends to never remind her once the compulsion had been done. After a number of failed attempts, Alaric successfully compels her to forget her love for Damon. She however leaves Alaric with some of her reminders of Damon, should she ever need them again. She is told of her former feelings for Damon soon afterwards, but decides to stay the way she is, as she doesn't want to go back to being unhappy again. She starts to date her classmate, Liam. \nOnce Damon comes back to life, Alaric tries to convince Elena to allow him to undo the compulsion, a decision she is reluctant to make. She eventually decides to have him undo it, but Alaric goes back to being human again after crossing into Mystic Falls, causing him to lose his vampire status (he only stayed alive because his once fatal human injuries were healed), meaning he will not be able to do so. She is then left to finally come face-to-face with Damon and see if she'll still feel the same way about him. They eventually rekindle their relationship, Elena takes the cure that Bonnie gave Damon. At Alaric's wedding, Kai ruins their wedding and casts a sleeping spell on Elena, linking her life to Bonnie's. She makes a sacrifice to let Bonnie live out her life until it is her turn. She bids goodbye to her friends and loved ones before parting ways but knows that she will see Damon, Stefan and Caroline again one day.\n\n====Season 7====\nElena doesn't make an appearance but is heard calling Damon's name when he visits the Armory vault. It was a way of Sybil, the Siren, luring him into a trap.\n\n====Season 8====\nIn the final episode, Elena makes an appearance. When a weakened Bonnie dies from the sounding bell, she meets Elena in a dream-like forest. Elena hugs her and wonders if she really has died. Enzo appears and says it isn't her time and takes Bonnie back to the world of the living. When Bonnie wakes up, it was Stefan who resuscitated her. Elena, asleep, is then taken to the Mystic Falls High School by Katherine and places her in the boiler room. Stefan tries to rescue Elena, but Katherine had Kai spell the boiler room, so that Elena can't be taken out of the room. After Bonnie had deflected the hellfire back into the bell, Bonnie passes out. Elena wakes up and wanders the school. Stefan meets up with her. It looks like Bonnie has died, but in fact Elena is still sleeping and Stefan's ghost came to visit her in her dream. He had taken the place of killing Katherine instead of Damon, since Damon is human after Stefan gave him the cure. He came to say goodbye. After a tearful hug and saying goodbye, Stefan goes into afterlife. Elena finally wakes up because Bonnie has broken the spell over her. Elena reunites with Damon and the rest of the gang. Elena gives Caroline the message Stefan whispered into her ear, saying he did hear her voice message and will love her forever. In the epilogue, Elena continued to study at medical school. After finishing her education, she went back to Mystic Falls and lived together with Damon, happily married for a long time. After living out her life, she crosses over to the afterlife where she finally reunites with her parents, Aunt Jenna and Uncle John.\n\n==== Post-Season 8 ====\nThe second-last episode of ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'', '[[The Originals (season 5)|The Tale of Two Wolves]]', features [[List of The Originals characters|Elijah and Hope Mikaelson]] visiting Mystic Falls, and the window of a doctor's office reads 'Elena Salvatore, M.D.', showing that Elena got her own medical practice.\n\n==Reception==\nElena has received mainly positive reviews. Steve West of the Cinema Blend compared the story of ''The Vampire Diaries'' and the character of Elena to the popular vampire franchise, ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', and its protagonist [[Bella Swan]].

Exceptions were those planned for the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] without surcharge, which were only issued 500,000 times. A very small number were produced of the higher values 1+2 rupees, which exist in three different varieties. Due to the fact that this value was manufactured in a multicolour print, unfinished variants were discovered later. At the end the flag should be illustrated in orange, white and green colours. Unfinished prints in black and black/orange have been preserved. Of the black version the found quantity was 4500 pieces, of the black-orange 2000 pieces and of the final, finished version 7000 pieces. Except for the higher rupees values (only imperforated), all stamps exist both perforated and in practically the same number imperforated. The stamps planned for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were perforated L 10\u00bd. All other small nominal values were perforated differently, so there were issues with the following variants: L 9\u00bd:10\u00bd, 10\u00bd, 10\u00bd:9\u00bd and 11:10\u00bd. There are often stamps with irregular perforations.\n\nA large part of the 1+2 rupees stamp in black/orange exists only without gum. Of the 1+2 rupees stamp, very rare proofs have survived, including two sheets of proofs with dark purple instead of black tones and one sheet of proofs on cardboard paper with [[Optical brightener|brightener]]. This cardboard was provided with advertising on its reverse side. Moreover there exist proofs that were made on paper dyed orange on the front side. There are rupee stamps on which the colours appear blurred or have been printed in the wrong place (sometimes twice). There is a conspicuous plate error of the 3+3 annas stamp, which partly has a larger white, round spot left of the nurse's head.\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"1+2 rupees stamps (inclusive proofs)\">\nStamp Azad Hind.jpg|1+2 rupees black/orange/green (VII a)\nStamp Azad Hind black.jpg|1+2 rupees black<br /> (VII b)\nStamp Azad Hind orange.jpg|1+2 rupees black/orange (VII c)\nStamp Azad Hind Orange paper.JPG|Proof on orange coloured paper\nAzad Hind Karton.png|Proof on cardboard paper with optical brightener\nAzad Hind violett.png|Proof with dark purple tones\n</gallery>\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Varieties and special features\">\nStamp PF Azad Hind 3a.png|3+3 annas stamp with a striking plate error\nAzad Hind gruen verschoben.png|Genuine 1+2 rupees stamp with shifted green colour\nAzad Hind orange verschoben.png|Genuine 1+2 rupees stamp with shifted orange colour\nAzad Hind Sample print back side.png|Reverse side of the proof on cardboard paper\n</gallery>\n\n== Cataloguing and publications ==\n[[File:Stamps Azad Hind Adaptation.png|thumb|180px|A modern design of Azad Hind stamps in a publication of the ''Netaji Birth Place Museum'' (India)]]\nThe stamps of Azad Hind are listed in the [[Michel catalog|Michel Germany catalogue]] under \"Nationales Indien\" (\"National India\") and bear the designations I to X ( perforated and imperforated).

Freidman: ''\"Azad Hind\" and \"Chalo Delhi\" Stamps.'' Jal Cooper, Bombay 1972, p. 12.</ref>According to propaganda philately specialist Dave Ripley, the soldiers on the 1+2 rupees stamp represent three of India's best-known freedom fighters at the time (from left): [[Sukhdev Thapar]], [[Bhagat Singh]] as standard-bearer and [[Shivaram Rajguru]]. They were hanged by the British authorities on March 23, 1931.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.psywar.org/stamps.php| title=Herbert A. Friedman: Propaganda and Espionage Philately| publisher=psywar.org| accessdate=2020-04-17}}</ref>  1 million copies of each stamp were printed. Exceptions were those planned for the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] without surcharge, which were only issued 500,000 times. A very small number were produced of the higher values 1+2 rupees, which exist in three different varieties. Due to the fact that this value was manufactured in a multicolour print, unfinished variants were discovered later. At the end the flag should be illustrated in orange, white and green colours. Unfinished prints in black and black/orange have been preserved. Of the black version the found quantity was 4500 pieces, of the black-orange 2000 pieces and of the final, finished version 7000 pieces. Except for the higher rupees values (only imperforated), all stamps exist both perforated and in practically the same number imperforated. The stamps planned for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were perforated L 10\u00bd. All other small nominal values were perforated differently, so there were issues with the following variants: L 9\u00bd:10\u00bd, 10\u00bd, 10\u00bd:9\u00bd and 11:10\u00bd. There are often stamps with irregular perforations.\n\nA large part of the 1+2 rupees stamp in black/orange exists only without gum. Of the 1+2 rupees stamp, very rare proofs have survived, including two sheets of proofs with dark purple instead of black tones and one sheet of proofs on cardboard paper with [[Optical brightener|brightener]]. This cardboard was provided with advertising on its reverse side. Moreover there exist proofs that were made on paper dyed orange on the front side. There are rupee stamps on which the colours appear blurred or have been printed in the wrong place (sometimes twice). There is a conspicuous plate error of the 3+3 annas stamp, which partly has a larger white, round spot left of the nurse's head.\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"1+2 rupees stamps (inclusive proofs)\">\nStamp Azad Hind.jpg|1+2 rupees black/orange/green (VII a)\nStamp Azad Hind black.jpg|1+2 rupees black<br /> (VII b)\nStamp Azad Hind orange.jpg|1+2 rupees black/orange (VII c)\nStamp Azad Hind Orange paper.JPG|Proof on orange coloured paper\nAzad Hind Karton.png|Proof on cardboard paper with optical brightener\nAzad Hind violett.png|Proof with dark purple tones\n</gallery>\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Varieties and special features\">\nStamp PF Azad Hind 3a.png|3+3 annas stamp with a striking plate error\nAzad Hind gruen verschoben.png|Genuine 1+2 rupees stamp with shifted green colour\nAzad Hind orange verschoben.png|Genuine 1+2 rupees stamp with shifted orange colour\nAzad Hind Sample print back side.png|Reverse side of the proof on cardboard paper\n</gallery>\n\n== Cataloguing and publications ==\n[[File:Stamps Azad Hind Adaptation.png|thumb|180px|A modern design of Azad Hind stamps in a publication of the ''Netaji Birth Place Museum'' (India)]]\nThe stamps of Azad Hind are listed in the [[Michel catalog|Michel Germany catalogue]] under \"Nationales Indien\" (\"National India\") and bear the designations I to X ( perforated and imperforated). Of No. VII (1+2 rupees) the varieties a, b and c are named.\n\nThe [[Indian Post]] has published the Azad-Hind stamps in a book entitled ''India's Freedom Struggle through India Postage Stamps''.<ref>*{{cite web | url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/footprints-of-history/article28060995.ece| title=S.

These can usually be recognized by an unclear and washed-out looking print, as they are often produced using [[offset printing]] instead of photogravure. There are also imitations that are produced with [[Inkjet printer|inkjet printers]].\n\nAs the stamps have not been issued, it is not possible that they exist with a real [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellation]]. In 1964 Subhas Chandra Bose was honoured in India by the Indian Post with two stamps. On this occasion [[First day cover|first day covers]] with Bose stamps were also published. On some of these letters, as a \"mixed franking\", Azad Hind stamps were additionally attached and then cancelled. Also cancellations of exclusively used Azad Hind stamps on first day covers are known.<ref>*{{cite web | url=https://www.stampcircuit.com/de/stamp-Auction/todywalla-auctions/4897949/lot-358-india-azad-hind-stamps-todywalla-auctions-stamp| title=Todywalla auctions| publisher=stampcircuit.com| accessdate=2020-04-17}}</ref> The same was done with Indian first day covers from 1968.<ref>*{{cite web | url=https://www.roots.sg/learn/collections/listing/1315434| title=First Day Cover issued in commemoration of the 25th Anniversary of the Azad Hind| publisher=roots.sg| accessdate=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n== See also ==\n*[[Azad Hind]]\n*[[Indian National Army]]\n*[[Cinderella stamps]]\n== Sources ==\n* ''Michel Deutschland-Spezial 2018.''
