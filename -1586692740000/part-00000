If the force of the impact is excessive, the [[bone]] may fracture at or near the site of the impact and cause damage to the underlying structures within the skull such as the [[Meninges|membranes]], [[blood vessel]]s, and [[Human brain|brain]]. \n\nWhile an uncomplicated skull fracture can occur without associated  physical or [[neurological]] damage and is in itself usually not clinically significant, a fracture in healthy bone indicates that a substantial amount of force has been applied and increases the possibility of associated [[traumatic brain injury|injury]]. Any significant blow to the head results in a [[concussion]], with or without loss of [[consciousness]].\n\nA fracture in conjunction with an overlying [[laceration]] that tears the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and the [[meninges]], or runs through the [[paranasal sinuses]] and the [[middle ear]] structures, bringing the outside environment into contact with the cranial cavity is called a compound fracture. Compound fractures can either be clean or contaminated.\n\nThere are four major types of skull fractures: linear, depressed, diastatic, and basilar. Linear fractures are the most common, and usually require no intervention for the fracture itself. Depressed fractures are usually [[Bone fracture|comminuted]], with broken portions of bone displaced inward\u2014and may require surgical intervention to repair underlying tissue damage.

Thus the traumatic impact required to cause a fracture depends on the impact site. The skull is thick at the [[glabella]], the [[external occipital protuberance]], the [[mastoid process]]es, and the external angular process. Areas of the skull that are covered with muscle have no underlying diplo\u00eb formation between the internal and external lamina, which results in thin bone more susceptible to fractures.\n\nSkull fractures occur more easily at the thin squamous [[Squama temporalis|temporal]] and [[parietal bone]]s, the [[sphenoid sinus]], the [[foramen magnum]] (the opening at the base of the skull that the spinal cord passes through), the [[Petrous part of the temporal bone|petrous temporal ridge]], and the inner portions of the [[Greater wing of sphenoid bone|sphenoid wings]] at the base of the skull. The [[middle cranial fossa]], a depression at the base of the cranial cavity forms the thinnest part of the skull and is thus the weakest part. This area of the cranial floor is weakened further by the presence of multiple [[Foramina of the skull|foramina]] as a result this section is at higher risk for basilar skull fractures to occur. Other areas more susceptible to fractures are the [[cribriform plate]], the roof of orbits in the [[anterior cranial fossa]], and the areas between the mastoid and [[dural sinus]]es in the [[posterior cranial fossa]].<ref>[[Medscape]]: Ali Nawaz Khan: Imaging in Skull Fractures [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/343764-overview]</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\nChildren with a simple skull fracture without other concerns are at low risk of a bad outcome and rarely require aggressive treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bressan|first1=S|last2=Marchetto|first2=L|last3=Lyons|first3=TW|last4=Monuteaux|first4=MC|last5=Freedman|first5=SB|last6=Da Dalt|first6=L|last7=Nigrovic|first7=LE|title=A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Management and Outcomes of Isolated Skull Fractures in Children|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|volume=71|issue=6|pages=714\u2013724.e2|date=23 November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2017.10.014|pmid=29174834}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of a concussion or skull fracture in people after trauma without intracranial [[hemorrhage]] or [[Focal neurologic signs|focal neurologic deficits]] was indicated in long term cognitive impairments and emotional lability at nearly double the rate as those patients without either complication.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17215737 | doi=10.1097/TA.0b013e31802ce9bd | volume=62 | title=Long-term cognitive, emotional, and functional outcomes in trauma intensive care unit survivors without intracranial hemorrhage | date=January 2007 | author=Jackson JC, Obremskey W, Bauer R | display-authors = etal | journal=J Trauma | pages=80\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThose with a skull fracture were shown to have \"neuropsychological dysfunction, even in the absence of intracranial pathology or more severe disturbance of consciousness on the GCS\".<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9058000 | volume=11 | title=Impact of skull fracture on neuropsychological functioning following closed head injury | date=March 1997 | author=Smith-Seemiller L, Lovell MR, Smith S, Markosian N, Townsend RN | journal=Brain Inj | pages=191\u20136}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Le Fort fracture of skull|Le Fort facial fracture]]\n*[[Facial trauma|Facial fracture]]\n*[[Mandibular fracture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Forensic Neuropathology By Jan E.

It has been reported in older children in atypical regions of the skull such as the basiooccipital and the base of the skull base and in association with other types of skull fractures. It is characterized by a diastatic enlargement of the fracture.\n\nVarious factors are associated with the development of a GSF. The primary causitive factor is a tear in the [[dura mater]]. The skull fracture enlarges due, in part, to the rapid physiologic growth of the brain that occurs in young children, and brain [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) pulsations in the underlying [[Leptomeninges|leptomenigeal]] [[cyst]]ic mass.<ref>Gupta SK, Reddy NM, Khosla VK, Mathuriya SN, Shama BS, Pathak A, Tewari MK, Kak VK.

Thus the traumatic impact required to cause a fracture depends on the impact site. The skull is thick at the [[glabella]], the [[external occipital protuberance]], the [[mastoid process]]es, and the external angular process. Areas of the skull that are covered with muscle have no underlying diplo\u00eb formation between the internal and external lamina, which results in thin bone more susceptible to fractures.\n\nSkull fractures occur more easily at the thin squamous [[Squama temporalis|temporal]] and [[parietal bone]]s, the [[sphenoid sinus]], the [[foramen magnum]] (the opening at the base of the skull that the spinal cord passes through), the [[Petrous part of the temporal bone|petrous temporal ridge]], and the inner portions of the [[Greater wing of sphenoid bone|sphenoid wings]] at the base of the skull. The [[middle cranial fossa]], a depression at the base of the cranial cavity forms the thinnest part of the skull and is thus the weakest part. This area of the cranial floor is weakened further by the presence of multiple [[Foramina of the skull|foramina]] as a result this section is at higher risk for basilar skull fractures to occur. Other areas more susceptible to fractures are the [[cribriform plate]], the roof of orbits in the [[anterior cranial fossa]], and the areas between the mastoid and [[dural sinus]]es in the [[posterior cranial fossa]].<ref>[[Medscape]]: Ali Nawaz Khan: Imaging in Skull Fractures [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/343764-overview]</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\nChildren with a simple skull fracture without other concerns are at low risk of a bad outcome and rarely require aggressive treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bressan|first1=S|last2=Marchetto|first2=L|last3=Lyons|first3=TW|last4=Monuteaux|first4=MC|last5=Freedman|first5=SB|last6=Da Dalt|first6=L|last7=Nigrovic|first7=LE|title=A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Management and Outcomes of Isolated Skull Fractures in Children|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|volume=71|issue=6|pages=714\u2013724.e2|date=23 November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2017.10.014|pmid=29174834}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of a concussion or skull fracture in people after trauma without intracranial [[hemorrhage]] or [[Focal neurologic signs|focal neurologic deficits]] was indicated in long term cognitive impairments and emotional lability at nearly double the rate as those patients without either complication.<ref>Jackson JC.

At the end of the previous season, Zadar had become champions of the [[Yugoslav First Basketball League|Yugoslav League]], and had the right to participate in the [[FIBA European Champions Cup]] (EuroLeague). Komazec made great performances, and led his team in the fourth place of the top 6 semifinal group stage. After six years in Zadar, where he became the absolute leader and scorer of his team, he made the big step in his career for the transcription of the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] (which was then the best in Europe) and [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], of the head coach [[\u017deljko Pavli\u010devi\u0107]] and the Greek superstar [[Nikos Galis]]. There he found an old acquaintance from years of Zadar, [[Stojko Vrankovi\u0107]], who had just returned from the [[NBA]]. \n\nIn a year that began with ambitions to win the championship, for Panathinaikos and him also, won only the [[Greek Basketball Cup|1993 Greek Cup]], in a final against [[Aris B.C.|Sato Aris]]. Komazec, although he did some excellent performances, did not respond satisfactorily to Panathinaikos, who was preparing to make the fling at European level, and in the summer he was [[loan (sports)|loaned]] to [[Pallacanestro Varese|Cagiva Varese]], where he played the next two seasons (1993\u201394 in [[Serie A2 Basket|A2]] & 1994\u201395 [[Lega Basket Serie A|A1]]), and made impressive performances. \n\nThe impression that he made by his performance in Varese, caused [[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Buckler Beer Bologna]], which was the dominant team of the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian League]] the previous years, to buy his contract from Panathinaikos, and close a deal with him for the next two years, in an effort to replace the large void left in the team by [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107|Sa\u0161a Danilovi\u0107]] leaving for the [[NBA]]'s [[Miami Heat]]. The Croatian star didn't succeed one more time to respond to the high demands of competitive sport at the top level, and he only led Virtus to the meager wins of the [[Italian Basketball Supercup|Italian Supercup]] in 1996, and the [[Italian Basketball Cup|Italian Cup]] in 1997. This failure brought him back again to Varese the next year (1997\u201398), where rediscovered his best self, and with a scoring recital, he led the Lombardy team to the playoffs semifinals in the Italian League, and on the course to a participation in the EuroLeague, for the first time 20 years. \n\nIn the summer of 1998, came the third and final chance for Komazec to make an important achievement in a great club of European basketball, as he agreed to play for [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] of [[head coach]] [[Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107]]. Arijan began the season doing very well, and everything indicated that the experiment for the player and the club could end up in achieving something good at the end of the season, when the major club titles, both in Greece and in Europe were contested. But an injury put him off of the court for half a month, and he became substantially off in his playing form, throughout the remaining part of the season. His participation at the [[1999 FIBA EuroLeague Final Four]], in [[Munich]], was the only one in his short and essentially failed time at Olympiacos. \n\nIn the next season (1999\u201300), he returned to his roots, and he quite unexpectedly was joined in [[KK Zadar|Zadar]] by [[Dino Ra\u0111a]]. Together, the duo led the [[Dalmatia]]n club to the semifinals of the [[FIBA Saporta Cup]], where they lost to the Greek club [[AEK B.C.|AEK]]. They won the [[Kre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107 Cup|Croatian Cup]] in the same season, which marked the last success of his career.\n\nHe was briefly a part of the [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver Grizzlies]] [[NBA]] team, during the 2000\u201301 season, but he only spent one month with the team, and he did not play in any official NBA games with them.\n\n==National team career==\nKomazec was a member of the senior [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavian national team]] (1990\u201392), and then the senior  [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatian national team]]. He was a part of the Croatian teams that won silver at the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]], and bronze at [[EuroBasket]] [[EuroBasket 1993|1993]] and [[EuroBasket 1995|1995]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nHis father is Milan Komazec, a former basketball player who won three [[Yugoslav First Basketball League|Yugoslav First League]] championships ([[1965 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1965]], [[1967 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1967]], and [[1967\u201368 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1968]]) with Zadar. His uncle is [[Petar Popovi\u0107 (basketball, born 1959)|Petar Popovi\u0107]], a former basketball player.

After six years in Zadar, where he became the absolute leader and scorer of his team, he made the big step in his career for the transcription of the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] (which was then the best in Europe) and [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], of the head coach [[\u017deljko Pavli\u010devi\u0107]] and the Greek superstar [[Nikos Galis]]. There he found an old acquaintance from years of Zadar, [[Stojko Vrankovi\u0107]], who had just returned from the [[NBA]]. \n\nIn a year that began with ambitions to win the championship, for Panathinaikos and him also, won only the [[Greek Basketball Cup|1993 Greek Cup]], in a final against [[Aris B.C.|Sato Aris]]. Komazec, although he did some excellent performances, did not respond satisfactorily to Panathinaikos, who was preparing to make the fling at European level, and in the summer he was [[loan (sports)|loaned]] to [[Pallacanestro Varese|Cagiva Varese]], where he played the next two seasons (1993\u201394 in [[Serie A2 Basket|A2]] & 1994\u201395 [[Lega Basket Serie A|A1]]), and made impressive performances. \n\nThe impression that he made by his performance in Varese, caused [[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Buckler Beer Bologna]], which was the dominant team of the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian League]] the previous years, to buy his contract from Panathinaikos, and close a deal with him for the next two years, in an effort to replace the large void left in the team by [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107|Sa\u0161a Danilovi\u0107]] leaving for the [[NBA]]'s [[Miami Heat]]. The Croatian star didn't succeed one more time to respond to the high demands of competitive sport at the top level, and he only led Virtus to the meager wins of the [[Italian Basketball Supercup|Italian Supercup]] in 1996, and the [[Italian Basketball Cup|Italian Cup]] in 1997. This failure brought him back again to Varese the next year (1997\u201398), where rediscovered his best self, and with a scoring recital, he led the Lombardy team to the playoffs semifinals in the Italian League, and on the course to a participation in the EuroLeague, for the first time 20 years. \n\nIn the summer of 1998, came the third and final chance for Komazec to make an important achievement in a great club of European basketball, as he agreed to play for [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] of [[head coach]] [[Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107]]. Arijan began the season doing very well, and everything indicated that the experiment for the player and the club could end up in achieving something good at the end of the season, when the major club titles, both in Greece and in Europe were contested. But an injury put him off of the court for half a month, and he became substantially off in his playing form, throughout the remaining part of the season. His participation at the [[1999 FIBA EuroLeague Final Four]], in [[Munich]], was the only one in his short and essentially failed time at Olympiacos. \n\nIn the next season (1999\u201300), he returned to his roots, and he quite unexpectedly was joined in [[KK Zadar|Zadar]] by [[Dino Ra\u0111a]]. Together, the duo led the [[Dalmatia]]n club to the semifinals of the [[FIBA Saporta Cup]], where they lost to the Greek club [[AEK B.C.|AEK]]. \u03a4hey won the [[Kre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107 Cup|Croatian Cup]] in the same season, which marked the last success of his career.\n\nHe was briefly a part of the [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver Grizzlies]] [[NBA]] team, during the 2000\u201301 season, but he only spent one month with the team, and he did not play in any official NBA games with them.\n\n==National team career==\nKomazec was a member of the senior [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavian national team]] (1990\u201392), and then the senior  [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatian national team]]. He was a part of the Croatian teams that won silver at the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]], and bronze at [[EuroBasket]] [[EuroBasket 1993|1993]] and [[EuroBasket 1995|1995]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nHis father is Milan Komazec, a former basketball player who won three [[Yugoslav First Basketball League|Yugoslav First League]] championships ([[1965 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1965]], [[1967 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1967]], and [[1967\u201368 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1968]]) with Zadar. His uncle is [[Petar Popovi\u0107 (basketball, born 1959)|Petar Popovi\u0107]], a former basketball player. His first-cousin is [[Alan Gregov]], a former basketball player.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Zadarska sporstska dinastija |journal=KO\u0160 |date=February 1990 |issue=5 |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0BIEP7nsWaTNzUwUVJwN2g4R1E/view |accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.aek.com/basketball/roster/arijan_komazec.htm Arijan Komazec]\n* [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/players/3486/injuries.html Sports Illustrated]\n* [http://www.eurobasket.com/player.asp?Cntry=ITA&PlayerID=22332&AmNotSure=1 Eurobasket]\n* [http://www.euroleague.net/competition/players/showplayer?pcode=AQR&seasoncode=E2001 Euroleague.net Profile]\n\n{{Navboxes colour |title= Croatia squads |bg= red |fg= white |list1=\n{{Croatia Men Basketball Squad 1996 Summer Olympics}}\n{{Croatia Squad EuroBasket 1995}}\n{{Croatia Squad 1994 FIBA World Championship}}\n{{Croatia Squad EuroBasket 1993}}\n{{Footer 1992 Olympic Silver Medalists Basketball Men}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes colour |title= Yugoslavia squads |bg= #00008b |fg= white |list1=\n{{Yugoslavia Squad EuroBasket 1991}}\n{{Yugoslavia Squad 1990 FIBA World Championship}}\n}}\n{{Lega Basket Serie A scoring leader}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Komazec, Arijan}}\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:AEK B.C. players]]\n[[Category:Basketball players at the 1992 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Basketball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Croatian expatriate basketball people in Greece]]\n[[Category:Croatian expatriate basketball people in Italy]]\n[[Category:Croatian men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:FIBA EuroBasket-winning players]]\n[[Category:FIBA World Championship-winning players]]\n[[Category:Greek Basket League players]]\n[[Category:KK Zadar players]]\n[[Category:Lega Basket Serie A players]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Olympiacos B.C. players]]\n[[Category:Olympic basketball players of Croatia]]\n[[Category:Olympic medalists in basketball]]\n[[Category:Olympic silver medalists for Croatia]]\n[[Category:Pallacanestro Varese players]]\n[[Category:Panathinaikos B.C. players]]\n[[Category:S.S.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 93 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 93 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

After the reform, the processing of rapes and other sexual assaults has become more efficient. More cases have been reported, and the police have been better able to solve them, increasing the number of convicted assaulters and therefore bringing the percentage of solved cases up to 64 percent in 2003, which is about 367 cases.<ref name=Seksuaalirikokset>{{cite web|url=http://www.optula.om.fi/material/attachments/optula/julkaisut/rikollisuustilanne/rikollisuustilanne2007/m2xiK2Nk7/4.2_Lapsiin_ja_varhaisnuoriin_kohdistunut.pdf|title=Rikollisuustilanne |publisher=Oikeuspoliitinen Tutkimuslaitos |year=2007|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=StatTiedotteet>{{cite web|url=https://www.stat.fi/ajk/tiedotteet/v2004/275oiks_tausta-aineisto.pdf|title=Rikollisuustilanne |publisher=Tilastokeskus |year=2004|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref> Even at this increased rate of reporting, [[Amnesty International]] says that fewer than 10 per cent of rapes are estimated to be reported to the police in Finland.<ref name=Amnesty/>\n\nThe rate at which charges are pressed after a [[rape]] varies depending on the type of assault.

However, in these cases, the process often stops because the police cannot solve the crime, the case ends up being classified as not fulfilling the characteristics of a rape, or the victim requests that the charges be dropped. In a significant number of cases, a sufficient amount of evidence for a conviction is not available to the police.<ref name=Naisten1/>\n\nThe Central Statistical Office also states that prior to 1999, police did not report about a third of all rape cases to the prosecutor. After the reform, this number has decreased to one tenth of all cases that come to the attention of the police. In 2003, 337 cases were reported to the prosecutor, which is about 92 percent of solved rapes.<ref name=\"Seksuaalirikokset\" /><ref name=\"StatTiedotteet\" /> \nIn their briefing published in March 2012, the Finnish Department of Justice stated that with the reform that took place in 2011 (the characteristics of rape were expanded so that now sexual interaction with anyone who can be considered defenseless is in all circumstances a rape) it is expected that the number of cases where the accused is convicted of a rape will increase considerably.<ref name=ValtioneuvostoTiedote>{{cite web|url=http://valtioneuvosto.fi/ajankohtaista/tiedotteet/tiedote/fi.jsp?oid=353249|title=Oikeuspoliittinen tutkimuslaitos: Uutta tietoa raiskausrikoksista ja rangaistusk\u00e4yt\u00e4nn\u00f6ist\u00e4 |publisher=Oikeusministeri\u00f6 |year=2012|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe sentences of the convicted have been getting longer: on the latter half of 1990, the sentences got longer by about half a year, and even in the last decade there has been a slight increase in the sentences given to convicted sexual offenders.

The convicted should receive a jail sentence of at least one and at most six years. \nIt is also considered rape if the assaulter takes advantage of the victim being unconscious, sick, disabled, in a state of fear or if the victim is in any other way considered unable to defend themselves or to express their consent or the lack of consent.\nIf some of the factors above are lacking evidence, the accused should be sentenced to at least four months or at most four years in prison.\n\nAttempted rape is also punishable.\n\n===Aggravated rape 2 \u00a7 (27.6.2014/509)===\n\nA rape is considered aggravated if:\n*serious physical injury, serious illness or a life-threatening state occurs\n*the crime is committed by multiple people, or in especially considerable mental or physical suffering results from the crime\n*the victim is 18 years old or younger\n*the crime is committed in a way that is particularly brutal, harsh, or humiliating\n*if a firearm, an edged weapon or another life-threatening device is used, or\n*if the victim is threatened with severe violence\n\nIf the rape is aggravated when judged comprehensively, the accused should be convicted for aggravated rape and sentenced to a minimum of two years and a maximum of ten years in prison.\n\nAn attempted aggravated rape is also punishable.\n\n===Coercing someone into a sexual act 4 \u00a7 (24.7.1998/563)===\n\nIf the accused forced the victim into an act other than those stated in 1 \u00a7 by using violence or the threat of it, or if the accused forced the victim to submit to any of these acts, it clearly violates the victim's right of sexual self-determination and the accused should be convicted for forcing someone into a sexual act and sentenced with either a fine or jail time for up to three years.\n\nAn accused should also be sentenced if the assaulter takes advantage of the victim being unconscious, sick, disabled, in a state of fear or if the victim is in any other way considered unable to defend themselves or to express their consent or the lack of consent, and gets the victim to do an act described in the paragraph above or if the accused forced the victim into submitting to one of these acts, therefore considerably violating the victim's right of self-determination. (13.5.2011/495)\n\nAn attempt is also punishable.\n\n===Sexual abuse 5 \u00a7 (24.7.1998/563)===\n\nA person can be convicted if he/she takes advantage of their situation or relation to the victim to coerce them to sexual interaction or to another act that considerably violates the victim's right of sexual self-determination, or if the victim is coerced so submit to a similar act that violates sexual self-determination, when:\n*the victim is younger than 18 years, and is in school or at another institution where he/she is under the assaulter's authority or supervision, or in another situation similar to these where the perpetrator is clearly in a position that makes him/her superior\n*the victim is younger than 18 years, and their ability to independently make decisions about their sexual behavior is considerably weaker than that of the perpetrator because of the victim's level of maturity and the possible age difference between the perpetrator and the victim, with the perpetrator clearly taking advantage of the victim's immaturity\n*the victim is being treated in a hospital or another institution, and their ability to defend themselves and form or voice an opinion is limited because of illness, disability or another state of inability, or (27.6.2014/509)\n*the victim is particularly dependent on the perpetrator, who gravely takes advantage of this dependency\n\nShould be convicted for taking sexual advantage and sentenced to fines or up to four years in prison.\n\n===Sexual abuse of a child 6\u2009\u00a7 (20.5.2011/540)===\n\nA person can be convicted for sexual abuse of a child, if they touched or in another way commit a sexual act that is likely to cause harm to a child's development or get the child to commit a similar sexual act. Anyone who is under 16 years old is considered a child. If convicted, the perpetrator should be sentenced to a minimum of four months and maximum of four years in jail.\n\nAnyone who has sexual intercourse with a child younger than 16 years should also be convicted, if the crime is over all not aggravated by the reasoning stated in 7 \u00a7's first paragraph. In addition, a person should be convicted for taking sexual advantage of a child if what is stated above occurs with a child who is 16 but not yet 18 and the perpetrator is the victim's parent or in a similar relationship with the child and lives in the same household.\n\nAn attempt is also punishable.\n\n===Aggravated sexual abuse of a child 7\u2009\u00a7 (20.5.2011/540)===\n\nApplicable, if\n*the perpetrator has sexual intercourse with a child younger than 16 or with a child who is 16 but not yet 18 and the perpetrator is the victim's parent or in a similar relationship with the child and lives in the same household\n*In sexual abuse of a child\n**the victim is a child to whose development the crime is likely to cause severe harm because of the child's age or level of development \n**the crime is committed in a way that is particularly humiliating\n**the crime is likely to cause severe harm to the child because of the trust the child has for the perpetrator or because of the child's dependency of the perpetrator\n \nAlso if the crime as a whole is aggravated, the perpetrator should be convicted for aggravated sexual abuse of a child and sentenced to a minimum of one year and a maximum of ten years in prison.\n\nAn attempt is also punishable.\n\n===Definitions 10 \u00a7 (27.6.2014/509)===\nThe legal terms used in these statutes are defined as followed:\n\n*\"''Sexual Intercourse''\" means inserting one's sexual organ into the victim's sexual organ or anal aperture, or taking the other person's sexual organ into your body.\n*\"''Sexual Act''\" means an act, that is sexually relevant considering the perpetrator, the victim and the circumstances of the act.\n\n== Victims ==\n\n===Women===\nThe majority of cases of sexual violence is against women.<ref name=Heuni/> Some groups within society have a greater possibility of becoming a victim of sexual violence, and sexual violence often has different kinds of impact of the lives of the victims from different backgrounds (age and social status also have an effect).<ref name=Naisten1/> However, according to a cross-cultural\ncomparison between three regions in Finland, Denmark, Russia, Estonia and the US in 1988 \"Scandinavian workers reported fewer women-unfriendly experiences than the women in the other countries did.

This violence is dominantly physical or threats of violence: sexual violence against men is rare.<ref name=Heuni/>\nAlthough the risk of becoming a victim of violence committed by strangers is rather high for men, they are not worried about becoming victims of violence when walking alone in their area after dark: less than five percent of men said they felt unsafe.<ref name=Heuni/>\nA study conducted by Markku Heiskanen and Elina Ruuskanen states that the most common form\nof sexual harassment experienced by men was indecent passes, touching or\nattempts to be kissed against one's will and that 14 percent of the men had such experiences\nafter their 15th birthday, and almost 5 per cent in the last 12 months.<ref name=Heuni/> However, according to Berdahl et al.

Other factors that are likely to effect the probability of getting sexually offended are social status, possible drug usage, belonging to a sexual or gender minority or being disabled as well as if the person is a victim of [[human trafficking]]. The aforementioned characteristics are also likely to decrease the probability of getting and searching for help if a person does become a victim of a crime of sexual offense.<ref name=Naisten1/>\n\nThere has been no sufficient research done on sexual and gender minorities, but a study done in the beginning of 1980 (by Gr\u00f6nfors et al.) about experiences of violence by gay and bisexual persons states that every sixth gay or bisexual male had experienced violence because of their sexual orientation.

Five percent of the victims are immigrants from elsewhere in Europe, while immigrants with African origins form two percent of the offended. With respect to the native Finns, immigrants from Africa have seven times as high risk to be sexually offended and the immigrants with Vietnamese origins have a risk five times as high as that of natives. Some of this difference in the possibility of being sexually offended is explained by the differences in the age structures of the groups.<ref name=maahanmuuttajat>{{cite web|url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/152441/265_Lehti_ym_2014.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|title=Maahanmuuttajat Rikosten Uhreina ja Tekij\u00f6in\u00e4 |publisher=Tammerprint Oy |year=2014|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ulkomaalaiset suomessa.png|thumb|center|700px|Foreigners in Finland 1990\u20132005.

The purpose of this is to prevent crimes, to improve the possibilities, and to interfere with severe harassment and other possible offenses.<ref name=GVEI/>\n\nThe [[Finnish law]] on restraining order states, that \u2033a restraining order may be imposed only if there are reasonable grounds to assume that the person against whom the order is applied for is likely to commit an offense against the life, health, liberty or privacy of the\nperson who feels threatened or in some other way severely harass this person.\u2033 <ref name=RestrainingOrder>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1998/en19980898.pdf|title=Act on Restraining Orders|publisher=Finlex|year=2010 |accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> However, \u2033if the person who feels threatened and the person against whom the restraining order is applied for live permanently in the same residence, a restraining order may be imposed to prevent an offense against life, health or liberty or a threat of such an offense (inside-the-family restraining order).

The first one is to prevent violence by developing ways in which sexual violence could be more easily detected and interfered with and by improving the level on which the authorities are aware of sexual offences. The second principle is to protect the victims and to provide support for them by training authorities to be more sensitive when interacting with a victim of a sexual assault, which would in turn make the process easier on the victim as well as increase the probability that the case will be solved since the victim is more likely to feel like he/she is being taken seriously when his/her case is handled with a symphatetic attitude. The plan also aims to improve the already existing support systems. The last of the main principles is to bring the perpetrators to justice for their acts by improving the process of investigation more effective. This is to be achieved by revising the laws that handle sexual offences.<ref name=Naisten1/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oulu child sexual exploitation scandal]]\n*[[Corrective rape]]\n*[[Estimates of sexual violence]]\n*[[Human Rights]]\n*[[Rape statistics]]\n*[[Sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n*[[Sexual violence in South Africa]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Finnish Law http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001#L20\n*The Criminal Code of Finland http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf\n\n{{Europe topic|Sexual violence in}}\n\n[[Category:Sexual violence by country|Finland]]\n[[Category:Sexual violence in Europe|Finland]]\n[[Category:Sexuality in Finland|Violence]]\n[[Category:Violence in Finland]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Finland 1996 CIA map.jpg|thumb|A map of Finland]]\n{{rape}}\nSexual violence is defined as the use of force or manipulation to get someone to engage in unwanted sexual activity without his or her consent.<ref name=NSVRC>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/Publications_NSVRC_Factsheet_What-is-sexual-violence_1.pdf|title=What is Sexual Violence?|publisher=National Sexual Violence Resource Center |year=2010|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref> Such violence takes place in both [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]] relationships, as well as outside intimate relationships.<ref name=Amnesty/> Women as well as men commit sexual assault and child sexual assault.

More cases have been reported, and the police have been better able to solve them, increasing the number of convicted assaulters and therefore bringing the percentage of solved cases up to 64 percent in 2003, which is about 367 cases.<ref name=Seksuaalirikokset>{{cite web|url=http://www.optula.om.fi/material/attachments/optula/julkaisut/rikollisuustilanne/rikollisuustilanne2007/m2xiK2Nk7/4.2_Lapsiin_ja_varhaisnuoriin_kohdistunut.pdf|title=Rikollisuustilanne |publisher=Oikeuspoliitinen Tutkimuslaitos |year=2007|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=StatTiedotteet>{{cite web|url=https://www.stat.fi/ajk/tiedotteet/v2004/275oiks_tausta-aineisto.pdf|title=Rikollisuustilanne |publisher=Tilastokeskus |year=2004|accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref> Even at this increased rate of reporting, [[Amnesty International]] says that fewer than 10 per cent of rapes are estimated to be reported to the police in Finland.<ref name=Amnesty/>\n\nThe rate at which charges are pressed after a [[rape]] varies depending on the type of assault.

However, in these cases, the process often stops because the police cannot solve the crime, the case ends up being classified as not fulfilling the characteristics of a rape, or the victim requests that the charges be dropped. In a significant number of cases, a sufficient amount of evidence for a conviction is not available to the police.<ref name=Naisten1/>\n\nThe Central Statistical Office also states that prior to 1999, police did not report about a third of all rape cases to the prosecutor. After the reform, this number has decreased to one tenth of all cases that come to the attention of the police.

The convicted should receive a jail sentence of at least one and at most six years. \nIt is also considered rape if the assaulter takes advantage of the victim being unconscious, sick, disabled, in a state of fear or if the victim is in any other way considered unable to defend themselves or to express their consent or the lack of consent.\nIf some of the factors above are lacking evidence, the accused should be sentenced to at least four months or at most four years in prison.\n\nAttempted rape is also punishable.\n\n===Aggravated rape 2 \u00a7 (27.6.2014/509)===\n\nA rape is considered aggravated if:\n*serious physical injury, serious illness or a life-threatening state occurs\n*the crime is committed by multiple people, or in especially considerable mental or physical suffering results from the crime\n*the victim is 18 years old or younger\n*the crime is committed in a way that is particularly brutal, harsh, or humiliating\n*if a firearm, an edged weapon or another life-threatening device is used, or\n*if the victim is threatened with severe violence\n\nIf the rape is aggravated when judged comprehensively, the accused should be convicted for aggravated rape and sentenced to a minimum of two years and a maximum of ten years in prison.\n\nAn attempted aggravated rape is also punishable.\n\n===Coercing someone into a sexual act 4 \u00a7 (24.7.1998/563)===\n\nIf the accused forced the victim into an act other than those stated in 1 \u00a7 by using violence or the threat of it, or if the accused forced the victim to submit to any of these acts, it clearly violates the victim's right of sexual self-determination and the accused should be convicted for forcing someone into a sexual act and sentenced with either a fine or jail time for up to three years.\n\nAn accused should also be sentenced if the assaulter takes advantage of the victim being unconscious, sick, disabled, in a state of fear or if the victim is in any other way considered unable to defend themselves or to express their consent or the lack of consent, and gets the victim to do an act described in the paragraph above or if the accused forced the victim into submitting to one of these acts, therefore considerably violating the victim's right of self-determination. (13.5.2011/495)\n\nAn attempt is also punishable.\n\n===Sexual abuse 5 \u00a7 (24.7.1998/563)===\n\nA person can be convicted if he/she takes advantage of their situation or relation to the victim to coerce them to sexual interaction or to another act that considerably violates the victim's right of sexual self-determination, or if the victim is coerced so submit to a similar act that violates sexual self-determination, when:\n*the victim is younger than 18 years, and is in school or at another institution where he/she is under the assaulter's authority or supervision, or in another situation similar to these where the perpetrator is clearly in a position that makes him/her superior\n*the victim is younger than 18 years, and their ability to independently make decisions about their sexual behavior is considerably weaker than that of the perpetrator because of the victim's level of maturity and the possible age difference between the perpetrator and the victim, with the perpetrator clearly taking advantage of the victim's immaturity\n*the victim is being treated in a hospital or another institution, and their ability to defend themselves and form or voice an opinion is limited because of illness, disability or another state of inability, or (27.6.2014/509)\n*the victim is particularly dependent on the perpetrator, who gravely takes advantage of this dependency\n\nShould be convicted for taking sexual advantage and sentenced to fines or up to four years in prison.\n\n===Sexual abuse of a child 6\u2009\u00a7 (20.5.2011/540)===\n\nA person can be convicted for sexual abuse of a child, if they touched or in an other way commit a sexual act that is likely to cause harm to a child's development or get the child to commit a similar sexual act. Anyone who is under 16 years old is considered a child. If convicted, the perpetrator should be sentenced to a minimum of four months and maximum of four years in jail.\n\nAnyone who has sexual intercourse with a child younger than 16 years should also be convicted, if the crime is over all not aggravated by the reasoning stated in 7 \u00a7's first paragraph. In addition, a person should be convicted for taking sexual advantage of a child if what is stated above occurs with a child who is 16 but not yet 18 and the perpetrator is the victim's parent or in a similar relationship with the child and lives in the same household.\n\nAn attempt is also punishable.\n\n===Aggravated sexual abuse of a child 7\u2009\u00a7 (20.5.2011/540)===\n\nApplicable, if\n*the perpetrator has sexual intercourse with a child younger than 16 or with a child who is 16 but not yet 18 and the perpetrator is the victim's parent or in a similar relationship with the child and lives in the same household\n*In sexual abuse of a child\n**the victim is a child to whose development the crime is likely to cause severe harm because of the child's age or level of development \n**the crime is committed in a way that is particularly humiliating\n**the crime is likely to cause severe harm to the child because of the trust the child has for the perpetrator or because of the child's dependency of the perpetrator\n \nAlso if the crime as a whole is aggravated, the perpetrator should be convicted for aggravated sexual abuse of a child and sentenced to a minimum of one year and a maximum of ten years in prison.\n\nAn attempt is also punishable.\n\n===Definitions 10 \u00a7 (27.6.2014/509)===\nThe legal terms used in these statutes are defined as followed:\n\n*\"''Sexual Intercourse''\" means inserting one's sexual organ into the victim's sexual organ or anal aperture, or taking the other person's sexual organ into your body.\n*\"''Sexual Act''\" means an act, that is sexually relevant considering the perpetrator, the victim and the circumstances of the act.\n\n== Victims ==\n\n===Women===\nThe majority of cases of sexual violence is against women.<ref name=Heuni/> Some groups within society have a greater possibility of becoming a victim of sexual violence, and sexual violence often has different kinds of impact of the lives of the victims from different backgrounds (age and social status also have an effect).<ref name=Naisten1/> However, according to a cross-cultural\ncomparison between three regions in Finland, Denmark, Russia, Estonia and the US in 1988 \"Scandinavian workers reported fewer women-unfriendly experiences than the women in the other countries did.

This violence is dominantly physical or threats of violence: sexual violence against men is rare.<ref name=Heuni/>\nAlthough the risk of becoming a victim of violence committed by strangers is rather high for men, they are not worried about becoming victims of violence when walking alone in their area after dark: less than five percent of men said they felt unsafe.<ref name=Heuni/>\nA study conducted by Markku Heiskanen and Elina Ruuskanen states that the most common form\nof sexual harassment experienced by men was indecent passes, touching or\nattempts to be kissed against one's will and that 14 percent of the men had such experiences\nafter their 15th birthday, and almost 5 per cent in the last 12 months.<ref name=Heuni/> However, according to Berdahl et al.

Other factors that are likely to effect the probability of getting sexually offended are social status, possible drug usage, belonging to a sexual or gender minority or being disabled as well as if the person is a victim of [[human trafficking]]. The aforementioned characteristics are also likely to decrease the probability of getting and searching for help if a person does become a victim of a crime of sexual offense.<ref name=Naisten1/>\n\nThere has been no sufficient research done on sexual and gender minorities, but a study done in the beginning of 1980 (by Gr\u00f6nfors et al.) about experiences of violence by gay and bisexual persons states that every sixth gay or bisexual male had experienced violence because of their sexual orientation.

Five percent of the victims are immigrants from elsewhere in Europe, while immigrants with African origins form two percent of the offended. With respect to the native Finns, immigrants from Africa have seven times as high risk to be sexually offended and the immigrants with Vietnamese origins have a risk five times as high as that of natives. Some of this difference in the possibility of being sexually offended is explained by the differences in the age structures of the groups.<ref name=maahanmuuttajat>{{cite web|url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/152441/265_Lehti_ym_2014.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|title=Maahanmuuttajat Rikosten Uhreina ja Tekij\u00f6in\u00e4 |publisher=Tammerprint Oy |year=2014|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ulkomaalaiset suomessa.png|thumb|center|700px|Foreigners in Finland 1990-2005.

The first one is to prevent violence by developing ways in which sexual violence could be more easily detected and interfered with and by improving the level on which the authorities are aware of sexual offences. The second principle is to protect the victims and to provide support for them by training authorities to be more sensitive when interacting with a victim of a sexual assault, which would in turn make the process easier on the victim as well as increase the probability that the case will be solved since the victim is more likely to feel like he/she is being taken seriously when his/her case is handled with a symphatetic attitude. The plan also aims to improve the already existing support systems. The last of the main principles is to bring the perpetrators to justice for their acts by improving the process of investigation more effective. This is to be achieved by revising the laws that handle sexual offences.<ref name=Naisten1/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oulu child sexual exploitation scandal]]\n*[[Corrective rape]]\n*[[Estimates of sexual violence]]\n*[[Human Rights]]\n*[[Rape statistics]]\n*[[Sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n*[[Sexual violence in South Africa]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Finnish Law http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001#L20\n*The Criminal Code of Finland http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf\n\n{{Europe topic|Sexual violence in}}\n\n[[Category:Sexual violence by country|Finland]]\n[[Category:Sexual violence in Europe|Finland]]\n[[Category:Sexuality in Finland|Violence]]\n[[Category:Violence in Finland]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing, replaced: an other  \u2192  another,typo(s) fixed: 1990-2005 \u2192 1990\u20132005", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence_in_Finland"}
