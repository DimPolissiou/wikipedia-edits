The population was 1,316 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The village is located within the [[Black Creek (town), Wisconsin|Town of Black Creek]].\nOrigins of the community trace back to 1862 when it was settled by [[American Civil War]] veteran, Thomas J. Burdick and his son, Abraham. Initially, the village had been referred to as Middleburg, due to its geographical proximity to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Shawano, Wisconsin|Shawano]], and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. However, the name was later changed to reflect the dark-colored creek along the outskirts of the community following village [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]] in 1904.<ref name=\"sievert\"/> \nToday, Black Creek hosts a variety of community events including the annual Family Daze celebration.\nThe mayor of Black Creek, Wisconsin is Lance Mursau\n\n==History==\n[[File:MainStreetSouthBlackCreekWI1907.jpg|thumb|right|Main Street looking south c.1907]]\n\nIn the [[Menominee language]], Black Creek is known as ''En\u0101\u0113nohnyah'', \"Little Walks Plainly\", which is a man's name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www4.uwsp.edu/museum/menomineeClans/places/chart.aspx|title=Menominee Place Names in Wisconsin|last=Hoffman|first=Mike|date=|website=The Menominee Clans Story|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref> The territory where Black Creek is today was originally occupied by several different [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] nations.

The community had been known as Middleburg, due to its geographical proximity to the larger communities of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Shawano, Wisconsin|Shawano]], and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. After village [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]] in 1904, the settlement was renamed Black Creek to reflect the dark-colored creek along the northern edge of the community.

The village school serves grades pre-K through 8th.\n\nBlack Creek's original schoolhouse was constructed in 1874 and condemned in 1900. A replacement two-story school, built along present-day State Street ([[WIS 54]]), was used until 1954. Because of lack of space, the school system also rented the former community auditorium, along Maple Street, for various school functions from 1937 to 1957.\n\nToday's village school was constructed in 1954. After a major building expansion in 1957, the one-room schoolhouses in the surrounding vicinity closed, and the students transferred to the grade school, doubling the enrollment. [[Kindergarten]], art, music, and [[physical education]] programs were also added that year. Since then, the school has expanded in 1969, 1987, and 2008.<ref name=\"sievert\"/>\n\n[[Seymour Community High School]] serves as the village and surrounding area high school.\n\nThe Black Creek Village Public Library is a member of the Outagamie Waupaca Library System (OWLS).<ref>\n [http://owlsweb.org/owls/directory/ \"Member Libraries\"].

The village school serves grades pre-K through 8th.\n\nBlack Creek's original schoolhouse was constructed in 1874 and condemned in 1900. A replacement two-story school, built along present-day State Street ([[WIS 54]]), was used until 1954. Because of lack of space, the school system also rented the former community auditorium, along Maple Street, for various school functions from 1937 to 1957.\n\nToday's village school was constructed in 1954. After a major building expansion in 1957, the one-room schoolhouses in the surrounding vicinity closed, and the students transferred to the grade school, doubling the enrollment. [[Kindergarten]], art, music, and [[physical education]] programs were also added that year. Since then, the school has expanded in 1969, 1987, and 2008.<ref name=\"sievert\"/>\n\n[[Seymour Community High School]] serves as the village and surrounding area high school.\n\nThe Black Creek Village Public Library is a member of the Outagamie Waupaca Library System (OWLS).<ref>\n [http://owlsweb.org/owls/directory/ \"Member Libraries\"].

Located on the [[Ohio River]] in [[downtown Cincinnati]], the stadium was best known as the home of \"[[The Big Red Machine]]\", as the Reds were often called in the 1970s.\n\nConstruction began on February 1, 1968, and was completed at a cost of less than $50 million. On June 30, 1970, the Reds hosted the [[Atlanta Braves]] in their grand opening, with [[Hank Aaron]] hitting the first ever home run at Riverfront. Two weeks later on July 14, 1970, Riverfront hosted the [[1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. This game is best remembered for the often-replayed collision at home plate between Reds star [[Pete Rose]] and catcher [[Ray Fosse]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]].\n\nIn September 1996, Riverfront Stadium was renamed \"Cinergy Field\" in a sponsorship deal with [[Greater Cincinnati]] energy company [[Cinergy]]. In [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], to make room for [[Great American Ball Park]], the [[seating capacity]] at Cinergy Field was reduced to 39,000. There was a huge in-play wall in center field visible after the renovations, to serve as the [[batter's eye]]. The stadium was demolished by implosion on December 29, 2002.\n\n==History==\nRiverfront was a multi-purpose, circular [[cookie-cutter stadium|\"cookie-cutter\" stadium]], one of many built in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s as communities sought to save money by having their [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]] teams share the same facility. Riverfront, [[Veterans Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Shea Stadium]] in New York and [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] in Washington, D.C. all opened within a few years of each other and were largely indistinguishable from one another; in particular, it was often confused with fellow [[Ohio River]] cookie-cutter Three Rivers Stadium by sportscasters because of the two stadium's similar names and similar designs.\n\nOne feature of Riverfront that distinguished it from other cookie-cutters was that the lower level  seats for baseball, from home plate to the left field foul line, were wheeled for conversion to a football seating configuration.<ref>http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/past/RiverfrontStadium.htm</ref>  The astroturf panels covering the tracks could be seen in left field during Reds games.  (Shea Stadium in New York had featured a similar movable field-level seats design from its debut in 1964 until the Jets moved to [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey in 1984, after which the Mets retrofitted Shea for exclusive baseball use.<ref>http://mlb.mlb.com/nym/ballpark/history.jsp</ref>  A variation of this design was also used at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in Pittsburgh.)<ref>http://www.steelersfever.com/three_rivers_stadium.html</ref>\n\nThe site Riverfront Stadium sat on originally included the 2nd Street [[tenement]], birthplace and boyhood home of [[cowboy]] singer and actor [[Roy Rogers]], who joked that he was born \"somewhere between second base and center field.\"\n\nRiverfront Stadium's scoreboard was designed by [[American Sign and Indicator]], but in its last years was maintained by [[Trans-Lux]].  That scoreboard would be upgraded in the 1980s with the addition of an adjacent Sony [[JumboTron]].\n\n===Big Red Machine===\n\nThe Reds moved to Riverfront Stadium midway through the 1970 season, after spending over 86 years at the intersection of Findlay Street and Western Avenue \u2013 the last 57\u00bd of those years at [[Crosley Field]].  Riverfront quickly earned a place in Cincinnati's century-long baseball tradition as the home of one of the best teams in baseball history.  The Reds had only won three pennants in their final 39 years at Crosley Field (1939, 1940, 1961) but made the [[World Series]] in Riverfront's first year (1970) and a total of four times in the stadium's first seven years, with the Reds winning back-to-back championships in [[1975 World Series|1975]] and [[1976 World Series|1976]]. The World Series would return in [[1990 World Series|1990]], with Cincinnati winning the first two of a four-game sweep of the [[Oakland Athletics]] at Riverfront.\n\n[[File:RedsOpeningDay1995.jpg|thumb|right|325px|The turf infield and dirt \"slide pits\" can be seen in this April 1995 photograph.]]Baseball purists disliked Riverfront's [[artificial turf]], but Reds' Manager [[Sparky Anderson]] and General Manager [[Bob Howsam]] took advantage of it by encouraging speed and line drive hitting that could produce doubles, triples and high-bouncing infield hits. Players who combined power and speed like [[Joe Morgan]], [[Pete Rose]] and [[Ken Griffey, Sr.]] thrived there. On defense, the fast surface and virtually dirtless infield (see photo) rewarded range and quickness by both outfielders and infielders, like shortstop [[Dave Concepci\u00f3n]] who used the turf to bounce many of his long throws to first. [[Catcher]] [[Johnny Bench]] and [[first baseman]] [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] played here. The artificial turf covered not only the normal grass area of the ballpark but also most of the normally dirt-covered portion of the infield. Only the pitcher's mound, the home plate area (in two circled areas), and cutouts around first, second and third bases had dirt surfaces (which were covered in five-sided diamond shaped areas). This was the first stadium in the majors with this \"sliding pit\" configuration. The new stadiums that would follow ([[Veterans Stadium]], [[Royals Stadium]], [[Louisiana Superdome]], [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)]], [[Exhibition Stadium]], [[Kingdome]], [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], [[B.C. Place]], [[SkyDome]]) installed sliding pits as the original layout, and the existing artificial turf fields in [[Candlestick Park|San Francisco]], [[Astrodome|Houston]], [[Three Rivers Stadium|Pittsburgh]], and [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]] would change to the cut-out configuration within the next few years.\n\nRiverfront hosted the MLB All-Star Game twice: first on July 14, 1970 with President [[Richard Nixon]] in attendance (51,838 total attendance), and again on July 12, 1988 (55,837 attendance).\n\n===Professional football===\nDespite Cincinnati's love of baseball, it was the prospect of a professional football team that finally moved the city to end 20 years of discussion and build a new stadium on the downtown riverfront. After playing for two seasons at [[Nippert Stadium]] on the [[University of Cincinnati]]  campus, the Bengals built on the Reds' success in the stadium's first year when they recorded their first winning season and playoff appearance in 1970, just their third year of existence.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable football game at Riverfront was the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]] on January 10, 1982. The game became known as the ''[[Freezer Bowl]]'' and was won by the Bengals over the [[San Diego Chargers]], 27\u20137. The air temperature during the game was {{convert|-9|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and the [[wind chill]] was {{convert|-37|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, the coldest in NFL history. The win earned the Bengals their first of two trips to the [[Super Bowl]] ([[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]]) while playing at Riverfront.\n\nRiverfront Stadium hosted the 1988 AFC Championship, as the Bengals beat the [[Buffalo Bills]] 21&ndash;10 to advance to [[Super Bowl XXIII|their second Super Bowl appearance]].\n\nDuring the Bengals' tenure, they defeated every visiting franchise at least once, enjoying perfect records against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] (4-0), [[New York Giants]] (4-0), and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] (3-0). They posted a 5\u20131 record in playoff games played in Riverfront Stadium, with victories over the [[Buffalo Bills]] (twice), [[San Diego Chargers]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Houston Oilers]]. Their only home playoff loss came to the [[New York Jets]].\n\nFor most of the Bengals' tenure at the stadium, the field contained only the basic markings required for play. Until the late 1990s, there wasn't a logo at midfield or any writing in the end zone, which had long become standard in NFL stadiums.\n\nDuring the 1988 season as the Bengals were making another [[Super Bowl XXIII|Super Bowl]] run, Riverfront Stadium was nicknamed the Jungle as the Bengals went a perfect 10-0 at home during the regular season and in the playoffs.  With the new stadium nickname, the fans and team adopted the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\" as the unofficial theme song for the Bengals.  When [[Paul Brown Stadium]] opened in 2000, the Jungle theme was incorporated into the stadium design.\n\n===College football===\nBetween 1970 and 1990 Riverfront Stadium hosted 25 [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|University of Cincinnati football]] games to accommodate higher-caliber visiting teams and local rivals which would overwhelm demand in their usual home, [[Nippert Stadium]] (which then could only hold 28,000). Among the Bearcats' opponents were the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]], [[Maryland Terrapins football|University of Maryland]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|University of Kentucky]], [[Louisville Cardinals football|University of Louisville]], [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]], [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University]], [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State University]], whose [[1985 NCAA Division I-A football season|1985]] game took place with the Nittany Lions number one in the coaches' poll, and the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] three times, twice while the Hurricanes were the defending national champions. It would be a temporary full-time home for the Bearcats during the 1990 season, when Nippert Stadium was undergoing renovations.\n\nThe Bearcats finished with a 12\u201313 all-time record at Riverfront.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Cincinnati Bearcats|Date|Home Team|Opponent|Score|Attendance}}\n|-\n| September 19, 1970\n| '''[[1970 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1970|team=Dayton Flyers|title=Dayton}}\n| 13\u20137\n| \n|-\n| November 8, 1975\n| [[1975 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 16 [[1975 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]]'''\n| 19\u201321\n| 16,478\n|-\n| September 11, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]\n| 38\u201316\n|\n|-\n| October 9, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Long Beach State 49ers football team|Long Beach State]]\n| 34\u201314\n|\n|-\n| November 13, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1982|team=Morgan State Bears|title=Morgan State}}\n| 52\u20130\n|\n|-\n| November 18, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]\n| 20\u201310\n|\n|-\n| October 1, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Cornell Big Red|title=Cornell}}\n| 48\u201320\n|\n|-\n| October 8, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Temple Owls|title=Temple}}\n| 31\u201316\n|\n|-\n| October 22, 1983\n| [[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 8 [[1983 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 7\u201317\n|\n|-\n| November 5, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1983 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team|Rutgers]]\n| 18\u20137\n|\n|-\n| November 12, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Memphis Tigers|title=Memphis State}}\n| 43\u201310\n|\n|-\n| October 13, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 10 [[1984 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 25\u201349\n|\n|-\n| October 27, 1984\n| '''[[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1984 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]\n| 40\u201321\n|\n|-\n| November 17, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1984 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]'''\n| 7\u201329\n|\n|-\n| November 22, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1984 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]'''\n| 26\u201331\n|\n|-\n| October 5, 1985\n| [[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''{{cfb link|year=1985|team=Temple Owls|title=Temple}}'''\n| 16\u201328\n|\n|-\n| October 26, 1985\n| '''[[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1985 Boston College Eagles football team|Boston College]]\n| 24\u201317\n|\n|-\n| November 9, 1985\n| [[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 2 [[1985 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]]'''\n| 10\u201331\n|\n|-\n| September 13, 1986\n| '''[[1986 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1986 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]\n| 45\u201338\n|\n|-\n| September 27, 1986\n| [[1986 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1986 Kentucky Wildcats football team|Kentucky]]'''\n| 20\u201337\n|\n|-\n| October 24, 1987\n| [[1987 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1987 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 10\u201348\n|\n|-\n| November 5, 1988\n| [[1988 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1988 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia]]'''\n| 13\u201351\n|\n|-\n| September 2, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1990 Bowling Green Falcons football team|Bowling Green]]'''\n| 20\u201334\n|\n|-\n| September 22, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1990 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]'''\n| 12\u201316\n|\n|-\n| November 3, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 25 [[1990 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]'''\n| 16\u201341\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite web |title=2009 University of Cincinnati Football Media Guide |url=https://gobearcats.com/documents/2015/4/30/09fbguide_151-198.pdf |publisher=gobearcats.com |accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Final years as a baseball-only stadium===\n\n[[File:Cinergy Field 3.jpg|thumb|left|Cinergy Field after the left and center field stands were removed.]]\nWhen the Bengals moved to [[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[2000 NFL season|2000]], the Reds were left as Cinergy Field's only tenant. Prior to the [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]] baseball season, the stadium was remodeled into a baseball-only configuration, and the artificial surface was replaced with grass.\n\n[[File:Cinergy Field 1.jpg|thumb|right|Cinergy Field during a Cincinnati Reds game vs. the St. Louis Cardinals on August 23, 2001. Construction of Great American Ballpark is visible in the background.]]\nTo allow room for the construction of [[Great American Ball Park]] (which was being built largely over the grounds the stadium already sat on), a large section of the left and center field stands were removed and the distance to the fences was shortened by {{convert|5|ft}}. A {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} wall was built in deep center field to prevent easy home runs. The new Great American Ball Park and old Riverfront Stadium were 26&nbsp;inches apart at its closest point during this time. In the Reds' final two seasons in the stadium, ongoing construction on Great American was plainly visible just beyond the outfield walls while the team played their games.\n\n[[File:Cinergy Field Implosion.JPG|thumb|left|December 29, 2002 implosion.]]\n[[File:Cinergylot.png|thumb|right|The Riverfront Stadium site in June 2006.

Today, part of the site is now occupied by Great American Ball Park and the [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]], along with several [[mixed-use development]]s and parking facilities.  A small portion of the Riverfront Stadium site is now occupied by the [[Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum|Reds' Hall of Fame and Museum]] and Main Street, which was extended when the new park was built and when the old park was demolished.\n\n==Seating capacity==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Baseball\n|-\n!

Located on the [[Ohio River]] in [[downtown Cincinnati]], the stadium was best known as the home of \"[[The Big Red Machine]]\", as the Reds were often called in the 1970s.\n\nConstruction began on February 1, 1968, and was completed at a cost of less than $50 million. On June 30, 1970, the Reds hosted the [[Atlanta Braves]] in their grand opening, with [[Hank Aaron]] hitting the first ever home run at Riverfront. Two weeks later on July 14, 1970, Riverfront hosted the [[1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. This game is best remembered for the often-replayed collision at home plate between Reds star [[Pete Rose]] and catcher [[Ray Fosse]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]].\n\nIn September 1996, Riverfront Stadium was renamed \"Cinergy Field\" in a sponsorship deal with [[Greater Cincinnati]] energy company [[Cinergy]]. In [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]], to make room for [[Great American Ball Park]], the [[seating capacity]] at Cinergy Field was reduced to 39,000. There was a huge in-play wall in center field visible after the renovations, to serve as the [[batter's eye]]. The stadium was demolished by implosion on December 29, 2002.\n\n==History==\nRiverfront was a multi-purpose, circular [[cookie-cutter stadium|\"cookie-cutter\" stadium]], one of many built in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s as communities sought to save money by having their [[American football|football]] and [[baseball]] teams share the same facility. Riverfront, [[Veterans Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Shea Stadium]] in New York and [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] in Washington, D.C. all opened within a few years of each other and were largely indistinguishable from one another; in particular, it was often confused with fellow [[Ohio River]] cookie-cutter Three Rivers Stadium by sportscasters because of the two stadium's similar names and similar designs.\n\nOne feature of Riverfront that distinguished it from other cookie-cutters was that the lower level  seats for baseball, from home plate to the left field foul line, were wheeled for conversion to a football seating configuration.<ref>http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/past/RiverfrontStadium.htm</ref>  The astroturf panels covering the tracks could be seen in left field during Reds games.  (Shea Stadium in New York had featured a similar movable field-level seats design from its debut in 1964 until the Jets moved to [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey in 1984, after which the Mets retrofitted Shea for exclusive baseball use.<ref>http://mlb.mlb.com/nym/ballpark/history.jsp</ref>  A variation of this design was also used at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in Pittsburgh.)<ref>http://www.steelersfever.com/three_rivers_stadium.html</ref>\n\nThe site Riverfront Stadium sat on originally included the 2nd Street [[tenement]], birthplace and boyhood home of [[cowboy]] singer and actor [[Roy Rogers]], who joked that he was born \"somewhere between second base and center field.\"\n\nRiverfront Stadium's scoreboard was designed by [[American Sign and Indicator]], but in its last years was maintained by [[Trans-Lux]].  That scoreboard would be upgraded in the 1980s with the addition of an adjacent Sony [[JumboTron]].\n\n===Big Red Machine===\n\nThe Reds moved to Riverfront Stadium midway through the 1970 season, after spending over 86 years at the intersection of Findlay Street and Western Avenue \u2013 the last 57\u00bd of those years at [[Crosley Field]].  Riverfront quickly earned a place in Cincinnati's century-long baseball tradition as the home of one of the best teams in baseball history.  The Reds had only won three pennants in their final 39 years at Crosley Field (1939, 1940, 1961) but made the [[World Series]] in Riverfront's first year (1970) and a total of four times in the stadium's first seven years, with the Reds winning back-to-back championships in [[1975 World Series|1975]] and [[1976 World Series|1976]]. The World Series would return in [[1990 World Series|1990]], with Cincinnati winning the first two of a four-game sweep of the [[Oakland Athletics]] at Riverfront.\n\n[[File:RedsOpeningDay1995.jpg|thumb|right|325px|The turf infield and dirt \"slide pits\" can be seen in this April 1995 photograph.]]Baseball purists disliked Riverfront's [[artificial turf]], but Reds' Manager [[Sparky Anderson]] and General Manager [[Bob Howsam]] took advantage of it by encouraging speed and line drive hitting that could produce doubles, triples and high-bouncing infield hits. Players who combined power and speed like [[Joe Morgan]], [[Pete Rose]] and [[Ken Griffey, Sr.]] thrived there. On defense, the fast surface and virtually dirtless infield (see photo) rewarded range and quickness by both outfielders and infielders, like shortstop [[Dave Concepci\u00f3n]] who used the turf to bounce many of his long throws to first. [[Catcher]] [[Johnny Bench]] and [[first baseman]] [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] played here. The artificial turf covered not only the normal grass area of the ballpark but also most of the normally dirt-covered portion of the infield. Only the pitcher's mound, the home plate area (in two circled areas), and cutouts around first, second and third bases had dirt surfaces (which were covered in five-sided diamond shaped areas). This was the first stadium in the majors with this \"sliding pit\" configuration. The new stadiums that would follow ([[Veterans Stadium]], [[Royals Stadium]], [[Louisiana Superdome]], [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)]], [[Exhibition Stadium]], [[Kingdome]], [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], [[B.C. Place]], [[SkyDome]]) installed sliding pits as the original layout, and the existing artificial turf fields in [[Candlestick Park|San Francisco]], [[Astrodome|Houston]], [[Three Rivers Stadium|Pittsburgh]], and [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]] would change to the cut-out configuration within the next few years.\n\nRiverfront hosted the MLB All-Star Game twice: first on July 14, 1970 with President [[Richard Nixon]] in attendance (51,838 total attendance), and again on July 12, 1988 (55,837 attendance).\n\n===Professional football===\nDespite Cincinnati's love of baseball, it was the prospect of a professional football team that finally moved the city to end 20 years of discussion and build a new stadium on the downtown riverfront. After playing for two seasons at [[Nippert Stadium]] on the [[University of Cincinnati]]  campus, the Bengals built on the Reds' success in the stadium's first year when they recorded their first winning season and playoff appearance in 1970, just their third year of existence.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable football game at Riverfront was the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]] on January 10, 1982. The game became known as the ''[[Freezer Bowl]]'' and was won by the Bengals over the [[San Diego Chargers]], 27\u20137. The air temperature during the game was {{convert|-9|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and the [[wind chill]] was {{convert|-37|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, the coldest in NFL history. The win earned the Bengals their first of two trips to the [[Super Bowl]] ([[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]]) while playing at Riverfront.\n\nRiverfront Stadium hosted the 1988 AFC Championship, as the Bengals beat the [[Buffalo Bills]] 21&ndash;10 to advance to [[Super Bowl XXIII|their second Super Bowl appearance]].\n\nDuring the Bengals' tenure, they defeated every visiting franchise at least once, enjoying perfect records against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] (4-0), [[New York Giants]] (4-0), and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] (3-0). They posted a 5\u20131 record in playoff games played in Riverfront Stadium, with victories over the [[Buffalo Bills]] (twice), [[San Diego Chargers]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Houston Oilers]]. Their only home playoff loss came to the [[New York Jets]].\n\nFor most of the Bengals' tenure at the stadium, the field contained only the basic markings required for play. Until the late 1990s, there wasn't a logo at midfield or any writing in the end zone, which had long become standard in NFL stadiums.\n\nDuring the 1988 season as the Bengals were making another [[Super Bowl XXIII|Super Bowl]] run, Riverfront Stadium was nicknamed the Jungle as the Bengals went a perfect 10-0 at home during the regular season and in the playoffs.  With the new stadium nickname, the fans and team adopted the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\" as the unofficial theme song for the Bengals.  When [[Paul Brown Stadium]] opened in 2000, the Jungle theme was incorporated into the stadium design.\n\n===College football===\nBetween 1970 and 1990 Riverfront Stadium hosted 25 [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|University of Cincinnati football]] games to accommodate higher-caliber visiting teams and local rivals which would overwhelm demand in their usual home, [[Nippert Stadium]] (which then could only hold 28,000). Among the Bearcats' opponents were the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]], [[Maryland Terrapins football|University of Maryland]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|University of Kentucky]], [[Louisville Cardinals football|University of Louisville]], [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]], [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University]], [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State University]], whose [[1985 NCAA Division I-A football season|1985]] game took place with the Nittany Lions number one in the coaches' poll, and the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] three times, twice while the Hurricanes were the defending national champions. It would be a temporary full-time home for the Bearcats during the 1990 season, when Nippert Stadium was undergoing renovations.\n\nThe Bearcats finished with a 12\u201313 all-time record at Riverfront.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Cincinnati Bearcats|Date|Home Team|Opponent|Score|Attendance}}\n|-\n| September 19, 1970\n| '''[[1970 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1970|team=Dayton Flyers|title=Dayton}}\n| 13\u20137\n| \n|-\n| November 8, 1975\n| [[1975 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 16 [[1975 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]]'''\n| 19\u201321\n| 16,478\n|-\n| September 11, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]\n| 38\u201316\n|\n|-\n| October 9, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Long Beach State 49ers football team|Long Beach State]]\n| 34\u201314\n|\n|-\n| November 13, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1982|team=Morgan State Bears|title=Morgan State}}\n| 52\u20130\n|\n|-\n| November 18, 1982\n| '''[[1982 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1982 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]\n| 20\u201310\n|\n|-\n| October 1, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Cornell Big Red|title=Cornell}}\n| 48\u201320\n|\n|-\n| October 8, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Temple Owls|title=Temple}}\n| 31\u201316\n|\n|-\n| October 22, 1983\n| [[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 8 [[1983 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 7\u201317\n|\n|-\n| November 5, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1983 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team|Rutgers]]\n| 18\u20137\n|\n|-\n| November 12, 1983\n| '''[[1983 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| {{cfb link|year=1983|team=Memphis Tigers|title=Memphis State}}\n| 43\u201310\n|\n|-\n| October 13, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1984 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 25\u201349\n|\n|-\n| October 27, 1984\n| '''[[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1984 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]\n| 40\u201321\n|\n|-\n| November 17, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1984 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]'''\n| 7\u201329\n|\n|-\n| November 22, 1984\n| [[1984 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1984 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]'''\n| 26\u201331\n|\n|-\n| October 5, 1985\n| [[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''{{cfb link|year=1985|team=Temple Owls|title=Temple}}'''\n| 16\u201328\n|\n|-\n| October 26, 1985\n| '''[[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1985 Boston College Eagles football team|Boston College]]\n| 24\u201317\n|\n|-\n| November 9, 1985\n| [[1985 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 2 [[1985 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]]'''\n| 10\u201331\n|\n|-\n| September 13, 1986\n| '''[[1986 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]'''\n| [[1986 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]\n| 45\u201338\n|\n|-\n| September 27, 1986\n| [[1986 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1986 Kentucky Wildcats football team|Kentucky]]'''\n| 20\u201337\n|\n|-\n| October 24, 1987\n| [[1987 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1987 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]]'''\n| 10\u201348\n|\n|-\n| November 5, 1988\n| [[1988 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1988 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia]]'''\n| 13\u201351\n|\n|-\n| September 2, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1990 Bowling Green Falcons football team|Bowling Green]]'''\n| 20\u201334\n|\n|-\n| September 22, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''[[1990 Miami Redskins football team|Miami (OH)]]'''\n| 12\u201316\n|\n|-\n| November 3, 1990\n| [[1990 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]]\n| '''No. 25 [[1990 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]'''\n| 16\u201341\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite web |title=2009 University of Cincinnati Football Media Guide |url=https://gobearcats.com/documents/2015/4/30/09fbguide_151-198.pdf |publisher=gobearcats.com |accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Final years as a baseball-only stadium===\n\n[[File:Cinergy Field 3.jpg|thumb|left|Cinergy Field after the left and center field stands were removed.]]\nWhen the Bengals moved to [[Paul Brown Stadium]] in [[2000 NFL season|2000]], the Reds were left as Cinergy Field's only tenant.

Construction of Great American Ballpark is visible in the background.]]\nTo allow room for the construction of [[Great American Ball Park]] (which was being built largely over the grounds the stadium already sat on), a large section of the left and center field stands were removed and the distance to the fences was shortened by {{convert|5|ft}}. A {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} wall was built in deep center field to prevent easy home runs. The new Great American Ball Park and old Riverfront Stadium were 26&nbsp;inches apart at its closest point during this time. In the Reds' final two seasons in the stadium, ongoing construction on Great American was plainly visible just beyond the outfield walls while the team played their games.\n\n[[File:Cinergy Field Implosion.JPG|thumb|left|December 29, 2002 implosion.]]\n[[File:Cinergylot.png|thumb|right|The Riverfront Stadium site in June 2006.

The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] level (formerly Division I-A) and represents the university as a member of [[Conference USA]] in the Eastern division. The program has 1 national championship ([[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]/I-AA), 13 conference championships (1 [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], 9 [[Ohio Valley Conference|OVC]], 1 [[Gateway Football Conference|Gateway]], 2 [[Conference USA]]) and 3 FBS-level Bowl wins. The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012. That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history. Despite the surprising 7\u20135 record in 2011, a season in which the Hilltoppers went 7\u20131 in their final eight games, they were not invited to a bowl game. It wasn't until the following year, 2012, that the Hilltoppers were invited to their first FBS-level bowl game, the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesar's Bowl]].\n\nOn December 7, 2012, prior to their December 26th bowl game, Taggart left WKU to accept the head football coach position at [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&ATCLID=205822229|title=Welcome Home Willie Taggart|work=GoUSFBulls.com}}</ref> [[Lance Guidry]], WKU's defensive coordinator was named interim head coach and led the Hilltoppers to their first bowl appearance as an FBS member.

The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] level (formerly Division I-A) and represents the university as a member of [[Conference USA]] in the Eastern division. The program has 1 national championship ([[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]/I-AA), 13 conference championships (1 [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], 9 [[Ohio Valley Conference|OVC]], 1 [[Gateway Football Conference|Gateway]], 2 [[Conference USA]]) and 3 FBS-level Bowl wins. The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012. That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history. Despite the surprising 7\u20135 record in 2011, a season in which the Hilltoppers went 7\u20131 in their final eight games, they were not invited to a bowl game. It wasn't until the following year, 2012, that the Hilltoppers were invited to their first FBS-level bowl game, the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesar's Bowl]].\n\nOn December 7, 2012, prior to their December 26th bowl game, Taggart left WKU to accept the head football coach position at [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&ATCLID=205822229|title=Welcome Home Willie Taggart|work=GoUSFBulls.com}}</ref> [[Lance Guidry]], WKU's defensive coordinator was named interim head coach and led the Hilltoppers to their first bowl appearance as an FBS member.

The idea for a newspaper as an advocate for the rights of German soldiers originated in a [[prisoner of war camp]] in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] and came from Nazi ''[[Kreisleiter]]'' [[Helmut Damerau]] and the [[Wehrmacht]] Colonel [[Heinrich Detloff von Kalben]]. It was supported by [[Waffen-SS]] General [[Felix Steiner]] and financed by [[Leo Giess]], a carpenter, as well as [[German Americans]].<ref name=\"Spiegel\" /><ref name=\"Zeit\" >{{cite news |first=Dietrich |last=Strothmann |date=8 September 1967|title=Angeklagt: die National-Zeitung|trans-title=Charged: The National Zeitung|url=https://www.zeit.de/1967/36/angeklagt-die-national-zeitung/komplettansicht|language=German |work=[[Die Zeit]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung'' was an advocate of [[Wiederbewaffnung|German rearmament]] but found itself in financial trouble by 1953, when financial support from the US dried up. Damerau approached the West German government for financial support and the newspaper received a monthly subsidy of DM 11,000 from 1953 onward.<ref name=\"Spiegel\" /> This however was not received well by the paper's readership, and the circulation of the ''Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung'' dropped from 30,000 to 12,000. In 1954 the German government pushed for the sale of the paper, which Damerau refused and, consequently, the government dropped its financial support. The paper was subsequently only published fortnightly and, for a time in 1955, only monthly and shifted further to the right of the political spectrum.<ref name=\"Spiegel\" />\n\nThe fifth anniversary of the first publication of the paper saw it print well-wishes from a number of high ranking former Wehrmacht Generals, among them the former ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]s'' [[Erich von Manstein]], [[Wilhelm List]] and [[Albert Kesselring]].<ref name=\"Spiegel\" />\n\nIt called for and organised protests, like when German [[handball]] club [[THW Kiel]] hosted a team from [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland, because, in the paper's opinion Wroc\u0142aw should be referred to by its former German name, Breslau. It protested against any form of recognition of the post-war Polish-German border, the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] and attacked prominent German scientists like [[Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]] for publishing the [[Memorandum of T\u00fcbingen]] (German:''T\u00fcbinger Memorandum'') in support of the border. The newspaper also supported the [[Ilse Hess|wife]] of [[Rudolf Hess]] in her attempts to free her husband.<ref name=\"Spiegel\" />\n\nThe newspaper advocated a return to German military traditions after the formation of the [[Bundeswehr]] and attempted to influence officers who had previously served in the Wehrmacht. It was critical of [[Wolf Graf von Baudissin]]'s concept of citizens in uniform, and the West German government became, in turn, critical of the newspaper. [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|German defence minister]] [[Franz Josef Strauss|Franz-Josef Strauss]] made unsuccessful attempts to purchase the newspaper, offering Damerau DM 150,000 for the financially troubled paper.

The idea for a newspaper as an advocate for the rights of German soldiers originated in a [[prisoner of war camp]] in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] and came from Nazi ''[[Kreisleiter]]'' [[Helmut Damerau]] and the [[Wehrmacht]] Colonel [[Heinrich Detloff von Kalben]]. It was supported by [[Waffen-SS]] General [[Felix Steiner]] and financed by [[Leo Giess]], a carpenter, as well as [[German Americans]].<ref name=\"Spiegel\" /><ref name=\"Zeit\" >{{cite news |first=Dietrich |last=Strothmann |date=8 September 1967|title=Angeklagt: die National-Zeitung|trans-title=Charged: The National Zeitung|url=https://www.zeit.de/1967/36/angeklagt-die-national-zeitung/komplettansicht|language=German |work=[[Die Zeit]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung'' was an advocate of [[Wiederbewaffnung|German rearmament]] but found itself in financial trouble by 1953, when financial support from the US dried up. Damerau approached the West German government for financial support and the newspaper received a monthly subsidy of DM 11,000 from 1953 onward.<ref name=\"Spiegel\" /> This however was not received well by the paper's readership, and the circulation of the ''Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung'' dropped from 30,000 to 12,000. In 1954 the German government pushed for the sale of the paper, which Damerau refused and, consequently, the government dropped its financial support. The paper was subsequently only published fortnightly and, for a time in 1955, only monthly and shifted further to the right of the political spectrum.<ref name=\"Spiegel\" />\n\nThe fifth anniversary of the first publication of the paper saw it print well-wishes from a number of high ranking former Wehrmacht Generals, among them the former ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]s'' [[Erich von Manstein]], [[Wilhelm List]] and [[Albert Kesselring]].<ref name=\"Spiegel\" />\n\nIt called for and organised protests, like when German [[handball]] club [[THW Kiel]] hosted a team from [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland, because, in the paper's opinion Wroc\u0142aw should be referred to by its former German name, Breslau. It protested against any form of recognition of the post-war Polish-German border, the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] and attacked prominent German scientists like [[Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]] for publishing the [[Memorandum of T\u00fcbingen]] (German:''T\u00fcbinger Memorandum'') in support of the border. The newspaper also supported the [[Ilse Hess|wife]] of [[Rudolf Hess]] in her attempts to free her husband.<ref name=\"Spiegel\" />\n\nThe newspaper advocated a return to German military traditions after the formation of the [[Bundeswehr]] and attempted to influence officers who had previously served in the Wehrmacht. It was critical of [[Wolf Graf von Baudissin]]'s concept of citizens in uniform, and the West German government became, in turn, critical of the newspaper. [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|German defence minister]] [[Franz Josef Strauss|Franz-Josef Strauss]] made unsuccessful attempts to purchase the newspaper, offering Damerau DM 150,000 for the financially troubled paper.
